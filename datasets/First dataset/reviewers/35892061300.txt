15144341300	Glycated haemoglobin and cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese subjects with normal glucose tolerance	Increased plasma glucose concentration is a predictive factor for mortality in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Although glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) is a useful index of mean blood glucose concentrations over the preceding 1 to 3 months, there are few data regarding its relationship to cardiovascular risk. We have examined the relationship between HbA(1c) and cardiovascular risk factors in 1280 subjects with normal glucose tolerance. Based on HbA(1c) tertiles (tertile 1: n = 427, 262 men and 165 women, HbA(1c) level: 2.9-4.7% in men and 3.2-4.2% in women; tertile 2: n = 426, 261 men and 165 women, HbA(1c) level: 4.7-5.1% in men and 4.2-4.6% in women; tertile 3: n = 427, 262 men and 165 women, HbA(1c) level: 5.1-6.7% in men and 4.6-6.9% in women), increasing HbA(1c) was associated with increasing age, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio, fasting and 2-h plasma glucose, 2-h insulin, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and urate concentrations. When age and sex were included as covariates, increasing HbA(1c) remained associated with increasing fasting and 2-h plasma glucose, 2-h insulin, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. These findings emphasize the importance of hyperglycaemia, as reflected by HbA(1c), as a continuum in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, these findings support the hypothesis that cardiovascular disease risk commences with rising glucose concentrations before 'conventionally-defined' glucose intolerance occurs.

21744456718	High prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Hong Kong Chinese - Comparison of three diagnostic criteria	The World Health Organisation (WHO), European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR) and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panels had introduced definitions for the metabolic syndrome (MES). We aimed to estimate the prevalence of MES in a working population in Hong Kong using the three definitions for MES and compare their relative significance. The data are obtained from a prevalence survey for glucose intolerance and lipid abnormality in a Hong Kong Chinese working population. The distribution of occupational groups in these subjects was similar to that recorded in the Hong Kong Census (1991) and representative of the Hong Kong working population. Definition of obesity was modified using the Asian criterion of body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m

0029874304	Thyrotoxicosis and renal tubular acidosis presenting as hypokalaemic paralysis	A 34-yr-old Chinese woman presented with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. She had a goitre and was biochemically thyrotoxic. However, she also had urinary potassium loss with a metabolic acidosis and reduced ability to acidify her urine. The co-existence of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) was confirmed. There was no evidence of xerostomia or xerophthalmia, although anti-Ro antibody and rheumatoid factor were positive. Paralytic attacks did not recur after the thyrotoxicosis was controlled with radioactive iodine. Possible pathogenic mechanisms for the association of these disorders are discussed. Female patients presenting with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) should be thoroughly investigated for possible additional precipitating factors in view of the strong male predominance of TPP, particularly when there are atypical metabolic features.

0029912806	Identification of C-type natriuretic peptide gene transcripts in glial cells	C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a third member of the natriuretic peptide family, is found throughout the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in those regions involved in neuroendocrine regulation. Astrocytes, which have important physiological roles in normal neuronal functioning, express receptors of CNP. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by hybridization with a digoxigenin-labelled cDNA probe, we have demonstrated the expression of CNP gene transcripts in both cultured mouse astrocytes and rat C6 glioma cells, with the former expressing the gene at a considerably higher level than the latter. Our data raise the possibility that CNP may act in autocrine and/or paracrine fashion in glial cell physiology and neuromodulate communication between glial cells and neurones.

0029989010	Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in a Chinese population	We retrospectively evaluated the characteristics of adult patients admitted with thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis in Hong Kong. From 1984 to 1993, 45 Chinese adult patients were admitted with acute limb weakness, plasma potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/l and thyrotoxicosis confirmed by laboratory investigations. All but one were male. Seventy-five percent of attacks occurred between 9 pm and 9 am. Half of the attacks occurred between July and October (49.1%), most commonly in August (20%). Mean (± SEM) plasma potassium on admission was 2.17 ± 0.08 mmol/l (range 1.1-3.5). In 15 episodes (27.3%), plasma potassium on recovery exceeded 5.0 mmol/l, while in three episodes (5.5%), potassium exceeded 6.0 mmol/l. No patient had a positive family history of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Only 28.9% had a known history of thyrotoxicosis before their first presentation with periodic paralysis. Twenty-seven (60%) had clinical evidence of thyrotoxicosis. Although all were biochemically thyrotoxic, 11.4% had only a mild degree of thyrotoxicosis (suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, high free thyroxine, but normal free triiodothyronine). One quarter of the patients had a normal erythrocyte zinc concentration, indicating either a short history of thyrotoxicosis or transient thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis of thyrotoxic hypokalaemic paralysis should always be considered in Chinese patients with acute muscle weakness, especially in young males. Absence of clinical thyrotoxicosis does not exclude the diagnosis. Plasma potassium should be monitored carefully during treatment to prevent rebound hyperkalaemia.

0008905145	Simple anthropometric indexes and cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese	OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a major public health problem due to its associations with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Although there are sophisticated methods, such as imaging, to document total body fat and its distributions, anthropometric measurements remain important in clinical practice. We examined the relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and the three commonest anthropometric measurements for obesity, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and waist circumference (WC), in Hong Kong Chinese subjects. DESIGN AND SETTING: The data are obtained from a prevalence survey for glucose intolerance and lipid abnormality in a representative Hong Kong Chinese working population. All employees from a public utility company and a regional hospital were invited to participate. SUBJECTS: There were 1513 subjects (910 men and 603 women, mean age ± s.e.m.: 37.5 ± 0.2 y). All of them had no significant past medical history. MEASUREMENTS: BMI, WHR and WC of the 1513 subjects were assessed for their relationships with various cardiovascular risk factors. These include blood pressure, fasting and 2 h plasma glucose and insulin, glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and urine albumin concentration. RESULTS: After age adjustment, all three anthropometric indexes were significantly correlated with the major cardiovascular risk factors in both men and women. When BMI, WHR and WC were analysed according to quartiles, there was a significant trend for blood pressure, plasma triglyceride, fasting and 2 h plasma glucose and insulin to increase, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol to decrease, with increasing obesity after adjustment for age and smoking. Using stepwise regression analysis with the three indexes as independent variables, most of the variance in blood pressure, plasma lipid, insulin, glucose and urinary albumin concentration were explained either by WC or WHR. In women, BMI was the main explanatory variable for reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: In Hong Kong Chinese, BMI, WHR and WC provide important information in assessing cardiovascular risks. In men, central adiposity as reflected by WC and to some extent, WHR, explained most of the variance in blood pressure, plasma glucose, lipid, insulin and albuminuria. In women, all three indexes reflecting general and central obesity contribute to the variance in these risk factors.

0030187687	Secular changes in standing height, sitting height and sexual maturation of Chinese - The Hong Kong growth study, 1993	In 1993 a territory-wide cross-sectional growth survey on 25,000 Chinese children from birth to 18 years was performed in Hong Kong. Compared to the last growth survey in 1963, definite secular changes were observed. There was an increase of final adult standing height of 3-6 cm in boys and 2-7 cm in girls, in which 1-8 cm and 0-5 cm respectively for boys and girls was accounted for by the sitting height. Thus most of the height increase had occurred in the leg length in girls, but in boys only half of it. The height difference was more marked during the pubertal years because secular change had brought about an earlier sexual maturation, including an advancement of median menarcheal age by 0-5 year, coupled with an earlier growth spurt. This paper also provides the first growth standards for Chinese from birth to 18 years, with percentile charts on both standing height and sexual maturation in boys and girls.

0030228663	Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis	Liver involvement in autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) in the form of chronic active hepatitis has been well described. However, to our knowledge, primary biliary cirrhosis in APS has not been reported. Here we report the case of a 27-year-old man who presented with classical insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and subsequently developed Hashimoto's thyroiditis, hypogonadism, and primary biliary cirrhosis. The latter diagnosis was confirmed by a cholestatic pattern of liver enzymes, positive anti-mitochondrial antibody, normal cholangiogram, and characteristic liver biopsy findings. Primary biliary cirrhosis should probably be regarded as a possible, though uncommon, component of APS.

0030696924	Acromegaly in a woman presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis and insulin resistance	A 22-year-old Chinese woman presented with typical features of diabetic ketoacidosis. There was a family history of diabetes but she was not obese. Plasma glucose and bicarbonate levels were 27.0 mmol/l and 5 mmol/l, respectively. Significant insulin resistance was noticed: she needed up to 15 units of insulin per hour. She required up to 120 units daily for her diabetic control even after her acidosis had subsided. She was then noticed to have the clinical features of acromegaly. The diagnosis was confirmed, and a cranial CT scan confirmed the presence of a pituitary macroadenoma. She underwent uneventful trans-sphenoidal resection of the tumour and her insulin requirement gradually lessened. Acromegaly should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained insulin resistance.

0030751252	Accuracy, precision and user-acceptability of self blood glucose monitoring machines	The performance of six self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) machines (Accutrend®, Reflolux S®, Companion 2®, Glucometer GX®, Glucometer IV® and One Touch II®) were examined using venous blood samples from 88 patients. Whole blood glucose (BG) values were measured by four machines from each brand. Machine-generated whole blood glucose (BG) values were corrected before comparison with laboratory plasma glucose values, measured by a glucose oxidase method. Based on error grid analysis, most of the corrected machine-generated BG values were clinically acceptable. Accutrend®, Glucometer IV® and Companion 2® showed the greatest consistency between machines of the same brand. Over 80% of corrected BG values generated by Glucometer IV® fell within ± 10% of the reference values. One Touch II® yielded the most reproducible results with a mean CV of 2.7% and was considered the most user friendly machine. More studies are required to examine the performance of these machines in the hands of patients.

0030821146	The effect of age on cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese women	Chinese women traditionally have a low incidence of coronary heart disease. However, information on cardiovascular risk factors in this population are relatively scarce. We examined these risk factors in 601 Hong Kong Chinese women (age±SEM, 38.5±0.4 years; range, 18-66 years) stratified into four age groups (group 1, ≤30 years; group 2, 31-40 years; group 3, 41-50 years; group 4, ≤51 years). Increasing age in Chinese women was associated with increased body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein B, fasting and 2-h plasma glucose, glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma insulin and urate concentrations. After adjustment for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and smoking, all these age-related associations remained statistically significant except for fasting plasma insulin concentration. There was a progressive increase with age in the prevalence of glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. These prevalence rates further increased in subjects aged 51 years (the mean menopausal age in Asian women) or above. These findings suggest that age had an important and independent effect on cardiovascular risk in Chinese women and that, as in Caucasians, the onset of menopause might further increase this risk.

0030481561	Serum bilirubin and cardiovascular risk factors in a Chinese population	Background - Many risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been identified. Recently, an association between low concentration of serum bilirubin and increased risk of CVD has been reported. However, information on this topic remains scarce. Methods - We examined the relationships between serum bilirubin and CVD risk factors in 1,508 Hong Kong Chinese. We divided the subjects into four quartiles based on serum bilirubin concentrations. Cardiovascular risk factors studied include age, sex, smoking, obesity, glycaemic status and lipid indices. Results - Decreasing serum bilirubin concentration was associated with older age, increased prevalence of smoking, higher body mass index and systolic blood pressure, increased glycated haemoglobin, fasting and 1h insulin, triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B concentrations, and lower high-density lipoprotein concentration. Women had lower bilirubin concentrations than men. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking and insulin levels as covariates, the associations between serum bilirubin concentration and glycated haemoglobin, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein and very-low-density lipoprotein persisted. The prevalence rates of abnormal glucose tolerance (impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes) were similar amongst the four quartiles of bilirubin concentrations. However, the mean bilirubin concentration was significantly lower in subjects with abnormal glucose tolerance (9.3 ± 3.5 μmol/l, n = 178) than in normal subjects (10.1 ± 5.2 μmol/l, n = 1330, P = 0.039), When analysed as a continuous variable by age;adjusted partial correlation coefficients, serum bilirubin concentration was inversely correlated with fasting insulin, triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein and glycated haemoglobin level. Conclusions - There were close associations between low serum bilirubin concentration and increased CVD risk factors. Subjects with abnormal glucose tolerance also had lower serum bilirubin concentration than normal subjects. Some of these associations (body mass index, systolic blood pressure) could be explained by differences in insulin level. These relationships between bilirubin and CVD risk factors require further clarification, although abnormal intermediary metabolism and antioxidant deficiency may be possible linking factors.

0031009074	Plasma fibrinogen concentration in a Chinese population	Plasma fibrinogen concentration has been shown to be a predictor of major cardiovascular events. Information on plasma fibrinogen amongst Chinese has been scanty. We examined the relationships between plasma fibrinogen concentration and cardiovascular risk factors in 988 chinese subjects who underwent 75 g oral glucose tolerance test for screening for glucose intolerance. The study involved a selected sample with subjects who had an history of gestational diabetes, delivery of big babies (birth weight ≤ 4 kg), equivocal plasma glucose concentrations and subjects who were family members of diabetic patients. This was mainly a non-smoking (96.6%), non-drinking (98%) and non-exercising (99%) population of which 87% (n = 855) were female. Among the 988 subjects (age ± S.D. 36.8 ± 10.2, range 16-79 years), plasma fibrinogen concentration ranged from 1.40 to 9.90 g/l with a mean of 3.26 ± 0.93 g/l. On stratification of the subjects into 4 quartiles based on plasma fibrinogen concentrations, we found that increased plasma fibrinogen was associated with older age, higher body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), fasting and 2 h plasma glucose (PG), prevalence of diabetes, glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and triglyceride (TG) level. After adjustment for age and sex, increased plasma fibrinogen concentration remained associated with higher BMI, systolic BP, 2 h PG and TG level. On multivariate analysis using age, BMI, BP, TG, HbA(1c), and PG as independent variables, plasma fibrinogen was independently related to plasma TG concentration and HbA(1c). With 1 S.D. change in TG concentration and HbA(1c), there were 3.7 and 5.2% changes in plasma fibrinogen concentration respectively. These findings emphasize the close relationships between plasma fibrinogen and cardiovascular risk factors, in particular abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism.

0031758858	Short-term efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy with lovastatin and acipimox in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mixed dyslipidemia	In type 2 diabetes, it is not uncommon to find an elevated serum triglyceride and/or reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels; elevated total cholesterol levels often occur as well. To evaluate the short-term efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy with lovastatin and acipimox in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes who have mixed dyslipidemia, an open-label 6-month trial was conducted. All patients had type 2 diabetes (n = 33) with total cholesterol ≥6.2 mmol/L and fasting triglyceride ≥2.8 mmol/L, which had been confirmed twice and persisted for at least 12 weeks after introduction of diet control. After a 4-week run-in period, they were given lovastatin 40 mg daily at night for 12 weeks. Acipimox 250 mg three times a day was then added for a further 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment with lovastatin alone, improvement was observed in total cholesterol (21% reduction), triglyceride (32% reduction), low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (5.5% reduction), HDL cholesterol (11.6% elevation), apolipoprotein A-I (4.6% elevation), and apolipoprotein B (20.5% reduction). The addition of acipimox to lovastatin for an additional 12 weeks further reduced serum total cholesterol triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, but this additional decrease was not statistically significant. However, HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were significantly increased by the addition of acipimox (a 14.2% and 9.0% elevation, respectively). Serum creatine phosphokinase increased slightly after 12 weeks of lovastatin but decreased to a concentration similar to baseline after 12 weeks of combination treatment. No patients reported muscle pain or weakness or other side effects. Combination treatment with lovastatin and acipimox appears to be a safe and effective therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia, and has particular benefit in elevating serum HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels.

0031815257	A novel PCR-based methodology to determine TAP allele frequencies in population studies	The TAP genes have been extensively studied as candidate susceptibility genes for autoimmune and infectious diseases. TAP1 and TAP2 have two and three polymorphic sites respectively which are used for the allele assignment following WHO nomenclature. The usual techniques employed to determine the TAP alleles cannot unequivocally ascertain the alleles present in subjects which are heterozygous at more than one polymorphic position within the genes. This results in an inability to determine absolute TAP allele frequencies in population studies. The aim of this study was to devise a PCR-based method to unambiguously assign TAP alleles to all subjects. The novel method was tested in Oriental Type I diabetic and control subjects. The technique is a valuable tool for allele assignment in heterozygous subjects solely using PCR.

0031890271	Gene expression of the renin-angiotensin system in human kidney	Background. Immunocytochemical studies have revealed that all components of the renin-angiotensin system are widely distributed in human tissues yet the information on the gene expression of the renin-angiotensin system in various types of cell remains scarce. Objective. We explored the presence of a local renin-angiotensin system in human kidney. Methods. We sought to determine the presence of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding for renin, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in cultured human glomerular cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells using a two-step polymerase chain reaction. The gene expression of the renin-angiotensin system in normal human kidney and in diseased kidney was studied by in-situ hybridization using synthetic oligonucleotides. Results. By using a two-step polymerase chain reaction, renin, angiotensinogen, and ACE mRNA were found in cultured mesangial and epithelial cells but only ACE mRNA was present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Renin mRNA was detected in juxtaglomerular granular cells and also in glomerular and tubular epithelia in normal kidney by in-situ hybridization. A similar tubular, but not mesangial, distribution was found with angiotensinogen and ACE mRNA. In contrast, stronger signals for renin, angiotensinogen and ACE mRNA were detected in mesangial and epithelial cells of kidney tissues from hypertensive patients and from patients with renal pathology characterized by mesangial proliferation (immunoglobulin A nephropathy, diabetes mellitus, or lupus nephritis). Conclusions. That gene expression of the renin-angiotensin system occurs in resident glomerular cells supports the hypothesis that there is a local renin-angiotensin system in human kidney. Our findings support the previous speculation that the renin-angiotensin system could be a local factor involved in the progression of chronic renal failure and consequent development of hypertension.

0031902193	Combined use of a fasting plasma glucose concentration and HbA(1c) or fructosamine predicts the likelihood of having diabetes in high-risk subjects	OBJECTIVE - To assess the validity of using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations in conjunction with HbA(1c) or fructosamine for the screening of diabetes in high-risk individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - In this study, 2,877 Hong Kong Chinese (565 [19.6%] men; 2,312 [80.4%] women) with various risk factors for glucose intolerance underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for screening of diabetes. The risk factors included a family history positive for diabetes, a history of gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, and obesity. RESULTS - Using World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 1,593 (55.4%) had normal glucose tolerance, 657 (22.8%) had impaired glucose tolerance, and 627 (21.8%) had diabetes. When the 1997 American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria were applied, 394 (13.7%) had diabetes with an FPG ≤ 7.0 mmol/l. Using multiple receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the paired values of an FPG of 5.6 mmol/l and a HbA(1c) of 5.5% gave an optimal sensitivity of 83.8% and specificity of 83.6% to predict a 2-h plasma glucose (PG) >-11.1 mmol/l. Likewise, the paired values of an FPG of 5.4 mmol/l and a fructosamine level of 235 μmol/l (n = 2,408) gave an optimal sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 83.2%. An FPG ≤5.6 mmol/1 and an HbA(1c) ≤5.5% was 5.4-fold more likely to occur in diabetic subjects (based on the WHO criteria) compared with nondiabetic subjects. For paired parameters less than these values, the likelihood ratio of this occurring in diabetic subjects was only 0.11. Similarly, an FPG ≤5.4 mmol/l and a fructosamine ≤235 μmol/l was fivefold more likely to occur in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects, with both parameters less than these values having a likelihood ratio of 0.04. Using these paired values as initial screening tests, only subjects who had an FPG ≤5.6 mmol/1 and <7.8 mmol/1 and an HbA(1c) ≤5.5% (n = 642) required an OGTT to confirm diabetes, thereby saving 77.7% [(2,877 - 642)/2,877] of the OGTTs performed. Similarly, only subjects who had an FPG ≤5.4 mmol/l and <7.8 mmol/1 and a fructosamine ≤235 μmol/1 (n = 526) required OGTT to confirm diabetes, meaning that 78.2% [(2,408 - 526)/2,408] of the OGTTs could have been saved. Based on the 1997 ADA criterion of an FPG cutoff value of 7.0 mmol/1, the corresponding numbers of OGTTs to be saved were 82.6% and 85.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS - The paired values of FPG and HbA(1c) or FPG and fructosamine helped to identify potentially diabetic subjects, the diagnosis of which could be further confirmed by the 75-g OGTT. Using this approach, ~80% of OGTTs could have been saved, depending on the diagnostic cutoff value of FPG.

0031962210	The reproducibility and usefulness of the oral glucose tolerance test in screening for diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors	We examined the reproducibility of oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) using the World Health Organization criterion in 212 Chinese subjects (male 149, female 63) who underwent two 75 g OGTTs within a 6-week period. The overall reproducibility was 65.6% (139/212) of which 74 subjects had normal glucose tolerance, 24 had diabetes and 41 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on two occasions. The subjects were divided into three groups [group 1: normal OGTTs on both occasions (n = 74); group 2: one abnormal OGTT (either diabetes or IGT (n = 51); group 3: 2 abnormal OGTTs (n = 87)]. Subjects in group 1 were younger, had lower blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fasting and 2 h plasma insulin levels, triglyceride, very-low density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein-B concentrations than both groups 2 and 3. Group 2 had similar characteristics as group 3 except for a lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA(lc)), fasting and 2 h plasma glucose during the two OGTTs. With receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, a HbA(lc) of 5.3% gave an optimal sensitivity of 70.7% and specificity of 74.3% to predict diabetes as defined by a 2 h plasma glucose value ≤ 11.1 mmol/L in the first OGTT. Of the 212 subjects, 73 had HbA(lc) ≤ 5.3%. The reproducibility of OGTT was 56.2% for these 73 subjects. With ROC analysis, a BMI of 25 kg/m

0031985489	Dual phase spiral CT in the detection of small insulinomas of the pancreas	Dual phase contrast enhanced spiral computed tomography (DPSCT) has the potential to improve detection of small insulin secreting islet cell tumours of the pancreas. Seven patients with biochemically proven insulinoma, who had previously undergone a range of negative radiological procedures, were referred for DPSCT. Images of the pancreas were obtained using 3 mm collimation in the arterial and arteriovenous perfusion phase following the rapid injection of contrast medium. Six tumours were localized in seven patients. The six insulinomas identified on DPSCT ranged in size from 6 mm to 18 mm and were located in the uncinate process (2), head (1), neck (2) and body (1). All six tumours were detected in the arterial phase and four in the arteriovenous phase. The four insulinomas detected on both perfusion phases were more conspicuous in the arterial phase in three patients and more conspicuous in the arteriovenous phase in one patient. In conclusion, high resolution arterial phase acquisition of the pancreas is very valuable in the detection of small insulinomas.

0032539770	Gene transcription and synthesis of adrenomedullin by cultured human renal cells	Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a novel 52 amino acid peptide with a potent vasodilator effect. Gene expression of ADM is found in human kidney but the exact cell source in the kidney is uncertain. Its plasma level is raised in association with changes in sympathetic nervous activity and body fluid volume in hypertension and chronic renal failure. Herein, we examined the presence of mRNA encoding for ADM in cultured human glomerular cells. Adrenomedullin in cell culture supernatant was measured by a radio-immunoassay (with a detection level of 3.2 pmol/l). Adrenomedullin mRNA was found in cultured mesangial and glomerular epithelial cells as well as in vascular endothelial cells. Supernatant levels of ADM for cultured mesangial and glomerular epithelial cells were 21.2 and < 3.2 pmol/l respectively. Contrary to vascular smooth muscle cells, the gene expression for ADM in mesangial cells was up-regulated when incubated with increasing concentration of TNF-α or fetal bovine serum (FBS) but this effect was not observed with very high concentration. Parallel results were observed in adrenomedullin levels in supernatant from mesangial cell cultures. Forskolin, captopril, or TGF-β had no effect on the transcription or synthesis of ADM in mesangial cells. The gene expression for ADM in glomerular epithelial cells was down-regulated when incubated with increasing concentration of TNF-α, forskolin or FBS. The ADM levels in all supernatant from resting glomerular epithelial cell cultures were < 3.2 pmol/l. Recent murine data show that ADM stimulates the release of cAMP but suppresses mitogenesis in cultured mesangial cells. Our results suggest ADM is synthesized by mesangial cells in an autocrine fashion and the peptide may potentially be involved in intra-renal blood pressure control.

2342616981	Increasing Severity of Cardiovascular Risk Factors with Increasing Middle Cerebral Artery Stenotic Involvement in Type 2 Diabetic Chinese Patients with Asymptomatic Cerebrovascular Disease	OBJECTIVE - To identify determinants associated with increasing severity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis in asymptomatic Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with and without MCA stenosis determined using transcranial Doppler. Conventional risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, and differences in the pattern of these may explain the heterogeneity of disease presentation in different populations. In Chinese patients, MCA stenosis is the most commonly identified intracranial vascular lesion. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Anthropometric and fasting biochemical parameters were compared between type 2 diabetic patients with MCA stenosis in one (n = 185) or both (n = 200) vessels and 1,492 type 2 diabetic patients without evidence of stenosis. RESULTS - Increasing MCA stenoic vascular involvement was associated with significantly increasing age, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol, but with lower glucose levels. There was also an increased prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and use of blood pressure- and glucose-lowering agents in the patients with MCA stenosis. Concomitant significant increases in the prevalence of peripheral vascular disease and retinopathy were also observed in the patients with MCA stenosis. CONCLUSIONS - Transcranial Doppler examination identified stenosis in one or both MCAs in over one-fifth of the Chinese type 2 diabetic subjects without symptoms of cerebrovascular disease. A number of conventional cardiovascular risk factors were closely associated with MCA stenosis. This technique may allow the identification of a particularly high-risk group, and further studies are required to determine whether asymptomatic MCA stenosis is predictive of primary cerebrovascular events and whether intensive treatment of risk factors would reduce the risk.

33645994502	Prediction of cardiovascular and total mortality in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients by the WHO definition for the metabolic syndrome	Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MES) in type 2 diabetic patients and the predictive values of the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Cholesterol Education Programme (NCEP) definitions and the individual components of the MES on total and cardiovascular mortality. Methods: A prospective analysis of a consecutive cohort of 5202 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients recruited between July 1994 and April 2001. Results: The prevalence of the MES was 49.2-58.1% depending on the use of various criteria. There were 189 deaths (men: 100 and women: 89) in these 5205 patients during a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 2.1 (0.3-3.6 years). Of these, 164 (87%) were classified as cardiovascular deaths. Using the NCEP criterion, patients with MES had a death rate similar to those without (3.51 vs. 3.85%). By contrast, based on the WHO criteria, patients with MES had a higher mortality rate than those without (4.3 vs. 2.4%, p=0.002). Compared to patients with neither NCEP- nor WHO-defined MES, only the group with MES defined by the WHO, but not NCEP, criterion had significantly higher mortality rate (2.6 vs. 6.8%, p<0.001). Using Cox regression analysis, only age, duration of diabetes and smoking were identified as independent factors for cardiovascular or total death. Among the various components of MES, hypertension, low BMI and albuminuria were the key predictors for these adverse events. Conclusions: In Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, the WHO criterion has a better discriminative power over the NCEP criterion for predicting death. Among the various components of the MES defined either by WHO or NCEP, hypertension, albuminuria and low BMI were the main predictors of cardiovascular and total mortality. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

33745260423	Microalbuminuria prevalence study (MAPS) in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients in Hong Kong	Objectives. To assess the prevalence of macroalbuminuria and microalbuminuria, and the level of blood pressure control in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in Hong Kong. Design. Cross-sectional clinic-based epidemiological study. Setting. Six medical centres (including two public hospital diabetes centres) in Hong Kong. Patients. Recruited from the medical centres from April to November 2002, after excluding those with bacteriuria and haematuria. Main outcome measures. Body mass index; blood pressure; levels of blood glucose, macroalbuminuria, and microalbuminuria; treatments for hypertension and diabetes. Results. The as per-protocol recruited population of 437 hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients had a mean age of 61.7 (standard error, 0.5) years. Overall, the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in this population was high; 18.3% had macroalbuminuria (95% confidence interval, 16.5-20.2%) and 24.9% had microalbuminuria (95% confidence interval, 22.9- 27.0%). Predictive factors were advanced age, male sex, poor blood pressure control, and existing cardiovascular complications. Whilst almost all patients (96.1%) were receiving treatment for hypertension, only 25.6% had systolic/diastolic blood pressures below the 130/85 mm Hg target. Conclusions. In Hong Kong, the prevalence of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria is high in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension, particularly in males and those with poorly controlled systolic blood pressure. Tight glycaemic control, antihypertensive therapy, and use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors/blockers are necessary to retard the progression of nephropathy to advanced renal disease.

33746716908	Association of smoking with increasing vascular involvement in type 2 diabetic Chinese patients	Purpose: To identify the relationship between smoking and the metabolic profile and existing vascular disease in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: 1710 diabetic patients were screened for complications, and biochemical and anthropometric vascular risk factors. As most smokers were male, differences were only compared between male current (n = 196) and never smoking patients (n = 300). Results: The smokers had higher glycosylated haemoglobin levels (8.2 ± 2.0 vs. 7.6 ± 1 8%, p < 0.001) than never smokers, despite a greater proportion receiving hypoglycaemic agents (87.5 vs. 79.6%, p = 0.003). Male smokers compared to never smokers had lower HDL-cholesterol levels (1.12 ± 0.31 vs. 1.20 ± 0.30 mmol/L, p = 0.006), and elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (3.57 [2.68-4.75] vs. 2.47 [1.99-3.05] mg/mmol, p = 0.040). However, diastolic blood pressure was lower in the smoking group (78 ± 12 vs. 82 ± 12 mmHg, p = 0.001) even though they received less blood pressure-lowering treatments (23.8 vs. 33.2%, p = 0.034). The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease was increased in the diabetic patients who smoked compared to nonsmokers (7.1 vs. 2.8%, p = 0.039). Conclusions: Smoking was associated with a more adverse metabolic profile and peripheral vascular disease. As mainland China undergoes rapid modernisation and urbanisation, the observed effects of smoking means tobacco control becomes increasingly important to prevent or minimise potential health impacts and chronic disease. © J.

33747081437	Metabolic syndrome by the international diabetes federation definition in Hong Kong Chinese	In this report, we aimed to examine the impact of the new International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definition on the prevalence and clinical characteristics of subjects with metabolic syndrome (MES). Data were obtained from a prevalence survey for cardiovascular risk factors in a Hong Kong Chinese working population. There were 1513 subjects well representing all occupational groups from managers to general laborers [910 (60.1%) men and 603 (39.9%) women (mean age 37.5 ± 9.2, median 37.0, range 18-66 years)]. The crude prevalence of MES defined by the IDF criterion was 7.4% (compared to other criteria: NCEP, 9.6%; WHO, 13.4% and EGIR, 8.9%). The age-standardized prevalence of MES by the IDF criterion was 8.8% in women and 7.3% in men. Subjects with MES defined by IDF criterion had higher body mass index and waist compared to those with MES defined by NCEP or WHO criteria, and lower triglyceride compared to those with MES defined by NCEP criterion after adjustment for age, gender and smoking. Non-MES subjects defined by IDF criterion had higher 2 h glucose and insulin resistance compared to non-MES subjects defined by WHO. In conclusion, the new IDF criterion for MES is easy to implement in clinical practice. It may be potentially more 'specific' in identifying subjects with MES although compared to the NCEP criterion, it may have missed a proportion of subjects, especially men, who have metabolic derangement. Prospective and interventional studies are needed to validate the prognostic values of this new definition in comparison with other existing definitions. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

0033063882	Clinical characteristics of acromegaly in Hong Kong	This study analyses the clinical characteristics of acromegalic patients in Hong Kong. All patients with acromegaly under follow up in Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong between January 1984 and December 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. Detailed hospital notes were available for review in 28 out of 34. Of the 28 patients with full records available, 27 were Chinese and 1 was Nepalese. There were 8 (28.6%) males and 20 (71.4%) females. The mean age (± SD) at presentation was 51.2 ± 16.8 years (range: 28 to 84 years) (male, 49.9±13.9 years [range: 28-66]; female, 51.7 ± 18.1 years [range: 31-84]; p-value: NS). The commonest mode of presentation (n=22, 78.6%) was clinical suspicion by medical staff during consultation for other conditions, acromegaly being later confirmed. The estimated duration of symptoms, before diagnosis, was 14 years (range: 1 to 30 years). CT scan imaging of the pituitary gland showed that 12 patients (42.9%) had pituitary macro-adenomas (≥1 cm), 3 (10.7%) had micro-adenomas (<1 cm), 6 (21.4%) had normal imaging, 1 (3.6%) had an empty sella and 6 (21.4%) had suspicious but inconclusive lesions in the pituitary gland. Surgery was offered as initial treatment to all patients. 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, if the maximal growth hormone response following glucose loading exceeded 10 μg/L, radiotherapy was offered. Of the 28 patients, 13 received surgery and radiotherapy, 2 surgery only, 4 radiotherapy only, 4 no treatment and 5 defaulted. At presentation, 50% had some abnormality of glucose tolerance. The mean early morning fasting baseline growth hormone was 52.8 ± 37.0 μg/L (mean ± SD, median: 48.1 μg/L) and the maximal growth hormone response during an extended oral glucose tolerance test was 63.2 ± 34.9 μg/L (median: 61.3 μg/L). Forty five percents of patients had a maximal growth hormone response exceeding 60 μg/L. Of the 19 patients who underwent surgery and/or radiotherapy, 15 had their pituitary function reassessed 6 months after intervention. Their early morning fasting growth hormone and maximal growth hormone response in an extended oral glucose tolerance test were 21.3 ± 25.8 and 35.4 ± 37.5 μg/L, respectively. In conclusion, acromegaly in Hong Kong has an estimated annual incidence of 3.8 per million. There is a female preponderance, tendency to late presentation (>10 years) and low number of large tumors. Up to 80% were referred following observer suspicion.

0032707432	Molecular genetics of diabetes mellitus in chinese subjects: Identification of mutations in glucokinase and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α genes in patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus/MODY	Aims: To examine the prevalence of identified MODY-related genes in Chinese subjects with early onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus and a positive family history of diabetes and to look for possible associations between the gene mutations and the development of diabetes. Methods: Ninety-two unrelated Chinese subjects with diabetes diagnosed before the age of 40 years who had a positive family history of diabetes were screened for mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF-1α and HNF-4α) and glucokinase genes by direct sequencing. The family members of patients with mutations and 100 healthy controls were also examined. Results: Mutations in the HNF-1α and the glucokinase genes were found in 5% and 3% of the diabetic subjects, respectively but no mutations were found in the coding region of the HNF-4α gene. Three mutations found in the glucokinase gene were novel missense mutations (I110T, A119D and G385V). The mutations in the HNF-1α gene were also new and included four missense mutations (G20R, R203H, S432C, I618M) and one splice acceptor site mutation (IVS2nt-1G→A). Patients with mutations in these genes were clinically heterogeneous with respect to phenotype and basal pancreatic beta cell function. Conclusions: Genetic factors such as mutations in the HNF-1α and glucokinase genes may be important in the development of diabetes in Chinese people, especially when the disease is of early onset.

0032843458	Plasma insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, and central obesity among young Chinese type 2 diabetic patients	OBJECTIVE - To examine the relationships between central obesity, insulin resistance index, plasma insulin, growth hormone (GH), and cortisol concentrations in 90 young Chinese type 2 diabetic patients (aged 33 ± 5 years) and 104 age- and sex-matched control subjects (aged 32 ± 9 years). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Young Chinese diabetic patients (aged <40 years) were recruited from the Prince of Wales Hospital. Blood pressure, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences were determined. Venous blood was sampled for measurements of fasting plasma glucose, HbA(1c), lipids, creatinine, insulin, GH, and cortisol. A 24-h urine was assayed for urinary albumin excretion (UAE). General and central obesity was represented by BMI and waist circumference, respectively. Insulin resistance index was estimated as a product of fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. RESULTS - Compared with control subjects, diabetic patients were more obese, hyperglycemic, and had worse lipid profile, higher blood pressures, UAE, insulin resistance index, plasma insulin, and cortisol concentrations (all P < 0.001) but lower GH concentrations (P < 0.05). When analyzed as a whole group (n = 194), increasing quartiles of waist circumference were associated with increasing trends of insulin resistance index, plasma insulin, and cortisol concentrations (all P < 0.01) but a decreasing trend of plasma GH concentration (P < 0.05). Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, waist circumference was only associated with sex variable (being higher in men) in the control subjects. In the diabetic group, 51% of waist circumference was independently related to male sex and increased plasma insulin and cortisol concentrations as well as reduced plasma GH levels. CONCLUSIONS - In young Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, hyperinsulinemia, hypercortisolemia, and reduced plasma GH levels were closely associated with central obesity. Based on these findings, we postulate that maladaptive hormonal responses to rapid changes in lifestyle may have led to obesity and type 2 diabetes in these young patients. Alternatively, lifestyle-related obesity may have given rise to these hormonal changes. More studies are required to delineate the nature of these relationships.

0034010240	Glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes: The impact of body weight, β-cell function and patient education	We examined the determinants of glycaemic control in a consecutive cohort of 562 newly-referred Chinese type 2 diabetic patients (57% women) during a 12-month period. All patients underwent a structured assessment with documentation of clinical and biochemical characteristics. Pancreatic β-cell function was assessed by fasting plasma C-peptide concentration. Insulin deficiency was defined as fasting plasma C-peptide < 0.2 pmol/ml. Insulin resistance (IR) was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) based on a product of fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Treatment was considered appropriate when insulin-deficient patients were treated with insulin and non-insulin-deficient patients were treated with oral agents or diet. Mean (± SD) age was 54.3 ± 13.8 years (range 17-87 years) and disease duration was 5.0 ± 5.9 years. At the time of referral, 70.5 % (n = 396) were on drug therapy (9% on insulin and 62.8% on oral agents), 20.6% (n = 116) were on diet and 9% (n = 50) had not received any form of treatment. The mean HbA(Ic), was 8.4 ± 2.3%. The geometric mean ( x// antilog SD) of IR was 4.62 x// 2.51 (range 0.63-162.7) and correlated only with waist:hip ratio (WHR, p = 0.008). The geometric mean of plasma C peptide was 0.47 x// 2.89 nmol/l and correlated with BMI (p < 0.001). Glycated haemoglobin was correlated positively with age (p = 0.013), disease duration (p < 0.001), IR (p < 0.001) and negatively with BMI (p < 0.001). Glycated haemoglobin was lower in patients who had seen a dietitian (7.9% vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001) or diabetes nurse (7.8% vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001) or who performed self blood glucose monitoring (7.9% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.001) and higher among smokers (8.9% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.003). Compared to insulin-deficient patients (n = 118), non-insulin-deficient patients (n = 413) had features resembling that of the Metabolic Syndrome with increased WHR (p = 0.005), blood pressure (p < 0.001), BMI (p = 0.001) and were older (p = 0.04). Amongst the insulin-deficient patients, 27% were treated with oral agents or diet. Patients receiving appropriate therapy (n = 362) had a lower HbA, than those treated inappropriately (n = 173) (8.2% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, short disease duration (p < 0.001), low IR (p < 0.001), high BMI (p = 0.001), diabetes education (p < 0.001), lack of smoking (p = 0.014) and choice of appropriate treatment (p = 0.009) were the independent determinants of good glycaemic control.

0034087941	Mitochondrial DNA A3243G mutation in patients with early- or late-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus in Hong Kong Chinese	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The mitochondrial DNA A to G mutation at nucleotide 3243 (mt3243) is associated with a subtype of diabetes characterized by maternal transmission and deafness. We have previously reported a 2.7% prevalence of this mutation in a cohort of young patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In this study, we aimed to confirm this finding by examining for the prevalence of this mutation in a large- scale study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred and six unrelated Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes and 213 nondiabetic controls were studied. The presence of mt3243 mutation was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and ApaI digestion. RESULTS: This mutation was found in four of 133 (3.0%) patients with early onset (≤ 40 years) diabetes who also had a positive maternal family history, and in one of 348 (0.3%) patients with late-onset (>40 years) diabetes and no family history. Basal pancreatic β- cell function, as assessed by fasting plasma C-peptide, was variable amongst mutation carriers, and did not correlate with the level of heteroplasmy of mutation. CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with most studies, our results suggest that despite the high prevalence of positive maternal family history of diabetes amongst our type 2 diabetic patients, mt3243 mutation was not a major cause of diabetes in either early- or late-onset diabetic patients in Hong Kong. The role of other genetic, environmental and intrauterine factors needs further investigation.

0033851155	Diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese: Evidence for familial clustering and parental effects	OBJECTIVE - To investigate transmission patterns of diabetes and their relationships with clinical characteristics in Hong Kong Chinese patients with late-onset (age ≥35 years) type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This study involved 2,310 patients consecutively selected from a hospital clinic-based diabetes registry. These patients all reported the diabetes status of their parents as well as siblings. RESULTS - Approximately 36% of the 2,310 patients reported at least 1 affected parent or sibling (25 and 21% reported at least 1 diabetic parent and sibling, respectively). These patients, irrespective of their sex, were more likely to have a diabetic mother than a diabetic father (17 vs. 13% of the male patients and 18 vs. 9% of the female patients, P < 0.01). The male patients were more likely than the female patients to have a diabetic father (13 vs. 9%, P < 0.01). The female patients with a diabetic mother were found to have higher levels of plasma total cholesterol compared with the female patients with a diabetic father in multiple comparisons with adjustment for significance (5.56 ± 1.30 vs. 5.09 ± 0.95 mmol/l, P < 0.05). In 2-group comparisons, there was also evidence that the male patients with a diabetic father had higher BMI values than the male patients with a diabetic mother (25.9 ± 3.5 vs. 25.0 ± 3.5 kg/m

0033851966	Outcomes of screening for diabetes in high-risk Hong Kong Chinese subjects	OBJECTIVE - To examine the significance of individual risk factors on the development of diabetes in subjects who underwent screening for diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 1,649 Chinese subjects underwent screening for diabetes. They were asymptomatic but had known risk factors for diabetes, including a positive family history of diabetes, a past history of gestational diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia. Another 799 age-matched subjects from the community who had no risk factors for diabetes were used as the comparison group. RESULTS - Of the 1,649 subjects who underwent screening, 241 (14.6%) had diabetes. In these subjects, 989 (60.0%) had 1 risk factor, 502 (30.4%) had 2 risk factors, 141 (8.6%) had 3 risk factors, and 17 (1.0%) had 4 or 5 risk factors for diabetes. Of the 799 control subjects, 29 (3.6%) had diabetes. Compared with the comparison group, the odds ratio (95% CI) of having diabetes after adjustment for age was 5.2 (3.5-7.7) in the 1,649 subjects with known risk factors. The odds ratio of having diabetes increased from 3.7 in subjects with 1 risk factor to 28.4 in subjects with 4 or 5 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS - In men, age, BMI, family history of diabetes, and dyslipidemia, and in women, age, BMI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, total cholesterol, and history of gestational diabetes are associated with increased odds of developing diabetes. These risk factors have additive effects on the odds of having diabetes. Early and regular screening for diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors is essential in these high-risk individuals.

0033856802	Treatment of Chinese acromegaly with a combination of bromocriptine and octreotide	Background: Good results have been reported with combined use of octreotide and bromocriptine in acromegalic Caucasians. Data concerning the efficacy and tolerability of this combination treatment in Chinese acromegalic patients are scanty. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of combined therapy using bromocriptine and octreotide in the treatment of acromegaly in Chinese patients and to compare the cost-effectiveness of various regimes. Methods: Sixteen Chinese acromegalic patients with growth hormone (GH) concentration not suppressible to below 5 mU/L (2 μg/L) during an extended OGTT were recruited to undergo four phases of the study. During the study period, the patients were given bromocriptine alone, bromocriptine and low dose octreotide, bromocriptine and medium dose octreotide, and medium dose cotreotide alone. Plasma concentrations of GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured before and after the completion of each phase. Results: The number of patients reaching target GH concentrations was significantly higher when treated with octreotide compared to baseline (p<0.05). Bromocriptine alone had a significant effect but not to the extent of octreotide alone. A combination of low dose octreotide and bromocriptine is as efficacious in the treatment of acromegaly as high dose octreotide. None of the patients suffered from serious adverse effects. Conclusion: The results confirmed the usefulness and tolerability of bromocriptine and octreotide in Chinese acromegalics. The most cost-effective regime in this study was a combination of low dose octreotide and bromocriptine.

40949134280	Health literacy, complication awareness, and diabetic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus	Title. Health literacy, complication awareness, and diabetic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus Aim. This paper is a report of a study to examine the relationship between health literacy, complication awareness and diabetic control among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to validate a Chinese version of the Short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Background. There is a rapidly increasing trend in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Asian countries. Alongside the considerable progress in recent decades of health education in the field of diabetes care, the effects of health literacy and complication awareness have received increasing attention over the past 10 years. Method. This study was conducted from September 2005 to February 2006 with 149 Chinese patients (mean = 59·8 years, range: 27-90 years) who were undergoing/had undergone diabetic complication assessment. Survey data were collected using a structured questionnaire incorporating demographics; assessment of complication awareness in two sections: a self-developed 10-item patient awareness score and a modified Chinese version of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities measure; and health literacy as measured by the Chinese version of the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. Diabetic control was assessed by the most recent HbA1c level. Findings. Health literacy (P < 0·001) and patient awareness scores were negatively correlated to diabetic control (P = 0·035), but management of treatment in the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities measure (P = 0·030), gender (P = 0·023) and duration of diabetes (P < 0·001) were positively correlated to HbA1c. Conclusion. To develop effective patient education and improve patients' diabetic control and own complications, educational strategies need to consider patients' health literacy levels and self-care skills. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

41349097566	Middle cerebral artery stenosis increased the risk of vascular disease mortality among type 2 diabetic patients	Background: In Chinese populations, middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis is the most commonly identified intracranial vascular lesion, and has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of secondary stroke mortality, but has yet to be reported for primary events. We assess whether asymptomatic MCA stenosis is associated with mortality in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: The presence of MCA stenosis was determined by transcranial Doppler and mortality data were collated in the Hong Kong Death Registry. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine if the MCA stenosis (n = 272, 53.7% 2-vessel disease) in 2,197 diabetics was associated with all-cause or vascular disease mortality, including after adjustment for conventional vascular risk factors. Anthropometric and fasting biochemical parameters were compared between diabetic patients with MCA stenosis and without evidence of stenosis. Results: A total of 191 deaths were identified (30.9% of vascular disease origin) during a follow-up of 18,279 patient years over 8.32 years. After adjustment for age, gender and diabetes duration, the hazard ratios for vascular mortality for 1- and 2-vessel disease were 2.47 (95% CI = 1.13-5.38) and 4.47 (95% CI = 2.24-8.82), p < 0.001 for trend, for increasing vascular mortality with increasing severity of cerebrovascular involvement, but 0.81 (95% CI = 0.45-1.47) and 2.23 (95% CI = 1.45-1.47), p = 0.001 for trend, for all-cause mortality. For vascular mortality, further adjustments for anthropometric and fasting biochemical parameters, or existing disease and treatment history increased the hazard ratios for 1-vessel disease slightly but attenuated the risk for 2-vessel disease evidently, 2.81 (95% CI = 1.10-7.16) and 2.85 (95% = CI 1.11-7.33), p = 0.026. Conclusion: The presence of MCA stenoses was an independent predictor of vascular mortality in these diabetics. More aggressive treatment of risk factors in these subjects merits further evaluation.

51749100072	Type 2 diabetes mellitus and its renal complications in relation to apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism	The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 allele is reported to be associated with greater risk of renal impairment in type 2 diabetes. Relationships among APOE polymorphisms, renal impairment, and biochemical parameters were explored. A prospective study of 405 consenting Chinese type 2 diabetic patients [mean age ± standard deviation (SD): 59.2 ± 10.3 years] without advanced complications at entry was conducted. APOE genotyping and measurement of plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidants were performed at entry. HbA1C, plasma glucose, lipids, creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine, and blood pressure were measured at entry and at up to 4 years of follow-up. APOE allelic frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Odds ratios of albuminuria at entry and/or during follow-up for different APOE groups were not significantly different. The non-ε2 (ε3/3, ε3/4, ε4/4) group had significantly greater plasma ascorbate (51.6 ± 20.1 μmol/L) than the ε2 (ε2/2, ε2/3) group (44.5 ± 16.2 μmol/L, P = 0.021), but higher plasma ascorbate levels did not seem to decrease the risk of renal impairment in the non-ε2 group. Baseline plasma lipid-standardized α-tocopherol levels were least in ε2 subjects with persistent albuminuria (3.6 ± 1.1 μmol/mmol of total cholesterol plus triglycerides, P = 0.008) compared with ε2 subjects who had no albuminuria at entry or during follow-up (4.5 ± 0.8 μmol/mmol of total cholesterol plus triglycerides). The APOE ε2 allele does not seem to be associated with increased risk of renal impairment in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Plasma lipid-standardized α-tocopherol may play a role in determining risk of renal dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. © 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

5644244991	Albuminuria is a marker of increasing intracranial and extracranial vascular involvement in type 2 diabetic Chinese patients	Aims/hypothesis. Albuminuria has been reported to be a marker of cardiovascular risk factors and disease morbidity and mortality, but its relationship with intracerebral atherosclerotic disease is less clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between albuminuria and intracranial and extracranial vascular involvement in Chinese Type 2 diabetic patients. Methods. The anthropometric and fasting biochemical measurements of 966 Type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (55.6%), microalbuminuria (27.7%) or macroalbuminuria (16.7%) were compared. The prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular disease and middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis, measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound, were also compared between the groups. Results. Albuminuria was closely associated with a range of adverse parameters, including high BP, dyslipidaemia, smoking and adiposity (all p<0.01). The prevalence of microvascular disease (retinopathy p<0.001) and macrovascular disease (peripheral vascular disease p=0.012, myocardial infarction, p=0.004, MCA stenosis p<0.001) increased significantly with increasing levels of albuminuria. Albuminuria was also found to be an independent predictor of microvascular and macrovascular disease. Conclusions/interpretation. Albuminuria was an independent predictor of increasing levels of vascular risk factors and microvascular and macrovascular disease in this group of Type 2 diabetic patients, and a possible role for albuminuria as a marker of intracranial cerebrovascular disease should be further investigated.

65449135597	Statins for asymptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis: The regression of cerebral artery stenosis study	Background: The progression of cerebral atherosclerosis increases the risk of stroke and vascular events. Given the known benefits of statins in retarding coronary and carotid atherosclerosis progression, we studied the effects of statins on asymptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis progression. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on the progression of MCA stenosis among stroke-free individuals who had mild to moderately elevated LDL cholesterol (3.0-5.0 mmol/l). Two hundred and twenty-seven subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 114) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 113). The severity of MCA stenosis at baseline and at the end of the study was graded by MRA into normal, minimal (<10%), mild (10-49%), moderate (50-90%) and severe (>90%). The primary outcome was the change in grading of MCA stenosis over 2 years. Results: At the end of the study, the LDL cholesterol level decreased by 1.43 and 0.12 mmol/l for the active and placebo groups, respectively (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients having stable, progressive and regressive MCA stenosis between the placebo (72, 22 and 6%) and active groups (78.6, 15.5 and 5.8%). The all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the active group (n = 0) relative to the placebo group (n = 7, p = 0.014). Any clinical events were also lower in the active group (n = 5) than in the placebo group (n = 13, p = 0.052). Conclusions: Simvastatin 20 mg daily had no apparent effect upon the evolution of asymptomatic MCA stenosis over 2 years. © 2009 S. Karger AG.

We investigated the effects of statins on WML progression by performing a post hoc analysis on the ROCAS (Regression of Cerebral Artery Stenosis) study, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of statins upon asymptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis progression among stroke-free individuals. Two hundreds and eight randomized subjects were assigned to either placebo (n = 102) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 106) for 2 years.

66549123436	Effects of structured versus usual care on renal endpoint in type 2 diabetes: The SURE study - A randomized multicenter translational study	OBJECTIVE - Multifaceted care has been shown to reduce mortality and complications in type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that structured care would reduce renal complications in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 205 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients from nine public hospitals who had plasma creatinine levels of 150-350 μmol/l were randomly assigned to receive structured care (n = 104) or usual care (n = 101) for 2 years. The structured care group was managed according to a prespecified protocol with the following treatment goals: blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, A1C <7%, LDL cholesterol <2.6 mmol/l, triglyceride <2 mmol/l, and persistent treatment with renin-angiotensin blockers. The primary end point was death and/or renal end point (creatinine >500 μmol/l or dialysis). RESULTS - Of these 205 patients (mean ± SD age 65 ± 7.2 years; disease duration 14 ± 7.9 years), the structured care group achieved better control than the usual care group (diastolic blood pressure 68 ± 12 vs. 71 ± 12 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.02; A1C 7.3 ± 1.3 vs. 8.0 ± 1.6%, P < 0.01). After adjustment for age, sex, and study sites, the structured care (23.1%, n = 24) and usual care (23.8%, n = 24; NS) groups had similar end points, but more patients in the structured care group attained ≥3 treatment goals (61%, n = 63, vs. 28%, n = 28; P < 0.001). Patients who attained ≥3 treatment targets (n = 91) had reduced risk of the primary end point (14 vs. 34; relative risk 0.43 [95% CI 0.21- 0.86] compared with that of those who attained ≤2 targets (n = 114). CONCLUSIONS - Attainment of multiple treatment targets reduced the renal end point and death in type 2 diabetes. In addition to protocol, audits and feedback are needed to improve outcomes. © 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.

0034478254	Hypothyroidism presenting as hypercholesterolaemia and simvastatin-induced myositis	We report on a 50-year-old woman who presented with hypertension. She was given simvastatin for hypercholesterolaemia. The creatine kinase level was 3180 U/L at the 3-month follow-up visit, which was thought to be due to simvastatin treatment. Although treatment was discontinued, the creatine kinase level 4 months later remained higher than 3006 U/L. Echocardiography revealed mild pericardial effusion and normal left ventricular function; the electromyogram was also normal. The patient subsequently showed signs and symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, which was confirmed by measurements of the concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (>100 mU/L) and free thyroxine (<2 pmol/L). Thyroxine replacement therapy normalised the creatine kinase and cholesterol levels. This case illustrates the importance of excluding underlying causes of hypercholesterolaemia before contemplating lipid-lowering therapy.

0034795629	A low socio-economic status is an additional risk factor for glucose intolerance in high risk Hong Kong Chinese	To examine whether a low socio-economic status (SES) is an additional risk factor for glucose intolerance in Hong Kong Chinese with known risk factors for glucose intolerance, a total of 2847 Chinese subjects (473 men and 2374 women) were recruited from the community for assessment. They had known risk factors for glucose intolerance including a previous history of gestational diabetes, positive family history of diabetes in first degree relatives and equivocal fasting plasma glucose concentrations between 7 and 8 mmol/1 or random plasma glucose concentrations between 8 and 11 mmol/1. The 2847 subjects were classified according to their education levels and occupations: Education group 1 = high school or university, group 2 = middle school, group 3 = illiterate or up to elementary school; occupational group 1 = professional or managerial, group 2 = non-manual, group 3 = manual, group 4 = unskilled, group 5 = housewife or unemployed. Different socio-economic groups were well represented in this selected population. The distribution of educational groups in this study was similar to that recorded in the 1991 Hong Kong Census. When analysed according to education levels and after adjustment for age, women in the lowest social class had the highest prevalence of diabetes, body mass index, blood pressure and plasma glucose concentrations. Men with the lowest education level had the highest prevalence of diabetes after age adjustment. The age-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of having diabetes was 2.3 (1.3, 4.3) in female subjects and 2.5 (1.2, 5.4) in male subjects with the lowest SES compared to subjects with the highest SES. When categorised according to occupation and after adjustment for age, women in the lowest social class had the highest prevalence of diabetes and glycaemic indexes. The age-adjusted odds ratio of having diabetes was 4.5 (1.9, 10.9) in female subjects with the lowest SES compared to those with the highest SES. The corresponding age-adjusted odds ratio in male subjects was 1.9 (0.9, 3.9) but this was not statistically significant. In conclusion, a lower socio-economic class, categorised either by occupational or educational level, was an additional risk factor for diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese who had known risk factors for glucose intolerance. These subjects should have increased priority for health education and regular diabetes screening. Our findings further emphasise the complex relationships between societal affluence, personal income and educational level.

0034826914	Factors predicting the age when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed in Hong Kong Chinese subjects	OBJECTIVE - To examine the factors predicting age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The relationships between age at diagnosis and parental history of diabetes as well as an array of clinical and metabolic factors were examined using a hospital clinic-based diabetes registry involving 3,414 index patients with type 2 diabetes. Patterns of age at diagnosis in successive generations were also examined using 21 affected child-parent pairs and 7 affected child-parent-grandparent trios. RESULTS - Approximately 29% of the index patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at ≤35 years of age (hereby defined as early-onset). Compared with the patients diagnosed at >35 years of age (hereby defined as late-onset), the early-onset patients had higher rates of positive paternal (16 vs. 5%) and maternal (22 vs. 12%) history of diabetes (both at P < 0.01) and had poorer metabolic profiles.

0035133457	HLA typing and immunological characterization of young-onset diabetes mellitus in a Hong Kong Chinese population	Aims: A study of the Hong Kong Chinese showed that the majority of subjects with young-onset diabetes (age of diagnosis < 35 years) present with a phenotype suggestive of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, although up to 50% subsequently need insulin treatment. The aim of this study was to use a combination of clinical, genetic and immunological markers to characterize the disease phenotype further in such individuals and to determine whether the requirement for insulin is the result of autoimmune disease. Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven Hong Kong Chinese with young-onset diabetes were studied, irrespective of their mode of presentation. The subjects were typed for alleles of the HLA-DR and -DQ genes and investigated for the presence of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Plasma C-peptide concentration and requirement for insulin were also determined. Results: One hundred and three subjects presented with a syndrome resembling Type 2 diabetes, while 34 presented with Type 1 diabetes. Of the former group, 35 patients (34.0%) were insulin-deficient, 16 (15.5%) were insulin-treated and seven (6.9%) were positive for GAD autoantibodies. Among the GAD-positive subjects presenting with Type 2 diabetes, the HLA-DRB1*03 allele may be a marker of early progression to insulin therapy. Conclusions: Seven subjects with Type 2 diabetes at presentation had autoantibodies to GAD. Causes other than GAD autoimmunity, however, must be sought to explain the high prevalence of insulin deficiency observed in the Chinese patients. This study highlights the heterogeneity of the pathogenic processes leading to the diabetic phenotype.

77951573234	Effects of statins on progression of subclinical brain infarct	Background: Subclinical brain infarct (SBI) is associated with subsequent stroke and cognitive decline. A longitudinal epidemiological study suggests that statins may prevent development of SBI. We investigated the effects of statins upon development of brain infarct by performing a post-hoc analysis of the Regression of Cerebral Artery Stenosis (ROCAS) study. Methods: The ROCAS study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of simvastatin 20 mg daily upon progression of asymptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis among stroke-free individuals over 2 years. A total of 227 subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 114) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 113). The number of brain infarcts as detected by MRI was recorded at baseline and at the end of the study. The primary outcome measure was the number of new brain infarcts at the end of the study. Results: Among the 227 randomized subjects, 33 (14.5%) had SBI at baseline. At the end of the study, significantly fewer subjects in the active group (n = 1) had new brain infarcts compared with the placebo group (n = 8; p = 0.018). The new brain infarcts of subjects in the active group were subclinical. Among the placebo group, the new brain infarcts of 3 subjects were symptomatic while those of the remaining 5 subjects were subclinical. Among putative variables, multivariate regression analysis showed that only the baseline number of SBIs (OR = 6.27, 95% CI 2.4-16.5) and simvastatin treatment (OR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.82) independently predicted the development of new brain infarcts. Conclusions: Consistent with findings of the epidemiological study, our study suggests that statins may prevent the development of a new brain infarct. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

77957731525	Phaeochromocytoma in the Hong Kong Chinese population	Objective: To review the clinical manifestations of phaeochromocytoma in a Hong Kong Chinese population. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Five public hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients: Seventeen patients with operated phaeochromocytoma between 1994 and 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Six patients (35%) were men, 11 (65%) were women. The mean age at presentation was 47 (range, 17-72) years. The diagnosis post-presentation was delayed by 1 to 132 months. Over 70% of the patients had hypertension. The most frequent symptoms were headache (53%), palpitations (53%), and sweating (41%); all these symptoms were present in 24% of the patients. Four (24%) had hereditary phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndrome. The sensitivity of 24-hour urinary catecholamine measurements was 82%. Mean urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were respectively 7- and 8-fold greater than the upper reference limits. Computed tomography and metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy were the most widely used means for tumour localisation (sensitivity, 100% and 87% respectively). Approximately 65% of the patients had intraadrenal tumours; 53% were on right side, 18% were bilateral. All the patients were prescribed phenoxybenzamine (dosage range, 20-120 mg/day) preoperatively. Two thirds of the patients had improved blood pressure 1 year after the operation. No malignancy was reported after a mean follow-up period of 7 years. Conclusion: Our series of patients with phaeochromocytomas commonly had a high frequency of normotension and extra-adrenal tumours. A high index of clinical suspicion and appropriate biochemical investigations are necessary to make the diagnosis, especially for patients manifesting adrenal incidentaloma and extra-adrenal lesion.

7844250480	Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase in young Chinese diabetic patients	Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are a useful autoimmune marker for type 1 diabetes mellitus in Caucasians. We examined antibodies to GAD and their relationships with clinical features and pancreatic β cell function in 140 young Chinese diabetic patients. Over an 18-month period beginning in 1995, 140 young Chinese diabetic subjects with age of onset of disease ≤ 35 years and age < 40 years were recruited consecutively, irrespective of their modes of presentation. Clinical features, antibodies to GAD and pancreatic β cell function (using a glucagon stimulation test) were examined. Increased levels of antibodies to GAD (> 18 units) were detected in 12.1% (n = 17) of these subjects. Forty-three (31%) patients had a classical type 1 presentation and 65 (46%) patients were insulin-deficient based on post-glucagon plasma C-peptide levels. Patients who were insulin-deficient and had a type 1 presentation had the highest prevalence of antibodies to GAD (29.0%) compared with patients who had a type 2 presentation and were non-insulin deficient (6.4%, P = 0.003). Patients who had antibodies to GAD had lower body mass index and waist-hip ratio, earlier onset of disease, lower blood pressure, plasma triglyceride and C-peptide, and higher concentrations of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glycated haemoglobin, and were more likely to require drug treatment, compared with those without antibodies to GAD. In conclusion, there was a low prevalence of antibodies to GAD in Chinese young diabetic patients although such antibodies remained a relatively specific marker for insulin deficiency and acute presentation. Causes other than autoimmunity should be sought to explain the high prevalence of insulin deficiency in these young Chinese patients.

79551566313	Relationships among diabetic retinopathy, antioxidants, and glycemic control	Purpose. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide and affects ∼11% of the Hong Kong population. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common cause of vision loss in type 2 DM. Risk of DR is increased by poor glycemic control, elevated lipids, and blood pressure, but it is not possible to predict the development or progression of DR at an individual level. Increased oxidative stress is thought to play a role. The use of a wider biomarker profile incorporating biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress may aid identification of individuals at higher risk or at very early stages of developing DR. Methods. Four hundred twenty type 2 DM subjects without diabetic complications were investigated. Eyes were examined for DR and anterior and posterior ocular segment pathology. DR was graded according to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study criteria. Demographic data were collected. Traditional risk factors plus biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress in fasting blood and urine were determined. Results. Overall DR prevalence was 89%. No significant differences in any demographic measures or biomarkers were found among those subjects with different DR grades, or in those without DR. Significant correlations (p < 0.0001) between HbA1c and DNA damage, (ρ = 0.32) and fasting plasma glucose and DNA damage (ρ = 0.52) were seen. DNA damage was also significantly and inversely correlated (p < 0.0001) with both plasma ascorbic acid (ρ = -0.41) and plasma total antioxidant level (ρ = -0.21). Conclusions.DR prevalence was very high in this group, but no biomarker differences were seen in those with DR compared to those free of DR, or in those with different degrees of severity of DR. This group of 420 subjects is being followed up to investigate whether the extended biomarker profile at baseline is related to progression of and/or incident DR.

0036312257	Life-threatening diuretic-induced hyponatraemia: A review of seven patients	Seven patients were hospitalised with dizziness and deteriorating general condition. Tests for serum electrolytes revealed marked hyponatraemia in these patients. Diuretics taken by these patients for treatment of hypertension were suspected to be the major cause of the hyponatraemia, although other factors might have contributed. All seven patients recovered with cessation of the diuretics and sodium chloride supplement. As diuretics are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension and are commonly prescribed, we should be aware of this potentially life-threatening complication. Since hyponatraemia developed in our patients after a duration of treatment ranging from 2 days to 14 years, it is prudent to monitor serum electrolytes for patients on diuretic therapy, particularly during circumstances when patients have reduced salt intake or increased risk of electrolytes loss.

80051806740	First insulinization with basal insulin in patients with Type 2 diabetes in a real-world setting in Asia	Background: The First Basal Insulin Evaluation (FINE) Asia study is a multinational, prospective, observational study of insulin-naïve Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in Asia, uncontrolled (A1c≥8%) on oral hypoglycemic agents, designed to evaluate the impact of basal insulin initiation. Methods: Basal insulin was initiated with or without concomitant oral therapy and doses were adjusted individually. All treatment choices, including the decision to initiate insulin, were at the physician's discretion to reflect real-life practice. Results: Patients (n=2679) from 11 Asian countries were enrolled (mean [±SD] duration of diabetes 9.3±6.5years; weight 68.1±12.7kg; A1c 9.8±1.6%). After 6months of basal insulin (NPH insulin, insulin glargine, or insulin detemir), A1c decreased to 7.7±1.4%; 33.7% patients reached A1c <7%. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) decreased from 11.7±3.6 to 7.2±2.5mmol/L and 36.8% of patients reached FBG <6.1mmol/L. The mean daily insulin dose prescribed increased marginally from 0.18 to 0.23U/kg per day at baseline to 0.22-0.24U/kg per day at Month 6. Mean changes in body weight and reported rates of hypoglycemia were low over the duration of the study. Conclusions: Initiation of insulin therapy is still being delayed by approximately 9years, resulting in many Asian patients developing severe hyperglycemia. Initiating insulin treatment with basal insulin was effective and safe in Asian T2DM patients in a real-world setting, but insulin needs may differ from those in Western countries. © 2011 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84864696068	Tuberculous pericarditis presenting as massive haemorrhagic pericardial effusion	Tuberculous pericarditis is an exceedingly rare but a well-described extra-pulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis (TB) infection in Hong Kong. An 82-year-old woman with a known history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia was admitted for congestive heart failure. Routine echocardiographic study during admission revealed a massive pericardial effusion (∼4 cm in thickness) but with no tamponade effect. Pericardiocentesis was performed and 1.6 L of heavily blood stained fluid was drained. All tumour and auto-immune markers were unremarkable. A whole body positron emission tomography-computer tomography (PET-CT) scan was then performed and showed an increased fl uorodeoxyglucose uptake in the entire pericardium with no sources of possible malignancy identified. Rapid acid fast bacilli culture and Genprobe examination of the pericardial fluid then demonstrated the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis . She was started on anti-TB medications and tolerated them well. Follow-up echocardiographic study showed no re-accumulation of pericardial fluid. Copyright 2012 BMJ Publishing Group.

0037827278	Triglyceride, albuminuria and blood pressure are the major associations of non-fatal cardiovascular disease in Chinese type 2 diabetes	Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We studied risk factors for CVD in a cohort of Chinese type 2 diabetic patients recruited between July 1994 and August 1998. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) was defined as a history of: (i) confirmed coronary artery disease (with typical electrocardiographic changes or a positive exercise tolerance test) in patients under care of a cardiologist; (ii) documented myocardial infarction; or (iii) coronary interventions such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) was defined as any definite cerebral vascular event with or without residual neurological deficit. CVD was defined as a history of IHD or CVA. The study enrolled 3333 patients, including 1370 men (41.1%) and 1963 women (58.9%) of mean age 55.9±13.3 years (range, 16-91 years; median, 57 years). A total of 279 patients (8.4%) had CVD (including 4.1% with CVA, 4.9% with IHD, and 0.6% with both CVA and IHD). Men had an overall higher rate of CVD than women (10.1% vs. 7.1%, p=0.002). All cardiovascular diseases showed a progressive increase in prevalence with increasing age with the peak among those aged ≥60 years. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of age, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, lipid profiles, albuminuria, smoking and family history of diabetes on the risk of CVD. In women, age, systolic blood pressure and triglyceride level and in men, age and albuminuria, were predictive for CVD. In conclusion, 8.4% of Hong Kong Chinese type 2 diabetic patients being followed in a hospital out-patient setting have a history of established and confirmed cardiovascular disease. Age, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride and albuminuria were the major independent risk factors for non-fatal cardiovascular diseases.

0043245768	Middle cerebral artery stenosis in type II diabetic Chinese patients is associated with conventional risk factors but not with polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system genes	Background: Conventional and genetic risk factors have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke, and differences may explain the heterogeneity of disease presentation in different populations. In Chinese, middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis is the most commonly identified intracranial vascular lesion. The involvement of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) gene polymorphisms in this condition has not been determined. Objectives: To determine whether conventional and RAS genetic vascular risk factors are associated with MCA stenosis, asymptomatic Chinese type II diabetic patients with and without MCA stenosis matched for age, gender and diabetes duration were compared.

Study design: Descriptive analysis of a prospective cohort. Patients and methods: During a median 7-year observational period, 91 patients with type 2 diabetes and no cardiovascular or renal complications were monitored by a nurse and a diabetologist in a clinical trial setting according to a structured protocol. Another 81 patients with comparable clinical characteristics were monitored by generalists at the medical clinic in the same hospital. Clinical end points, defined as death and cardiovascular and renal events, were evaluated in 1997 by review of case records. Results: Patients receiving structured care had lower mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07, 0.65; P = .006) than the usual-care group, as well as a lower incidence of combined clinical end points (RR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.22, 0.84; P = .01). In the usual-care group, patients who had no monitoring of glycosylated hemoglobin or plasma lipid levels during the entire observational period (8.6%) had a 14.6-fold (P < .01) and 15.7-fold (P < .01) increased risk of death and combined clinical end points, respectively, compared with those who had at least one measurement (60.5%). Conclusion: Management by protocol-driven care model improved survival and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Definitive studies are required to confirm these findings and compare the cost effectiveness of these care models.

84893543354	Development and validation of the Chinese attitudes to starting insulin questionnaire (Ch-ASIQ) for primary care patients with type 2 diabetes	Objectives: To develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese questionnaire which assesses the barriers and enablers to commencing insulin in primary care patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes. Research Design and Method: Questionnaire items were identified using literature review. Content validation was performed and items were further refined using an expert panel. Following translation, back translation and cognitive debriefing, the translated Chinese questionnaire was piloted on target patients. Exploratory factor analysis and item-scale correlations were performed to test the construct validity of the subscales and items. Internal reliability was tested by Cronbach's alpha. Results: Twenty-seven identified items underwent content validation, translation and cognitive debriefing. The translated questionnaire was piloted on 303 insulin naïve (never taken insulin) Type 2 diabetes patients recruited from 10 government-funded primary care clinics across Hong Kong. Sufficient variability in the dataset for factor analysis was confirmed by Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (P<0.001). Using exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation, 10 factors were generated onto which 26 items loaded with loading scores > 0.4 and Eigenvalues >1. Total variance for the 10 factors was 66.22%. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was 0.725. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the first four factors were ≥0.6 identifying four subscales to which 13 items correlated. Remaining sub-scales and items with poor internal reliability were deleted. The final 13-item instrument had a four scale structure addressing: 'Self-image and stigmatization'; 'Factors promoting self-efficacy; 'Fear of pain or needles'; and 'Time and family support'. Conclusion: The Chinese Attitudes to Starting Insulin Questionnaire (Ch-ASIQ) appears to be a reliable and valid measure for assessing barriers to starting insulin. This short instrument is easy to administer and may be used by healthcare providers and researchers as an assessment tool for Chinese diabetic primary care patients, including the elderly, who are unwilling to start insulin. © 2013 Fu et al.

12944302104	An alarmingly high prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in Asian type 2 diabetic patients: The MicroAlbuminuria Prevalence (MAP) Study	Aim/hypothesis: Microalbuminuria represents the earliest clinical evidence of diabetic nephropathy and is a marker of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Its early detection allows the implementation of individualised and aggressive intervention programmes to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. There is limited information on the prevalence of microalbuminuria among hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients in Asia. Methods: This cross-sectional epidemiological study aimed to assess the prevalence of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria among consecutively screened hypertensive type 2 diabetic adult patients in 103 centres in 10 Asian countries or regions. Predictive factors for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were characterised using a stepwise logistic regression model. Results: A total of 6,801 patients were enrolled and 5,549 patients constituted the per-protocol population (patients with bacteriuria and haematuria were excluded). The prevalence of microalbuminuria was 39.8% (39.2-40.5; 95% CI) and the prevalence of macroalbuminuria was 18.8% (18.2-19.3; 95% CI). Only 11.6% of the patients had systolic and diastolic blood pressure below the 130/80 mm Hg target. In the multivariate analyses, the predictive factors for the presence of microalbuminuria were age, BMI, systolic blood pressure and ethnic origin. The highlighted predictive factors for the presence of macroalbuminuria were age, sex, ethnic origin, BMI, duration of diabetes, presence of diabetic complications, intake of diuretics, intake of calcium channel blockers, diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions/interpretation: The high prevalence (58.6%) of micro or macroalbuminuria observed in these patients is alarming and indicates an impending pandemic of diabetic cardiovascular and renal diseases in Asia with its potential economic consequences. © Springer-Verlag 2004.
