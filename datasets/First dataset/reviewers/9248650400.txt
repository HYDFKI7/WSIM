14744295411	Analysis of kinetic energy loss intensity in compound channels	The intense momentum transfer on the vertical interface between main channel and flood plain in a compound channel, makes its conveyance capacity decrease. To reflect the kinetic energy loss intensity in a compound channel, two new concepts, transverse kinetic energy correction coefficient (TKECC) and kinetic energy loss rate (KELR) are put forward for steady, mean and turbulent flow. Through the analysis of the mechanism of kinetic energy loss in compound channels, a conclusion is drawn that TKECC is larger than 1 and KELR is larger than 0 in compound channels. By analyzing the experimental data from Science and Engineering Research Council-flood Channel Facility (SERC-FCF), it is found that TKECC and KELR are both related to shapes of cross section. Kinetic energy loss becomes weaker with the increase of main channel side slope factor and becomes stronger with the increase of the ratio of main channel and flood plain width. Kinetic energy loss in a symmetric compound channel is stronger than that in an asymmetric one. For all the shapes of cross section, kinetic energy loss increases with the increase of the relative depth. After it reaches the largest value, it decreases with the increase of the relative depth, and the compound channel ultimately shows a characteristic of single channels.

14844358043	Computation of resistance coefficient and conveyance capacity in compound channels	Stage-discharge curves are particularly important in river basin management. For compound channel, it is difficult to produce the stage-discharge curve. In computing conveyance capacity, adopting either the single channel method or the conventional divided cross section method will result in enormous error. In this paper, a compound channel is divided into four sub-regions: the flood-plain-side-slope region, the flood-plain region, the main-channel-side-slope region and the main-channel region. By analyzing a large numbers of experimental data from the Science and Engineering Research Council Flood Channel Facility (SERC-FCF), the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient relationships among them are established. The experimental data from SERC-FCF show that the resistance coefficient in main-channel region is related to the relative depth (Dr), the ratio between the resistance coefficient in flood-plain region and that in main-channel region varies exponentially with Dr, and the resistance coefficients in flood-plain-side-slope region and the main-channel-side-slope region can be expressed by those of the flood-plain region and the main-channel region. Finally, by computing the discharge in every sub region on the basis of the resistance coefficient relationships, the total discharge can be obtained. The experimental data show that the computed discharge is in close agreement with the measured one.

17944362063	Stochastic nature of gravel bed load transport in Chuanjiang River	Bed load motion and its transport rate is one of the basic issues in river dynamics. The authors discuss the stochastic nature of bed load motion in Chuanjiang River. The characteristics of channel, hydrology and sediment in Chuanjiang River are introduced. Based on data analysis of gravel movement velocity and its sediment discharge measured in Chuanjiang River, it is found that the gravel not only has the characteristics of short movement distance, long cease time and low movement average velocity, but also its movement has very strong stochastic behavior and discontinuity. The reason for the stochastic nature and discontinuity of gravel movement has been analyzed. The gravel bed load transport rage also has very strong stochastic nature after studying its varying law within annual distribution and average annual distribution. In the meanwhile, the result also show that the section configuration and near watercourse characteristic has influenced gravel bed load transport rate.

17944367980	Comparison of methods predicting normal depth in compound channels	The normal depth plays an important role in hydraulic calculation. To a compound channel, when water in a main channel flows in an out-of-bank condition and onto the adjoining flood plain, it results in great error if the normal depth is calculated by the Manning equation. All kinds of methods predicting the normal depth in compound channels are systemically summarized in this paper. In all the methods, the normal depth is solved by the dichotomy method and compared with different series of experimental data from Engineering Research Council Flood Channel Facility. By comparison, it is found that the calculation precision is high with the methods considering momentum exchange between the main channel and the floodplain. According to the order from high precision to low, they are, in turn, the channel coherence method, the Liu Peiqing's method, the cross-sectional inclined division method, the momentum transfer method, the Xie Han-xiang's method, and the superposing cross section method. By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the methods mentioned above, it is pointed out that the channel coherence method is a good method in calculating the normal depth in natural rivers with compound cross section.

In this paper, various methods are used to calculate the discharge of the whole cross section and the discharge allocation between main channel and flood plain. All calculation results are compared with the experimental data from Science and Engineering Research Council Flood Channel Facility (SEREFCF). It is found that the precisions of Cross-Sectional Vertical Division Method, Single Channel Method and Equivalent Velocity Division Method are poor. Based on the comprehensive analysis for available methods, the authors suggest that it is preferably to use the Channel Coherence Method to calculate the flow capacity and analyze the discharge allocation of channels with compound cross section.

21844438722	Investigation of stochastic nature of bed load motion in Chuanjiang river	Bed load motion and its transport rate is one of the basic issues in river dynamics, the authors discussed the stochastic nature of bed load motion in Chuanjiang river. Chungjiang river lies in the upstream reach of Yangtze river. Its stochastic nature is shown in the following four aspects. Firstly, even though all the conditions are the same, due to the fluctuation of the flow, the bed load discharge and the location and width of sediment transport belts are different. Secondly, during the process of bed load motion, pebbles show the strong nature of intermittence. Thirdly, the sediment discharges through upstream and downstream reach are not equal, i.e. the pebble motion exists the discontinuity. Fourthly, annual mean transport rates of bed load for different stations are different and variation of transport rate of pebbles for a given station with year is large.

21844455293	Experimental study on flow patterns and width adjustment in self-formed channels	The distribution of velocity is one of the basic issues in river dynamics. Based on the experimental data measured by ADV in the flume of State Key Hydraulics Laboratory (SKHL), this paper analyzed the vertical distribution of point velocity and the varying law of turbulence intensity in straight mobile compound channel with an asymmetric floodplain. Above certain relative height, the streamwise point velocity follows the logarithmic distribution. Below the location, the velocity varies linearly approximately. For all discharges involved in experiments, the streamwise, lateral and vertical turbulence intensities bear the similarity. They increase with flow depth increasing. After they reach the maximum values, they decrease as flow depth increases. Furthermore, the bed configuration is measured for four discharges, respectively. During the course of width adjustment, the main channel deposits and its side slope and floodplain erode when clean water is supplied. By the analysis of the bed in stabilization, it is found that the shape of cross section follows the parabola distribution.

24744457086	Analysis on methods for predicting composite roughness of river channel with compound cross section	Experimental result and field observation data are used to check the validity of the currently used methods for predicting composite roughness of river channel including the Pavlovskij Method, Einstein-Bank Method, Lotter Method, Krishnamurthy-Christensen Method and Drasco-Hardegger Method. The comparison shows that the accuracies of the first four methods are poor and they are not suitable for predicting the roughness of river channel with compound cross section due to neglecting the momentum transformation. The last method cannot be used popularly since it is an empirical formula, in spite of the transfer of momentum is considered. Based on the data obtained an improved method for calculating the roughness of river having the same roughness in main channel and floodplain is proposed.

26644468851	Study on resistance coefficient in compound channels	This paper presents a further study of the Manning and Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficients, as they play a significant role in assessing the cross-sectional mean velocity, conveyance capacity and determining the lateral distribution of depth mean velocity and local boundary shear stress in compound channels. The relationships between the local, zonal and overall resistance coefficients, and a wide range of geometries and different roughness between the main channel and the flood plain are established by analyzing a vast amount of experimental data from a British Science and Engineering Research Council Flood Channel Facility (SERC-FCF). And the experimental results also show that the overall Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient for a compound channel is the function of Reynolds number, but the function relationship is different from that for a single channel. By comparing and analyzing the conventional methods with the experimental data to predict composite roughness in compound channels, it is found that these methods are not suitable for compound channels. Moreover, the reason why the conventional methods cannot assess correctly the conveyance capacity of compound channels is also analyzed.

27744469339	Turbulence characteristics of overbank flow in compound river channel with vegetated floodplain	The turbulence characteristic of overbank flow in compound river channel with vegetated floodplain was studied experimentally by model test. The shrubs, arbors and grasses were modeled by using plastic straws, feather and plastic grasses respectively. A 3-D ADV was used to measure the flow velocities. It is found that the distributions of fluctuating velocity in three directions obey the law of normal distribution. The time-averaged velocity is related to the sampling duration. If the floodplain is vegetated, the lateral exchange of momentum becomes intensive and the momentum is transferred from the main channel to its associated floodplain. The effects of different kinds of vegetation on turbulence are not the same. The turbulence intensity increases after the floodplain is vegetated. The lateral and vertical turbulence intensities are in the same order and follow the S-shape distribution law.

33744729707	Velocity distribution in compound channels with vegetated floodplains	The authors experimentally studied the velocity distribution of flows in different types of vegetation such as arbors, shrubs and grass. The experimental procedures and the principle of ADV for measuring the local velocities are described in detail. For vegetation on the floodplain, the authors chose plastic grass, duck feathers and plastic straws as model grass, model shrubs and model arbors, respectively. ADV was used to measure the local flow velocities for different types of vegetation on the floodplain, discharges and flume slopes. All measured streamwise velocities follow a logarithmic distribution for non-vegetated floodplain, and obey S-shaped distribution for vegetated floodplain. The S-shaped distribution divides the flow into three regions. The range of every region is related to the flow depth, lateral location and vegetation type. For different types of vegetation, the S-shaped distribution is different. In the meantime, it is found that the velocity in the main channel increases and that on the floodplain decreases after the floodplain is vegetated. The increasing or decreasing degree is related to vegetation type. Furthermore, the influences of bed slope on local velocity distribution for different types of vegetation are distinct.

33846419110	Flow patterns in compound channels with vegetated floodplains	Understanding the hydraulics of flow in a compound channel with vegetated floodplains is very important for determining the stage-discharge curve and for supporting the management of fluvial processes. In this paper, the flow patterns over different types of vegetation, such as tree, shrub, and grass, are described, based on an experimental study. For vegetation on the floodplain, the authors choose plastic grass, duck feathers, and plastic straws as model grass, shrubs, and trees, respectively. A 3D acoustic Doppler velocimeter was used to measure the local flow velocities for different types of vegetation on the floodplain, and the total discharge and flume slope were measured independently. In the cases of nonvegetated floodplains, all measured streamwise velocity distributions followed the logarithmic distribution, but for vegetated floodplains, they followed an S-shaped profile, exhibiting three zones. For all cases, the fluctuating velocity followed a normal distribution. The influence of different types of vegetation on the distributions of the secondary currents, turbulence intensities, and Reynolds shear stresses were also analyzed. © 2007 ASCE.

Many different representative methods for predicting the composite roughness were systematically summarized. Besides the measured data, a vast number of laboratory data and field data for compound channels were collected and used to check the validity of these methods for different subsection divisions including the vertical, horizontal, diagonal and bisectional divisions.

39749123923	Experimental study on flow resistance in compound channels with totally mobile bed	Understanding flow resistance in a compound channel with totally mobile bed is important for determining the stage-discharge curve and supporting the management of fluvial processes. The paper experimentally studies the characteristics of flow resistance for overbank flows in a compound channel with totally mobile bed composed of non-uniforme sediment, including the variation of energy loss and resistance coefficients along the channel after armoring is completed. The experimental results show that it is difficult to obtain uniform flow in this type channel. By analyzing the experimental data, it is found that water surface slope is largely different from energy slope for this type of channel. For this type of channel, under the given condition, the resistance coefficients don't keep constant, while they vary along the channel. The characteristics show that flow resistance in compound channels with totally mobile bed is more complex than that in compound channels with rigid bed. As a resistance, it is more difficult to predict conveyance capacity and sediment transport capacity in compound channels with totally mobile bed than in ones with rigid bed.

34248660533	Computation of momentum transfer coefficient and conveyance capacity in compound channels** ** Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 50579040, 50579041).	The momentum transfer coefficient is an important parameter for determining the apparent shear stress at the vertical interface between the main channel and its associated flood plains, the cross-sectional mean velocity and the discharge capacity in compound channels. In this article, under the Boussinesq assumption and through analyzing the characteristics of velocity distribution in the interacting region between the main channel and its associated flood plain, the expression of momentum transfer coefficient was theoretically derived. On the basis of force balance, the expression of vertical apparent shear stress was obtained. By applying the experimental data from the British Engineering Research Council Flood Channel Facility (SERC-FCF), the relationship between the momentum transfer coefficient with the relative depth and the ratio of the flood plain width to the main channel width, was established, And hence the conveyance capacity in compound channels was calculated with Liu and Dong's method.

The analytical solution to the transverse variation of depth-averaged velocity is presented that includes the effects of lateral momentum transfer and secondary flow in addition to bed friction. Different forms of boundary conditions at the internal wall between the rectangular main channel and the adjoining floodplain are presented. A comparison with the published experimental data demonstrates that the present model is capable of predicting the distributions of depthaveraged velocity and boundary shear stress. The results also indicate that the secondary flow and boundary conditions have influences on them. Finally, the key parameters in the model, such as the Darcy-Weisbach coefficient, the momentum transfer coefficient, and the secondary flow coefficient are also discussed and analyzed. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

It may give a regional picture of groundwater level with emphasis on the natural situation. Observation data from the primary network can be used to estimate the actual state of groundwater system. Since the cost of the installation and maintenance of a groundwater monitoring network is extremely high, the assessment of effectiveness of the network becomes very necessary. Groundwater level monitoring networks are the examples of discontinuous sampling on variables presenting spatial continuity and highly skewed frequency distributions. Anywhere in the aquifer, ordinary kriging provides estimates of the variable sampled and a standard error of the estimate. In this article, the average Kriging standard deviation was used as a criterion for the determination of network density, and the GIS-based approach was analysized. A case study of groundwater level network simulation in the Chaiwopu Basin, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, was presented. In the case study, the initial phreatic water observation wells were 18, a comparison of the three variogram parameters of the three defferent variogram models shows that the Gaussian model is the best. Finally, a network with 55 wells was constructed. © 2008 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.

Wenchuan earthquake is the largest earthquake in Longmen Mountain area as recorded in the historic documents.

Firstly, a correction of Probability Density Function (PDF) of hiding and exposure degree of uniform sediment was developed based on the geometric relation. Based on the method of probability theory combined with mechanics, the mean of sediment particle's force arm and the expression for the probability of incipient motion were derived.

The force arms of particles on the bed slope are assumed to be a function of the exposure degree, which is stochastically related to the size and gradation of bed materials. Based on this conception, the formula for the angle of repose of nonuniform sediment is developed. The angle of repose of nonuniform sediment is experimentally investigated in rotation drum at the rolling motion of sediment particles. The nonuniform sediment is gotten from the mixture of two kinds of uniform sediment with different weight ratios and two experimental plans that one for changing the weight ratio of two kinds of uniform sediment from 1:9 to 9:1 and the other changing the uniform sediment size and weight ratio are used. The effect of the rotation speed and the filling degree on the angle of repose is investigated, too. Finally, the formula has been tested against a wide range of laboratory data, the prediction by the newly proposed formulas is very good. © 2009 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.

77952829279	Analysis of runoff in ungauged mountain watersheds in Sichuan, China using kinematic-wave-based GIUH model	Floods are one of the most common natural hazards occurring all around the world. However, the knowledge of the origins of a food and its possible magnitude in a given region remains unclear yet. This lack of understanding is particularly acute in mountainous regions with large degrees in Sichuan Province, China, where runoff is seldom measured. The nature of streamflow in a region is related to the time and spatial distribution of rainfall quantity and watershed geomorphology. The geomorphologic characteristics are the channel network and surrounding landscape which transform the rainfall input into an output hydrograph at the outlet of the watershed. With the given geomorphologic properties of the watershed, theoretically the hydrological response function can be determined hydraulically without using any recorded data of past rainfall or runoff events. In this study, a kinematic-wave-based geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph (KW-GIUH) model was adopted and verified to estimate runoff in ungauged areas. Two mountain watersheds, the Yingjing River watershed and Tianquan River watershed in Sichuan were selected as study sites. The geomorphologic factors of the two watersheds were obtained by using a digital elevation model (DEM) based on the topographic database obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission of US's NASA. The tests of the model on the two watersheds were performed both at gauged and ungauged sites. Comparison between the simulated and observed hydrographs for a number of rainstorms at the gauged sites indicated the potential of the KW-GIUH model as a useful tool for runoff analysis in these regions. Moreover, to simulate possible concentrated rainstorms that could result in serious flooding in these areas, synthetic rainfall hyetographs were adopted as input to the KW-GIUH model to obtain the flow hydrographs at two ungauged sites for different return period conditions. Hydroeconomic analysis can be performed in the future to select the optimum design return period for determining the flood control work. © 2010 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77955498816	Study on bed load transport for uniform sediment in laminar flow	Previous studies focused on the bed load transport rate for the condition of turbulent flow, while the knowledge of sediment transport in laminar flow is very limited. As an extreme case to reflect the viscous effect on sediment transport, sediment transport in laminar flow is considered in this paper. There are at least two factors affecting the transport rate of sediment under laminar flow conditions: (1) fluid forces; (2) particle to particle interactions. Together, these two factors represent the physical transport system. First, an exposure degree Probability Density Function (PDF) is developed to explore how the transport rate can be associated with characteristics of laminar flow and this factor reflects the particle to particle interactions, and the pickup probability equation in the absence of turbulence is developed based on the stochastic approach which reflects the exposure degree influence. Then, the formulas to calculate the critical shear stress of incipient motion and the bed load transport rate of fine uniform sediment are established. The derivation is made mainly based on Einstein's bed load theory; we choose Einstein's equation to model this system because we believe that the probabilistic approach taken is an appropriate way to account for the spatial and temporal variations in the forces causing sediment transport. These formulas have been tested against a wide range of existing laboratory data and compared with other existing empirical or semiempirical methods. The predictions by these newly proposed formulas are very good. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The relations, proposed recently by Yang, for the probability of fractional incipient motion and for the average velocity of particle motion are introduced to bedload formula. Plenty of experimental data for the bedload transport rate of uniform sediment are used to determine parameters. The theoretical bedload formula for any fraction of nonuniform sediment possesses several advantages, including a clear physical concept, a strict mathematical derivation, and a self-adaptability to uniform sediment. The formula is verified with experimental data expressing the transport of nonuniform sediment under full motion in laboratory flume. The result shows that the experimental observations agree well with the predicted fractional bedload transport rates. © 2011 IEEE.

79959667383	Theoretical study on stochastic model of sediment interchanges	Four motion states are supposed by Han: stationary, rolling, jumping and suspension. The step motion and unit motion are introduced as the fundamental concept of stochastic model. The unit motion consists of several steps of the same motions. For a long time, Markov process with discrete states and time is used to describing sediment interchanges near the flow bottom. Therefore, the transport process is a Markov process with discrete states and continuous time. On the basis of the Han's one-step movement transition probability of Markov with discrete states and time, the author obtains the transition law of the interchanges between various movement states of sediments with continuous time. The analysis of stationary distribution shows that the model can be applied to describe the general case for the sediment interchange process. Finally, the application of transition probability with continuous time to nonequilibrium transportation rate of bed load is discussed. This study demonstrates that the concept of transition probability with continuous time is a useful approach for sediment research. © 2011 IEEE.

84871410341	Analytical models for overbank flows in meandering channels with vegetated floodplains	The velocity distribution in a meandering compound channel with vegetated floodplain was very important for determining sediment transport, channel process and bank protection. The lateral distribution of depth-averaged velocity in meandering vegetated compound channels was studied. For the streamwise momentum equation, the drag force due to vegetation was added to it as a momentum sink term. And three different integral forms of turbulent diffusion term were considered and three analytical solutions to depth-averaged velocity were obtained. The effects of sinuosity and secondary flows were also taken into account. The series of experimental data of UK-FCF were used to examine the three models, and the results indicated that using the optimum K values in each panel, the proposed model could predict velocity distribution better than the earlier method which ignored the secondary flow effects on floodplain. The K values in the main channel increased significantly after the floodplain was vegetated. The predictions of three models were almost the same on the floodplain and the differences were mainly in the main channel. On a whole, the model has the best agreement with experimental data.

84874816984	Application of shiono and knight method to compound open channel flow with one-line emergent vegetation	A quasi two-dimensional model was developed to calculate depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress in a straight compound channel with one-line emergent vegetated at the floodplain edge. Reduction in volume of water due to vegetation is modelled as porosity. Drag force due to vegetation is modelled as an additional momentum source term in the Navier-Stokes equation. Estimation methods for model parameters-friction factor, roughness height due to drag force, porosity, eddy viscosity and advection term-are discussed. The predictive capability of the model is assessed against experimental data with regard to distributions of depth-averaged velocity and boundary shear stress. The results show that the quasi 2D model well reproduces a reasonable simulation of the flow field under relative water depths of 0.24 and 0.52. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84876083244	Study on stochastic distribution of nonuniform gravel bedload transport	The variation process of non-uniform gravel bedload movement was measured in a natural-scale laboratory channel with steady flow. Using the channel, the bedload transport process with the series of high accuracy and long time was sampled and described by Γ distribution. When the sampling duration is shorter, the process of bedload transport rate per unit width and its lateral distribution both show stochastic features. However, with the sampling duration increasing, although the process of bedload transport rate per unit width is still stochastic, its lateral distribution approaches stable. And the probability density of bedload transport rate per unit width follows the Γ distribution, and the values of α and β increase with sampling duration and dimensionless shields parameter increasing. By using the present experimental data and regressing them, α and β are formulated in terms of sampling duration and dimensionless shields parameter. The research results may provide support for practical engineering.

84876087703	Two-dimensional analytical solutions to depth-averaged velocity in compound channels with overbank flows	The lateral distribution of the secondary flow coefficient K, has been obtained in terms of the depth-averaged product of the streamwise and transverse velocities (UV)d and the square of the depth-averaged velocity U 2 d. According to the relationship between (UV)d and U 2 d, two parameters, a and b, were introduced to reflect the secondary flows and then new two-dimensional analytical solutions were presented. The structure of solutions shows that parameter b only existed in the linearly varied domain. It should be noticeable that rotational direction of secondary flows was presented by a and its intensity was decided by the values of a and b. The sensitive analysis of two coefficients had been undertaken, indicating that good prediction could be presented by specified appropriate a values in each panel and the effect of b for velocity was mainly in the main channel and the floodplain side slope domains. The experimental data of UK-FCF were used to verify this analytical model, showing that good agreements were obtained. Meanwhile, the values of a and b in compound channels with different cross sections were discussed.

84876089676	Experimental investigation on the maximum bed-load transport rate during the process of armoring layer destruction	The relationship between bed-load transport rate and flow intensity was discussed. Armoring layer destruction experiments were carried out in natural channel with clear-water scour. The results showed that dimensionless transport rate strength, corresponding to the maximum bed-load transport rate, increases with flow intensity and the increasing speed is faster than the calculated results by Meyer-Peter formula, Bagnold formula, and Engelong formula. Using the same forms of Meyer-Peter formula, through regression the relationship between dimensionless transport rate strength, corresponding to the maximum bed-load transport rate, and flow intensity during the process of clear-water scour and armoring layer destruction was established.

84876090018	Sediment transport nature and its simulation in fully mobile bed compound channels under the action of clear water	Sediment transport is one of the basic issues in the field of river dynamics. The sediment transport nature in fully mobile bed compound channels was experimentally studied under the action of clear water and then the method for modeling the sediment transport rate in the type of channels was proposed. The experimental results showed that the sediment transport rate first increases and then decreases with time. The median diameter of sediment first rapidly and then slowly increases with time, and finally approach the median diameter of the original bed material. According to the motion nature of sediment transport, the computational method for sediment transport rate in the type of channel was proposed. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis of parameters in the proposed method was undertaken. The computed results showed that the method can be capable of modeling the sediment transport in the processes of clear-water action.

84876094605	Modeling the velocity distribution in compound channels with vegetated floodplains based on the equivalent resistance	Compound channels composed of the main channel and its associated floodplains widely exist in natural rivers. When water in the main channel flows in an out-of-bank manner onto the adjoining floodplain, the flow structure is usually very complex. However, in natural rivers, floodplains and river banks are often home to many kinds of vegetation. Generally, such vegetation increases stabilization for banks and channels, but also increases the flow resistance and changes the velocity distribution and affects the discharge capacity. Hence, how to determine the velocity distribution and discharge become very important. In this paper, based on the equivalent balance of flow resistance, the equivalent additional resistance coefficient and equivalent composite resistance coefficient of vegetated channels are proposed. Then using the Shiono and Knight method (SKM) together with the proposed equivalent composite resistance method, the lateral distribution of depth-averaged velocity in compound channels with vegetated floodplains are determined. The results show that the computational method for composite resistance coefficient in the vegetated compound channel is feasible and can give good predictions for the velocity distribution for the type of channel, combining the SKM.

84878852209	Effection of boundary conditions to depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress in vegetated rectangular compound channels	The drag force of vegetation was introduced in the depth-averaged momentum equation and the analytical solutions of depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress were presented. Based on the feature of cross-section of vegetated rectangular compound channels, the force balance equation was built at the interface between main channel and floodplain and then two boundary conditions were carried out. The predicted results of these two boundary conditions were compared and their results were almost the same at a high relative flow height while some differences were in the shear layer at a low one. The continuity condition which contained the wall shear stress in the main channel provided better predictions. Finally, eight groups of experimental data were applied to verify the predicted ability of the better boundary condition. The results showed that optimal secondary flow coefficients in each domain result in much better lateral distributions of depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress, especially in main channels. Good predicted results can be obtained by choosing appropriate secondary flow coefficients in each case.

84880288647	The characteristics of secondary flows in compound channels with vegetated floodplains	The experiments were conducted in compound channels with vegetated floodplains for investigating the influence of vegetation types on the characteristics of secondary flows. In terms of the streamwise and transverse velocities and the depth-averaged velocity, the secondary flow coefficient, M, is proposed, with good physical meanings, and it may characterize the rotational direction and the intensity of the secondary currents. The experimental results show that, for the cases without vegetation and with grass, the rotational directions of the secondary flows are all anticlockwise while for the cases with shrubs, they are all changed to the clockwise direction in the whole cross-section. However, when trees are planted, the secondary flows rotate in the anticlockwise direction in the main channel and in the clockwise direction on the floodplain. In addition, for all cases, the intensities of the secondary currents on the floodplain are stronger than those in the main channel. © 2013 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.

84881625141	Parameter sensitivity of the velocity distribution model in compound channels with vegetated floodplains	Based on the local analysis method, the sensitivity of three parameters, drag coefficient, eddy viscosity coefficient and secondary flow coefficient, in Shiono and Knight Method (SKM) was studied. The sensitivity of the parameters to both cross section velocities and conveyance capacity were calculated. The results showed that the parameters of main channel are more sensitive than the flood plain. The parameters of main channel to cross section velocities are less sensitive than to the conveyance capacity, while the parameters of floodplain are just contrary to that. For SKM model, the secondary coefficient is nonnegligible to calculate both cross section velocities and conveyance capacity, and the selection of main channel parameters is more significant than floodplain for the accuracy of simulation results.

84883363487	Modeling depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress in compound channels with emergent and submerged vegetation	This paper presents an approach to modeling the depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress in compound channels with emergent and submerged vegetation. The depth-averaged equation of vegetated compound channel flow is given by considering the drag force and the blockage effect of vegetation, based on the Shiono and Knight method (1991) [40]. The analytical solution to the transverse variation of depth-averaged velocity is presented, including the effects of bed friction, lateral momentum transfer, secondary flows and drag force due to vegetation. The model is then applied to compound channels with completely vegetated floodplains and with one-line vegetation along the floodplain edge. The modeled results agree well with the available experimental data, indicating that the proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the lateral distributions of depth-averaged velocity and bed shear stress in vegetated compound channels with secondary flows. The secondary flow parameter and dimensionless eddy viscosity are also discussed and analyzed. The study shows that the sign of the secondary flow parameter is determined by the rotational direction of secondary current cells and its value is dependent on the flow depth. In the application of the model, ignoring the secondary flow leads to a large computational error, especially in the non-vegetated main channel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84892536009	Evolution characteristics of compound fluvial channels with totally movable-bed under clear water	The evolution characteristics of compound fluvial channels with totally movable-bed that was made of non-uniform sediment were studied experimentally under clear water. They include the variations of stabilized width and bank erosion along the channel after the riverbed is roughened completely. Before the experiments, the compaction of sand was finished by slowly flowing water. After the whole self-formed channel was submerged for some time, the water was discharged slowly; then, the movable-bed channel was restored. The original and eroded bed surface levels were probed by using a total station and the discharge and water levels were measured by a triangular weir and automatic water level meter, respectively. The results show that with increasing deposition of sediment, the flow depth in the main channel becomes shallow, leading to the force under which sediment particles start to move is decreased. When the channel becomes stabilized, the channel width varies along the channel. After the riverbed is roughened totally, the width of the main channel is increased and the retreat rate of river bank becomes small along the channel. Under the action of clear water, the floodplain and bank of the main channel are eroded and the eroded area decreases along the channel. This is consistent with decrease in the cross-section averaged velocity along the channel.

84893875922	Modeling overbank flows in compound channel with one-line vegetation	Based on the Shiono and Knight method(SKM) and the secondary flow motion characteristics, the determination of the lateral distribution of depth-averaged velocity in compound channels with one-line vegetation along the edge of the floodplain was proposed. The results showed that there is large disagreement between the computed results and the experiment data, especially in the main channel, when the secondary flow is ignored. When using the traditional divisions of sub-region, the prediction doesn't largely agree with the experiment data. However, the results showed that by considering the effect of secondary flow, increasing the division of sub-regions and adjusting the available parameters for each region, the proposed method can be capable of predicting the lateral distributions of depth-averaged velocity in this type of channel.

84896283886	Stage-discharge prediction in compound channels	The failure of conventional methods for discharge prediction in compound channels results from their ignorance of the loss in conveyance arising from the complicated flow interaction between the main channel and its associated floodplains. In this paper, a new method is presented for assessing the stage-discharge relationship and the discharge distribution in compound channels by considering both the momentum transfer between the upper and lower main channel flows and that between the upper main channel and its adjoining floodplain flows. A calibration using data from the laboratory channels and three natural rivers demonstrates that the presented method can give predictions that agree better with the experimental and field data. The computed results also show that the method not only is well capable of predicting the discharge distributions of the floodplain and the whole main channel, but also of predicting the discharge distribution in the lower main channel. In addition, the momentum transfer coefficient introduced in the presented method is also further discussed. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84900495798	Experimental study on rheological properties factors of debris flow slurry	This experimental study made tests on debris flow slurry of particle size below 0.5 mm with an Anton Paar Physica MCR301 rheometer. Factors of the rheological properties of debris flow were analyzed by using data series of slurry tests on different clay contents in three shear modes. Results show that under a fixed shear rate, an increase in coarse particles content or clay content will cause an increase in shear stress and that in the case of high concentration of coarse particles, the influence of the coarse particle content on shear stress exceeds that of the clay. The continuous increasing in shear stress under a fixed shear rate reveals a feature of slurry structure, that is, its anti-thixotropic changes over time. The clay's nature has some effects on the rheological properties of debris flow. © Copyright.

Based on the minimum active hypothesis proposed by Dou Guoren, continuity equation, momentum equation of flow with Meyer-Peter bedload formula, the hydraulic geometry formula for the channel with vegetation was proposed with the consideration of the effect of vegetation on the slope roughness, stability factor of slop and the intensity of sediment transport. Then using the sanded glass flume to simulate shifting bed straight channel, a series of data on hydraulic geometry with rigid vegetation and no vegetation were obtained. The comparison of the calculated data with the experiments and the difference between the hydraulic geometry with vegetation and that without vegetation, showed that the present formula is capable of well modeling the hydraulic geometry.

84907657470	An analytical model for lateral depth-averaged velocity distributions along a meander in curved compound channels	This paper presents an analytical method for modeling the lateral depth-averaged velocity distribution along a half-meander in a curved compound channel. An equation is derived from the momentum equation and the flow continuity equation which contains a velocity term with both streamwise velocity variation and lateral secondary flow variation. A velocity variation parameter is proposed in the main channel and on the floodplain for a series of test sections. To study the validity of these equations experiments were conducted in a large scale meandering compound channel at Sichuan University, China. Based on the experimental data, the generation mechanism of secondary flow in the main channel along half a meander is analyzed. It is shown that the secondary current is enhanced by the centrifugal force and the floodplain flow. Due to the discontinuity of the flow depth and the effect of meandering in the main channel flow, a region divided method is adopted. A new boundary condition is proposed by introducing the angle between the main channel flow and the floodplain flow, and it is shown that this gives better modeling results in cross-over sections. The modeling results indicate that the proposed method, which uses the new boundary condition and includes both the streamwise velocity variation and the lateral secondary flow variation, can model the lateral depth-averaged velocity distributions more accurately. Finally, variations in the velocity term between the main channel and floodplain are discussed and analyzed.

84916200550	Predictive model for stage-discharge curve in compound channels with vegetated floodplains	The governing equation of the discharge per unit width, derived from the flow continuity equation and the momentum equation in the vegetated compound channel, is established. The analytical solution to the discharge per unit width is presented, including the effects of bed friction, lateral momentum transfer, drag force, and secondary flows. A simple but available numerical integral method, i.e., the compound trapezoidal formula, is used to calculate the approximate solutions of the sub-area discharge and the total discharge. A comparison with the published experimental data from the U. K. Flood Channel Facility (UK-FCF) demonstrates that this model is capable of predicting not only the stage-discharge curve but also the sub-area discharge in the vegetated compound channel. The effects of the two crucial parameters, i.e., the divided number of the integral interval and the secondary flow coefficient, on the total discharge are discussed and analyzed.

10644222719	Nonlinear study of conveyance capacity in compound channels	The conventional methods cannot correctly predict discharge in a compound channel. Aiming at the shortcoming, the paper adopts system dynamics method to study the conveyance capacity. By analyzing a vast number of experimental data from Science and Engineering Research Council Flood Channel Facility (SERC-FCF), it is found that the ratio of the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficients between on the flood plain and in the main channel decreases with the increase of the relative depth. The resistance coefficient in the main channel varies with the relative depth and follows the paraboloidal distribution. On the basis of the resistance coefficient relationships obtained, applying system dynamics method, the authors established the system dynamics model of conveyance capacity when water flows in an out-of-bank manner and onto the adjoining flood plain. The model gives the relationship between stage and discharge. There is a good agreement with modeled and experimental values. The absolute values of the relative errors of discharge are only about 3%.
