84929136433	A novel glycated hemoglobin A1c-lowering traditional Chinese medicinal formula, identified by translational medicine study	Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that has a significant impact on the health care system. The reduction of glycated hemoglobin A1c is highly associated with the improvements of glycemic control and diabetic complications. In this study, we identified a traditional Chinese medicinal formula with a HbA1c-lowering potential from clinical evidences. By surveying 9,973 diabetic patients enrolled in Taiwan Diabetic Care Management Program, we found that Chu-Yeh-Shih-Kao-Tang (CYSKT) significantly reduced HbA1c values in diabetic patients. CYSKT reduced the levels of HbA1c and fasting blood glucose, and stimulated the blood glucose clearance in type 2 diabetic mice. CYSKT affected the expressions of genes associated with insulin signaling pathway, increased the amount of phosphorylated insulin receptor in cells and tissues, and stimulated the translocation of glucose transporter 4. Moreover, CYSKT affected the expressions of genes related to diabetic complications, improved the levels of renal function indexes, and increased the survival rate of diabetic mice. In conclusion, this was a translational medicine study that applied a "bedside-to-bench" approach to identify a novel HbA1c-lowering formula. Our findings suggested that oral administration of CYSKT affected insulin signaling pathway, decreased HbA1c and blood glucose levels, and consequently reduced mortality rate in type 2 diabetic mice. © 2014 Lo et al.

19344369028	Morin inhibits 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced hepatocellular transformation via activator protein 1 signaling pathway and cell cycle progression	Flavonoids are constituents of fruits, vegetables, and plant-derived beverages, as well as components in herbal containing dietary supplements. They exhibit a remarkable spectrum of biochemical and pharmacological activities. In this study, we examined morin (3,5,7,2′,4′-pentahydroxyflavone) for its effect on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated human hepatocytes. Morin inhibited TPA-induced cellular transformation in Chang liver cells in a dose-dependent manner. Luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that morin suppressed TPA-induced AP-1 activity, and the inhibition of AP-1 activity by morin was mediated through the inhibition of p38 kinase. Moreover, morin induced the S-phase arrest and inhibited the DNA synthesis in TPA-treated hepatocytes, suggesting that a cell cycle checkpoint was activated by morin to block DNA synthesis in S phase. In conclusion, our results suggested that morin was a potent anti-hepatocellular transformation agent that inhibited cellular transformation by suppressing the AP-1 activity and inducing the S-phase arrest in human hepatocytes. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

0030070925	Rapid screening of pseudorabies virus-specific cDNAs from a cDNA library	In order to reduce the time and cost for screening of pseudorabies virus (PRV)-specific cDNAs, a rapid and inexpensive method was developed that involved subtractive hybridization of the plasmid, which contained cDNA fragment, to PRV genomic DNA which was bound to nylon membranes. Ninety percent of DNA background was subtracted successfully by this method and the eluted DNA in the form of plasmid could be used to transform bacteria directly. Applying this technique, 200 colonies were screened from a cDNA library containing 30 000 colonies. Furthermore, 17 colonies containing PRV- specific cDNAs, including PRV43, UL42, gII, DNase, EP0, 11K, gX, and RSP40, were identified from the 200 colonies by colony hybridization, Southern hybridization, and DNA sequencing. This, the subtractive hybridization can be used to construct and successfully establish the PRV cDNA library from PRV- infected cells.

0030600470	Identification of a pseudorabies virus UL12 (deoxyribonuclease) gene	We characterized the gene encoding the pseudorabies virus (PrV) homologue of the herpes simplex virus 1 UL12 open reading frame that encodes the alkaline nuclease. The deduced PrV UL12 product was 492 amino acid residues and exhibited three conserved regions among herpesviruses. Northern blot analysis indicated that three transcripts (3.2, 1.6 and 1 kb) were encoded in this region and the UL12 corresponds to the 1.6-kb transcript. Primer extension and UL12-specific cDNA cloning were performed to verify the precise location of the UL12 transcript. These data indicated that the transcription start site of UL12 was located at 47-62 nucleotides upstream of the UL12 translation start site and the polyadenylation cleavage site was located at 15 or 16 nucleotides downstream the typical polyadenylation signal. Furthermore, the 53-kDa UL12 product, which indeed has deoxyribonuclease activity, was evidenced by in vitro expression.

0030273514	Analysis of upregulated cellular genes in pseudorabies virus infection: Use of mRNA differential display	Virus infection usually alters the host cell and shuts off the synthesis of cellular macromolecules. In order to screen the upregulated cellular transcripts during pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection, we employed the mRNA differential display technique. The screen is based on positive selection at the mRNA level for genes expressed in normal cells but increased in corresponding PRV-infected cells. Over 14 000 species of mRNA, isolated from mock-infected and PRV-infected Madin-Darby bovine kidney cell at 1 h post infection, were screened, and 40 candidate clones were recovered. Southern blot analysis revealed that 17 out of 40 candidate clones, were enhanced in PRV-infected cells. Partial DNA sequences demonstrated that 17 clones were distinct cellular genes, including those encoding the modulators of signal transduction (saposin, 14-3-3, adenylate kinase, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase C-α), those encoding the components of translation (fau, ribosomal proteins S11, L31, L36), other cellular genes (peptidase, cyclin E, rch1, oligo-C-rich single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein, rap, arginyl-tRNA synthetase), and two unknown genes. Thus, this study identifies successfully the transcriptionally regulated cellular genes which are associated with PRV infection. Furthermore, this study provides support for the use of mRNA differential display as a method to rapidly isolate differentially expressed genes in virus infection.

0030720301	Stimulation of type I DNA topoisomerase gene expression by pseudorabies virus	Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that type I DNA topoisomerase activity is required for the replication and gene expression of pseudorabies virus (PRV). In the present report, we further analyzed the expression of topoisomerase I in PRV-infected cells, and the western blot result showed that the expression of topoisomerase I was increased after virus infection. The increase sustained to late time of infection when the cytopathic effect was obvious and the synthesis of most host proteins was shut off by PRV. From transient expression assay, it was also found that the promoter of cellular topoisomerase I gene could be stimulated by immediate-early protein (IE180) and viral early protein 0 (EP0), and these two regulatory proteins appeared to work synergistically. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that PRV can stimulate the expression of topoisomerase I and that the stimulation is mediated at least by IE180 and EP0 proteins of PRV at the transcriptional level.

0031909401	DNA vaccination induces a long-term antibody response and protective immunity against pseudorabies virus in mice	In order to investigate the mechanism of long-term immunity and the effect of protective immunity induced by DNA vaccination, we constructed the expression plasmid containing a pseudorabies virus (PRV) gD gene encoding an envelope glycoprotein. Intramuscular vaccination of mice with the plasmid DNA induced a strong antibody response which lasted for one year after final vaccination. An IgM to IgG class switch occurred, indicating helper T-lymphocyte activity. We further analyzed the persistence and expression of gD gene by polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that gD gene was present and expressed in the muscle cell up to one year after final booster injection. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with the plasmid DNA were protected against a subsequent lethal challenge with PRV. Therefore, the DNA vaccination does induce a protective immunity and long-term antibody response against PRV, which could be maintained by persistent expression of gD gene in muscle cells.

0032128404	Identification, expression, and characterization of the pseudorabies virus DNA-binding protein gene and gene product	The pseudorabies virus (PRV) gene encoding a DNA-binding protein (DBP) was first identified in this study. The DBP gene has an open reading frame of 3531 nucleotides, capable of coding a 1177-amino-acid polypeptide of 125 kDa. The deduced DBP exhibits a conserved zinc-binding motif and a conserved DNA-binding region, suggesting the similar DNA-binding mechanism occurs among alphaherpesviral DBP homologs. To further identify the biochemical properties of PRV DBP, this protein was expressed in Escherichia coli by using a pET expression vector and purified to homogeneity. The PRV DBP binds cooperatively and preferentially to single-stranded DNA with no significant base preference, judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and competitive nitrocellulose filter binding assays. Taken together, these results suggest that PRV DBP may play an important role in PRV DNA replication by binding cooperatively and nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA that is formed during the replication origin unwinding and replication fork movement.

2542487451	Activation of activator protein-1 in cells exposed to electrical stimulation of various parameters used in electroacupuncture therapy	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of electrical stimulation on activator protein-1 (AP-1) in recombinant liver cells. In order to elucidate the molecular effects of electrical stimulation on cells, AP-1 expression was detected by a luciferase assay. The parameters used were taken from clinical electroacupuncture (EA) therapy as follows: biphasic rectangular symmetrical pulses (frequency: 2, 10 and 100 Hz; pulse width: 50, 80, 130 and 250 μsec; intensity: 1, 2, 5 and 10 mA; time: 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes). S (10% fetal bovine serum in medium), SF (serum free medium) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment represented the experimental, negative and positive groups, respectively. We found that electrical stimulation with 10 Hz, a pulse width of 130 μsec, and a duration of 30 minutes gave a significant increase in AP-1 activity. In contrast, the intensity of the stimulation had no significant effect on AP-1 activity. In conclusion, our data suggest that electrical stimulation with an appropriate frequency, duration and pulse width could cause an increase in AP-1 activity in cells. © 2003 World Scientific Publishing Company & Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

27144491086	A novel loss-of-function deletion in sodium/iodide symporter gene in follicular thyroid adenoma	The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) actively transports iodide into thyrocytes. However, in thyroid carcinoma, down-regulated or mis-targeted NIS expression is commonly found and usually correlates with tumor dedifferentiation and loss of radioiodine uptake capacity. In this study, we screened NIS genes of thyroid tumor tissues from three patients with thyroid carcinoma by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. We found a novel exon 6 deletion in NIS gene. We then examined the NIS gene from the blood of this patient. The nucleotide sequences of the flanking region of exon 6 were normal. By transient transfection and I-125 uptake assay, we found that the wild type NIS-expressing HepG2 cells accumulated six times more iodide than mutant and mock HepG2 cells. Our data demonstrated that the exon 6 deletion causes an iodide-trapping defect. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

27744437536	Acetaldehyde-induced interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α production is inhibited by berberine through nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway in HepG2 cells	Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the most common liver diseases in the world. Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), have been correlated with the patients affected by ALD. However, the direct effect of alcohol in the induction of IL-1β and TNF-α has not been clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that acetaldehyde, the metabolic product of ethanol, was able to induce IL-1β and TNF-α production in HepG2 cells. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), the transcription factor involved in the regulation of cytokine production, was also activated by acetaldehyde through inhibitory κB-α (IκB-α) phosphorylation and degradation. However, the NF-κB inhibitors, such as aspirin, cyclosporin A and dexamethasone, inhibited both the acetaldehyde-induced NF-κB activity and the induced cytokine production. Therefore, these data suggested that acetaldehyde stimulated IL-1β and TNF-α production via the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway. By screening 297 controlled Chinese medicinal herbs supervised by Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy at Taiwan, we found that Coptis chinensis (Huang-Lien) and Phellodendron amurense (Huang-Po) were capable of inhibiting acetaldehyde-induced NF-κB activity. Berberine, the major ingredient of these herbs, abolished acetaldehyde-induced NF-κB activity and cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, its inhibitory ability was through the inhibition of induced IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation. In conclusion, we first linked the acetaldehyde-induced NF-κB activity to the induced proinflammatory cytokine production in HepG2 cells. Our findings also suggested the potential role of berberine in the treatment of ALD. © 2005 National Science Council.

31444441306	Design and biological activities of novel inhibitory peptides for SARS-CoV spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

Therefore, we assayed the inhibitory effects of small peptides derived from S protein on the binding of S protein to ACE2 and on the S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus infectivity. SP-4 (residues 192-203), SP-8 (residues 483-494), and SP-10 (residues 668-679) significantly blocked the interaction between S protein and ACE2 by biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with IC

33845618023	Gastrodia elata modulated activator protein 1 via c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway in kainic acid-induced epilepsy in rats	Gastrodia elata (Orchidaceae) is a Chinese herb. Our previous study showed that Gastrodia elata is able to reduce epileptic seizures, oxygen free radicals, microglia activation, and apoptosis in kainic acid (KA)-treated rats. Activator protein 1 (AP-1) is involved in modulating the neuronal plasticity and apoptosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of AP-1 in antiepileptic effect of Gastrodia elata. Gastrodia elata (0.5, 1.0 g/kg) or valproic acid (VA, 250 mg/kg) was administered orally in Sprague-Dawley rats for 1 week before and 2 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of KA. Protein levels of AP-1 were determined by measuring c-Jun and c-Fos proteins, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases activations were determined by measuring the phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of rat brain using Western blotting. These results indicated that pre-treatment with Gastrodia elata or VA activated JNK signal pathway and c-Jun expression, while post-treatment with Gastrodia elata or VA suppressed both the JNK signaling pathway and the c-Jun expression induced by KA. These findings suggested that Gastrodia elata regulated the AP-1 expression via the JNK signaling pathway in KA-induced epilepsy. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

34250866723	Acetaldehyde induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene expression via nuclear factor-κB and activator protein 1 signaling pathways in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells: Association with the invasive potential	Alcohol consumption is a significant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alcohol also increases the prevalence of invasion in HCC patients. However, the molecular mechanism on the metastatic effect of alcohol is unclear so far. Herein we demonstrated that acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol, increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gelatinolytic activity and promoted cell invasion through the up-regulation of MMP-9 gene transcription in HepG2 cells. The transcription of MMP-9 gene was regulated by 10 μM acetaldehyde via inductions of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) activities. Acetaldehyde stimulated the translocation of NF-κB into nucleus through inhibitory κB-α (IκB-α) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) signaling pathways. Acetaldehyde also induced AP-1 activity via the phosphorylation of p38 kinase. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated for the first time that acetaldehyde activated NF-κB and AP-1 activities via IκB, JNK/β-TrCP, and p38 signaling pathways, resulting in MMP-9 gene expression and hepatocarcinoma cells invasion. These results suggested that acetaldehyde might be a potential factor involved in the invasiveness of HCC in alcoholic patients. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

34548206790	Berberine suppresses inflammatory agents-induced interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α productions via the inhibition of IκB degradation in human lung cells	Pulmonary inflammation is a characteristic of many lung diseases. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), have been correlated with lung inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that various inflammatory agents, including lipopolysaccharide, 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, hydrogen peroxide, okadaic acid and ceramide, were able to induce IL-1β and TNF-α productions in human lung epithelial cells (A-549), fibroblasts (HFL1), and lymphoma cells (U-937). Berberine, the protoberberine alkaloid widely distributed in the plant kingdom, was capable of suppressing inflammatory agents-induced cytokine production in lung cells. Inhibition of cytokine production by berberine was dose-dependent and cell type-independent. Moreover, the suppression of berberine on the cytokine production resulted from the inhibition of inhibitory κB-α phosphorylation and degradation. In conclusion, our findings suggested the potential role of berberine in the treatment of pulmonary inflammation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34547700235	Noninvasive nuclear factor-κB bioluminescence imaging for the assessment of host-biomaterial interaction in transgenic mice	The inflammatory response is a key component in the biocompatibility of biomaterials. Among the factors that control the development of inflammation is a critical molecule nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of noninvasive whole-body real-time imaging for the evaluation of host-biomaterial interaction in the NF-κB transgenic mice. Transgenic mice, carrying the luciferase gene under the control of NF-κB, were constructed. In vivo bioluminescence imaging showed that the constitutive and induced NF-κB activities of transgenic mice were detected in most of the lymphoid tissues, demonstrating that NF-κB-driven luminescence reflected the inflammatory response in vivo. By the implantation of genipin-cross-linked gelatin conduit (GGC) and bacterial endotoxin-immersed GGC in the dorsal region, we detected a strong and specific luminescent signal from the tissue around the bacterial endotoxin-immersed GGC implant. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis also demonstrated that inflammation, characterized by the infiltration of immune cells, the accumulation of fluid, and the activation of NF-κB, was evoked around the same region. The correlation between the bioluminescence imaging and histological changes indicated that noninvasive imaging technique could be used to monitor the real-time inflammation in the implanted mice. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

36248964175	Microarray analysis of vanillin-regulated gene expression profile in human hepatocarcinoma cells	Vanillin is one of the most widely used flavor compounds in food and personal products. It has been reported that vanillin is able to inhibit mutagenesis induced by chemical and physical mutagens, and to suppress the invasion and migration of cancer cells. Herein we used the oligonucleotide microarray approach to study gene expression profile of vanillin-treated human hepatocarcinoma cells. Microarray data followed by gene ontology (GO) investigation displayed that vanillin-affected clusters of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis. Genes down-regulated by vanillin were grouped into three GO categories, regulation of cellular process, cell cycle, and death. Furthermore, most of the down-regulated genes were associated with cancer progression. Knowledge-based analysis further indicated that Fos may play a central role in the regulation of gene expression network. Analysis of Fos-related transcription factor, activator protein 1 (AP-1), showed that vanillin inhibited AP-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) was diminished with increasing concentrations of vanillin, indicating that vanillin-regulated AP-1 activity via ERK pathway. In conclusion, our data suggested that vanillin exhibited the anticancer potential by the regulations of cell cycle and apoptosis. Moreover, its regulation may involve the suppression of a central molecule, AP-1. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0033037038	Pseudorabies virus early protein 0 trans-activates the TATA-associated promoter by stimulating the transcription initiation	Pseudorabies virus (PRV) early protein 0 (EP0) is a transactivator containing a RING finger domain. To assess the transactivation mechanism of PRV EP0, we performed the in vitro transcription by combining HeLa nuclear extract, purified recombinant EP0 and simple promoter constructs, and evaluated the results by primer extension. The data showed that EP0 could significantly activate the TATA-containing synthetic promoters. Moreover, EP0 activated transcription by stabilizing the formation of transcription initiation complex instead of enhancing the elongation rate. To further understand the role of EP0 on assembling the transcription initiation complex, we performed the pull-down assay using affinity precipitation of proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts and bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase EP0 RING finger fusion. The data showed that at least six nuclear proteins physically interacted with the EP0 RING finger. Overall, the transactivation of PRV EP0 is accomplished by enhancing the transcription initiation and is associated with at least six nuclear proteins. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

0034162668	Identification of a DNA-binding domain and an active-site residue of pseudorabies virus DNase	The pseudorabies virus (PRV) DNase gene has an open reading frame of 1476 nt, capable of coding a 492-residue protein. A previous study showed that PRV DNase is an alkaline exonuclease and endonuclease, exhibiting an Escherichia coli RecBCD-like catalytic function. To analyse its catalytic mechanism further, we constructed a set of clones truncated at the N-terminus or C-terminus of PRV DNase. The deleted mutants were expressed in E. coli with the use of pET expression vectors, then purified to homogeneity. Our results indicate that (1) the region spanning residues 274-492 exhibits a DNA-binding ability 7-fold that of the intact DNase; (2) the N-terminal 62 residues and the C-terminal 39 residues have important roles in 3'-exonuclease activity, and (3) residues 63-453 are responsible for 5'- and 3'-exonuclease activities. Further chemical modification of PRV DNase revealed that the inactivation of DNase by diethyl pyrocarbonate, which was reversible on treatment with hydroxylamine, seemed to be attributable solely to the modification of histidyl residues. Because the herpesviral DNases contained only one well-conserved histidine residue, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace His

58849158423	Vanillin inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression through down-regulation of nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells	Vanillin has been reported to exhibit anti-invasive and antimeta-static activities by suppressing the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). However, the underlying mechanism of anti-invasive activity remains unclear so far. Herein we demonstrate that vanillin reduced 12-O- tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity and suppressed cell invasion through the down-regulation of MMP-9 gene transcription in HepG2 cells. Vanillin significantly reduced the 6.6fold invasive capacity of HepG2 cells in noncytotoxic concentrations, and this anti-invasive effect was concentration-dependent in the Matrigel invasion assay. Moreover, vanillin significantly suppressed the TPA-induced enzymatic activity of MMP-9 and decreased the induced mRNA level of MMP-9. Analysis of the transcriptional regulation indicated that vanillin suppressed MMP-9 transcription by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity. Western blot further confirmed that vanillin inhibited NF-κB activity through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation. In conclusion, vanillin might be a potent anti-invasive agent that suppresses the MMP-9 enzymatic activity via NF-kB signaling pathway.

51349153234	Emodin is a novel alkaline nuclease inhibitor that suppresses herpes simplex virus type 1 yields in cell cultures	Background and purpose: Most antiviral therapies directed against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are limited to a small group of nucleoside analogues that target the viral polymerase. Extensive clinical use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients. This highlights the need for the development of new anti-herpesviral drugs with novel targets. Herein the effects of a plant anthraquinone, emodin, on the HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity and virus yields were investigated. Experimental approach: HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity was examined by nuclease activity assay. Inhibition of virus yields was measured by plaque reduction assay and immunohistochemical staining.

52049086698	Relationship between San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang and its herbal components on the gene expression profiles in HepG2 cells	Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for thousands of years. Most Chinese herbal formulae consist of several herbal components and have been used to treat various diseases. However, the mechanisms of most formulae and the relationship between formulae and their components remain to be elucidated. Here we analyzed the putative mechanism of San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang (SHXXT) and defined the relationship between SHXXT and its herbal components by microarray technique. HepG2 cells were treated with SHXXT or its components and the gene expression profiles were analyzed by DNA microarray. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that SHXXT and its components displayed a unique anti-proliferation pattern via p53 signaling, p53 activated, and DNA damage signaling pathways in HepG2 cells. Network analysis showed that most genes were regulated by one molecule, p53. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis showed that Rhizoma Coptis shared a similar gene expression profile with SHXXT. These findings may explain why Rhizoma Coptis is the principle herb that exerts the major effect in the herbal formula, SHXXT. Moreover, this is the first report to reveal the relationship between formulae and their herbal components in TCM by microarray and bioinformatics tools. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

However, its detail mechanisms for interfering inflammatory reaction remain unknown. In this study, we found that menthone can suppress the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as well as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity induced by LPS and other inflammatory agents, including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, hydrogen peroxide, okadaic acid, and ceramide. Furthermore, our data also demonstrated that the translocation of NF-κB activated by LPS into the nucleus was suppressed by menthone, and I-κB and β-transducin repeat containing protein (β-TrCP)were both involved in this suppression. To sum up, this study has provided molecular evidence for menthone effect on the LPS-induced cytokine production, NF-κB activation, and the involvement of I-κB and β-TrCP. © 2008 by The Chinese Physiological Society.

57349132885	Eriobotrya japonica leaf and its triterpenes inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokines and inducible enzyme production via the nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway in lung epithelial cells	Pulmonary inflammation is a characteristic of many lung diseases. Increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-8, have been correlated with lung inflammation. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce iNOS, COX-2, and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8) productions in human lung epithelial cells (A-549). Leaf of Eriobotrya japonica (Pi-Pa-Ye, PPY), a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pulmonary inflammatory diseases, was capable of suppressing LPS-induced cytokine productions in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the suppression of PPY on the cytokine productions resulted from the inhibition of inhibitory κB-α phosphorylation and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Analysis of the anti-inflammatory effects of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, the triterpene compounds present in PPY, showed that ursolic acid significantly inhibited LPS-induced IL-8 production, NF-κB activation, and iNOS mRNA expression, whereas oleanolic acid did not have these effects. In conclusion, our findings suggested the potential mechanisms of PPY and its active component, ursolic acid, in the treatment of pulmonary inflammation. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Our previous study indicated that a novel exon 6 deletion (residues 233-280) in SLC5A5 loses the iodide uptake activity. Herein we characterized the role of His-226 in iodide transport of SLC5A5. His-226, a highly conserved extracellular residue among SLC5A5 homologs, was replaced with alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or lysine. All the SLC5A5 mutants were expressed normally in the cells and targeted correctly to the plasma membrane. However, all of the mutants displayed severe defects in iodide uptake, suggesting that His-226 was critical for iodide uptake. Kinetic analysis further showed that mutation at His-226 led to a dramatic decrease in V

60749095404	Mutagenesis identifies the critical regions and amino acid residues of suid herpesvirus 1 DNA-binding protein required for DNA binding and strand invasion	Herpesviral DNA-binding protein (DBP) is a unique protein involved in viral DNA replication and genomic recombination. It binds and stabilizes the single-stranded DNA. It also forms the D-loops and promotes the strand invasion. To identify the functional regions and amino acid residues required for DNA binding and D-loop formation, we characterized several DBP mutants of suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1). Acetic anhydride modification assay showed that lysine residues were critical for DNA binding and D-loop formation. Replacement of highly conserved lysine residues with alanine revealed that Lys-756 and Lys-970 were critical for DNA binding, while Lys-161 participated in DNA binding and D-loop formation. Analysis of nested deleted mutants showed that N-terminal 201 amino acid residues and C-terminal 305 amino acid residues were required for D-loop formation and DNA binding, respectively. In conclusion, these findings suggested that SuHV-1 DBP contained critical regions for DNA binding and D-loop formation, and Lys-161, Lys-756, and Lys-970 were required for DNA binding or D-loop formation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

63449119852	Mutagenesis identifies the critical amino acid residues of human endonuclease G involved in catalysis, magnesium coordination, and substrate specificity	Background. Endonuclease G (EndoG), a member of DNA/RNA nonspecific -Me-finger nucleases, is involved in apoptosis and normal cellular proliferation. In this study, we analyzed the critical amino acid residues of EndoG and proposed the catalytic mechanism of EndoG. Methods. To identify the critical amino acid residues of human EndoG, we replaced the conserved histidine, asparagine, and arginine residues with alanine. The catalytic efficacies of Escherichia coli-expressed EndoG variants were further analyzed by kinetic studies. Results. Diethyl pyrocarbonate modification assay revealed that histidine residues were involved in EndoG activity. His-141, Asn-163, and Asn-172 in the H-N-H motif of EndoG were critical for catalysis and substrate specificity. H141A mutant required a higher magnesium concentration to achieve its activity, suggesting the unique role of His-141 in both catalysis and magnesium coordination. Furthermore, an additional catalytic residue (Asn-251) and an additional metal ion binding site (Glu-271) of human EndoG were identified. Conclusion. Based on the mutational analysis and homology modeling, we proposed that human EndoG shared a similar catalytic mechanism with nuclease A from Anabaena.

64249084605	Nuclear factor-κB bioluminescence imaging-guided transcriptomic analysis for the assessment of host-biomaterial interaction in vivo	Establishment of a comprehensive platform for the assessment of host-biomaterial interaction in vivo is an important issue. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is an inducible transcription factor that is activated by numerous stimuli. Therefore, NF-κB-dependent luminescent signal in transgenic mice carrying the luciferase genes was used as the guide to monitor the biomaterials-affected organs, and transcriptomic analysis was further applied to evaluate the complex host responses in affected organs in this study. In vivo imaging showed that genipin-cross-linked gelatin conduit (GGC) implantation evoked the strong NF-κB activity at 6 h in the implanted region, and transcriptomic analysis showed that the expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-24, and IL-1 family were up-regulated. A strong luminescent signal was observed in spleen on 14 d, suggesting that GGC implantation might elicit the biological events in spleen. Transcriptomic analysis of spleen showed that 13 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways belonging to cell cycles, immune responses, and metabolism were significantly altered by GGC implants. Connectivity Map analysis suggested that the gene signatures of GGC were similar to those of compounds that affect lipid or glucose metabolism. GeneSetTest analysis further showed that host responses to GGC implants might be related to diseases states, especially the metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In conclusion, our data provided a concept of molecular imaging-guided transcriptomic platform for the evaluation and the prediction of host-biomaterial interaction in vivo. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

64249131014	Transcriptomic analysis of EGb 761-regulated neuroactive receptor pathway in vivo	Ethnopharmacological relevance: EGb 761, a well-defined extract from Ginkgo biloba, has been widely used in patients with cerebral disorders. Aim of the study: Although EGb 761 exhibits neuroprotective effects and exerts beneficial effects on many neurological disorders, its mechanism on the neuronal functions is unclear so far. Materials and methods: In this study, we used oligonucleotide microarray technique to investigate the effect of EGb 761 on the transcriptional profile of mouse genes. RNA samples were obtained from frontal cortex, straitum, and kidneys after the oral administration of EGb 761 for seven consecutive days. Results: Our data showed that EGb 761 significantly altered the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway in frontal cortex but not in straitum and kidney. Then we analyzed 26 receptor genes that were significantly altered by EGb 761 in this pathway and found that EGb 761 treatment highly up-regulated the subgroup of dopamine receptors, especially dopamine receptor 1a (Drd1a), in frontal cortex. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining confirmed the increased level of Drd1a expression after EGb 761 treatment. Conclusions: In summary, we investigated for the first time the overall effects of EGb 761 on the gene expression in brain using a powerful systemic biological technique. Our results suggested that EGb 761 altered unique pathways and regulated the expressions of some specific neuronal receptor genes exclusively in frontal cortex. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

64949147925	Noninvasive bioluminescent and microPET imaging for the regulation of NF-κB in human hepatoma-bearing mice	The activity of nuclear factor-κb (NF-κB), a nuclear transcription factor, influences both critical tumor promotion and host-tumor interactions. Preventing NF-κB activation may thus inhibit the development of cancer. Therefore, development of easy and rapid methods to evaluate the regulation of NF-κB is needed for drug discovery. The aim of this study was to visualize the regulation of NF-κB by real-time, noninvasive bioluminescence and microPET imaging in vivo. Materials and Methods: A highly responsive HepG2/NF- κb/luc clone L for 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)- induced tumor promotion inhibited by methotrexate (MTX) was selected by high-throughput bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in vitro.

67651100698	Vanillin improves and prevents trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis in mice	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is chronic inflammatory and relapsing disease of the gut. It has been known that activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and production of proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of IBD. In this study, the effect of vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), a potent nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor, was evaluated in mice with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Oral administration of vanillin improved macroscopic and histological features of TNBS-induced colitis in a dose-dependent manner. Vanillin not only prevented TNBSinduced colitis but also ameliorated the established colitis. By in vivo NF-κB bioluminescence imaging, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and Western blot, we found that vanillin suppressed in vivo NF-κB activities through the inhibition of p65 translocation, inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB)-α phosphorylation, and IκB kinase activation. Furthermore, vanillin reduced the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α] and stimulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4) in colonic tissues. In conclusion, this work identified vanillin as an anti-inflammatory compound with the capacity to prevent and ameliorate TNBS-induced colitis. Due to its safety, vanillin could be a potent candidate for the treatment of IBD. Copyright © 2009 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

70350139869	Comprehensive evaluation of a novel nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, quinoclamine, by transcriptomic analysis	Background and purpose: The transcription factor nuclear factor-KB (NF-κB) has been linked to the cell growth, apoptosis and cell cycle progression. NF-κB blockade induces apoptosis of cancer cells. Therefore, NF-κB is suggested as a potential therapeutic target for cancer. Here, we have evaluated the anti-cancer potential of a novel NF-κB inhibitor, quinoclamine (2-amino-3-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone). Experimental approach: In a large-scale screening test, we found that quinoclamine was a novel NF-κB inhibitor. The global transcriptional profiling of quinoclamine in HepG2 cells was therefore analysed by transcriptomic tools in this study. Key results: Quinoclamine suppressed endogenous NF-κB activity in HepG2 cells through the inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation and p65 translocation. Quinoclamine also inhibited induced NF-κB activities in lung and breast cancer cell lines. Quinoclamine-regulated genes interacted with NF-κB or its downstream genes by network analysis. Quinoclamine affected the expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle or apoptosis, suggesting that quinoclamine exhibited anti-cancer potential. Furthermore, quinoclamine down-regulated the expressions of UDP glucuronosyltransferase genes involved in phase Il drug metabolism, suggesting that quinoclamine might interfere with drug metabolism by slowing down the excretion of drugs. Conclusion and implications: This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of quinoclamine by transcriptomic analysis. Our findings suqqest that quinoclamine is a novel NF-κB inhibitor with anti-cancer potential. © 2009 The British Pharmacological Society All rights reserved.

76949108679	Microarray analysis reveals the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B signaling by aristolochic acid in normal human kidney (HK-2) cells	Aim: To study the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of aristolochic acid (AA), a major active component of plants from the Aristolochiaceae family using microarray analysis. Methods: Human kidney (HK-2) cells were treated with AA (0, 10, 30, and 90 μmol/L) for 24 h, and the cell viability was measured by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Complementary DNA microarrays were used to investigate the gene expression pattern of HK-2 cells exposed to AA in triplicate. A quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was used to verify the microarray data for selected nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-regulated genes. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of NF-κB p65 was visualized by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy in HK-2 cells. The NF-B activity was examined by a luciferase reporter assay in HK-2/NF-κB transgenic cells. Results: AA exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect in HK-2 cells and induced alterations in the gene expression profiles related to the DNA damage response, DNA repair, macromolecule metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolic process, DNA metabolic process, apoptosis, cell cycle, and transcription. In addition, 9 biological pathways associated with immunomodulatory functions were down-regulated in AA-treated HK-2 cells. A network analysis revealed that NF-κB played a central role in the network topology. Among NF-κB-regulated genes, 8 differentially expressed genes were verified by qRT-PCR. The inhibition of NF-κB activity by AA was further confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and by NF-κB luciferase reporter assay. Conclusion: Our data revealed that AA could suppress NF-κB activity in normal human cells, perhaps partially accounting for the reported anti-inflammatory effects of some plants from the genus Aristolochia. © 2010 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.

77952989674	Aristolochic acid suppresses DNA repair and triggers oxidative DNA damage in human kidney proximal tubular cells	Aristolochic acid (AA), derived from plants of the Aristolochia genus, has been proven to be associated with aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and urothelial cancer in AAN patients. In this study, we used toxicogenomic analysis to clarify the molecular mechanism of AA-induced cytotoxicity in normal human kidney proximal tubular (HK-2) cells, the target cells of AA. AA induced cytotoxic effects in a dose-dependent (10, 30, 90 μM for 24 h) and time-dependent manner (30 μM for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h). The cells from those experiments were then used for microarray experiments in triplicate. Among the differentially expressed genes analyzed by Limma and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, we found that genes in DNA repair processes were the most significantly regulated by all AA treatments. Furthermore, response to DNA damage stimulus, apoptosis, and regulation of cell cycle, were also significantly regulated by AA treatment. Among the differentially expressed genes found in the dose-response and time-course studies that were involved in these biological processes, two up-regulated (GADD45B, NAIP), and six down-regulated genes (TP53, PARP1, OGG1, ERCC1, ERCC2, and MGMT) were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). AA exposure also caused a down-regulation of the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase. Moreover, AA treatment led to increased frequency of DNA strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive nuclei, and micronuclei in a dose-dependent manner in HK-2 cells, possibly as a result of the inhibition of DNA repair. These data suggest that oxidative stress plays a role in the cytotoxicity of AA. In addition, our results provide insight into the involvement of down-regulation of DNA repair gene expression as a possible mechanism for AA-induced genotoxicity.

77955056586	Antrodia camphorata suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear factor-κB activation in transgenic mice evaluated by bioluminescence imaging	In an earlier study, we found that Antrodia camphorata inhibited the production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 by blocking nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages. This study was aimed at evaluating the inhibitory effects of the fermented culture broth of A. camphorata in terms of LPS-induced NF-κB activation in transgenic mice by using a non-invasive, real-time NF-κB bioluminescence imaging technique. Transgenic mice carrying the luciferase gene under the control of NF-κB were given A. camphorata (570. mg/kg, p.o.) for three consecutive days and then injected with LPS (4. mg/kg, i.p.). In vivo imaging showed that treatment with LPS increased the luminescent signal, whereas A. camphorata suppressed the LPS-induced inflammatory response significantly. Ex vivo imaging showed that A. camphorata suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activity in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and kidney. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that A. camphorata suppressed production of the LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and NF-κB p65 subunit in these organs. Furthermore, A. camphorata attenuated the productions of LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β in serum from transgenic mice. We report the first confirmation of the anti-inflammatory action in vivo of this potentially beneficial mushroom. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

78049381533	Application of bioactivity database of Chinese herbal medicine on the therapeutic prediction, drug development, and safety evaluation	Aim of the study: Chinese herbal medicine has been used for the treatments of various diseases for years. However, it is often difficult to analyze their biological activities and molecule mechanisms because of their complex nature. In this study, we applied DNA microarray to analyze the biological events induced by herbal formulae, predict the therapeutic potentials of formulae, and evaluate the safety of formulae. Materials and methods: Mice were administrated orally with 15 formulae for 7 consecutive days, and the gene expression profiles in liver or kidney were further analyzed by transcriptomic tools. Results: Our data showed that most formulae altered the metabolic pathways, such as glutathione metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, and regulatory pathways, such as antigen processing and presentation and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway. By comparing the gene expression signatures of formulae with those of disease states or drugs, we found that mice responsive to formula treatments might be related to disease states, especially metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, and drugs, which exhibit anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative effects. Moreover, most formulae altered the expression levels of cytochrome p450, glutathione S-transferase, and UDP glycosyltransferase genes, suggesting that caution should be paid to possible drug interaction of these formulae. Furthermore, the similarities of gene expression profiles between formulae and toxic chemicals were low in kidney, suggesting that these formulae might not induce nephrotoxicities in mice. Conclusions: This report applied transcriptomic tools as a novel platform of translational medicine for Chinese herbal medicine. This platform will not only for understanding the therapeutic mechanisms involving herbal formulae and gene interactions, but also for the new theories in drug discovery. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

78549278122	Conserved charged amino acid residues in the extracellular region of sodium/iodide symporter are critical for iodide transport activity	Background. Sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) mediates the active transport and accumulation of iodide from the blood into the thyroid gland. His-226 located in the extracellular region of NIS has been demonstrated to be critical for iodide transport in our previous study. The conserved charged amino acid residues in the extracellular region of NIS were therefore characterized in this study. Methods. Fourteen charged residues (Arg-9, Glu-79, Arg-82, Lys-86, Asp-163, His-226, Arg-228, Asp-233, Asp-237, Arg-239, Arg-241, Asp-311, Asp-322, and Asp-331) were replaced by alanine. Iodide uptake abilities of mutants were evaluated by steady-state and kinetic analysis. The three-dimensional comparative protein structure of NIS was further modeled using sodium/glucose transporter as the reference protein. Results. All the NIS mutants were expressed normally in the cells and targeted correctly to the plasma membrane. However, these mutants, except R9A, displayed severe defects on the iodide uptake. Further kinetic analysis revealed that mutations at conserved positively charged amino acid residues in the extracellular region of NIS led to decrease NIS-mediated iodide uptake activity by reducing the maximal rate of iodide transport, while mutations at conserved negatively charged residues led to decrease iodide transport by increasing dissociation between NIS mutants and iodide. Conclusions. This is the first report characterizing thoroughly the functional significance of conserved charged amino acid residues in the extracellular region of NIS. Our data suggested that conserved charged amino acid residues, except Arg-9, in the extracellular region of NIS were critical for iodide transport. © 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

This study was to determine whether ZJW and its components blocked activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activities as well as tumor promotion in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. ZJW and its components, Coptis chinensis and Evodia rutaecarpa, inhibited AP-1 and NF-κB activities, and suppressed anchorage-independent growth of HepG2 cells. The major alkaloidal ingredients, berberine and evodiamine, inhibited AP-1 activities and/or NF-κB activation, and further suppressed hepatocellular transformation. In conclusion, ZJW and its constituents, berberine and evodiamine, suppressed tumor promotion primarily through AP-1 and/or NF-κB pathways in HepG2 cells. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To develop anti-HSV compounds from plants, 31 herbs used as antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agents in Chinese medicine were screened. Five different preparations (cold aqueous, hot aqueous, ethanolic, acid ethanolic, and methanolic) from 31 herbs were analyzed by plaque reduction assay, and 7 extracts, which showed significant antiviral activities, were further elucidated for their antiviral mechanisms. Our results showed that ethanolic extract of Rheum officinale and methanolic extract of Paeonia stiffhiticosa prevented the process of virus attachment and penetration. Aqueous extract of P. stiffintlicosa and ethanolic extract ofAfelia toosendan inhibited virus attachment to cell surface. Aqueous extract ofSophoraflavescens and methanolic extract of M. toosendan showed no effect on virus attachment and penetration. These data indicated that these 4 herbs have a potential value as a source of new powerful anti-HS V compounds. © 2001 Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

0036082511	Pseudorabies virus DNA-binding protein stimulates the exonuclease activity and regulates the processivity of pseudorabies virus DNase	The pseudorabies virus (PRV) DNase is an alkaline exonuclease and endonuclease, which exhibits an Escherichia coli RecBCD-like catalytic function. The PRV DNA-binding protein (DBP) promotes the renaturation of complementary single strands of DNA, which is an essential function for recombinase. To investigate the functional and physical interactions between PRV DBP and DNase, these proteins were purified to homogeneity. PRV DBP stimulated the DNase activity, especially the exonuclease activity, in a dose-dependent fashion. Acetylation of DBP by acetic anhydride resulted in a loss of DNA-binding ability and a 60% inhibition of the DNase activity, suggesting that DNA-binding ability of PRV DBP was required for stimulating the DNase activity. PRV DNase behaved in a processive mode; however, it was converted into a distributive mode in the presence of DBP, implying that PRV DBP stimulated the dissociation of DNase from DNA substrates. The physical interaction between DBP and DNase was further analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and a significant interaction was observed. Thus, these results suggested that PRV DBP interacted with PRV DNase and regulated the DNase activity in vitro. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

80051976325	Comprehensive assessment of host responses to ionizing radiation by nuclear factor-κB bioluminescence imaging-guided transcriptomic analysis	The aim of this study was to analyze the host responses to ionizing radiation by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) bioluminescence imaging-guided transcriptomic tool. Transgenic mice carrying the NF-κB-driven luciferase gene were exposed to a single dose of 8.5 Gy total-body irradiation. In vivo imaging showed that a maximal NF-κB-dependent bioluminescent intensity was observed at 3 h after irradiation and ex vivo imaging showed that liver, intestine, and brain displayed strong NF-κB activations. Microarray analysis of these organs showed that irradiation altered gene expression signatures in an organ-specific manner and several pathways associated with metabolism and immune system were significantly altered. Additionally, the upregulation of fatty acid binding protein 4, serum amyloid A2, and serum amyloid A3 genes, which participate in both inflammation and lipid metabolism, suggested that irradiation might affect the cross pathways of metabolism and inflammation. Moreover, the alteration of chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 5, chemokine (CC-motif) ligand 20, and Jagged 1 genes, which are involved in the inflammation and enterocyte proliferation, suggested that these genes might be involved in the radiation enteropathy. In conclusion, this report describes the comprehensive evaluation of host responses to ionizing radiation. Our findings provide the fundamental information about the in vivo NF-κB activity and transcriptomic pattern after irradiation. Moreover, novel targets involved in radiation injury are also suggested. © 2011 Chang et al.

84859341657	Assessment of chitosan-affected metabolic response by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor bioluminescent imaging-guided transcriptomic analysis	Chitosan has been widely used in food industry as a weight-loss aid and a cholesterol-lowering agent. Previous studies have shown that chitosan affects metabolic responses and contributes to anti-diabetic, hypocholesteremic, and blood glucoselowering effects; however, the in vivo targeting sites and mechanisms of chitosan remain to be clarified. In this study, we constructed transgenic mice, which carried the luciferase genes driven by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), a key regulator of fatty acid and glucose metabolism. Bioluminescent imaging of PPAR transgenic mice was applied to report the organs that chitosan acted on, and gene expression profiles of chitosan-targeted organs were further analyzed to elucidate the mechanisms of chitosan. Bioluminescent imaging showed that constitutive PPAR activities were detected in brain and gastrointestinal tract. Administration of chitosan significantly activated the PPAR activities in brain and stomach. Microarray analysis of brain and stomach showed that several pathways involved in lipid and glucose metabolism were regulated by chitosan. Moreover, the expression levels of metabolism-associated genes like apolipoprotein B (apoB) and ghrelin genes were down-regulated by chitosan. In conclusion, these findings suggested the feasibility of PPAR bioluminescent imaging-guided transcriptomic analysis on the evaluation of chitosan-affected metabolic responses in vivo. Moreover, we newly identified that downregulated expression of apoB and ghrelin genes were novel mechanisms for chitosan-affected metabolic responses in vivo. © 2012 Kao et al.

84862244833	Early induction of cytokines/cytokine receptors and Cox2, and activation of NF-κB in 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced murine oral cancer model	The purpose of this study was to identify the genes induced early in murine oral carcinogenesis. Murine tongue tumors induced by the carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO), and paired non-tumor tissues were subjected to microarray analysis. Hierarchical clustering of upregulated genes in the tumor tissues revealed an association of induced genes with inflammation. Cytokines/cytokine receptors induced early were subsequently identified, clearly indicating their involvement in oral carcinogenesis. Hierarchical clustering also showed that cytokine-mediated inflammation was possibly linked with Mapk6. Cox2 exhibited the greatest extent (9-18 fold) of induction in the microarray data, and its early induction was observed in a 2. h painting experiment by RT-PCR. MetaCore analysis showed that overexpressed Cox2 may interact with p53 and transcriptionally inhibit expression of several downstream genes. A painting experiment in transgenic mice also demonstrated that NF-κB activates early independently of Cox2 induction. MetaCore analysis revealed the most striking metabolic alterations in tumor tissues, especially in lipid metabolism resulting from the reduction of Pparα and Rxrg. Reduced expression of Mapk12 was noted, and MetaCore analysis established its relationship with decreased efficiency of Pparα [U+F020]phosphorylation. In conclusion, in addition to cytokines/cytokine receptors, the early induction of Cox2 and NF-κB activation is involved in murine oral carcinogenesis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Microarray analysis has become a widely used tool for the generation of gene expression data on a genome-wide scale. This paper discusses the application of whole genome expression profiling as a tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing the therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine. This review also highlights how data derived from DNA microarray analysis can be used to screen for drug targets of various herbal drugs, to predict the therapeutic potential of herbal drugs, to analyze the safety of drugs in the preclinical stage of drug development, and to establish a modern definition of traditional Chinese medicine. © 2012.

84863230356	5-fluorouracil induced intestinal mucositis via nuclear factor-κB activation by transcriptomic analysis and in vivo bioluminescence imaging	5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of malignant cancers. However, approximately 80% of patients undergoing 5-FU treatment suffer from gastrointestinal mucositis. The aim of this report was to identify the drug target for the 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis was established by intraperitoneally administering mice with 100 mg/kg 5-FU. Network analysis of gene expression profile and bioluminescent imaging were applied to identify the critical molecule associated with 5-FU-induced mucositis. Our data showed that 5-FU induced inflammation in the small intestine, characterized by the increased intestinal wall thickness and crypt length, the decreased villus height, and the increased myeloperoxidase activity in tissues and proinflammatory cytokine production in sera. Network analysis of 5-FU-affected genes by transcriptomic tool showed that the expression of genes was regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and NF-κB was the central molecule in the 5-FU-regulated biological network. NF-κB activity was activated by 5-FU in the intestine, which was judged by in vivo bioluminescence imaging and immunohistochemical staining. However, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) inhibited 5-FU-induced NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, 5-FU-induced histological changes were improved by 5-ASA. In conclusion, our findings suggested that NF-κB was the critical molecule associated with the pathogenesis of 5-FU-induced mucositis, and inhibition of NF-κB activity ameliorated the mucosal damage caused by 5-FU. © 2012 Chang et al.

Inflammation is correlated with human disorders, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is the critical molecule involved in inflammation. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of genipin on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute systemic inflammation in mice was evaluated by NF-κB bioluminescence-guided transcriptomic analysis. Transgenic mice carrying the NF-κB-driven luciferase genes were administered intraperitoneally with LPS and various amounts of genipin. Bioluminescent imaging showed that genipin significantly suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB-dependent luminescence in vivo. The suppression of LPS-induced acute inflammation by genipin was further evidenced by the reductions of cytokine levels in sera and organs. Microarray analysis of these organs showed that the transcripts of 79 genes were differentially expressed in both LPS and LPS/genipin groups, and one third of these genes belonged to chemokine ligand, chemokine receptor, and interferon (IFN)-induced protein genes. Moreover, network analysis showed that NF-κB played a critical role in the regulation of genipin-affected gene expression. In conclusion, we newly identified that genipin exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in a model of LPS-induced acute systemic inflammation via downregulation of chemokine ligand, chemokine receptor, and IFN-induced protein productions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84865508988	Ginger extract and zingerone ameliorated trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis in mice via modulation of nuclear factor-κB activity and interleukin-1β signalling pathway	Ginger is a commonly used spice with anti-inflammatory potential. Colitis is the common pathological lesion of inflammatory bowel diseases. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of ginger and its component zingerone in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Ginger and zingerone ameliorated TNBS-induced colonic injury in a dose-dependent manner. Pathway analysis of ginger- and zingerone-regulated gene expression profiles showed that ginger and zingerone significantly regulated cytokine-related pathways. Network analysis showed that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were key molecules involved in the expression of ginger- and zingerone-affected genes. Ex vivo imaging and immunohistochemical staining further verified that ginger and zingerone suppressed TNBS-induced NF-κB activation and IL-1β protein level in the colon. In conclusion, ginger improved TNBS-induced colitis via modulation of NF-κB activity and IL-1β signalling pathway.

0037154836	Differential regulation of activator protein 1 activity by glycyrrhizin	Glycyrrhizin, a major component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (licorice) root, is a saponin and exhibits a number of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammation, anti-ulcer, anti-allergy, and anti-carcinogenesis. Activator protein 1 (AP-1), a nuclear transcription factor, consists of Jun/Fos heterodimers or Jun/Jun homodimers, and blocking of tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activity could inhibit induced cellular transformation. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of glycyrrhizin-induced anticarcinogenesis, effect of glycyrrhizin on the AP-1 activity in untreated and tumor promoter - 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated conditions was analyzed in this study. Glycyrrhizin induced the AP-1/TATA reporter activity in a dose-dependent fashion, which was judged by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. Similar results were observed in HepG2 and Vero cells, suggested that glycyrrhizin effect was cell type-independent. In addition, the cis element responsible for glycyrrhizin activity was AP-1 responsive element. Further analysis indicated that glycyrrhizin exhibited a different regulation on the AP-1 activity in untreated and TPA-treated cells. Glycyrrhizin induced the AP-1 activity in untreated cells, while it inhibited the TPA-induced AP-1 activation in TPA-treated cells. These results provide insight into the biological actions of glycyrrhizin and the molecular basis for the development of new chemoprotective agents for cancer. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

0038397416	An in vitro system combined with an in-house quantitation assay for screening hepatitis C virus inhibitors	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious global health problem. Interferon-α (IFN-α) and ribavirin have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of HCV infection; however, these therapies display many side effects. To screen the anti-HCV compounds from plants, we established an in vitro model for inoculation of HCV by centrifugation-facilitated method. The HCV RNA molecules were then quantitated by nested competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) using fluorescein-labeled primers, and analyzed by ABI Prism™ 310. The positive and negative strands of HCV RNA were detectable in Vero cells on Day 7 post-infection, suggesting that the HCV RNA was present in the cell model system. The cell culture system was further used to screen the anti-HCV activities of 4 Chinese herbal formulas and 15 formula components. IFN-α showed an antiviral effect. The formulas exhibited no anti-HCV activities, while Arnebia euchroma, Thlaspi arvense, and Poncirus trifoliata displayed anti-HCV activities. Therefore, these results pointed out the possibility by using the cell culture system established in this study to screen the herb extracts for their anti-HCV activities. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

84869028687	Toona sinensis and its major bioactive compound gallic acid inhibit LPS-induced inflammation in nuclear factor-κB transgenic mice as evaluated by in vivo bioluminescence imaging	In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of a nutritious vegetable Toona sinensis (leaf extracts, TS) and its major bioactive compound gallic acid (GA) by analysing LPS-induced NF-κB activation in transgenic mice, using bioluminescence imaging. Mice were challenged intraperitoneally with LPS (1 mg/kg) and treated orally with TS or GA (100 or 5 mg/kg, respectively). In vivo and ex vivo imaging showed that LPS increased NF-κB luminescence in the abdominal region, which was significantly inhibited by TS or GA. Immunohistochemical and ELISA analyses confirmed that TS and GA inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB, interleukin-1β, and tumour necrosis factor-α expression. Microarray analysis revealed that biological pathways associated with metabolism and the immune responses were affected by TS or GA. Particularly, LPS-induced thioredoxin-like 4B (TXNL4B) 2 expression in the small intestine, and TXNL4B, iNOS, and COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells were significantly inhibited by TS or GA. Thus, the anti-inflammatory potential of TS was mediated by the downregulation of NF-κB pathway. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84874994166	Momordica charantia and its novel polypeptide regulate glucose homeostasis in mice via binding to insulin receptor	Momordica charantia (MC) has been used as an alternative therapy for diabetes mellitus. This study analyzed and elucidated therapeutic targets contributing to the hypoglycemic effect of aqueous extract of MC seeds (MCSE) by transcriptomic analysis. Protein ingredients aimed at the hypoglycemic target were further identified by proteomic, docking, and receptor-binding assays. The data showed that MSCE (1 g/kg) significantly lowered the blood glucose level in normal and diabetic mice. Moreover, MCSE primarily regulated the insulin signaling pathway in muscles and adipose tissues, suggesting that MCSE might target insulin receptor (IR), stimulate the IR-downstream pathway, and subsequently display hypoglycemic activity in mice. It was further revealed that inhibitor against trypsin (TI) of MC directly docked into IR and activated the kinase activity of IR in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, the findings suggested that MCSE regulated glucose metabolism mainly via the insulin signaling pathway. Moreover, TI was newly identified as a novel IR-binding protein of MC that triggered the insulin signaling pathway via binding to IR. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

0346098157	Antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of recombinant SARS coronavirus spike protein	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a novel coronavirus and causing worldwide outbreaks. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped RNA virus, which contains several structural proteins. Among these proteins, spike (S) protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors and is a major antigenic determinant, which induces neutralizing antibody. In order to analyze the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of SARS-CoV S protein, we expressed the S protein in Escherichia coli using a pET expression vector. After the isopropyl-β-D- thiogalactoside induction, S protein was expressed in the soluble form and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography to homogeneity. The amount of S protein recovered was 0.2-0.3 mg/100 ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients by ELISA and Western blot, which indicated that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using biotin-labeled S protein as the probe, we identified 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins in Vero cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection. Taken together, these results suggested that recombinant S protein exhibited the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability, and it could be a good candidate for further developing SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapy. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

84888875001	In vitro and invivo bioluminescent imaging to evaluate anti-Escherichia coli activity of Galla Chinensis	Background: Novel and rapid technology is urgently needed to expedite screening of new antibacterial drugs for preventing and treating life-threatening bacterial infection. Purpose: This study applied bioluminescent imaging to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Galla Chinensis extract (GCE) in gastrointestinal tracts of mice. Methods: Bioluminescent Escherichia coli (E. coli) was constructed by transforming plasmid DNA containing TATA box-driven luciferase gene. The antibacterial activity of GCE invitro was evaluated by mixing GCE and bioluminescent E. coli and subjecting to image; the antibacterial efficacy of GCE was evaluated invivo by administering intragastric GCE and bioluminescent E. coli to mice and subjecting to image at 2 hours. Results: GCE inhibited the growth of E. coli in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 4μg/μL and a minimal bactericidal concentration of 8μg/μL. Intragastric administration of bioluminescent E. coli showed that a strong luminescent signal was observed in the abdominal region, while GCE treatment significantly decreased bioluminescence. Exvivo image and bacterial count verified the decreased intensity of bioluminescence and number of viable E. coli in the intestines of GCE-treated mice. Conclusion: The findings suggest: (1) GCE exhibits anti- E. coli activities invitro and invivo; and (2) the feasibility of bioluminescent imaging on real-time monitoring of the antibacterial effects of natural products in living mice. © 2013.

84894587460	Application of transcriptomics in chinese herbal medicine studies	Transcriptomics using DNA microarray has become a practical and popular tool for herbal medicine study because of high throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, and reproducibility. Therefore, this article focuses on the overview of DNA microarray technology and the application of DNA microarray in Chinese herbal medicine study. To understand the number and the objectives of articles utilizing DNA microarray for herbal medicine study, we surveyed 297 frequently used Chinese medicinal herbs listed in Pharmacopoeia Commission of People′s Republic of China. We classified these medicinal herbs into 109 families and then applied PudMed search using microarray and individual herbal family as keywords. Although thousands of papers applying DNA microarray in Chinese herbal studies have been published since 1998, most of the articles focus on the elucidation of mechanisms of certain biological effects of herbs. Construction of the bioactivity database containing large-scaled gene expression profiles of quality control herbs can be applied in the future to analyze the biological events induced by herbs, predict the therapeutic potential of herbs, evaluate the safety of herbs, and identify the drug candidate of herbs. Moreover, the linkage of systems biology tools, such as functional genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics, will become a new translational platform between Western medicine and Chinese herbal medicine.

84894635160	The suppressive activities of six sources of medicinal ferns known as gusuibu on heat-labile enterotoxin-induced diarrhea	Diarrheal disease is one of the most important worldwide health problems. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the most frequently isolated enteropathogen in diarrheal diseases. In developing countries, a very large number of people, especially children, suffer from diarrhea. To combat this problem, World Health Organization has constituted the Diarrhea Diseases Control Program which guides studies on traditional medicinal practices and preventive measures. Gusuibu, a traditional folk medicine, has been claimed to heal certain types of diarrhea. However, so far no scientific study has been carried out on the anti-diarrheal mechanism of Gusiubu. The present study was performed to examine the suppressive activities of ethanol extracts of six sources of folk medicinal ferns used as Gusuibu on heat-labile enterotoxin (LT)-induced diarrhea. Inhibitory effects of six sources were evaluated on the ETEC LT subunit B (LTB) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GMI) interaction by GM1-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and patent mouse gut assay. Our results indicated that Drynaria fortunei had no anti-diarrheal effect, while, among the remaining five folk medicinal ferns, four belonging to family Davalliaceae had significant abilities on both the blocking of LTB and GM1 interaction and the inhibition of LT-induced diarrhea. In conclusion, these findings suggested the potential application of Gusuibu as an anti-diarrheal remedy. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84896102376	Deer antler extract improves fatigue effect through altering the expression of genes related to muscle strength in skeletal muscle of mice	Deer antler is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used in Asian countries for the tonic and the improvement of aging symptoms. The present study was designed to investigate the antifatigue effect and mechanism of Formosan sambar deer tip antler extract (FSDTAE). The swimming times to exhaustion of mice administered FSDTAE (8.2 mg/day) for 28 days were apparently longer than those of the vehicle-treated mice in forced swim test. However, the indicators of fatigue, such as the reduction in glucose level and the increases in blood urea nitrogen and lactic acid levels, were not significantly inhibited by FSDTAE. Therefore, microarray analysis was further used to examine the anti-fatigue mechanism of FSDTAE. We selected genes with fold changes >2 or <-2 in skeletal muscle for pathway analysis. FSDTAE-affected genes were involved in 9 different signaling pathways, such as GnRH signaling pathway and insulin signaling pathway. All of the significantly expressed genes were classified into 8 different categories by their functions. The most enriched category was muscular system, and 6 upregulated genes, such as troponin I, troponin T1, cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2, myosin heavy polypeptide 7, tropomyosin 2, and myomesin family member 3, were responsible for the development and contraction of muscle. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that FSDTAE increased troponins mRNA expression in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, our findings suggested that FSDTAE might increase the muscle strength through the upregulation of genes responsible for muscle contraction and consequently exhibited the anti-fatigue effect in mice. © 2014 Jaw-Chyun Chen et al.

84901197524	Uncaria rhynchophylla and rhynchophylline improved kainic acid-induced epileptic seizures via IL-1β and brain-derived neurotrophic factor	Uncaria rhynchophylla (UR) has been used for the treatment of convulsions and epilepsy in traditional Chinese medicine. This study reported the major anti-convulsive signaling pathways and effective targets of UR and rhynchophylline (RP) using genomic and immunohistochemical studies. Epileptic seizure model was established by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA) in rats. Electroencephalogram and electromyogram recordings indicated that UR and RP improved KA-induced epileptic seizures. Toll-like receptor (TLR) and neurotrophin signaling pathways were regulated by UR in both cortex and hippocampus of KA-treated rats. KA upregulated the expression levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF), which were involved in TLR and neurotrophin signaling pathways, respectively. However, UR and RP downregulated the KA-induced IL-1β and BDNF gene expressions. Our findings suggested that UR and RP exhibited anti-convulsive effects in KA-induced rats via the regulation of TLR and neurotrophin signaling pathways, and the subsequent inhibition of IL-1β and BDNF gene expressions. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

84903641123	Electroacupuncture improves trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis, evaluated by transcriptomic study	Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic colonic inflammation that displays symptoms like diarrhea and weight loss. Acupuncture has been widely accepted by Western countries for the treatment of pain. Here, we analyzed efficacy and mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid- (TNBS-) induced colitis in mice. Mice were intrarectally administered with 250 mg/kg TNBS and electroacupunctured at Quze (PC3) and Neiguan (PC6) acupoints, which have been applied for gastrointestinal disorders. Gene expression profiles in colons and spleens were analyzed by microarray for the elucidation of mechanism of EA. Our data showed that EA at PC3 and PC6 improved macroscopic and microscopic features of colitis and the improvement displayed a frequency-dependent manner. Administration of TNBS upregulated the expression of most cytokine genes in colons, while EA downregulated the expression of TNBS-induced cytokine genes. Pathway analysis showed that EA significantly affected inflammatory pathways in colons and immunity-associated pathway in spleens. Immunohistochemical staining further showed that EA decreased the expression of interleukin-1β and nuclear factor-B. In conclusion, this is the first study reporting the global gene expression profiles of EA on TNBS-induced colitis. Our findings suggested that inflammatory and immunity pathways were involved in the anti-inflammatory mechanism of EA on colitis induced by TNBS. © 2014 Tin-Yun Ho et al.

84907164545	A novel insulin receptor-binding protein from Momordica charantia enhances glucose uptake and glucose clearance in vitro and in vivo through triggering insulin receptor signaling pathway	Diabetes, a common metabolic disorder, is characterized by hyperglycemia. Insulin is the principal mediator of glucose homeostasis. In a previous study, we identified a trypsin inhibitor, named Momordica charantia insulin receptor (IR)-binding protein (mcIRBP) in this study, that might interact with IR. The physical and functional interactions between mcIRBP and IR were clearly analyzed in the present study. Photo-cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry showed that three regions (17-21, 34-40, and 59-66 residues) located on mcIRBP physically interacted with leucine-rich repeat domain and cysteine-rich region of IR. IR-binding assay showed that the binding behavior of mcIRBP and insulin displayed a cooperative manner. After binding to IR, mcIRBP activated the kinase activity of IR by (5.87 ± 0.45)-fold, increased the amount of phospho-IR protein by (1.31 ± 0.03)-fold, affected phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathways, and consequently stimulated the uptake of glucose in 3T3-L1 cells by (1.36 ± 0.12)-fold. Intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 nmol/kg mcIRBP significantly decreased the blood glucose levels by 20.9 ± 3.2% and 10.8 ± 3.6% in normal and diabetic mice, respectively. Microarray analysis showed that mcIRBP affected genes involved in insulin signaling transduction pathway in mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that mcIRBP is a novel IRBP that binds to sites different from the insulin-binding sites on IR and stimulates both the glucose uptake in cells and the glucose clearance in mice.

11444260099	Activation of activator protein 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in human hepatocellular transformation	Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common tumors worldwide. Activator protein 1 (AP-1) is a nuclear transcription factor, and its transactivation is required for transformation in several cell lines. However, no direct correlation between AP-1 activity and human hepatocellular transformation has been proved. Here we analyzed the role of AP-1 on the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced human hepatocellular transformation. TPA promoted the formation of anchorage-independent colonies, induced the AP-1 activity, and enhanced the DNA-binding ability of AP-1 in human hepatocytes. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) was increased by TPA and the TPA-induced AP-1 activity was inhibited by PD98059, indicating that TPA-induced AP-1 activation was via ERK pathway. Moreover, retinoic acid and PD98059, which inhibited the AP-1 activity, abolished the TPA-induced transformation. Our findings indicated that AP-1 and ERKs activations were required for TPA-induced human hepatocellular transformation. These studies suggested that AP-1 could be the target for the development of antihepatocellular transformation agents. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.
