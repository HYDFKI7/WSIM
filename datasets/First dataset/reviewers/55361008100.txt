84942284382	Multilevel cage-assisted anterior decompression and fusion for cervical spondylosis: Long-term outcomes in 20 cases	BACKGROUND: Ideal method for spinal fusion is interbody fusion, which was firstly applied by Robinson and Smith in 1955 on the removal of herniated intervertebral discs through the anterior cervical approach, followed by interbody grafting. Subsequently the presumption of interbody contents emerges to promote spinal fusion. The spinal interbody fusion has achieved significant developments and is considered one of standard treatments for spinal degeneration. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term efficacy of multilevel anterior cervical decompression and cage-assisted fusion for cervical spondylosis. METHODS: From October 2000 to October 2002, twenty cases with cervical spondylosis underwent three-level cage-assisted anterior cervical depression and fusion in the 306 Hospital of Chinese PLA (including 15 males and 5 females). The involved patients aged 48-65 years, with mean 56.4 years. The affected lesions were observed at the C<inf>4-7</inf>level in 12 cases and at the C3-6 level in 8 cases. JOA scores were recorded before treatment and at final follow-up to evaluate the improvement rate. Clinical results were graded using the Odom criteria. Radiological results at the anterioposterior and lateral film positions were observed before and after treatment, as well as at final follow-up. Cervical spine curvature (Cobb angle) was measured before and after treatment. Adjacent segment degeneration and graft fusion rate were observed upon final follow-up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: All 20 patients were successfully operated. No neurological and fixation-related complications occurred. The follow-up period was arranged from 10 to 132 months. The JOA score was (9.85 ± 0.81) preoperatively and (14.40 ± 0.94) postoperatively, showing significant difference. The average JOA improvement rate was 81%. Odom grading at final follow-ups included 14 excellent cases, 4 good cases, and 2 fair cases. No adjacent segment lesions were observed, Cage sedimentation was visible in two cases, and cervical curve maintained good. Graft fusion rate was 100% at final follow-up. Radiograph analysis indicated that, Cobb angle of cervical lordosis was significantly higher at postoperative 1 year and at final follow-up compared with preoperative measurement (P < 0.01), and no difference was significant between postoperative 1 year and final follow-up (P > 0.05). Multilevel cage-assisted anterior cervical decompression and fusion is an effective and safe way for multilevel cervical spondylosis and the long-term outcomes are good.

33645054573	Nodal signals pattern vertebrate embryos	Vertebrate embryonic patterning requires several conserved inductive signals-including Nodal, Bmp, Wnt and Fgf signals. Nodal, which is a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, activates a signal transduction pathway that is similar to that of other TGFβ members. Nodal genes, which have been identified in numerous vertebrate species, are expressed in specific cell types and tissues during embryonic development. Nodal signal transduction has been shown to play a pivotal role in inducing and patterning mesoderm and endoderm, and in regulating neurogenesis and left-right axis asymmetry. Antagonists, which act at different steps in the Nodal signal transduction pathway, have been shown to tightly modulate the inductive activity of Nodal. © Birkhäuser Verlag, 2006.

33646836098	Activation and roles of ALK4/ALK7-mediated maternal TGFβ signals in zebrafish embryo	Activin, Nodal, and Vg1, members of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, transduce signal through type I receptors ALK4 or ALK7 and play important roles in mesoderm induction and patterning during vertebrate embryogenesis. However, the timing and magnitude of the ALK4/ALK7-mediated maternal TGFβ signals are not clear. SB-431542 is identified as an inhibitor of the ALK4/ALK5/ALK7-mediated TGFβ signals and its specificity in vertebrate embryos has not been reported. We demonstrate that SB-431542 is able to specifically and reproducibly block the Smad2/3-mediated TGFβ signals in zebrafish embryo. Embryos exposed to SB-431542 exhibit various defects phenocopying Nodal-deficient mutants. SB-431542 treatments starting at different cell cycles before the midblastula transition lead to different degrees of developmental defects in mesoderm induction and patterning, suggesting that maternal TGFβ signals are activated right after fertilization and required for mesoderm formation and patterning. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33746751550	Tob1 Controls Dorsal Development of Zebrafish Embryos by Antagonizing Maternal β-Catenin Transcriptional Activity	Maternal β-catenin and Nodal signals are essential for the formation of the dorsal organizer, which, in turn, induces neural and other dorsal tissue development in vertebrate embryos. Tob (Transducer of ErbB2) proteins possess antiproliferative properties and are known to influence BMP signaling, but their relationship to other signaling pathways and to embryonic patterning in general was unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that zebrafish tob1a is required for correct dorsoventral patterning. Mechanistically, Tob1a inhibits β-catenin transcriptional activity by physically associating with β-catenin and preventing the formation of β-catenin/LEF1 complexes. Although Tob1a can also inhibit the transcriptional activity of the Nodal effector Smad3, its role in limiting dorsal development is executed primarily by antagonizing the β-catenin signal. We further demonstrate that Tob family members across species share similar biochemical properties and biological activities. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33747810132	Structure-activity relationship of surfactant for preparing DMFC anodic catalyst	Three kinds of surfactants as stabilizer were applied to the preparation of electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The catalysts have been characterized by examining their catalytic activities, morphologies and particle sizes by means of cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is found that the surfactants with different structures have a significantly influence on the catalyst shape and activity. The catalysts prepared with non-ionic surfactants as the stabilizer show higher activity for direct oxidation of methanol. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis has been explored and the effect of hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB value) has also been discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33749871479	Generation of mutants with developmental defects in zebrafish by ENU mutagenesis	As a good model for studying early development of vertebrates, zebrafish (Danio rerio) is attracting more and more attention. Following ENU mutagenesis, 320 F2 families were established. Mutants, which showed defects in epiboly, axis, somite, head, and cardiac and blood systems, were identified by observing morphological changes in F3 embryos. So far, 35 mutant lines have been established, the majority of which showed anomalies in axis and somite formation. These mutant lines provide useful genetic resources for cloning of the mutant genes and for studying mechanisms of early development of vertebrate embryos.

33846117854	Treatment of acute retinal necrosis with complicated retinal detachment	• Aim: To analyze the clinical characteristics of retinal detachment following the acute retinal necrosis (ARN), and evaluate the effect of vitrectomy in the management of ARN. • Methods: Sixteen cases (16 eyes) of ARN with complicated retinal detachment had undertaken vitrectomy. Five eyes with giant hole, 9 eyes with multiple netlike holes peripherally, and 2 eyes with exudation and necrosis on the retina. When the diagnosis established, 200-400μ g Ganciclovir was injected into the vitreous cavity. During the first surgery, 5 eyes were tamponaded with silicone oil and 3 eyes with long-effect gas in eyes with course < 2 months. Seven eyes were tamponaded with silicone oil and 1 eye with long-effect gas in eyes with course >2 months. • Results: Followed up from 16 to 39 months. The rate of retinal attachment in eyes with course < 2 months was 100%, visual acuity increased in 10 eyes and >0.05 in 6 eyes. The rate of retinal attachment in eyes with course >2 months was 88%, visual acuity increased in 5 eyes and > 0.05 in 3 eyes. • Conclusion: ARN may cause complicated retinal detachment. The vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade seems an effective method for the acute retinal necrosis. The main reason restrict the visual acuity improvement is the concurrent pathology change of the retina, choroid, optic nerve, blood vessels and macular scar. Therefor, early diagnosis is the key for increasing success ratio and visual acuity.

34347209975	Determination of metastasis-associated proteins in non-small cell lung cancer by comparative proteomic analysis	The development of metastasis is the leading cause of death and an enormous therapeutic challenge in cases of non-small cell lung cancer. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastasis process and to discover novel potential clinical markers for non-small cell lung cancer, comparative proteomic analysis of two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials, the non-metastatic CL1-0 and highly metastatic CL1-5 cell lines, was carried out using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. Thirty-three differentially expressed proteins were identified unambiguously, among which 16 proteins were significantly upregulated and 17 proteins were downregulated in highly metastatic CL1-5 cells compared with non-metastatic CL1-0 cells. Subsequently, 8 of 33 identified proteins were selected for further validation at the mRNA level using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and three identified proteins, S100A11, PGP 9.5 and HSP27, were confirmed by western blotting. The protein S100A11 displaying significant differential expression at both the protein and mRNA levels was further analyzed by immunohistochemical staining in 65 primary non-small cell lung cancer tissues and 10 matched local positive lymph node specimens to explore its relationship with metastasis. The results indicated that the upregulation of S100A11 expression in non-small cell lung cancer tissues was significantly associated with higher tumor-node-metastasis stage (P = 0.001) and positive lymph node status (P = 0.011), implying that S100A11 might be an important regulatory molecule in promoting invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer. © 2007 Japanese Cancer Association.

37749036751	Electrochemical characteristics of trioxane	In the present communication, the electrooxidation of trioxane (1, 3, 5-trioxane) was studied as a new fuel for direct-oxidation-type fuel cells. Direct-oxidation-type fuel cells have attracted much attention in recent years for the potential application as portable power sources; it can convert energy directly to electrical energy with high efficiency and low emission of pollution. Trioxane is a solid and favors the logistics of safe transportation as a fuel. The electro-oxidation and electro-sorption characteristics of this fuel at platinum electrode were investigated with electrochemical methods. The cyclic voltammetric result suggests that the electro-oxidation processes occur via chemisorption steps followed by surface reactions of adsorbed intermediates. The rate of electro-oxidation changed with the change of concentration of trioxane, acidity and temperature. The electro-oxidation of trioxane is carried out by an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis step in sulfuric acid solutions.

38149033666	A VO-based two-stage replica replacement algorithm	Due to high latency of the Internet, it becomes a challenge to access large and widely distributed data quickly and efficiently on data grids. Replication is a process to address this issue, by storing data in different locations to reduce access latency and improve data locality. However, because of the limited storage capacity, a good replica replacement algorithm is needed to improve the efficiency of the access to the replicas. In this paper, a VO-based two-stage replica replacement algorithm is proposed, which provides a good solution to deal with the relations between value and cost. In a VO, replica value is determined according to popularity to make sure which replica will be replaced, and the bandwidth is predicted to make replacement cost as low as possible. Experiments show that compared with traditional replacement algorithms our new replica replacement algorithm shows better performance and efficiency of the data access on Data Grids. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.

77954643708	Candidate variants at 6p21.33 and 6p22.1 and risk of non-small cell lung cancer in a Chinese population	Chromosome 6p21.33, containing BAT3 and MSH5 genes, together with chromosome 6p22.1 were recently identified as susceptible regions for lung cancer in Caucasian populations. These findings interest us in assessing whether genetic variants in these regions also contribute to lung cancer risk in Chinese populations. We genotyped the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs9295740) reported in Caucasian populations at Chromosome 6p22.1 and one common potentially functional variant (rs2075789) located at exon 2 of MSH5 in a case-control study including 1009 histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 1127 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. We found that the distributions of genotypes of both SNPs between cases and controls were not significantly different (P = 0.624 for rs9295740 and P = 0.937 for rs2075789). Logistic regression analyses revealed neither of the two SNPs was significantly associated with altered risk of NSCLC in dominant or recessive genetic models. When we compared the combined variant genotypes (GA+AA) with the common homozygote GG, assuming a dominant genetic model, the adjusted Ors were 1.03 (95% CI = 0.86-1.25) for rs9295740 and 1.03 (95% CI = 0.85-1.25) for rs2075789. In addition, no significant associations were observed in subgroups stratified by age, gender, smoking status or histologic types. Our results indicate that the most significant SNP rs9295740 identified in Caucasians in 6p22.1 and the potentially functional SNP rs2075789 in 6p21.33, seem not applicable to Chinese populations as susceptible markers for lung cancer. Re-sequencing and fine-mapping this region, along with extensive functional evaluations, is required.

79951965021	Concurrency-related complexities in network programming	The Internet has become a vital information infrastructure for modern society. However, the concurrent nature of network introduces a wide-range of difficulties in traditional programming methodology in developing high-quality network programs that significantly reduce productivity. The influence of concurrency on the complexity of software development is comparable to the "concurrency crisis" of software brought by multi-core processors, but it receives much less attention here than what it deserves. There is no universal approach to cope with this issue, and there are even disagreements between different approaches. In this paper, the basic concurrency models and their implementations are introduced, and then the paper surveys the inherent complexities of these approaches, comparing their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, this paper offers an opinion on the possibilities for future research on this topic. © Copyright 2011, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

80052621329	Hypothesis of optineurin as a new common risk factor in normal-tension glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease	Growing evidences suggest a link between normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both of them are progressive neurodegenerative disorders. Recently researches provide a clue that optineurin may be a new common underlying risk factor involved in NTG and AD. OPTINEURIN (OPTN) gene coding for " optineurin" protein is identified as the causative gene in NTG. Interestingly, optineurin was also found in neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites in AD, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. This suggested a new hypothesis for neurodegeneration in AD involving chronic optineurin neurotoxicity, mimicking NTG at the molecular level. A theoretical relationship between optineurin, NTG and AD seems to exist. Indicating that optineurin may play a role in both NTG and AD will shed new light on the link between these two diseases and lead to a better understanding of the common mechanisms underlying NTG and AD. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The level of methylation in genome and certain regions should be in a normal range, because any variation would cause physiological dysfunction. In account of essential roles of DNA methylation in the living system, the detection of methylation in both overall genome and specific positions has drawn great interest. So far many biological and chemical methods have been developed to detect DNA methylation.

We reported our findings for the existence of G-quadruplex structures in promoter region of oncogenes confirmed by G-quadruplex DNA cross-linking strategy. Probes for selective G-quadruplex cross-linking was designed and synthesized that show high selectivity for G-quadruplex cross-linking. Further biological studies demonstrated its good inhibition activity against murine melanoma cells. To further investigate if G-quadruplex DNA was formed in vivo and as the target, a derivative was synthesized and pull-down process toward chromosome DNAs combined with circular dichroism and high throughput deep sequencing were performed. Several simulated intracellular conditions, including X. laevis oocytes, Ficoll 70 and PEG, was used to investigate the compound's pure cross-linking ability upon preformed G-quadruplex. Thus, as a potent G-quadruplex cross-linking agent, our strategy provided both valuable evidence of G-quadruplex structures in vivo and intense potential in anti-cancer therapy.

The resulting artificial receptor has been extensively used in areas that require molecular recognition. Nevertheless, various imprinted materials synthesized using conventional imprinting protocols have low binding capacities and slow binding kinetics because of difficulty in extracting the original templates and high resistance to mass transfer. The combination of molecular imprinting and nanostructured materials is expected to overcome such difficulties. In this work, template molecules were attached onto the electrospun fibers and by using electrospun nanofibers and attached molecules as sacrificial templates, surface molecularly imprinted membranes with bi-, tri- or tetramodal pore structures were fabricated in the absence or presence of SiO

84896980834	Promise and challenge: The lens model as a biomarker for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia pathologically characterized by cerebral amyloid-beta (A β) deposition. Early and accurate diagnosis of the disease still remains a big challenge. There is evidence that A β aggregation starts to occur years before symptoms arise. Noninvasive monitoring of A β plaques is critical for both the early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. Presently, there is a major effort on looking for a reasonably priced technology capable of diagnosing AD by detecting the presence of A β. Studies suggest that AD is systemic rather than brain-limited focus diseases and the aggregation of the disease-causing proteins also takes place in lens except the brain. There is a possible relationship between AD and a specific subtype of age-related cataract (supranuclear cataract). If similar abnormal protein deposits are present in the lens, it would facilitate non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. However, there are controversies on the issues related to performance and validation of A β deposition in lens as biomarkers for early detection of AD. Here we review the recent findings concerning A β deposition in the lenses of AD patients and evaluate if the ocular lens can provide a biomarker for AD. © 2014 Tian Tian et al.

84897541135	Active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates nmda receptor mediated postischemic long-term potentiation (i-LTP) by promoting the interaction between CaMKII and NMDA receptors in ischemia	Active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been reported to take a critical role in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Changes in CaMKII activity were detected in various ischemia models. It is tempting to know whether and how CaMKII takes a role in NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated postischemic long-term potentiation (NMDA i-LTP). Here, we monitored changes in NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA fEPSPs) at different time points following ischemia onset in vitro oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) ischemia model. We found that 10 min OGD treatment induced significant i-LTP in NMDA fEPSPs, whereas shorter (3 min) or longer (25 min) OGD treatment failed to induce prominent NMDA i-LTP. CaMKII activity or CaMKII autophosphorylation displays a similar bifurcated trend at different time points following onset of ischemia both in vitro OGD or in vivo photothrombotic lesion (PT) models, suggesting a correlation of increased CaMKII activity or CaMKII autophosphorylation with NMDA i-LTP. Disturbing the association between CaMKII and GluN2B subunit of NMDARs with short cell-permeable peptides Tat-GluN2B reversed NMDA i-LTP induced by OGD treatment. The results provide support to a notion that increased interaction between NMDAR and CaMKII following ischemia-induced increased CaMKII activity and autophosphorylation is essential for induction of NMDA i-LTP. © 2014 Ning Wang et al.

84897585026	Potential role of retina as a biomarker for progression of Parkinson's disease	Optical coherence tomography (OCT) noninvasively quantifies the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). OCT has been studied in several neuro-ophthalmic conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies suggest that the quantitative analysis of RNFL can be precisely and noninvasively done by OCT scans and the results suggest that the thickness of RNFL is significantly decreased in patients with PD compared with age-matched controls and the foveal retinal thickness correlates with disease severity in PD. In this article, the application of OCT imaging of the retina in PD was reviewed. Literature survey of PubMed was carried out using the search terms of "Optical Coherence Tomography" combined with "Parkinson's Disease" and "retinal nerve fiber layer" (without restriction to the year of publication). Some related articles were also included. The search was completed in Jul. 2011 and revised and updated as necessary. The aim of this article is to review the current literatures on the use of optical coherence tomography in patients affected by PD and to enhance its use in clinical practice in neuro-ophthalmology.

The distribution of HOXB2 asodn in the HUVECs was observed by fluorescent labelling, and the influence of different concentrations of HOXB2 asodn on the DNA synthesis of HUVECs was assessed. Flow cytometry and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method were employed to observe the influence of HOXB2 asodn on HOXB2 expression and the HUVEC cell cycle. After the induction of liposome, the nuclear fluorescent staining of HOXB2 asodn was weaker 15 min after transfection and the staining reached the strongest level at 4-8 h but then weakened and disappeared by 16 h after transfection. This indicated that endothelial DNA synthesis could be inhibited by HOXB2 asodn in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the HUVECs could be delayed in their passage from G1 to S. Simultaneously, expression of HOXB2 mRNA had decreased significantly by 24-48 h after transfection. Clearly, HOXB2 plays important roles in the proliferation of endothelial cells and also affects the cell cycle.

44249099264	Potentially functional polymorphisms of EXO1 and risk of lung cancer in a Chinese population: A case-control analysis	Exonuclease 1 (EXO1) is an important nucleases involved in mismatch repair system that contributes to maintain genomic stability, to modulate DNA recombination, and to mediate cell cycle arrest. Potentially functional polymorphisms in EXO1 may alter cancer risks by influencing the repair activity of EXO1. Therefore, we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EXO1 were associated with risk of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped five common SNPs (rs1776177A/G, rs1047840G/A (Glu589Lys), rs1776148G/A (Gly670Glu), rs9350C/T (Leu757Pro) and rs851797T/C) that tag eight SNPs located at exon regions of EXO1 by using the Illumina high-throughput genotyping platform in 500 incident lung cancer cases and 517 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. Significant differences of allele and genotype distributions were observed in Glu589Lys (rs1047840) of EXO1 between the cases and controls (P = 0.028 and 0.025 for allele and genotype distributions, respectively). Logistic regression analyses revealed that individuals carrying the variant 589Lys allele (589Glu/Lys or 589Lys/Lys) had a significantly increased risk of lung cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 1.09-1.84] compared with those who carried the wild-type homozygote (589Glu/Glu). Furthermore, we found that haplotype AAGTT was more frequent in cases than in controls (P < 0.001 for both two-sided χ

46749147615	Genetic variants of miRNA sequences and non-small cell lung cancer survival	Recent evidence indicates that small noncoding RNA molecules known as microRNAs (miRNAs) can function as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Mutation, misexpression, and altered mature miRNA processing are implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Because SNPs in pre-miRNAs could alter miRNA processing, expression, and/or binding to target mRNA, we conducted a systematic survey of common premiRNA SNPs and their surrounding regions and evaluated in detail the association of 4 of these SNPs with the survival of individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). When we assumed that disease susceptibility was inherited as a recessive phenotype, we found that the rs11614913 SNP in hsa-mir-196a2 was associated with survival in individuals with NSCLC. Specifically, survival was significantly decreased in individuals who were homozygous CC at SNP rs11614913. In the genotype-phenotype correlation analysis of 23 human lung cancer tissue samples, rs11614913 CC was associated with a statistically significant increase in mature hsa-mir-196a expression but not with changes in levels of the precursor, suggesting enhanced processing of the pre-miRNA to its mature form. Furthermore, binding assays revealed that the rs11614913 SNP can affect binding of mature hsa-mir-196a2-3p to its target mRNA. Therefore, the rs11614913 SNP in hsa-mir-196a2 may be a prognostic biomarker for NSCLC. Further characterization of miRNA SNPs may open new avenues for the study of cancer and therapeutic interventions.

Due to high latency of the Internet, large amounts of data need to be replicated in multiple copies at several distributed sites. However, the storage capacity is limited. So a good replacement algorithm is important to the efficiency of the access to the replicas. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based two-stage replica replacement algorithm. This algorithm achieves a good balance between value and cost by predicting replica value to make sure which replica will be replaced, and predicting the replacement cost to make it as low as possible. Simulation results show that compared with traditional replacement algorithms our prediction-based two-stage replica replacement algorithm shows better performance and efficiency of the data access on Data Grids. ©2007 IEEE.

Therefore, the expression of UBE2T mRNA was examined in normal human tissues and 8 lung cancer cell lines. Subsequently, UBE2T expression was analyzed in 41 lung cancer tissues by PCR and Western blots, as well as in 103 lung cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry. To further elucidate the possible functional role of UBE2T, the protein was overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. UBE2T mRNA was highly expressed in all lung cancer cell lines examined, while it could not be detected in normal lung tissue. UBE2T was detected in 75.6% of primary lung cancer tissue samples (n = 41) at mRNA level and in 60.9% at protein level. In addition, positive UBE2T staining was observed in 61% of lung cancer specimens (n = 103), particularly in all immunohistochemically stained small cell carcinoma tissues. In normal lung tissue, only weak staining was observed in the basal cells of bronchial epithelium. Overexpression of UBE2T in NIH3T3 cells significantly promoted colony formation in soft agar medium (p < 0.001). In conclusion, UBE2T was significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissue and cell lines, suggesting involvement of UBE2T in the malignant cell phenotype. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

48149108930	EGF promoter SNPs, plasma EGF levels and risk of breast cancer in Chinese women	Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a potent mitogenic peptide, plays an important role in the development of cancers, including breast cancer. Previous studies showed that plasma EGF levels may influence the risk of cancer. In the current study, we hypothesized that genetic variants in the promoter region of EGF may influence plasma EGF levels and therefore are associated with breast cancer susceptibility. We genotyped three EGF polymorphisms (G61A, G-1380A, and A-1744G) in the promoter region by PCR-RFLP and measured plasma EGF levels using an enzyme immunoassay in a case-control study of Chinese women. We found that the mean plasma EGF levels in breast cancer patients (249.06 ± 197.54 pg/ml) were significantly lower than those in controls (982.41 ± 375.57 pg/ml, P < 0.001). There was a significant difference of plasma EGF levels among different genotypes carriers of the G-1380A locus in 654 controls (P = 0.007). After adjustment for age, body mass index, family history of cancer, age at menarche, and menopause status, EGF-1380AA carriers had significantly higher plasma EGF levels than -1380GG carriers did (P = 0.003). However, we did not find any significant associations between the three EGF polymorphisms (G61A, G-1380A, and A-1744G) and the risk of breast cancer. These findings indicated that plasma EGF levels served as a protective marker against breast cancer in our study and EGF G-1380A variant might be a modifier on it. Further studies are warranted to verify these findings. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The CTL antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a vital negative regulator of T-cell activation and proliferation. This study examined whether genetic polymorphisms in CTLA-4 are associated with cancer susceptibility. A two-stage investigation using haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphism approach and multiple independent case-control analyses was performed to assess the association between CTLA-4 genotypes and cancer risk. Functional relevance of the polymorphisms was examined by biochemical assays. We found that the 49G>A polymorphism in the CTLA-4 leading sequence causing

56349169767	ERCC6/CSB gene polymorphisms and lung cancer risk	Nucleotide excision repair (NER) enzymes are critical for the removal of bulky DNA adducts caused by environmental carcinogens such as smoking. Of them, Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB), coded by ERCC6, recruits NER repair factors to the DNA damage site and plays an important role in the repair process. Genetic variants of ERCC6 may alter the regulation of DNA repair and therefore were hypothesized to be associated with altered risk of smoking-related lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped eight tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) and three potentially functional SNPs of ERCC6 in 500 incident lung cancer cases and 517 controls in a Chinese population. Single locus analyses showed that none of the single SNP alone had the significant main affect on the risk of lung cancer. However, the combined variant genotypes of the four loci with P

We hypothesized that genetic variants in MBD4 were associated with lung cancer risk. We selected and genotyped three tagging SNPs (rs2311394, rs140693, and rs2005618) of MBD4 using the illumina SNP genotyping BeadLab platform in a case-control study of 500 incident lung cancer patients and 517 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. We observed a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer associated with the rs140693 GA genotype (adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52-0.93), and the combined rs140693 GA/AA variant genotypes (adjusted OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.58-1.00), compared with the wild-type homozygote rs140693 GG. The reduced lung cancer risk in non-smokers carrying rs140693 GA/AA genotypes was more predominant (adjusted OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.35-0.87). However, there was no statistic evidence of gene-smoking interaction. These findings suggest that genetic variants of MBD4 rs140693 may modulate risk of lung cancer. Further larger case-control and functional studies are needed to validate these findings. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

58349085976	A replica replacement algorithm based on value-cost prediction	Data Grid is a new kind of data management infrastructure. To improve access efficiency, large amounts of data on Data Grids need to be replicated in the form of replicas at distributed sites. Due to the limited storage capacity, a good replica replacement algorithm is needed. This paper proposes a replica replacement algorithm based on value-cost prediction, which achieves a good balance between value and cost. The algorithm predicts replica value to select replicas that will be replaced in the first stage, and predicts the bandwidth to make replacement cost as low as possible in the second stage. Simulation shows that compared with traditional replacement algorithms our replica replacement algorithm contributes to better grid performance. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

58349104128	Common genetic variants in pre-microRNAs were associated with increased risk of breast cancer in Chinese women	Small, noncoding RNA molecules, called microRNAs (miRNAs), are thought to function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNAs may change their property through altering miRNA expression and/or maturation, and thus they may have an effect on thousands of target mRNAs, resulting in diverse functional consequences. However, it remains largely unknown whether miRNA SNPs may alter cancer susceptibility. We evaluated the associations of selected four SNPs (rs2910164, rs2292832, rs11614913, and rs3746444) in pre-miRNAs (hsa-mir-146a, hsa-mir-149, hsa-mir-196a2, and hsa-mir-499) with breast cancer risk in a case-control study of 1,009 breast cancer cases and 1,093 cancer-free controls in a population of Chinese women and we found that hsa-mir-196a2 rs11614913:T>C and hsa-mir-499 rs3746444:A>G variant genotypes were associated with significantly increased risks of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.48 for rs11614913:T>C; and OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.51 for rs3746444:A>G in a dominant genetic model) in a dose-effect manner (P for trend was 0.010 and 0.037, respectively). These findings suggest, for the first time, that common SNPs in miRNAs may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. Further functional characterization of miRNA SNPs and their influences on target mRNAs may provide underlying mechanisms for the observed associations and disease etiology. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

58149262992	Association of human aryl hydrocarbon receptor gene polymorphisms with risk of lung cancer among cigarette smokers in a Chinese population	Background and objective Most of the carcinogenic effects of poiycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in tobacco smoke are mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates tobacco-induced expression of carcinogen metabolic enzymes. We hypothesized that genetic variations in AHR might confer individual susceptibility to lung cancer. Methods Eight selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms in AHR were genotyped using the lllumina SNP genotyping BeadLab platform in a case-control study of 500 lung cancer patients and 517 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. Results We found that significantly increased lung cancer risk was associated with heterozygous genotypes of rs2158041 (adjusted odds ratio=1.53 and 95% confidence interval=1.17-1.99 for GA, compared with the GG genotype) and rs7811989 (adjusted odds ratio=1.48 and 95% confidence interval = 1.13-1.93 for GA, compared with the GG genotype), although these two single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed significant differences in haplotype distributions of AHR between cases and controls (Global P= 1.38e-5). We also observed statistically significant interaction between the polymorphism rs2066853 (p.Arg554Lys) and cumulative cigarette smoking as a discrete or continuous variable (P= 0.033 and 0.019, respectively), and the Lys/Lys genotype conferred an increased risk of lung cancer in the heavy smokers (adjusted odds ratio = 3.36 and 95% confidence interval = 1.07-10.55). Conclusion These findings suggest that AHR polymorphisms and potential gene-smoking interaction may be involved in the etiology of lung cancer. Further large prospective studies with ethnically diverse populations and functional studies are warranted to validate these findings.

60849100482	Both foxj1a and foxj1b are implicated in left-right asymmetric development in zebrafish embryos	The HNF-3/HFH-4/Foxj1, a transcription factor, has been reported to be involved in systemic autoimmunity and cilia genesis in vertebrates. The zebrafish genome expressed two paralogous foxj1 genes, foxj1a and foxj1b. In this study, we demonstrate that down-regulation of either foxj1a or foxj1b by injecting antisense morpholino at the one-cell stage results in randomized expression of the early left-right (LR) asymmetric markers lefty2, southpaw, pitx2c and the later internal organ markers tpm4-tv1, cmlc2, cp in zebrafish embryos. Overexpression of foxj1a and foxj1b by injecting synthetic mRNAs also disrupts normal LR asymmetries. These data indicate that the two foxj1 genes are required for normal laterality development in zebrafish embryos. In contrast to foxj1b knockdown exclusively in dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) that has little effect on laterality, foxj1a knockdown in DFCs randomizes the LR patterns of the markers. Thus, foxj1a regulates asymmetric development through DFCs in a cell-autonomous fashion but foxj1b functions indirectly. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

63449112390	Putative functional polymorphisms of MMP9 predict survival of NSCLC in a Chinese population	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in cancer progression and their over-expression is often associated with unfavorable survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because genetic variants can alter expression level or biological activity of MMPs, we hypothesized that potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key MMP genes may be associated with the survival of NSCLC patients. We selected and genotyped 14 putative functional SNPs in six MMP genes (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9 and MMP12) using PCR-RFLP methods in 561 NSCLC patients. Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used for the survival analyses. The C-1562T, Arg279Gln and Arg668Gln polymorphisms in MMP9 were significantly associated with survival of patients with NSCLC (log-rank p values 5 0.032, 0.038 and 0.036, respectively). The C-1562T and Arg668Gln loci were in complete linkage disequilibrium (r2 5 1). Patients carrying the 668Gln allele had improved survival with a median survival time (MST) of 51.6 months, compared with 21.8 months for those with the 668Arg/Arg genotype (log-rank p 5 0.010). In contrast, the 279Gln/Gln genotype was associated with a significantly shortened MST (17.3 months, log-rank p 5 0.030) in the recessive model. In the final multivariate Cox regression model, 279Gln/Gln was identified as an independent prognostic factor with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.07-2.41). The MMP9 Arg279Gln and Arg668Gln SNPs are potential predictors of survival in NSCLC patients. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, replica value determination methods applied now do not perform well, because they cannot well adapt to the changes offile access patterns. We address this problem by introducing a new replica value determination method through data mining, and based on this method we propose a prefetching-based replication algorithm in a virtual organization (VO) environment in order to carry out a better replication optimization. The major idea of this algorithm is to make use of the characteristic that members in a VO have similar interests of file. Experiments show that compared with traditional replication algorithms our new replication algorithm shows better performance and efficiency in Data Grid. © 2008 IEEE.

The morphology, microstructure and thermal stability of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, environmental scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The results show that the structure of titania nanotube arrays is stable at 500 ° C or below, and the crystallized hydroxyapatite could be formed from hydroxyapatite precursor sol after calcining at 500 ° C for 4 h. The optimum calcining temperature for this material is 500 ° C. An obvious apatite layer formed on the surface of the embedded-style material after soaking in simulated body fluid for 5 days, indicating that the material possesses a good in vitro apatite forming ability on its surface.

66749114836	Common genetic variants on 5p15.33 contribute to risk of lung adenocarcinoma in a Chinese population	Chromosome 5p15.33, containing TERT and CLPTM1L genes, was recently identified as one of the susceptible regions for lung cancer in Caucasian populations. We hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in this region in Caucasians are also important in the development of lung cancer in Chinese population. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped two most significant SNPs reported in Caucasians, rs2736100A/C and rs402710C/T at 5p15.33, in a case-control study with 1221 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 1344 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. We found that rs2736100C allele in TERT gene was associated with a significantly increased risk of NSCLC with adjusted odds ratios of 1.26 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.51] and 1.31 (95% CI = 1.04-1.66) for one or two copies of the variant C allele, respectively. This significant association was more prominent among female (P for heterogeneity: 0.044), non-smokers (P for heterogeneity: 0.054) and/or the subjects with adenocarcinoma (P for heterogeneity: 0.058). However, no significant association was found between rs402710C/T and NSCLC risk. These results suggest that genetic variants in 5p15.33, especially in TERT gene, may also predispose the susceptibility of lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, in Chinese population. © The Author 2009.

66649084915	A functional genetic variant in microRNA-196a2 is associated with increased susceptibility of lung cancer in Chinese	microRNAs (miRNA) are a new class of non-protein-coding, small RNAs that function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. They participate in diverse biological pathways and function as gene regulators. Recently, we conducted a survey of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in miRNA sequences and reported that, among four SNPs (rs2910164, rs2292832, rs11614913, and rs3746444) in pre-miRNAs, rs11614913 in miR-196a2 might affect mature miR-196a expression and target mRNA-binding activity and was significantly associated with non-small cell lung cancer survival. However, it remains largely unknown whether miRNA SNPs may alter lung cancer susceptibility. In the current study, we evaluated associations between the above four SNPs in pre-miRNAs and lung cancer susceptibility in a case-control study of 1,058 incident lung cancer patients and 1,035 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. We found that miR-196a2 rs11614913 variant homozygote CC was associated with f25% significantly increased risk of lung cancer compared with their wild-type homozygote TT and heterozygote TC (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.54). However, no significant effects were observed on the association between the other three SNPs and lung cancer risk. These findings suggest that functional SNP rs11614913 in miR-196a2 could also contribute to lung cancer susceptibility. Copyright © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

The morphology of the final products strongly depended on the volume ratio of hydrazine hydrate and diethanolamine. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) explorations indicated that the as-prepared ZnSe nanoribbons were mostly about 40 nm in thickness, 100 nm in width, and 50 μm in length. X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations confirmed that resulting ZnSe nanoribbons are wurtzite structures and have a [0 0 1] growth direction. PL (photoluminescence) spectrum of the products exhibited a visible light emission. Based on these investigations, the products were expected to find wide applications in optoelectronic, field emission and catalytic fields. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, we found that a genetic variant of rs11614913 in the miR-196a2 sequence could alter mature miR-196a expression and target mRNA binding; this observation led us to hypothesize that rs11614913 might influence susceptibility to sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD). We conducted a three-stage case-control study of CHD in Chinese to test our hypothesis by genotyping miR-196a2 rs11614913 and three other pre-miRNA SNPs (miR-146a rs2910164, miR-149 rs2292832, and miR-499 rs3746444) in 1,324 CHD cases and 1,783 non-CHD controls.

70349233884	Tumorigenic role of orphan nuclear receptor NR0B1 in lung adenocarcinoma	Cancer stem cells are a limited population of tumor cells that are thought to reconstitute whole tumors. The Hoechst dye exclusion assay revealed that tumors are composed of both a main population and a side population of cells, which are rich in cancer stem cells. NR0B1 is an orphan nuclear receptor that is expressed to a greater extent in the side population, as compared with the main population, of a lung adenocarcinoma cell line. In this study, we investigated the role of NR0B1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Reduction of NR0B1expression levels in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines resulted in vulnerability to anticancer drugs and decreased abilities for invasion, in vitro colony formation, and tumorigenicity in non-obese diabetic/severe compromised immunodeficient mice. When 193 cases of lung adenocarcinoma were immunohistochemically examined, higher levels of NR0B1 expression correlated with higher rates of lymph node metastasis and recurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed high NR0B1 expression levels, stage of the disease, and size of tumor to be independent unfavorable prognostic factors for overall and disease-free survival rates. In clinical samples, NR0B1 expression levels inversely correlated to the proportion of methylated CpG sequences around the transcription initiation site of the NR0B1 gene, suggesting the epigenetic control of NR0B1 transcription in lung adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, NR0B1 might play a role in the malignant potential of lung adenocarcinoma. Copyright © American Society for Investigative Pathology.

70349947392	A zebrafish gene trap line expresses GFP recapturing expression pattern of foxj1b	Foxj1 has been found to play an important role in cilia formation and function in vertebrates. The zebrafish or Xenopus genome expresses two Foxj1 genes, foxj1a/FoxJ1 and foxj1b/FoxJ1.2. In this study, we have generated a zebrafish transgenic line T2BGSZ10 by To l 2 transposon-based gene trapping approach. T2BGSZ10 transgenic fish carry an insertion of the transposon genome into the first intron of the foxj1b locus. This insertion results in GFP expression in the forebrain, otic vesicles, floorplate, pronephric ducts and other domains during embryogenesis, which recaptures the expression pattern of foxj1b. Although normal expression of foxj1b is dramatically reduced, T2BGSZ10 homozygous embryos develop normally and grow to adulthood without detectable defects, which may be due to the incomplete interruption of foxj1b expression. Nevertheless, this transgenic line may serve as a useful model for dynamic observation of GFP-labeled tissues and organs and for isolation of GFP-labeled cells. © 2009 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

Alkyl self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) made of 1-tetradecene coupled to hydrideterminated Si(111) surface through robust silicon-carbon covalent bonds was employed as a resist layer. The SAM covered silicon substrate was then treated with dilute hydrofluoride, and subsequent used in AFM lithography. By varying the applied bias and pulse duration, both negative and positive patterns can be fabricated via this approach, such as Si pores and oxide dots. The results indicated that the HF-ethanol treatment of SAMs plays an important role in forming negative nanopatterns in situ. In particular, the Si pore structure formation was related to the reaction between F-buried inside the SAM and silicon substrate under the effect of tip electric field.

Circulating levels and functional polymorphisms of IGF1 and IGFBP3 may be biomarkers of cancer development. However, the results of published studies remain conflicting rather than conclusive. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for all published studies related to circulating levels and polymorphisms of IGF1 and IGFBP3 and cancer risk. In all, 96 studies and over 110000 subjects were available for this meta-analysis. Higher IGF1 circulating levels significantly increased 15% of cancer risk (odds ratio (OR), 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.29), especially among prostate, pre-menopausal breast and colorectal cancer patients, whereas higher concentrations of IGFBP3 significantly decreased the risk of advanced prostate cancer by 56% (OR, 0.44, 95% CI, 0.25-0.77). Meanwhile, IGFBP3 -202CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer with borderline significance (OR, 1.18, 95% CI, 0.99-1.41). Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses showed that circulating levels of IGFBP3 could be modified by its promoter polymorphism A-202C (P < 0.001). In conclusion, circulating levels of IGF1, IGFBP3 and IGFBP3 A-202C play a crucial role in carcinogenesis and could serve as susceptibility biomarkers for cancer development.

71549155642	Particle tracking carboxyl and transferrin conjugated quantum dots diffusion at living cell surface	Nanotechnologies and nanomaterials have gained much success in the fields of biological applications. In particular, quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a revolutionary means for imaging and optical detection in opposition to conventional organic dyes. For their robust photostability, large extinction coefficients, and relatively small size, QDs present superior advantages in single molecules monitoring over long time period in living cell. The interaction between functionalized QDs and living cell is the primary problem of the QDs application in living cell. In this work, carboxyl and transferrin conjugated CdS QDs were evaluated using total internal reflect fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and single particle tracking (SPT) techniques at living cell surface. The diffusion and binding were quantitively measured by mean square displacement (MSD) versus time plotting. To study the influence of different QDs surface on interaction between QDs and cell, dynamic characters of carboxyl and transferrin conjugated QDs were calculated respectively. The photonic characters of QDs were also investigated, considering that functionalized surface can lead to behavior altering of QDs under illuminating. Simultaneous imaging of several QDs with frame rates of up to 30 frames/s and localization accuracy of ∼10 nm was present. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

71549168985	14-kDa phosphohistidine phosphatase and its role in human lung cancer cell migration and invasion	14-kDa phosphohistidine phosphatase (PHP14) was the first protein histidine phosphatase to be discovered, but its biological function remains unclear. In our previous study, we found that it was associated with tumor invasion. Here, we investigated its role in lung cancer cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of PHP14 expression in highly metastatic lung cancer CL1-5 cells inhibited migration and invasion in vitro, but did not alter cell proliferation rates. Overexpression of PHP14 in NCI H1299 cells promoted migration and invasion in vitro, but again did not alter cell proliferation. To evaluate the metastatic properties of PHP14 in vivo, an experimental metastasis assay was performed. Experimental metastasis in vivo was extensively inhibited by PHP14 knockdown. To further examine the mechanism underlying the involvement of PHP14 in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, a comparative proteomics analysis was performed. The differential protein expression profiles revealed that PHP14 was probably involved in cytoskeletal reorganization; this was further supported by actin filament (F-actin) staining. These results demonstrate for the first time that PHP14 may be functionally important in lung cancer cell migration and the invasion of lung cancer cells, mediated partly through modulation of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77950498821	Serum microRNA signatures identified in a genome-wide serum microRNA expression profiling predict survival of non-small-cell lung cancer	Purpose: Recent findings that human serum contains stably expressed microRNA (miRNA) have revealed a great potential of serum miRNA signature as disease fingerprints to predict survival. We used genome-wide serum miRNA expression analysis to investigate the role of serum miRNA in predicting prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: To control disease heterogeneity, we used patients with stages I to IIIa lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, who were treated with both operation and adjuvant chemotherapies. In the discovery stage, Solexa sequencing followed by individual quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays was used to test the difference in levels of serum miRNAs between 30 patients with longer survival (alive and mean survival time, 49.54 months) and 30 patients with shorter survival matched by age, sex, and stage (dead and mean survival time, 9.54 months). The detected serum miRNAs then were validated in 243 patients (randomly classified into two subgroups: n = 120 for the training set, and n = 123 for the testing set). Results: Eleven serum miRNAs were found to be altered more than five-fold by Solexa sequencing between longer-survival and shorter-survival groups, and levels of four miRNAs (ie, miR-486, miR-30d, miR-1 and miR-499) were significantly associated with overall survival. The four-miRNA signature also was consistently an independent predictor of overall survival for both training and testing samples. Conclusion: The four-miRNA signature from the serum may serve as a noninvasive predictor for the overall survival of NSCLC. © 2010 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

77952090143	Tumorigenic role of podoplanin in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma	Background: Podoplanin, a mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein, is thought to be one of the cancer stem cell markers for squamous-cell carcinoma of the vulva. The objectives of the present study were to examine the role of podoplanin in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: Expression of podoplanin was examined immunohistochemically in 61 cases of ESCC that had not been treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery. Because cancer stem-cell quantities have been reported to increase with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, cases in patients who did not receive such prior therapies were included in this study. Cases with >10% tumor cells showing signals for podoplanin were categorized as podoplanin high, and the others were classified as podoplanin low. The effects of podoplanin on the behavior of cancer cells were evaluated in ESCC cell lines in which podoplanin expression was knocked down. Results: To examine whether podoplanin could be used as a cancer stem cell marker for ESCC, podoplanin-positive and podoplanin-negative fractions were sorted separately from the ESCC cell line and cultured. Podoplanin-positive ESCC cells yielded both podoplanin-positive and podoplanin-negative cells, whereas few cells were obtained from podoplanin-negative ESCC cells. When podoplanin expression was knocked down, ESCC cell lines became vulnerable to anticancer drugs and showed defective invasion and tumorigenic activities. Nineteen (31.1%) of 61 cases were categorized as podoplanin high. Podoplanin-high cases were correlated with T category, stage of disease, lymphatic and vascular invasion, recurrence, and prognosis of patients. Podoplanin-low cases showed better overall and disease-free survival. Conclusions: There is a role for podoplanin in tumorigenesis and malignant progression in ESCC. © 2010 Society of Surgical Oncology.

Results: After JWA expression was down-regulated by JWA-shRNA transfection, P-glycoprotein expression was increased in JAR and MCF-7 cells, and Rh123 retention was decreased. After JWA was over-expressed by flag-JWA transfection, P-glycoprotein expression was decreased in JAR /VP16 cells and Rh123 retention was increased. Conclusion: JWA gene can regulate the expression and transportation of P-glycoprotein in tumor cells.

77957139152	Orientation to learning context modulates retrieval processing for unrecognized words	Explicit memory errors may occur when individuals fail to retrieve information about items previously studied (item memory) or about the learning context (source memory). We examined electrophysiological measures during recognition failure in order to determine the influence of retrieval orientation for item versus source information. Recognition failure was associated with brain potentials distinct from those associated with success. Furthermore, source-memory failures were associated with earlier-onset brain potentials with a more anterior distribution compared to item-memory failures. Neurocognitive processing was thus modulated by retrieval orientation so as to differentially influence neural correlates of successful versus unsuccessful retrieval. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77957269172	Visualizing of the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of exosomes by live-cell microscopy	Cells release exosomes to transfer various molecules to other cells. Exosomes are involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes. They are emerging great potential utility for diseases diagnosis and treatment recently. However, the internalization and intracellular trafficking of exosomes have not been described clearly. In this work, exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of PC12 cells, labeled by lipophilic dye and amino-reactive fluorophore, incubated with resting PC12 cells. The results of live-cell microscopy indicated that exosomes were internalized through endocytosis pathway, trapped in vesicles, and transported to perinuclear region. Particle tracking fluorescent vesicles suggested that the active transport of exosomes may be mediated by cytoskeleton. The proteins on exosome membrane were found to be released from exosomes and trapped in lysosome. The inverted transport of lipophilic dye from perinuclear region to cell peripheries was revealed, possibly caused by recycling of the exosome lipids. This study provides new sight into the mechanisms of exosome uptake and intracellular fate. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

78449238107	Functional polymorphisms in two pre-microRNAs and cancer risk: A meta-analysis	Since the identification of two functional polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs (miR-146a rs2910164 and miR- 196a2 rs11614913), a number of studies were published in the past several years to evaluate the associations between the two SNPs and cancer risk. However, the findings remain conflicting rather than conclusive. This meta-analysis included 12 published case-control studies, 5,916 cancer patients and 6,869 control subjects for SNP rs2910164, and 6,574 cases and 7,601 controls for SNP rs11614913. The allele C of rs11614913 was associated with a significantly increased risk of overall cancers (CC vs. TT: OR=1.18; 95%CI: 1.02-1.37; CT vs. TT: OR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.02-1.21; CC/CT vs. TT: OR=1.13; 95%CI: 1.04-1.23). However, we failed to find main effects for rs2910164 on overall cancer risk in different genetic models tested, while significantly increased risk was evident among cancers other than breast (GG/GC vs. CC: OR=1.30, 95%CI: 1.03-1.64; between study heterogeneity test: P = 0.007). The two functional SNPs may represent tissue specific effect on cancer susceptibility; however, additional well-designed large studies are required for the validation of the associations.

79952467898	TDP-43 potentiates alpha-synuclein toxicity to dopaminergic neurons in transgenic mice	TDP-43 and α-synuclein are two disease proteins involved in a wide range of neurodegen-erative diseases. While TDP-43 proteinopathy is considered a pathologic hallmark of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobe degeneration, α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy body characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, TDP-43 protei-nopathy also coexists with Lewy body and with synucleinopathy in certain disease conditions. Here we reported the effects of TDP-43 on α-synuclein neurotoxicity in transgenic mice. Overexpression of mutant TDP-43 (M337V substitution) in mice caused early death in transgenic founders, but overexpression of normal TDP-43 only induced a moderate loss of cortical neurons in the transgenic mice at advanced ages. Interestingly, concomitant over-expression of normal TDP-43 and mutant α-synuclein caused a more severe loss of dopa-minergic neurons in the double transgenic mice as compared to single-gene transgenic mice. TDP-43 potentiated α-synuclein toxicity to dopaminergic neurons in living animals. Our finding provides in vivo evidence suggesting that disease proteins such as TDP-43 and α-synuclein may play a synergistic role in disease induction in neurodegenerative diseases. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

79952998152	Electrospun chitosan nanofibers for hepatocyte culture	In this study, we developed a method to obtain high surface area nanofiber meshes composed of chitosan of a number of molecular weights. This method required decreasing the viscosity and surface tension of the chitosan solution as well as optimization of the electrospinning parameters such as applied voltage and environmental humidity. These chitosan nanofiber meshes were developed as a culture substrate for hepatocytes. The fibers exhibited a uniform diameter distribution (average diameter: 112 nm) and FTIR results indicate that the chemical structure of chitosan is stable during the electrospinning process. The attachment, morphology and activity of hepatocytes cultured on the chitosan nanofiber meshes were tested. The results showed that the chitosan nanofibers are biocompatible with hepatocytes and that these chitosan nanofiber meshes could be useful tissue culture substrates for various applications, including bioartificial liver-assist devices and tissue engineering for liver regeneration.

0035670602	Analysis of the chemotactic activities of mouse chemokine MIP-2 to thymocyte subgroups	A mouse chemokine MIP-2 (macrophage inflamatory protein 2) is constitutively expressed not only by peritoneal macrophages, but also by fresh thymic stromal cells, based on RT-PCR detection. Moreover, the specific receptor of MIP-2 is expressed at different levels among four main subgroups of murine thymocytes including DN, DP, CD4SP and CD8SP. By the chemotaxis assays with Boyden chamber, we proved that the recombinant mouse MIP-2 can chemoattract the four main subgroups of thymocytes in different degrees, it mainly chemoattract the DP and SP subgroups. We firstly reported that MIP-2 is involved in the regulation of the directional migration of developing thymocytes.

79959273231	Differential expression of oncogenic miRNAs in proliferating and senescent human fibroblasts	miRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that play fundamental roles through the post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. miRNAs have been shown to regulate a broad spectrum of biological activities, including development, differentiation, cell death, and oncogenesis. However, little is known about their contribution to cellular senescence. The authors analyzed the expression of 576 miRNAs in proliferating and senescent normal human fibroblasts by microarray, and identified 12 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in proliferating and senescent fibroblasts. Interestingly, all six miRNAs that were down-regulated in senescent cells had been previously reported to be aberrantly expressed in tumor cells. It was further showed that inhibition of miR-17-5p and miR-20a by 2′-O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides resulted in the induction of senescent phenotypes in WI-38 cells. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79960816259	Site-specific recognition of guanosine by manganese(III) corroles in DNA non-duplex regions through active oxygen transfer	DNA damage plays an important role in cellular processes. Besides natural protein nucleases, different types of efficient agents for DNA damage have been developed over recent decades in the search for new anticancer and antiviral drugs. In addition to the double-stranded configuration, DNA structures also include some non-duplex regions, which are considered to be from spontaneous errors in DNA replication, thus playing an important role for cells. Herein, we focused on these non-duplex regions of DNA and generated manganese(III) corroles, which exhibit a highly selective cleavage ability for guanosine units located at non-duplex portions, such as loops and bulges. The cleavage mechanism was demonstrated to be a manganese-induced oxidation process. The results given herein show a molecular approach that could specifically probe the guanosine units in DNA non-duplex structures, thus representing a promising step in the construction of tools to target non-duplex structures in chromosomes. © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

80055008403	Examining the relationship between lifetime stressful life events and the onset of major depression in Chinese women	Background: In European and US studies, patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) report more stressful life events (SLEs) than controls, but this relationship has rarely been studied in Chinese populations. Methods: Sixteen lifetime SLEs were assessed at interview in two groups of Han Chinese women: 1970 clinically ascertained with recurrent MDD and 2597 matched controls. Diagnostic and other risk factor information was assessed at personal interview. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic regression. Results: 60% of controls and 72% of cases reported at least one lifetime SLE. Fourteen of the sixteen SLEs occurred significantly more frequently in those with MDD (median odds ratio of 1.6). The three SLEs most strongly associated with risk for MDD (OR > 3.0) preceded the onset of MDD the majority of the time: rape (82%), physical abuse (100%) and serious neglect (99%). Limitations: Our results may apply to females only. SLEs were rated retrospectively and are subject to biases in recollection. We did not assess contextual information for each life event. Conclusions: More severe SLEs are more strongly associated with MDD. These results support the involvement of psychosocial adversity in the etiology of MDD in China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80054771709	RNA-seq analyses generate comprehensive transcriptomic landscape and reveal complex transcript patterns in hepatocellular carcinoma	RNA-seq is a powerful tool for comprehensive characterization of whole transcriptome at both gene and exon levels and with a unique ability of identifying novel splicing variants. To date, RNA-seq analysis of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been reported. In this study, we performed transcriptome analyses for 10 matched pairs of cancer and non-cancerous tissues from HCC patients on Solexa/Illumina GAII platform. On average, about 21.6 million sequencing reads and 10.6 million aligned reads were obtained for samples sequenced on each lane, which was able to identify >50% of all the annotated genes for each sample. Furthermore, we identified 1,378 significantly differently expressed genes (DEGs) and 24, 338 differentially expressed exons (DEEs). Comprehensive function analyses indicated that cell growth-related, metabolism-related and immune-related pathways were most significantly enriched by DEGs, pointing to a complex mechanism for HCC carcinogenesis. Positional gene enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were most significantly enriched at chromosome 8q21.3-24.3. The most interesting findings were from the analysis at exon levels where we characterized three major patterns of expression changes between gene and exon levels, implying a much complex landscape of transcript-specific differential expressions in HCC. Finally, we identified a novel highly up-regulated exon-exon junction in ATAD2 gene in HCC tissues. Overall, to our best knowledge, our study represents the most comprehensive characterization of HBV-related HCC transcriptome including exon level expression changes and novel splicing variants, which illustrated the power of RNA-seq and provided important clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms of HCC pathogenesis at system-wide levels. © 2011 Huang et al.

80355141976	Cooperative replica prefetching mechanism for virtual organization in grid	Replication is an effective method that improves data access in Data Grids; however, the improvement of the efficiency of repilication is a crucial problem. Previous works on the replication mechanism mostly select high value replicas to replicate, and simply choose the files that have been accessed based on the access records of files. This paper starts with the analysis of the file access characteristics in the virtual organization (VO). After introducing the concept of implicit high-value file (IHVF), it proposes the cooperative replica prefetching mechanism (CoRPM) for virtual organization, which is based on which local grid nodes can obtain the replicas of IHVFs through cooperation with other gird nodes in the same VO. The architecture of CoRPM is presented first, in which prefetching elements running on every gird node work cooperatively to provide a file prefetching service for all the grid nodes in the VO. Then, on the basis of the design of CoRPM, the process of CoRPM is described, whose core algorithms include a job-type centric file prefetching algorithm and a prefetching file selecting algorithm. In the end, the paper evaluates the performance of CoRPM through simulations, and the results show that CoRPM does reduce the file access latency more effectively. © 2011 ISCAS.

81355135404	A specific probe for two-photon fluorescence lysosomal imaging	Lysosomes are vital organelles in physiological processes, as they receive and degrade macromolecules from the secretory and endocytic procedures. Evidences have shown that lysosomes were related to oncogenic activation and cancer progression, so lysosomes targeting and imaging probes make them convenient to be observed. In this study, a lysosome specific probe W-7 was designed and synthesized via convenient one-pot reaction and Heck reaction. This probe was derived from Tröger's base with a dimethylaminomethyl end group. The optical properties of this compound were measured. W-7 also showed two-photon absorption (TPA) effect by using laser excitation at the wavelength of infrared light. In vivo experiment, W-7 showed high specificity and selectivity for lysosomes in living cells (HeLa cells, MRC-5 cells and NRK cells), compared with LT Red, GT Red and MT Red (R = 0.96). Two-photon fluorescence images of HeLa cells stained by W-7 were obtained. And high resolution 3D reconstruction of lysosomes in one HeLa cell was provided by using two-photon confocal microscopy. The anantioseparation of racemic W-7 was carried out by chiral-HPLC, and the two enantiomers showed no significant difference in lysosomes imaging. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, a developed K-means clustering algorithm is adopted, which classifies the surface color of a building after extracting the building from its background environments. Then we set up an evaluation model formula based on the quantization of color's three elements in the chromatology. Finally, we analyze the composition of building color and give the evaluation results based on image processing technology. The experimental results show that the new method has significant advantage over traditional methods in the architectural color analysis, which provides a convenient and efficient foundation to the work of urban planning. © 2011 IEEE.

83555166002	Selective expression of S100A11 in lung cancer and its role in regulating proliferation of adenocarcinomas cells	S100A11, one secreted protein, is overexpressed in certain cancers. We investigated S100A11 expression in various subtypes of lung cancer and explored its role in cell proliferation. S100A11 mRNA level was examined in 45 pairs of frozen lung cancer tissues by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The specific expression and subcellular distribution of S100A11 were examined in 78 paraffin-embedded lung cancers, 2 benign lung diseases as well as 22 healthy lung tissues by immunohistochemistry. S100A11 protein level was further analyzed in the sera of 86 lung cancer patients and 50 healthy individuals by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that both mRNA and protein levels of S100A11 were overexpressed in adenocarcinomas (ADC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) compared with paired non-cancerous lung tissues, while S100A11 was detected downregulated in small cell lung cancers (SCLC). Further immunohistochemistry staining was positive for S100A11 only in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (ADC, SCC, large cell carcinomas, et al.), but not SCLC. Conclusively, we found S100A11 protein level increased in the sera of NSCLC patients. Furthermore, when S100A11 expression was knocked down in lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 and LTEP-a-2, the cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in vitro and in vivo. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84455183748	Brownian dynamics simulation of conformation and diffusion of linear DNA chain in dilute solution	By constructing a full-parameterized bead-spring chain model and applying a highly efficient second-order semi-implicit predictor-corrector algorithm, the influence of three nonlinear interactions including excluded volume interaction, finite extensible nonlinear elastic interaction and fluctuating hydrodynamic interaction on the radius of gyration, diffusion coefficient and their scaling exponents are studied systematically. Simulation results validate the scaling law of Zimm model in good solvent and demonstrate different degrees and directions of these nonlinear effects. Chain flexibility has little influence on conformation and diffusion coefficient. The higher solvent quality clearly increases the radius of gyration and decreases the diffusion coefficient, and makes both quantities increase with the scaling exponents. In addition, the hydrodynamic interaction has little influence on the conformation of DNA chain, but it increases the diffusion coefficient and decreases its scaling exponent greatly.

84856730452	Clinical predictors of familial depression in Han Chinese women	Background A number of clinical features potentially reflect an individual's familial vulnerability to major depression (MD), including early age at onset, recurrence, impairment, episode duration, and the number and pattern of depressive symptoms. However, these results are drawn from studies that have exclusively examined individuals from a European ethnic background. We investigated which clinical features of depressive illness index familial vulnerability in Han Chinese females with MD. Methods We used lifetime MD and associated clinical features assessed at personal interview in 1,970 Han Chinese women with DSM-IV MD between 30-60 years of age. Odds Ratios were calculated by logistic regression. Results Individuals with a high familial risk for MD are characterized by severe episodes of MD without known precipitants (such as stress life events) and are less likely to feel irritable/angry or anxious/nervous. Conclusions The association between family history of MD and the lack of a precipitating stressor, traditionally a characteristic of endogenous or biological depression, may reflect the association seen in other samples between recurrent MD and a positive family history. The symptomatic associations we have seen may reflect a familial predisposition to other dimensions of psychopathology, such as externalizing disorders or anxiety states.

84857367766	Clinical features and risk factors for post-partum depression in a large cohort of Chinese women with recurrent major depressive disorder	Background: Post partum depression (PPD) is relatively common in China but its clinical characteristics and risk factors have not been studied. We set out to investigate whether known risk factors for PPD could be found in Chinese women. Methods: A case control design was used to determine the impact of known risk factors for PPD in a cohort of 1970 Chinese women with recurrent DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD). In a within-case design we examined the risk factors for PPD in patients with recurrent MDD. We compared the clinical features of MDD in cases with PPD to those without MDD. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic and ordinal regression. Results: Lower occupational and educational statuses increased the risk of PPD, as did a history of pre-menstrual symptoms, stressful life events and elevated levels of the personality trait of neuroticism. Patients with PPD and MDD were more likely to experience a comorbid anxiety disorder, had a younger age of onset of MDD, have higher levels of neuroticism and dysthymia. Limitations: Results obtained in this clinical sample may not be applicable to PPD within the community. Data were obtained retrospectively and we do not know whether the correlations we observe have the same causes as those operating in other populations. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the despite cultural differences between Chinese and Western women, the phenomenology and risk factors for PPD are very similar. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84857373518	The impact of educational status on the clinical features of major depressive disorder among Chinese women	Background: Years of education are inversely related to the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the relationship between the clinical features of MDD and educational status is poorly understood. We investigated this in 1970 Chinese women with recurrent MDD identified in a clinical setting. Methods: Clinical and demographic features were obtained from 1970 Han Chinese women with DSM-IV major depression between 30 and 60 years of age across China. Analysis of linear, logistic and multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the association between educational level and clinical features of MDD. Results: Subjects with more years of education are more likely to have MDD, with an odds ratio of 1.14 for those with more than ten years. Low educational status is not associated with an increase in the number of episodes, nor with increased rates of co-morbidity with anxiety disorders. Education impacts differentially on the symptoms of depression: lower educational attainment is associated with more biological symptoms and increased suicidal ideation and plans to commit suicide. Limitations: Findings may not generalize to males or to other patient populations. Since the threshold for treatment seeking differs as a function of education there may an ascertainment bias in the sample. Conclusions: The relationship between symptoms of MDD and educational status in Chinese women is unexpectedly complex. Our findings are inconsistent with the simple hypothesis from European and US reports that low levels of educational attainment increase the risk and severity of MDD. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84859302354	Reactive oxygen species and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in Hodgkin lymphoma cells	Tumor cells with tumorigenic potential might be limited to a small population of cells, called cancer-initiating cells (CICs). CICs efficiently form colonies in vitro, yield both CIC and non-CIC populations, maintain reactive oxygen species (ROS) at low levels, show high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and are mostly in a quiescent state of the cell cycle. CICs of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are small in size, with low levels of ROS. The relationship between ROS level and ALDH activity in CICs was examined in HL cell lines. ROS-low and ALDH-high populations formed colonies in semi-solid cultures more efficiently than ROS-high and ALDH-low populations. ALDH-high populations yielded both ALDH-low and -high populations, whereas ALDH-low populations rarely yielded an ALDH-high population. The number of cells in a quiescent state was significantly greater in ROS-low than in ROS-high cells, whereas that of ALDH-high and ALDH-low cells was comparable to each other. These findings show that ALDH-high and ROS-low cells share CIC-like potential, but they differ in their cell cycle status, suggesting that CICs are comprised of cells with heterogeneous characteristics. © 2012 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

84859858701	Regulation of spike timing-dependent plasticity of olfactory inputs in mitral cells in the rat olfactory bulb	The recent history of activity input onto granule cells (GCs) in the main olfactory bulb can affect the strength of lateral inhibition, which functions to generate contrast enhancement. However, at the plasticity level, it is unknown whether and how the prior modification of lateral inhibition modulates the subsequent induction of long-lasting changes of the excitatory olfactory nerve (ON) inputs to mitral cells (MCs). Here we found that the repetitive stimulation of two distinct excitatory inputs to the GCs induced a persistent modification of lateral inhibition in MCs in opposing directions. This bidirectional modification of inhibitory inputs differentially regulated the subsequent synaptic plasticity of the excitatory ON inputs to the MCs, which was induced by the repetitive pairing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with postsynaptic bursts. The regulation of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) was achieved by the regulation of the inter-spike-interval (ISI) of the postsynaptic bursts. This novel form of inhibition-dependent regulation of plasticity may contribute to the encoding or processing of olfactory information in the olfactory bulb. © 2012 Ma et al.

The electrospun poly (e-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers were employed as templates for the in situ surface polymerization of PPy under mechanical stirring or ultrasonication to obtain burr-shaped or smooth fiber shells, respectively. Hollow PPy fibers, achieved by removing the PCL templates, were the ideal sorbents for solid phase extraction of polar compounds due to their inherent multi-functionalities. By using the hollow PPy fibers, two important neuroendocrine markers of behavioural disorders, 5-hydroxyindole-3- acetic acid and homovanillic acid, were successfully extracted. Under the optimized conditions, the absolute recoveries of the above two neuroendocrine markers were 90.7% and 92.4%, respectively, in human plasma. Due to its simplicity, selectivity and sensitivity, the method may be applied to quantitatively analyse the concentrations of polar species in complex matrix samples. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Current research on grid resource advance reservation, a well known and effective mechanism to guarantee QoS, fails to adapt to dynamic behavior of grid, and cannot solve imprecise deny of reservation request problem efficiently. For this, enabling system architecture for advance reservation is proposed. Virtual resource container (VRC) is adopted to alleviate a negative effect resulted from dynamic behavior of grid and QoS deviation distance (QDD) based logical resource selection algorithm is put forward to decrease imprecise reject ratio of reservation. At last, this new architecture is deployed to campus grid, and two illustrative experiments are conducted. Experimental results show that system architecture for advance reservation proposed in this paper can alleviate negative influence of grid resource dynamic fluctuation and avoid imprecise reject of advance reservation request effectively. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

This study aimed to develop a new type of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-based nanoparticles for gene delivery, which are capable of overcoming the disadvantages of polyethylenimine (PEI)- or cationic liposomebased gene carrier, such as the cytotoxicity induced by excess positive charge, as well as the aggregation on the cell surface. The PLGA-based nanoparticles presented in this study were synthesized by emulsion evaporation method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The size of PLGA/PEI nanoparticles in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was about 60 nm at the optimal charge ratio. Without observable aggregation, the nanoparticles showed a better monodispersity. The PLGA-based nanoparticles were used as vector carrier for miRNA transfection in HepG2 cells. It exhibited a higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells compared to the PEI/ DNA complex. The N/P ratio (ratio of the polymer nitrogen to the DNA phosphate) 6 of the PLGA/PEI/DNA nanocomplex displays the best property among various N/P proportions, yielding similar transfection efficiency when compared to Lipofectamine/DNA lipoplexes. Moreover, nanocomplex shows better serum compatibility than commercial liposome. PLGA nanocomplexes obviously accumulate in tumor cells after transfection, which indicate that the complexes contribute to cellular uptake of pDNA and pronouncedly enhance the treatment effect of miR-26a by inducing cell cycle arrest. Therefore, these results demonstrate that PLGA/PEI nanoparticles are promising non-viral vectors for gene delivery. © 2011 Liang et al.

84863289521	Up-regulation of GTSE1 lacks a relationship with clinical data in lung cancer	Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer types that lead to death in cancer patients across the world. Clarification of differentially expressed genes is essential for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. According to the public cDNA microarray database, we found that GTSE1 is overexpressed dramatically in lung cancer patients' tissues. To further verify the microarray data, quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining were undertaken to test GTSE1 expression both at mRNA and protein levels. GTSE1 is up-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues, especially in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The expression profile of GTSE1 was investigated, and the clinical significance and the association between GTSE1 and the overall survival were assessed in 246 lung cancer patients. No statistically significant correlation, however, was observed between GTSE1, the clinical features and survival. Thus, GTSE1 may not be a prognostic marker in lung cancers.

84866737812	Role of leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) for anti-apoptosis and tumourigenesis in cancers	Due to accelerated energy consumption, enhanced function of mitochondria in tumour cells compared to normal cells is prerequisite for tumour development. Leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) regulates the expression of all mitochondrial DNA-encoded mRNAs, thus plays an important role in the mitochondrial function. LRPPRC is abundantly expressed in the side population of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, where cancer stem cells are enriched. However, the role of LRPPRC in tumour development remained to be clarified in detail. Here, the expression of LRPPRC was examined in various types of tumours, such as lung adenocarcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, stomach, colon, mammary and endometrial adenocarcinoma, and lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed that all kinds of examined tumours abundantly expressed LRPPRC. In contrast, surrounding non-neoplastic cells hardly expressed LRPPRC. The knocked-down expression of LRPPRC in lung adenocarcinoma cells did not affect amount of side population and activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, known to be highly expressed in cancer stem cells of the lung. However, the knocked-down expression of LRPPRC reduced the abilities for anti-apoptosis, invasion and in vitro colony formation in lung adenocarcinoma, as well as Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Double staining of LRPPRC with active caspase-3 in clinical samples of lung adenocarcinoma revealed that apoptotic cells were hardly observed in LRPPRC-expressing tumours. These findings indicate that LRPPRC played an important role in tumourigenesis through the resistance to apoptosis and high invasive activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84868663721	Transcriptional Regulation of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1A1 Gene by Alternative Spliced Forms of Nuclear Factor Y in Tumorigenic Population of Endometrial Adenocarcinoma	High activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is characteristic of normal and cancerous stem cells. Recently, high ALDH expression was shown to be associated with poor prognosis in uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma. The population with high ALDH activity (ALDH-hi) was more invasive, anti-apoptotic, and tumorigenic than that with low activity (ALDH-lo). Here, the transcriptional regulation of ALDH1A1 gene, which is responsible for ALDH activity, was examined in endometrial adenocarcinoma. The promoter region of ALDH1A1 contained CCAAT and octamer binding motifs, and their mutation diminished promoter activity. Among CCAAT-recognizing transcription factors, nuclear factor YA (NFYA) was involved in ALDH1A1 transcription. Two alternatively spliced isoforms of NFYA (NFYA-long and NFYA-short) have been reported. The sorted ALDH-hi population of endometrial adenocarcinoma preferentially expressed NFYA-short, whereas ALDH-lo dominantly expressed NFYA-long. NFYA-short possessed higher transactivation ability than did NFYA-long. In addition, an additive effect of NFYA with Oct-1, which recognizes octamer binding motif, was observed in ALDH1A1 transactivation. These results indicate that the alternatively spliced isoforms of NFYA, in cooperation with Oct-1, play an important role in ALDH1A1 expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma. © The Author(s) 2011.

84868338325	A comparison of the clinical characteristics of women with recurrent major depression with and without suicidal symptomatology	Background The relationship between recurrent major depression (MD) in women and suicidality is complex. We investigated the extent to which patients who suffered with various forms of suicidal symptomatology can be distinguished from those subjects without such symptoms. Method We examined the clinical features of the worst episode in 1970 Han Chinese women with recurrent DSM-IV MD between the ages of 30 and 60 years from across China. Student's t tests, and logistic and multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the association between suicidality and other clinical features of MD. Results Suicidal symptomatology is significantly associated with a more severe form of MD, as indexed by both the number of episodes and number of MD symptoms. Patients reporting suicidal thoughts, plans or attempts experienced a significantly greater number of stressful life events. The depressive symptom most strongly associated with lifetime suicide attempt was feelings of worthlessness (odds ratio 4.25, 95% confidence interval 2.9-6.3). Excessive guilt, diminished concentration and impaired decision-making were also significantly associated with a suicide attempt. Conclusions This study contributes to the existing literature on risk factors for suicidal symptomatology in depressed women. Identifying specific depressive symptoms and co-morbid psychiatric disorders may help improve the clinical assessment of suicide risk in depressed patients. These findings could be helpful in identifying those who need more intense treatment strategies in order to prevent suicide. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

84870865512	Sox2 enhances the tumorigenicity and chemoresistance of cancer stem-like cells derived from gastric cancer	Gastric cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) have been identified to possess the ability of self-renewal and tumor initiation. However, the mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here, we isolated and characterized the GCSCs by side population (SP) sorting procedure and cultured sphere cells (SC) from human gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901, BGC-823, MGC-803, HGC-27 and MKN-28. The sorting and culture assay revealed that SP cells proliferated in an asymmetric division manner. In addition, SP cells exhibited a higher potential of spheroid colony formation and greater drug resistance than non-SP cells (NSP). Moreover, the SC were found with enhanced capabilities of drug resistance in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Sox2 mRNA and protein was highly and significantly overexpressed in the SP cells and SC. Importantly, downregulation of Sox2 with siRNA obviously reduced spheroid colony formation and doxorubicin efflux, as well as increased apoptosis rate in sphere cells in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. These results suggest that both SP cells and cultured SC enrich with GCSCs and that Sox2 plays a pivotal role in sustaining stem cell properties and might be a potential target for gastric cancer therapy. © 2012 The Editorial Board of Journal of Biomedical Research.

84870892988	Th22 Cells as Well as Th17 Cells Expand Differentially in Patients with Early-Stage and Late-Stage Myelodysplastic Syndrome	Background: Immunological mechanisms are increasingly recognized in the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Early-stage MDS (E-MDS) is characterized by autoimmune-mediated myelosuppression whereas late-stage MDS (L-MDS) involves immune evasion, giving dysplastic cells growth potential to progress into acute myeloid leukemia. T-helper (Th) 22 is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory autoimmunity and tumorigenesis. The roles of Th22 cells in the pathophysiology of E-MDS and L-MDS remain unsettled. Design and Methods: We studied 37 MDS patients (E-MDS, n = 17; L-MDS, n = 20) and 20 healthy controls to characterize their peripheral blood (PB), as well as 25 MDS patients and 10 healthy controls to characterize their bone marrow(BM). The expression of Interleukin-22 (IL-22), IL-17 or interferon gamma (IFN-γ) was examined in E-MDS, L-MDS patients and controls by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of RAR-related orphan receptor C (RORC), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-23 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The levels of IL-22 and IL-17 both in PB and BM plasma were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: In E-MDS, peripheral Th17 cells were significantly elevated and correlated with peripheral Th22 cells compared with healthy controls and L-MDS. Significantly higher levels of peripheral Th22 expansion, mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-α and lower level of RORC mRNA expression were observed in L-MDS compared with E-MDS. No statistical difference was found in IL-23 mRNA expression or plasma IL-22, IL-17 levels among E-MDS, L-MDS and controls. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that L-MDS cohort had increased frequencies of peripheral Th22 cells and higher mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, indicating that Th22 cells along with Th17 cells or not are involved in the dynamic immune responses of MDS. © 2012 Shao et al.

84872371691	Poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene nanoclusters for high effective solid phase extraction	Solid phase extraction (SPE) has emerged as the widely used technique for sample preparation in the analytical process. Recent research trends of SPE are toward developing novel adsorbents to enrich the analytes simply and effectively. In this study, we proposed the poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) nanoclusters as the SPE adsorbent. During the application, only a small amount of PEDOT nanoclusters was needed and placed in a pipet tip with glass wool on either side. Without complex preparation, the target analytes could be directly extracted from the sample onto the extraction material and eluted in this lab-in-a-pipet-tip system. The efficiency of this approach was demonstrated by detecting 20 kinds of sulfonamides (SAs) in honey with ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). All the analytes were detected by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The established method was extensively validated by determining the linearity (R

84872242880	Th22 and related cytokines in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases	Introduction: Th22 and related cytokines regulate various processes and have been linked to diverse effects. The levels of Th22 and cytokine IL-22 are increased in several disorders and positively related to some autoimmune diseases. Preclinical studies have suggested that the inhibition or stimulation of IL-22 is an attractive approach to reverse the immune disorders. Simultaneously, considering many patients with refractory autoimmune diseases respond poorly to the therapies which are highly toxic, more effective therapies are to be examined. Areas covered: The role of Th22 cells and related cytokines and therapeutic strategies targeting them in many illnesses, especially inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Expert opinion: Th22 cells and related cytokine IL-22 regulate multiple biological functions and play an important role in a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. They have unique and attractive advantages for targeting. Targeting IL-22 has already been trialed in many mice experiments, showing better efficacy and fewer side effects compared with classical drugs. Targeting IL-22 or Th22 might provide pathogenetic treatment. However, Th22 subset is a recently identified Th subset and its associated research is extremely limited. Therefore, there are still many unanswered questions and further researches are warranted. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

84873692457	Assessment and analysis of phthalate esters, in Lake Pontchartrain, by SPME combining with GC-MS	This study for the first time reports a quantitative analysis of phthalates and spatial distribution of phthalates in Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, USA using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). During 2008-2009, di-n-butylphthalate (DnBP) along with its congener (DiBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were detected in Lake Pontchartrain. Concentrations of these phthalates in the lake were monitored in different areas before and after the opening of the Bonnet Carré Spillway that occurred from April to May in 2008. The concentration of Σ3PAEs (DnBP, DiBP and DEHP) ranged from 0 to 20 μg/L in the surface water of the lake from March 2008 to June 2009. The distribution of the three phthalates varied with locations in the lake. An increase trend of Σ3PAEs was observed after the opening of the Bonnet Carré Spillway in the central lake area. The observed increase of the phthalates could be correlated to the opening of the spillway. The SPME followed by GC-MS employed in this study has been proved to be a rapid, sensitive and practical method to quantitatively analyse and evaluate phthalate concentrations in salt lake waters. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84873830118	Aberrant expression and association of VEGF and Dll4/notch pathway molecules under hypoxia in patients with lung cancer	Tumor angiogenesis plays important roles in the pathogenesis and prognosis of lung cancer. Both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Dll4/Notch pathways are critical for angiogenesis, whereas their relationship under hypoxia in lung cancer remains unknown. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the expression of VEGF and Dll4/Notch signaling molecules, and assessed their association with the microvessel density (CD31) and hypoxia (HIF1a) in lung cancer and normal lung tissues using immunohistochemical and Real-time RT-PCR techniques. Then, we investigated the biological function of Dll4 by transfecting Dll4 into HUVECs. In lung cancer tissues, Notch pathway molecules (HES1) and VEGF pathway molecules (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) were significantly up-regulated, while the ratio of VEGFR1/VEGFR2 was decreased. CD31 and HIF1a were also found to be elevated in lung cancer. VEGFR1 was negatively correlated with Notch1 while positively correlated with Dll4. CD31 was positively correlated with HIF1a but negatively correlated with VEGFR1. Moreover, HIF1a was nearly positively correlated with HES1 in lung cancer tissues. After transfection, Dll4, Notch1 and VEGFR1 were up-regulated while VEGF and VEGFR2 were down-regulated in Dll4-transfected HUVECs compared with controls. Also, our findings suggest that the expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 increased gradually with the disease progression of lung cancer. In summary, VEGF and Notch signaling pathway molecules were overexpressed in lung cancer, which positively correlates with hypoxia (HIF1a) and angiogenesis (CD31). There might be a negative feedback loop between VEGF and Dll4/Notch signaling pathway in lung tumor angiogenesis.

84875520481	Dynamics of exosome internalization and trafficking	Cells release exosomes into extracellular medium. Although the important roles of exosomes in many physiological and pathological processes are being revealed, the mechanism of exosome-cell interaction remains unclear. In this article, employing real-time fluorescence microscopy, the motion of exosomes on the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm of recipient PC12 cells was observed directly. In addition, several motion modes of exosomes were revealed by single particle tracking (SPT). The changes between motion modes were also detected, presenting the dynamic courses of exosome attachment onto plasma membrane and exosome uptake. Octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) was found to be useful to distinguish endocytosis from fusion during exosome uptake. Colocalization with organelle markers showed exosomes were sorted to acidic vesicles after internalization. The results provide new sight into the exosome-cell interaction mode and the intercellular trafficking of exosomes. This study will help to understand the roles of exosomes at cell level. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84875205667	Six1 Promotes Proliferation of Pancreatic Cancer Cells via Upregulation of Cyclin D1 Expression	Six1 is one of the transcription factors that act as master regulators of development and are frequently dysregulated in cancers. However, the role of Six1 in pancreatic cancer is not clear. Here we show that the relative expression of Six1 mRNA is increased in pancreatic cancer and correlated with advanced tumor stage. In vitro functional assays demonstrate that forced overexpression of Six1 significantly enhances the growth rate and proliferation ability of pancreatic cancer cells. Knockdown of endogenous Six1 decreases the proliferation of these cells dramatically. Furthermore, Six1 promotes the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in a xenograft assay. We also show that the gene encoding cyclin D1 is a direct transcriptional target of Six1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Overexpression of Six1 upregulates cyclin D1 mRNA and protein, and significantly enhances the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter in PANC-1 cells. We demonstrate that Six1 promotes cell cycle progression and proliferation by upregulation of cyclin D1. These data suggest that Six1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and may contribute to the increased cell proliferation through upregulation of cyclin D1. © 2013 Li et al.

84876000836	Phosphorylation of cofilin regulates extinction of conditioned aversive memory via AMPAR trafficking	Actin dynamics provide an important mechanism for the modification of synaptic plasticity, which is regulated by the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin. However, the role of cofilin regulated actin dynamics in memory extinction process is still unclear. Here, we observed that extinction of conditioned taste aversive (CTA) memory led to temporally enhanced ADF/cofilin activity in the infralimbic cortex (IrL) of the rats. Moreover, temporally elevating ADF/cofilin activity in the IrL could accelerate CTA memory extinction by facilitating AMPAR synaptic surface recruitment, whereas inhibition of ADF/cofilin activity abolished AMPAR synaptic surface trafficking and impaired memory extinction. Finally, we observed that ADF/cofilin-regulated synaptic plasticity was not directly coupled to morphological changes of postsynaptic spines. These findings may help us understand the role of ADF/cofilin-regulated actin dynamics in memory extinction and suggest that appropriate manipulating ADF/cofilin activity might be a suitable way for therapeutic treatment of memory disorders. © 2013 the authors.

84876923834	Metal-free click approach for facile production of main chain poly(bile acid)s	In this work, a metal-free click polymerization approach was developed to facilely produce versatile main chain poly(bile acid)s with high efficiency. No metal catalysts and organic solvents are required for the polymerization process, which exhibits multiple advantages, including less toxicity, being environmentally friendly and economically sound. Remarkably, the polymerization can finish within several minutes when the reactive monomers are in a crystalline state. Although the monomers are amorphous, no more than one hour is needed for completing the polymerization. The conversion efficiency can reach up to nearly 100% with the polymer molecular weight up to 93 500 Da, which still shows good solubility in most common solvents. The described approach is applicable for various bile acid monomers with different linkages, including long flexible alkyl chains, amide groups, phenyl groups and sterically hindered structures. Probably due to the strengthened hydrogen bonding interactions, π-π stacking and the hindrance effect introduced by the linkage used, the molecular weight and properties of the resulting polymers are strongly dependent on the monomer structures. Notably, by introducing a steric effect on azide groups (4e and 4f), the regioselectivity of the 1,4-triazole linkers is significantly improved from 60% to 85%. All the obtained polymers are thermally stable and display high resistance to thermal degradation. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84877620676	Clinical significance of integrin αvβ6 expression effects on gastric carcinoma invasiveness and progression via cancer-associated fibroblasts	Over-expression of integrin αvβ6 and increased numbers of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in the development and progression of cancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression level of integrin αvβ6 and CAF numbers, their correlation with clinicopathologic features and their role in the prognosis of human gastric cancers. The expression levels of integrin αvβ6 and α-SMA in CAFs were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Their correlation with clinicopathologic features, the relationships and the survival time of patients were also analyzed. The integrin αvβ6 expression levels were analyzed mainly in gastric cancers. The α-SMA expression levels were analyzed mainly in gastric cancers and paraneoplastic tissues. Patients with positive integrin β6 and α-SMA expression have a significantly lower overall survival rate than those with negative integrin β6 and α-SMA expression (P < 0.05). A multivariate analysis using a log-rank test indicated that patients with positive integrin β6 and α-SMA expression and/or a diffuse type of gastric cancer had a significantly poorer overall survival rate than did those with negative integrin β6 expression (P < 0.05). Integrin β6 expression correlated significantly with CAF numbers and served as a valuable prognostic indicator for human gastric cancers. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

84878658398	PKCλ is critical in AMPA receptor phosphorylation and synaptic incorporation during LTP	Direct phosphorylation of GluA1 by PKC controls α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor (AMPAR) incorporation into active synapses during long-term potentiation (LTP). Numerous signalling molecules that involved in AMPAR incorporation have been identified, but the specific PKC isoform(s) participating in GluA1 phosphorylation and the molecule triggering PKC activation remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the atypical isoform of PKC, PKCλ, is a critical molecule that acts downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and is essential for LTP expression. PKCλ activation is required for both GluA1 phosphorylation and increased surface expression of AMPARs during LTP. Moreover, p62 interacts with both PKCλ and GluA1 during LTP and may serve as a scaffolding protein to place PKCλ in close proximity to facilitate GluA1 phosphorylation by PKCλ. Thus, we conclude that PKCλ is the critical signalling molecule responsible for GluA1-containing AMPAR phosphorylation and synaptic incorporation at activated synapses during LTP expression. © 2013 European Molecular Biology Organization.

84878290967	Gene expression profiling of the DNMT3A R882 mutation in acute leukemia	DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is one of two human de novo DNA methyltransferases essential for the regulation of gene expression. DNMT3A mutations and deletions have been previously observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic sydromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, the involvement of DNMT3A in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has rarely been reported. In the present study, PCR and direct sequencing was performed to analyze mutations of DNMT3A amino acid residue 882 in 99 acute leukemia patients, including 57 AML patients, 41 ALL patients and a single biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) patient. DNMT3A expression was detected in mononuclear cells of the bone marrow in these patients and in normal individuals using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and 17.5% (10/57) of AML patients were found to exhibit DNMT3A mutations. Four missense mutations were observed in the DNMT3A-mutated AML patients, including R882 mutations and a novel single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in the M880V amino acid substitution. However, the ALL and BAL patients were not found to exhibit DNMT3A mutations. The DNMT3A expression levels in the AML patients were significantly higher compared with those of the ALL patients or normal controls. The reduced expression levels of DNMT3A were associated with a significantly lower complete remission rate in the AML patients. However, in the ALL patients, no statistical significance was identified. The results of the present study indicate that DNMT3A may play varying roles in the regulation of DNA methylation in AML and ALL.

ZnPc1 exhibited an almost exclusive mitochondrial-localizing property in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells. Remarkable photocytotoxicity but low dark cytotoxic properties were observed for ZnPc1 in four different cancer cell lines. Photodynamic treatment (PDT) with ZnPc1 resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species, a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and chromatin condensation, all important hallmarks of apoptosis. The results are consistent with its mitochondrial localization property and qualify ZnPc1 as a promising PDT agent. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

BM and PB were extracted from ND, CR, and relapsed-refractory AML patients and controls. Th subsets frequencies were examined by flow cytometry. BM plasma Th-associated cytokines levels were determined by ELISA. The frequencies of Th17 and Th1, and IFN-γ or TGF-β concentrations were significantly decreased in ND compared with CR patients or controls. Th17 percentage was significantly lower in BM than in PB for ND patients but was higher in BM for CR patients. However, in CR or relapsed-refractory patients, Th1 percentage in BM was higher than that in PB. Moreover, BM IL-17A level showed a decreased trend in ND patients. A significant elevation of plasma IL-6 level was found in ND compared with CR patients or controls. IL-17A showed the positive correlation with IL-6 concentration. And Th17 cells frequencies and TGF-β1 concentration were increased in BM from AML patients achieving CR after chemotherapy. Moreover, a significant decrease of BM plasma TGF-β1 level was found in M3 patients compared with the other subtypes. Our findings suggest that Th17 and related cytokines may be implicated in AML pathogenesis. © 2013 Tian Tian et al.

84884263850	Maleimide-containing polymer inverse opals: A new kind of reactive photonic structure with significant extendibility	In this work, maleimide-containing polymer inverse opals have been successfully prepared by utilization of an acrylate monomer bearing a masked (protected) maleimide unit. As an ideal clickable functional group, maleimide can promote the Michael addition of thiol-containing molecules and the thermoreversible Diels-Alder reaction of furan derivatives, providing tremendous opportunities to produce various functional materials from one maleimide-containing polymer. As a demonstration, four chemical systems were facilely evolved from the prepared maleimide-containing inverse opal. By exploiting the nucleophilic thiol-ene reaction of maleimide, the zwitterionic pH-responsive inverse opal and electroactive inverse opal were first fabricated by reacting with cysteine and thiol-containing ferrocene derivatives, respectively. Based on the same reaction, it was also found that the maleimide-containing inverse opal could serve as a self-reporting sensing platform to sensitively detect the reduction of oxidized glutathione by specific enzymes. On the other hand, the thermoreversible nature of the Diels-Alder reaction of the maleimide groups made it possible to construct a dynamic molecule gating system by reacting with alkyl-chain-substituted furan derivatives from the prepared interconnected macroporous film. In fact, due to the unlimited variety provided by the two kinds of reactions mentioned above, the described photonic material exhibits a significant extendibility and could be easily post-modified for special purposes with maintenance of the opaline structure. Thus, this novel clickable maleimide-containing polymer inverse opal could serve as a reactive platform for producing a variety of functional photonic materials. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

In recent years, reciprocal relationship between immune cells and bone systems has been uncovered gradually. Regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells are newly identified subsets of CD4+ T cells, and the balance between them is particularly essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. Accumulated data have demonstrated quantitative or functional imbalance between Th17 and Treg in bone related diseases, suggesting that Th17 and Treg cells are involved in these bone diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating Th17 and Treg cells will create opportunities for the development of therapeutic approaches. This review will present the role of Th17 and Treg cells in the inflammatory bone diseases and bone marrow malignancies and find the potential therapeutic target for immunotherapy. © 2013 Min Wang et al.

The key of this new mechanism is the exploration and location of IHVFs. Locating the IHVFs quickly can improve the performance of the mechanism. This paper employs the DHT (distributed hash table) technology to organize grid nodes to quickly locate the file correlation information which is essential for the query of IHVFs. Considering the specific query pattern, a PTree-based storage structure and corresponding query mechanism for file correlation information are proposed to improve the IHVF query efficiency.

Six1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor invloved in the initiation, progression and metastasis of breast cancer. We herein investigate the relationship between Six1 and resistance of paclitaxel in this study. The results indicate that six1 is a mediator of the paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer. The expression level of Six1 in breast cancer cells correlates with their resistance to paclitaxel. On the one hand, forced overexpression of Six1 in Six1-low/paclitaxel-sensitive MCF-7 or HS578T breast cancer cells induce their resistance to paclitaxel treatment directly; On the other hand, knockdown of endogenous Six1 in Six1-high/drug-resistant BT-474 breast cancer cells sensitized these cells to paclitaxel treatment. Besides, Six1 overexpression confers resistance to paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, clinical data and the publicly available breast cancer gene expression datasets display that the association of Six1 expression with paclitaxel sensitivity is clinically relevant. In conclusion, these data suggest that Six1 may function as an important modifier of the paclitaxel response in breast cancer cells, and serve as a potential target for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84888310087	Polypyrrole nanotubes for electrochemically controlled solid-phase extraction of anions and cations	Polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes were suggested as functional adsorbents for the electrochemically controlled solid-phase extraction (EC-SPE) of both anions and cations. The preparation of the PPy nanotubes on ITO glass was achieved by using a constant potential method. In situ anion (chloride, nitrate, and sulfate) and cation (dopamine) uptake and release were examined under controlled potential conditions for demonstrating the prospective applications of the PPy nanotube based EC-SPE. It was found that the PPy electrodes cycling between oxidation and reduction potentials could facilitate the extraction and desorption of the anions and cations, respectively. The method was validated with a standard reference material and used for the determination of the ions in real water samples. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84888639124	Mussel-inspired bioceramics with self-assembled Ca-P/polydopamine composite nanolayer: Preparation, formation mechanism, improved cellular bioactivity and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells	The nanostructured surface of biomaterials plays an important role in improving their in vitro cellular bioactivity as well as stimulating in vivo tissue regeneration. Inspired by the mussel's adhesive versatility, which is thought to be due to the plaque-substrate interface being rich in 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalamine (DOPA) and lysine amino acids, in this study we developed a self-assembly method to prepare a uniform calcium phosphate (Ca-P)/polydopamine composite nanolayer on the surface of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) bioceramics by soaking β-TCP bioceramics in Tris-dopamine solution. It was found that the addition of dopamine, reaction temperature and reaction time are three key factors inducing the formation of a uniform Ca-P/polydopamine composite nanolayer. The formation mechanism of a Ca-P/polydopamine composite nanolayer involved two important steps: (i) the addition of dopamine to Tris-HCl solution decreases the pH value and accelerates Ca and P ionic dissolution from the crystal boundaries of β-TCP ceramics; (ii) dopamine is polymerized to form self-assembled polydopamine film and, at the same time, nanosized Ca-P particles are mineralized with the assistance of polydopamine, in which the formation of polydopamine occurs simultaneously with Ca-P mineralization (formation of nanosized microparticles composed of calcium phosphate-based materials), and finally a self-assembled Ca-P/polydopamine composite nanolayer forms on the surface of the β-TCP ceramics. Furthermore, the formed self-assembled Ca-P/polydopamine composite nanolayer significantly enhances the surface roughness and hydrophilicity of β-TCP ceramics, and stimulates the attachment, proliferation, alkaline phosphate (ALP) activity and bone-related gene expression (ALP, OCN, COL1 and Runx2) of human bone marrow stromal cells. Our results suggest that the preparation of self-assembled Ca-P/polydopamine composite nanolayers is a viable method to modify the surface of biomaterials by significantly improving their surface physicochemical properties and cellular bioactivity for bone regeneration application. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

84891442807	Self-assembled main-chain poly(bile acid) membranes that wrinkle	With prospects for application in much scientific research, wrinkle patterns have attracted much attention. Several delicate methods, including a pre-patterning process and a controlled stress release procedure, have been developed to fabricate well-controlled wrinkle patterns. In this work, we discovered accidentally that unsophisticated mechanical scratching can also lead to ordered wrinkle structures. Combining experiment results and theoretical models as well as the folding properties of bile acid derivatives, it is revealed that ordered spring-like structures and their organized aggregates (multi-lamellar membranes), which are all based on unique amphiphilicity and rigid steroid skeletons, play a crucial role in the formation of well-organized wrinkle patterns. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to explain polymer wrinkle phenomena on a molecular level. Furthermore, due to their excellent biocompatibility, these polymers may serve as new wrinkling materials and exhibit potential uses in the field of bioengineering. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84892371343	The imbalanced profile and clinical significance of T helper associated cytokines in bone marrow microenvironment of the patients with acute myeloid leukemia	Background: Immunological disorder has shown to be related to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The microenvironment of AML is immunosuppressive, favoring the survival of malignant hematopoietic cells. However, the systematic research on AML abnormal immune microenvironment, especially the T helper (Th) cells imbalance, remains unsettled. Design and methods: The levels of cytokines in bone marrow plasma including Th1-associated cytokine (IFN-γ), Th2-associated cytokine (IL-4), Th17-associated cytokines (IL-17, IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-21), regulatory T cell (Treg)-associated cytokines (IL-35 and IL-10) and Th22-associated cytokine (IL-22) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in AML patients and controls. The relative expression levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-21 mRNA were analyzed by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Significant differences on cytokine levels tested were observed among the AML newly-diagnosed (ND) patients, AML patients in complete remission (CR) and controls except IL-21 and IL-35. In AML-ND group IFN-γ level was positively correlated with IL-21 or IL-22 level. Additionally, significant associations were observed between IL-17, IL-21 and some clinical characteristics. Conclusion: Our results showed that many cytokines were abnormal in AML bone marrow microenvironment. The dysregulation of Th subsets cytokines is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of AML. © 2013 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

84893449230	Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for the treatment of thin endometrium in experimental rats	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) induces stem cells to mobilize to the injury site, which have beneficial effect on tissue repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of G-CSF on the thin endometrium in rat models. In the present study, rats with thin endometrium were divided into 4 groups (experimental group I: administrated with G-CSF (40 μg/kg/d) 4-6 hours post-modeling; control group I: administrated with saline 4-6 hours post-modeling; experimental group II: administrated with G-CSF (40 μg/kg/d) 12 days post-modeling; control group II: administrated with saline 12 days post-modeling. The agentia was given once daily and last for 5 days. Endometrial morphology was analyzed by Hematoxylin-Eosin staining, and the regeneration of endometrial cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western-blot with cytokeratin and vimentin. We found that endometrial thickness and morphology presented a significant difference between experimental groups and control groups. No matter when we start with G-CSF, there was a significantly thicker endometrium and stronger expression of cytokeratin/vimintin in the experimental groups compared with the control groups (P<0.01). There were significant thicker endometrial lining and stronger expression of cytokeratin/vimintin in experimental group I than that of experimental group II (P<0.05), but there was no difference in the endometrial lining and the expression of cytokeratin/vimintin between the two control groups ( P>0.05). In conclusion, G-CSF can promote the regeneration of endometrial cells in animal research, especially when the G-CSF was administrated earlier. © 2013 Zhao et al.

84893078618	Elevated Th22 cells correlated with Th17 cells in peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological tumor in which progress T helper (Th) subsets including Th22, Th17, and Th1 cells play a pivotal role. However, the role of T helper (Th) subsets in the immune pathogenesis of AML remains unclear. Here, we investigated frequencies of Th22, Th17, pure Th17, and Th1 cells in the peripheral blood (PB) of AML patients. We demonstrated that Th22, Th17, and pure Th17 in newly-diagnosed (ND) and non-complete remission (Non-CR) AML patients and plasma IL-22 in ND AML patients were significantly increased. Retinoid-related orphan receptor C (RORC) expression was significantly elevated in CR and Non-CR AML patients. However, Th1 in ND AML patients and IL-17 in ND, Non-CR or CR AML patients was significantly decreased compared with controls. Moreover, Th22 and IL-22 showed positive correlation with pure Th17, but Th22 showed negative correlation with Th1 in ND AML patients. RORC showed positive correlation with Th22 and approximately positive correlation with pure Th17 in Non-CR patients. PB blast cell showed positive correlation with Th22 and negative correlation with Th1 in ND AML patients. Our results indicate that Th22 and pure Th17 cells conjointly contribute to the pathogenesis of AML and might be promising novel clinical index for AML. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84893558819	Smart photonic crystal hydrogels for biosensing applications	I often think that I might be able to manage. The attitude leads me to work actively. At the same time, I easily strike a compromise on encountering a difficulty. If this goes on, I cannot achieve growth or make a discovery. I might have to take an uncompromising stance. Smart hydrogels are a most interesting class of 'soft polymer' with high water content, the ability to swell rapidly and excellent biocompatibility. These hydrogel materials have found important applications in the biomedical domain. In this review paper, we will provide up-to-date research concerning the development of these responsive hydrogel materials for biosensor applications. We will focus on studies of photonic crystal hydrogels, in which the hydrogel materials were married with ordered nanostructures. Examples of photonic crystal hydrogels for sensing various types of analytes will be presented. Prospects for the future development of these remarkable hydrogel materials will also be presented. We do hope that this review will promote communication between biology, bionics, chemistry, optical physics and material science.

84893752276	Age at onset of recurrent major depression in Han Chinese women - A replication study	Background The relationship between age at onset (AAO) and major depression (MD) has been studied in US, European and Chinese populations. However, larger sample studies are needed to replicate and extend earlier findings. Methods We re-examined the relationship between AAO and the clinical features of recurrent MD in Han Chinese women by analyzing the phase I (N=1848), phase II (N=4169) and total combined data (N=6017) from the CONVERGE project. Linear, logistic, multiple linear and multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the association of AAO with continuous, binary and categorical variables. Results The effect size of the association between AAO and clinical features of MD was quite similar in the phase I and phase II samples. These results confirmed that MD patients with earlier AAO tended to suffer more severe, recurrent and chronic illness and cases of MD with earlier AAO showed increased neuroticism, greater family history and psychiatric comorbidity. In addition, we showed that earlier AAO of MD in Han Chinese women was associated with premenstrual symptoms, postnatal depression, a highly authoritarian or cold childhood parental rearing style and a reduced probability for having melancholia. Limitations Data were collected retrospectively through interview and recall bias may have affected the results. Conclusions MD with earlier AAO in Han Chinese women shows a distinct set of clinical features which are similar to those reported in Western populations. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84894076012	Anisotropic colloidal crystal particles from microfluidics	Anisotropic colloidal crystal particles (CCPs) have showed their great potential in biotechnology and structural materials due to their anisotropic shapes and tunable optical property. However, their controllable generation is still a challenge. Here, a novel microfluidic approach is developed to generate anisotropic CCPs. The microfluidic device is composed of an injection capillary and a collection capillary with available size and shape. Based on the device, the anisotropic particles with non-close-packed colloidal crystal structures are achieved by photo-polymerizing droplet templates in a confined collection capillary with different shapes and sizes. Moreover, anisotropic close-packed CCPs can be made from non-close-packed CCPs through a thermal process. It is demonstrated that the anisotropic CCPs in different sizes, structural colors and shapes (rods, cuboids and disks) can be generated. These distinguishable features of resultant particles make them ideal barcodes for high-throughput bioassays. In order to prove it, DNA multiplex detection is carried out. The experimental results indicate that achieved particles have a great encoding capacity and are highly practical for multiplex coding bioassays. Therefore, we believe that the anisotropic CCPs would be highly promising barcodes in biomedical applications, including high-throughput bioassays and cell culture research where multiplexing is needed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84894083668	Targeting Six1 by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth and invasion	The Six1 homeodomain protein is a developmental transcription factor that has been implicated in tumor onset and progression. Recently, it's reported that overexpression of Six1 is sufficient to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Moreover, its expression is significantly associated with poorer overall survival probability in advanced-stage colorectal cancer. To address whether Six1 could serve as a therapeutic target for human colorectal cancer, we used a lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) gene knockdown method to suppress the expression of Six1 in colorectal cancer cells. We showed that lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeted to Six1 gene efficiently reduced its expression in colorectal cancer cells at both mRNA and protein levels. In vitro functional assays revealed that knockdown of Six1 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, and inhibited cell migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, tumor xenograft model demonstrated that downregulation of Six1 dramatically inhibited colorectal cancer growth in vivo. In conclusion, these findings suggest that lentivirus-mediated Six1 inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of colorectal cancer.

84893915733	The prevalence, clinical correlates and structure of phobic fears in Han Chinese women with recurrent major depression	Background Phobic fears are common in the general population and among individuals with major depression (MD). We know little about the prevalence, clinical correlates, and structure of phobic fears in Chinese women with MD. Methods We assessed 22 phobic fears in 6017 Han Chinese women with MD. We used exploratory factor analysis to examine the structure of these phobic fears. We examined the relationship between individual phobic fears and the severity of MD, neuroticism, comorbid panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia using logistic regression models. Results The frequency of phobic fears ranged from 3.0% (eating in public) to 36.0% (snakes). Phobic fears were significantly associated with more severe MD, high neuroticism, and co-morbid panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia. Our factor analysis suggested four underlying subgroups of phobic fears which differed in their clinical correlates, severity and patterns of comorbidity. Limitations Data were collected retrospectively through interview and recall bias may have affected the results. Conclusions Phobic fears are correlated with comorbid MD and more severe MD. These phobic fears clearly subdivide into four subgroups that differ meaningfully from each other. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84896502346	Novel amplex red oxidases based on noncanonical DNA structures: Property studies and applications in microRNA detection	G-triplex has recently been identified as a new secondary structure in G-rich sequences. However, its functions and biological roles remain largely unknown. This study first developed two kinds of Amplex Red oxidases, which were based on relatively new G-triplex structure and a common G-quadruplex one. A collection of DNA binding assays including circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, a CD melting assay, and a UV titration study were used to determine the G-triplex structure of G3 oligomer. The low intrinsic oxidative activity of hemin was significantly enhanced using G-triplex or G-quadruplex. Only one key guanine deletion from the G3 oligomer or G4 one could result in a much decreased Amplex Red oxidation activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting direct use of air as the oxidant for fluorescence generation based on DNAzyme strategies. Further mechanism studies demonstrated an involvement of on-site H

84899129771	Distinct modifications of convergent excitatory and inhibitory inputs in developing olfactory circuits	The interaction between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is critical to neuronal signal processing. However, little is known about this fundamental property, largely due to the inability to clearly isolate the respective inputs. Here we took advantage of the characteristic stereotypical architecture of synaptic connections in the main olfactory bulb, which enabled us to entirely separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Using paired stimulation of two glomeruli located apart at different intensities, we separately elicited excitatory and inhibitory inputs and mimicked stimulation of competing mitral cells (MCs) with different odorants. We performed dual whole-cell patch recording of evoked excitatory postsynaptic responses (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic responses (IPSPs) in current-clamp mode from two competitive MCs that are connected to the two stimulated glomeruli in slices of the main olfactory bulb in 2-3-week-old rats. We deliberately held the recorded cells at a relative hyperpolarized potential. This manipulation not only suppressed action potential generation but also excluded the possible contamination of inhibitory components in excitatory inputs. We found that in weakly activated MCs repetitive EPSP-IPSP interactions (5. Hz, 180 times) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in convergent excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively. Unexpectedly, these forms of plasticity depend on activity of somatic (mainly non-synaptic) NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In contrast, the same repetitive stimulation induced the LTP of excitatory inputs in strongly activated MCs (MC2) that require activity of synaptic NMDARs. These distinct forms of plasticity in the developing olfactory circuit may represent a novel rule of modification in convergent inputs that leads to decorrelation of inputs and facilitates odor discrimination. © 2014 IBRO.

84899464927	Cytoplasmic retention of a nucleocytoplasmic protein TBC1D3 by microtubule network is required for enhanced EGFR signaling	The hominoid oncogene TBC1D3 enhances epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and induces cell transformation. However, little is known regarding its spatio-temporal regulation and mechanism of tumorigenesis. In the current study, we identified the microtubule subunit β-tubulin as a potential interaction partner for TBC1D3 using affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry analysis. The interaction between TBC1D3 and β-tubulin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Using the same method, we also revealed that TBC1D3 co-precipitated with endogenous α-tubulin, another subunit of the microtubule. In agreement with these results, microtubule cosedimentation assays showed that TBC1D3 associated with the microtubule network. The β-tubulin-interacting site of TBC1D3 was mapped to amino acids 286-353 near the C-terminus of the TBC domain. Deletion mutation within these amino acids was shown to abolish the interaction of TBC1D3 with β-tubulin. Interestingly, the deletion mutation caused a complete loss of TBC1D3 from the cytoplasmic filamentous and punctate structures, and TBC1D3 instead appeared in the nucleus. Consistent with this, wild-type TBC1D3 exhibited the same nucleocytoplasmic distribution in cells treated with the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole, suggesting that the microtubule network associates with and retains TBC1D3 in the cytoplasm. We further found that deficiency in β-tubulin-interacting resulted in TBC1D3's inability to inhibit c-Cbl recruitment and EGFR ubiquitination, ultimately leading to dysregulation of EGFR degradation and signaling. Taken together, these studies indicate a novel model by which the microtubule network regulates EGFR stability and signaling through tubulin dimer/oligomer interaction with the nucleocytoplasmic protein TBC1D3. © 2014 He et al.

84901334300	Facile fabrication of reactive plasmonic substrates for fluorescence enhancement via mussel-inspired chemistry	Based on the fascinating properties of polydopamine (PDA), a simple strategy was developed for facilely and efficiently fabricating plasmonic substrate with nanohybrid structure (PDA/Metal NPs/PDA). Because of the good reductive ability of PDA, metal nanoparticles such as Ag, Au, or Ag/Au hybrid particles with the good control of size and distribution on plasmonic substrate could be easily achieved. Also, owing to the exceptional self-adhesive nature, the presynthesized monodisperse metal NPs can be directly adsorbed to the surface to enrich plasmon response. Moreover, by carefully tuning the dopamine immersion time, the formed nanohybrid structure PDA/metal NPs/PDA enabled the distance-dependent MEF phenomenon where the distance could be controlled with a resolution of approximately 1 nm. In particular, the covalent (Michael addition or Schiff-base reaction) binding enabled us an easy but efficient way to immobilize a large diverse fluorophores or biomolecules on plasmonic substrate. All these above properties indicated the promising PDA-based plasmonic substrate for fluorescence enhancement. As a demonstration of the good fluorescence enhancement property, thiol-based dye was used. The ca. 5-fold fluorescence intensity enhancement on the plasmonic substrate with pattern structure clearly proved that PDA-based plasmonic substrate was indeed a good reactive platform for fluorescence enhancement. With the assistance of FDTD, the electromagnetic near-field distributions and the radiative power emitted by fluorophores on the substrate were found to be significantly improved, further helpful for explaining our experimental observations. Finally, the optimal set calculations guided us that based on the careful selection of fluorophore and space distance, a better fluorescence enhancement could be achieved for further optical and biological applications. These performed experiments suggested that the PDA-based fabricating protocol is indeed a powerful strategy for creating plasmon substrate that could find a wide range of applications. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Methods: Rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group, model group (permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries, 2VO) and experimental group (treated with escitalopram at the dosage of 30 mg/kg·d). Rats were selected as study objects at week 1, 2, 4 and 8 after administration in each group. Their cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze, the expression of BDNF protein was measured by Western blot, and dendritic morphology was studied by Golgi staining. Results: In the Morris water maze test, the escape latency obviously extended in model group and experimental group compared with that in sham-operation group (P<0.05), while the escape latency was shorter in experimental group than in model group (P<0.05). Compared with those in sham-operation group, the dendritic length and arborization and the density of dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 significantly decreased in model group and experimental group (P<0.05), while they increased significantly in experimental group compared with model group (P<0.05) by Golgi staining. Compared with sham-operation group, the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of experimental group and model group significantly decreased (P<0.05), but it increased significantly in experiment group compared with model group (P<0.05) by Western blot. Conclusion: Escitalopram could significantly delay the progression of cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral ischemia in rats. The improvement of learning and memory may be related to the increased expression of BDNF.

Here, we constructed a novel polyepitope vaccine which used recombinant lentiviral vector carrying BCR/ABL and WT1 genes, and determined the immunological effects of this vaccine in vitro. Methods: The DC vaccine was constructed using lentiviral vector transduced DCs. T lymphocytes were stimulated with DC vaccine and then co-cultured in vitro with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CML or ALL patients, respectively. The cytotoxicity of proliferous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was determined by the LDH assay. The IFN-γ production of CTLs was detected using ELISPOT assay. Results: We constructed an lentiviral vector encoding 50 different epitopes from BCR/ABL and WT1 antigens, and transferred it into DCs to prepare the DC vaccine successfully. The in vivo stimulation of CTLs with this DC vaccine were proved to show strong cytotoxicity and produce high level of IFN-γ. Conclusions: The novel recombinant lentiviral polyepitope DC vaccine is a promising candidate for clinical trials and may be an effective approach for CML immunotherapy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and DNMT3A mutations frequently occurred in AML patients and have been found conferred with myeloproliferative neoplasms in mouse model. Therefore, we sought to search for mutations in JAK2V617F, FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and DNMT3A in 129 cases including 120 classic MPN cases and 9 MDS/MPN cases. JAK2V617F mutation was found in 60% of the 120 classic MPNs. However, none of the patients displayed FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations; only 2 patients harbored DNMT3A R882 mutation. Further studies including whole-genome sequence will be conducted to investigate the possible involvement of these genes in MPN. © 2014 Min Wang et al.
