8644268075	Analysis and structure design of a flexible lamellate hinge for unmanned aerial vehicle control surface	A concept of a flexible lamellar hinge for UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) control surfaces is presented. The flexible lamellar hinge is a strip of lamellar jointing stabilizer and control surface, it can increase the aerodynamics efficiency of the control surface by preventing airflow turbulence through gap between stabilizer and control surface. The results of the model test in the wind tunnel show that the aerodynamics efficiency of the control surface using flexible lamellar hinge increases about 40 percent than that of the traditional ones. The design objectives of a flexible lamellar hinge include to meet the demand of control surface movement and to support control surface and its aerodynamics load. The lamellar hinge is designed as thin GFRP (glass-fiber reinforced polymer) laminates. The principle of control surface movement is analyzed. Different from traditional control surface, it is not rotary movement on fixed axis. When control surface is moving, the lamellar hinge is bent into column shape, and column radius and center of curvature vary with the movement of control surface. We also gave the motion equation of point in control surface for control mechanism design. The key point in designing flexible lamellar hinge structure is bending rigidity and/or flexural rigidity, it is achieved by composite laminates design. The flexibility of control surface can be calculated in term of cantilever theory. We designed a flexible lamellar hinge for a certain type of UAV.

0031294821	Variable structure control for aircraft in wind shear field	This paper examines the application of variable structure control theory to the design of a flight path control system for an aircraft landing in an unknown wind shear field. The objective in variable structure design is to confine the state trajectories to a subspace of the total state space. The motion in the subspace is insensitive to system parameter variations and external wind shear disturbance that lie within the space limits of the control. A switching type of control law is naturally obtained during the design procedure. The design process consists of three parts. First, the windshear and the system perturbation are taken as uncertain factors and the uncertain system model is presented. Then the invariance conditions for an aircraft with respect to the wind shear disturbance and the system parameter variations are derived. Finally the sliding hypersurface of the variable structure control system and the flight path control laws are designed. This control technique is feasible and efficient when applied to simulation calculations of CITATION II aircraft penetrating a wind shear field to land.

33845433385	Low Reynolds number high-lift airfoil design for HALE concept UAV	This paper is focused on the design and analysis of a new laminar flow airfoil for a high-altitude long-endurance concept aircraft. It is expected that the new designed airfoil have the maximum possible thickness and the best polar performance at relative low Reynolds numbers. The powerful inverse design methods can efficiently produce the anticipant airfoil shapes by solving the classical inverse problem of determining the aerodynamic shape that will produce given pressure distributions. For a successful design, the translation of the design goal into a properly defined pressure distribution which usually exhibits the required aerodynamic characteristics is a difficult problem. Aimed at this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been employed to optimize target pressure distributions for aerodynamic inverse design methods in the current study. Once the target pressure distributions are obtained, the corresponding airfoil geometries can be produced by an inverse design method. This paper outlines the design procedures. It was shown from the design samples that the design efficiency has been improved by providing the designer with tools for target pressure specification.

The non-cooperative cases involve single AUAV single target case, single AUAV multi-target case, multi-AUAV single target case and multi-AUAV multi-target case at unknown locations. For non-cooperative cases, AUAVs independently search, detect, identify and attack a target identified by themselves. For the cooperative case of multi-AUAV multi-target case, communications among AUAVs are allowed to help identify and pursue attacking targets. On the basis of the search theory, the mathematical models of mission performance evaluation for various cases are established and outcome tree for search confusion matrix of a single target or multi-targets is developed. The numerical results of the examples given show preliminarily that the probability of mission success for non cooperative cases begins to drop off rapidly for FTAR>0.01 but it can be greatly improved for cooperative cases.

38949139543	Ingenious idea for improving aerodynamic moment character of airfoil	In wing designing, bad aerodynamic moment character of an airfoil leads to large trim drag and bad longitudinal stability. How to improve aerodynamic moment character while keeping desirable basic aerodynamic characteristics unchanged is extremely difficult. We now present an ingenious idea that can do it. Also we will present preliminary experimental evidence that show our idea is feasible. The idea is that we take an airfoil called G140 by us which has satisfactory basic aerodynamic characteristics, and changes part of its trailing edge into a flat segment, approximately 5-8% of chord, thus creating a new airfoil called T140 by us. Our calculations and experiments were done for a T140 airfoil, whose flat segment is 7.5% of chord. In the full paper, we explain the idea and its implementation in some detail.

In the stage of conceptual design of a solar UAV, in order to estimate the scheme rapidly and accurately, it is necessary to research the characteristics of flight dynamics and control thoroughly. In this paper, the Lagrangian method is employed to model the motion of rigid UAV and the same configuration undergoing static deformation and aeroelastic deformation, the characteristics of flight dynamics and control are compared and it can be found that, while considering the static deformation only, since the pitch moment of inertia become large, the damp and frequency of short period and phugoid are reduced, and the gain of control law should be reduced a little for the same response with rigid UAV. While for elastic UAV, since its phugoid movement is coupled with the aeroelastic movement of wing, the damp and frequency of phugoid increase distinctly, so the gain of control law must be adjust greatly for the same response. ©2010 IEEE.

Numerical studies are conducted to investigate the beneficial effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the quasi "Global Hawk" airfoil using arrays of jets during the gust process. Based on unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, the grid-velocity method is introduced to simulate the gust influence, and dynamic response in vertical gust flow perturbation is investigated for the airfoil as well. An unsteady surface transpiration boundary condition is enforced over a user specified portion of the airfoil's surface to emulate the time dependent velocity boundary conditions. Firstly, after applying this method to simulate typical NACA0006 airfoil gust response to a step change in the angle of attack, it shows that the indicial responses of the airfoil make good agreement with the exact theoretical values and the calculated values in references. Furthermore, gust response characteristic for the quasi "Global Hawk" airfoil is analyzed. Five kinds of flow control techniques are introduced as steady blowing, steady suction, unsteady blowing, unsteady suction and synthetic jets. The physical analysis of the influence on the effects of gust load alleviation is proposed to provide some guidelines for practice.

In section 1 of the full paper, we describe the special features of such a flying wing, using the U.S. B-2 as an example. In section 2, we give Fig. 2 to show that both the drag and lateral force of the flying wing increase approximately linearly with increasing deflection angle of the drag rudder, thus increasing the yawing moment. Fig. 2 also shows that the nonlinear change of lift subsequently brings about the nonlinearities respectively of the pitch moment and the roll moment of the flying wing. Also in section 2, we give Fig. 3 to demonstrate that at the small angle of attack, the aerodynamic coefficient does not change appreciably, while at the large angle of attack, it changes remarkably and the pitch moment, in particular, decreases sharply. In section 3, we design the control law of the drag rudder. In doing so, we propose controlling the direction and velocity of the flying wing with the drag rudder. We point out that the deflection of the drag rudder produces rather big pitch moment. Therefore, it is necessary to use both the drag rudder and the elevator to perform interactive control. In section 4, we carry out the computer simulation of the drag rudder utilization. The simulation results, shown in Figs. 5 through 7, indicate preliminarily that the drag rudder can satisfactorily control the direction and velocity of the flying wing and that the interactive control has stable response speed, with the altitude error reduced by 33% and the pitch angle error by 56% respectively.

The results of simulation show that, while the highly flexible UAV suffers gust, the SOF controller can restrains the oscillation of angle of attack and the deformation of the wing, and the maximum displacement of the tip of the wing is reduced by 33%.

79957567972	Numerical simulation of missile launching and aerodynamic interference with plume effects	This paper simulates a missile launch process by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, through which the aerodynamic interference and rules of missile movement with and without consideration of the plume field are studied. A moving chimera grid approach is used coupled with an unsteady Euler flow solver, and a 6-DOF model is fully integrated into the CFD solution procedure to capture the time-dependent interference between the stationary and moving boundaries. Two thruster models are developed to account for the influence of thruster rockets on the flowfield. One model applies an equivalent massflux at the rocket nozzle exit in order to simulate the rocket plume effects. For the second model, the thrust vector exerted by the rockets is attached to the missile body for the duration of the run. And the paper presents the results obtained for a time-accurate missile launching from the quasi-'Global Hawk' unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by the developed numerical methods. All major trends of the trajectory are captured, including the displacements, angular orientations, pressure coefficient distribution on the plane in the captive position, and force coefficients histories during separation, which are then used for comparison. The results show that the effect of the plume field is significant on the missile dynamic characteristics and aerodynamic interference. The simulations may provide a tool for design verification and risk mitigation for the missile launch procedure.

Based on target decomposition theory, the relationship between complex interferometric coherence with height, extinction coefficient and topographic phase is quantitatively derived, and the extinction coefficient is regarded as a function of polarization components, so the coherent scattering model with obvious polarization characteristics is established. On this basis, considering the polarization dependence of model, full polarimetric interferometric coherence are used as input parameters, and then the vegetation height and topographic phase are retrieved by the three-stage method. Next, hard-in-loop polarimetric interferometric synthetic aperture radar (POLINSAR) system is constructed in anechoic chamber to validate the model, and a scene composed of araucarias and soil are measured. The experimental results show that the retrieval height is fluctuated 0.03 m to the actual height when the ground-to-volume ratio is lower than -10 dB, which validates the effectiveness of the model. ©2012 by Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Radio Science.

Through the influence functions, the displacement and deformer of the flow-field boundary are spread to ambient flow-field. The node of the grid can obtain the displacement through the influence functions and a new grid is built.

84863377074	Research of the gust response and gust alleviation based on direct force control	The paper presents a methodology for calculating the unsteady aerodynamic forces characteristics and gust response of the unmanned air vehicle (UAV) model using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools, and the efficiency of gust alleviation based on direct force control are also studied. Based on unsteady Euler equations, dynamic responses in vertical gust flow perturbation are investigated. The grid velocity method, which is used to model unsteady flow via grid movement, is introduced to simulate the gust influence. This approach avoids numerical instabilities and decouples the step change in the angle of attack from a pitch rate. And the dynamic chimera grid method is used to simulate the rudder movement of the gust alleviation effect. Numerical results for the NACA0006 airfoil are validated by comparison with analytical results for two-dimensional indicial responses. The initial and final lift values of the indicial responses closely match the exact analytical values as given by piston theory and quasi steady thin airfoil theory respectively. The solutions at small times match quite closely the exact solution which is known only for small times given by linear theory. The application of the same method to the UAV model reveals important characteristics of the three-dimensional vertical discrete gust response for the One-minus-cosine gust profile and gusts cause step changes in the angle of attack, and important characteristics of the gust response and resulting flow features are explained. Furthermore, the flow perturbations under dynamic rudder motion are investigated using moving chimera grid technique. Our study shows that with certain designed motions, the flapping rudder can effectively alleviate the freestream gust fluctuation and ensure a stable flight. However, no single parameter can determine whether the flapping rudder can reduce the gust effect. Finally, unsteady aerodynamic loads are computed for the wing of model with the designed rudder motion, the significance of the gust propagation effects is shown. It is found that the direct calculation of the gust response using CFD gives quite accurate results and provides a rich database. In general, this paper shows that the well-designed rudder movement can effectively alleviate the freestream gust fluctuation and ensure high flight qualities.

Based on the photovoltaic power generation model, this paper predicted solar cell performance by simulating the solar radiation and the solar cell temperature, both of which change hourly as flight time, speed and altitude and other working conditions change. Our results suggest that flight time is the most important impact factor on solar cell performance and the performance indices agree with the asymmetry around 12 o'clock solar time. Changes in flight altitude make the solar radiation and the ambient temperature change; the open circuit voltage, the short circuit current and the peak power will rise 1.52%, 1.49% and 3.65% respectively for 1 km rise in flight altitude. Changes in the flight speed make solar cell temperature change; the open circuit voltage and the peak power will rise by 3.90% and 5.32% respectively but the short circuit current will drop by 0.31% for 10 m/h increase in flight speed. Through the above research, this paper predicted the solar cell performance under different working conditions and laid a theoretical foundation for the correct selection and improvement of Chinese energy systems programs.

When it is used for avoiding dynamic obstacles, the intermittent local minimum problem and oscillation phenomenon will be emerged because only the path of mobile robots can be changed through force analysis whereas the speed of mobile robots can not be adjusted. Therefore, the real time property and maneuverability during the running process of mobile robots are greatly influenced by above problems. A novel dynamic obstacles avoiding method which called collision prediction algorithm (CPA) is proposed and it is combined with APF in order to solve the problems mentioned above. The APF is used when moving obstacles are not entering into the prediction area, otherwise, the CPA is carried out for path planning. In CPA, whether the collision between obstacles and mobile robots is happened should be judged at first. If it is happened, then the position of collision is predicted. Finally the speed of mobile robots is changed according to the prediction results so that the moving obstacles can be avoid quickly and effectively. © 2012 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

84880393747	Improving the geometrically nonlinear intrinsic beam element model of wing for high efficiency	The geometrically exact, nonlinear intrinsic beam element model proposed by Hodges, et al. is known as its space-time conservation law. Its shortcoming is that, in dealing with the structural dynamics of a flexible wing, the number of independent variables increase exponentially while the discrete nodes increase; furthermore, the set of equations become stiff and lead to low efficiency in numerical calculation. In order to improve the structural dynamics model of a common cantilever wing, this paper derives a spatial condensation method according to the boundary conditions of a spatial discrete model to convert the spatial discrete equations to ordinary matrix equations, and then the original equations become ordinary differential equations related to time domain only. Thus, the number of equations and the looping steps in their solution can be decreased greatly, and the Jacobian matrix can also be derived easily from the improved equations. The Gear method is employed to solve the original intrinsic beam element model and the condensation model proposed in this paper respectively. The results show that the proposed spatial condensation model can improve the operating rate by about 5.1 times as compared with the original model under the same conditions, and it exhibits high universality, stability and efficiency for different force models.

84883483860	Analysis of conceptual parameters of lift-fan VTOL aircraft in transition	Lift-fan VTOL aircraft is a special type of fixed wing aircraft, whose three modes are: helicopter-like hover, fixed-wing, and special transition. Among these three modes, aerodynamic lift system and direct lift system share only one engine system. The working conditions of the two lift systems differ apparently. Consequently, the relationships among conceptual parameters of lift-fan VTOL aircraft are different from those of conventional aircraft. On the basis of classical momentum theory, we established a preliminary model for analyzing characteristics of lift, drag and power. Then we assessed the impacts of the conceptual parameters exerted on characteristics of total drag and power consumed. We gave feasible methods for so selecting and weighing the conceptual parameters as to meet the requirements of reducing "surplus power" and saving more fuel during transition for cruising efficiency.

84886256973	Drag reduction research on multi-bump technology for supercritical airfoil	We study the flow characteristics of supercritical airfoil; we have tested some classic examples to explore the flow mechanism of multi-bump technology and to study the characteristics of drag reduction by taking advantage of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. We analyze the flow mechanism of multi-bump and then adjust the location and the geometry of multi-block. We find that not only the bump near the shock can reduce the wave drag but also the bump located near the leading-edge can improve the flow properties of airfoil. We applied multi-bump technology to RAE2822, and we find that the multi-bump technology can get more drag reduction, and that the total drag reduction can reach 11.5%.

84886285209	Power characteristics of photovoltaic modules of solar-powered airplanes including thermal effects	A power characteristic model of photovoltaic (PV) modules on the wing of solar-powered airplanes operated from sea level to the stratosphere is established. Because the efficiency of PV modules is a function of surface temperature, the proposed model includes thermodynamic effects. Firstly, the real-time power characteristics are analyzed at the altitudes of 10 km and 30 km and during the summer and winter solstice. Then, further investigations are conducted to research the daily averaged power per unit area from 0 km to 35 km throughout a whole year. The results show that the low atmosphere temperature is favorable condition for PV modules to obtain high absorption efficiency, and total solar radiation increases with the altitude increasing. However, the thinness of atmosphere density at high altitudes leads the deduction of Reynolds number, resulting in less heat carried away and the efficiency deterioration of PV modules. The maximum power collected occurs around 11 km. The research work shows that it is necessary to take into consideration the thermal effects on the efficiency of PV modules at high altitudes. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84886285947	Exploring an effective method of thrust allocation for solar-powered UAV with multiple propellers	Designing a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) should center on its energy. As the majority of solar-powered UAVs have distributive propulsion systems, the optimization of their thrust allocation may effectively enhance the efficiency of the propeller and energy utilization. When the function from thrust to propeller efficiency is a convex one, the maximum allocation of the sum of propeller efficiency can be approximately converted into the two-norm minimum allocation of thrust, which can be achieved with the pseudo-inverse method. Taking the minimization of the error of the pseudo-instruction as one of optimization objectives, we obtain the mixed optimization objective. Then we use the fixed point method to achieve the mixed optimization objective. As the attenuation and hysteresis of the propeller may increase the error of the pseudo-instruction, we use the dynamic gain to compensate for the dynamic characteristics of the propeller. Finally we simulate the thrust allocation of the solar-powered UAV and the compensation for the propeller's dynamic characteristics. The simulation results, given in Tables 1 through 4 and Figs. 4, 5, 7 and 8, and their comparison show preliminarily that: (1) compared with the pseudo-inverse method, the fixed point method can not only reduce the error of pseudo-instruction but also effectively achieve maximum energy efficiency of the propulsion system; (2) the dynamic gain compensation can effectively reduce the adverse influence of the propeller's dynamic characteristics on the thrust allocation.

84887519477	The analysis of motion characteristics of variable forward-swept wing mechanism with a double slideways	Based on the variable forward-swept wing configuration, this paper utilized a variable forward-swept wing mechanism with a double slideways, which make it possible for the aircraft to switch among orthogonal wing, forward-swept wing and delta wing freely. The general configuration of the variable forward-swept wing mechanism with a double slideways was elucidated by means of a three-dimensional model plot and then the mathematic simulation model was also established. The motion characteristics of linear motion were simulated, analyzed and optimized. The results indicated that the variable forward-swept wing mechanism with a double slideways can meet the aerodynamic requirements better. Moreover, there exists great linear relationship between the position of nut and the wing forward-swept angle. Therefore, this mechanism may serve as a useful reference when developing a morphing aircraft. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84894292059	Flight control system design for a flying-wing aircraft	In this paper, the flight control system of a flying-wing aircraft is designed. Significant dynamic nonlinearity and control redundancy are main problems for a flying-wing aircraft. As the over-actuated system and dynamic nonlinearity, the flight control system is divided into two parts: control laws and control allocation. Nonlinear dynamic inversion is used to design the control laws to generate control moments as the commands of control allocator. Because the relationship between moment and effector deflection is nonlinear, the nonlinear control allocation based on SQP is designed.

84896036326	NMPC based path following for a small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle in a dynamic environment	The goal of the paper is to make a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) follow a predefined path while avoiding previously unknown obstacles including pop-up threats and the moving obstacle in a dynamic environment. The predefined path is represented by a Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curve and the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm is used for real-time PH path following and collision avoidance in view of pop-up threats and the moving obstacle. A new form of cost function for the NMPC is proposed, which includes a navigation cost function for the PH path following a new type of collision avoidance cost for large obstacle avoidance, and an additional function penalizing the cost function in the case of the UAV flying back after obstacle avoidance. MATLAB based simulation experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to successfully avoid unknown obstacles in a dynamic environment while following the predefined PH path. © 2013 WIT Press.

84896540999	A control allocation method for flying wing aircraft with control effector interactions considered	For flying wing aircraft with large ratio, split-rudder is used for pitch and drag control; this leads to the occurrence of control effector interactions between the split-rudder and adjacent control surface. As the nonlinear characteristics of interaction moment is prominent, control allocation methods based on linear model produce a certain error. Sequential linear programming can solve the problem of considering the control interactions, but its performance highly relies on the mathematical form of interaction moment and the solving process requiring multiple linear programming may lead to a poor real-time performance. In this paper, a method based on compensation and linear programming is given. This method needs a greater control input, but real-time performance is significantly better than Sequential linear programming, and the mathematical form of interaction moment is relaxed.

84896268974	UAV path following in 3-D dynamic environment	When flying in dynamic environment, fixed-wing UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) following the reference path will collide with unknown obstacles. To solve the problems, a real-time obstacle avoidance path following algorithm is proposed. Firstly, 3-D Pythagorean hodograph (PH) is adopted as a reference flight path for its continuous curvature and smoothness, which is able to meet the kinematical constraint of fixed-wing UAV and is more suitable for path following. Then, sufficient conditions of stably following a parameterized path in three dimensions are given. A nonlinear model predictive controller is designed for 3-D PH path following, in which the form of objective function is modified to make the UAV timely avoid large unknown static and moving obstacles and fly towards the target after obstacle avoidance during path following. Finally, MATLAB based simulation experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

To address this issue, this paper discusses the coupling and compensation method of unit cells in different directions, and proposes an improved transmission/reflection method based on bi-directional coupling compensation. The results of this improved method indicate that comparing with traditional methods, this method can effectively predict multiple resonant regions, and calculate electromagnetic parameters of the whole material more accurately. The simulation results fit well with the results by using Ansoft HFSS software, but the corresponding computing time and hardware requirements of this method are obviously reduced due to the application of local modeling computation.

84898848208	Research on longitudinal static stability for VFSW tailless configuration UAV	The Variable Forward-Swept Wing (VFSW) Tailless configuration UAV can well satisfy multipurpose demands. However, this kind of unconventional morphing aircraft lacks tail, which brings great challenge to stability analysis. The connatural aero-elasticity divergence and the strong aerodynamic coupling as well as many uncertain factors in mechanical environment, give the VFSW Tailless configuration UAV complicated dynamic characteristics. During the process of transformation, the variation of dynamic shape will inevitably lead to the variation about aerodynamic center and barycentre positions of airplane, then make the angle of attack static stability margin variable, and directly influence stability of aircraft. On the basis of introduction of the VFSW Tailless configuration UAV, according to its geometric shape, positions of aerodynamic center and barycentre, in different states with different forward-swept angle, were calculated, so as to obtain variation curve of longitudinal static stability margin, which provided preferences for dynamics analysis, position of barycentre adjustment and design of flight control system (FCS). © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84903901007	Primary parameters determination for year-round solar-powered aircraft of wing-sail type at higher latitudes	Exploration of the capability of a solar-powered aircraft for year-round station keeping at higher latitudes is of great significance for the enhancement of its operational value. In this paper a model of power area density for PV modules arbitrarily oriented is first established which takes into consideration the temperature of the PV modules, flight altitude, flight latitude, and year-round seasons. The analysis on power absorption shows that the rotation angle of 90° is the optimal in the azimuth tracking method for a pair of sail tails in use. Secondly, a conceptual design methodology of solar-powered aircraft of a wing-sail configuration is developed which integrates the configuration design with energy absorption, and its formulations include mass component parameterization, aerodynamic efficiency, Kriging surrogate model and quantum behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm and its fitness function. Thirdly, a comparison of design methodology is conducted for the wing-sail configuration and wing-only configuration. Finally, a case study of the wing-sail configuration is conducted at the latitude of near 45°N and the altitude of higher than 18 km and its capabilities of operational altitude, payload-carrying and operational latitude in a whole year are investigated from 23.5°N to 55°N. The results show that in contrast with the traditional configuration, the wing-sail configuration improves power absorption characteristics at higher latitudes near winter, shortens the wingspan and reduce the wing area effectively, improves cruise velocity and makes year-round operation at higher latitudes feasible and efficient. These applications demonstrate the validity of the proposed design methodology of primary parameters of the wing-tail configuration solar-powered aircraft.

The coupled numerical simulation is also carried out on the inflow/outflow integrated for flying wing UAV, and it is applied to study the longitudinal aerodynamic performance of UAV and the flow characteristics of inlet under different flight conditions. Results indicate: The longitudinal aerodynamic performance of the model with power system is close to the model with pipeline connected, but the moment characteristic of the former is better; The inlet characteristics are similar when Ma=0.5 and Ma=0.6; As the mach number increasing, the inlet performance decreases rapidly, Especially at the Ma = 0.7, there is a large low-pressure dominated region at the small angle of attack α = 2°, which leads to the total pressure recovery coefficient decreasing rapidly and the flow distortion increasing obviously. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the beneficial effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the NLR airfoil using the AFC technique and conventional control surface during the gust process. Based on unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, the grid-velocity method is introduced to simulate the gust influence, and an unsteady suction/blowing boundary condition is enforced over a user specified portion of the airfoil's surface to emulate the AFC actuator.

In general, the configurations are classified into two representative types-the conventional and the wing-sail. The wing-sail configuration employs sail tails that can rotate around individual roll axes to maximize solar energy absorption, and photovoltaic (PV) modules are coupled to the wing and only one side of each sail tail. The configuration sizes are treated as key design variables, including wingspan, aspect ratio of wing, and area ratio of sail tails to the wing. The established methodology mainly contains two parts. The first part parameterizes energy absorption and energy consumption, mass components and aerodynamic efficiency. The second part employs an optimal approach to obtain a group of optimized solutions. Then, the methodology is applied to analyze conceptual parameters at different latitudes for both configurations. Finally, a solar powered stratospheric UAV concept of wing-sail configuration, PoXiao, is proposed for year-round operation at middle latitudes. Its energy performance is investigated to validate the operational altitude and latitude capabilities throughout a whole year and demonstrate the utility of the design methodology. The characteristics of stability and control for the wing-sail configuration is also preliminary analyzed.

HF-1 to treat tobacco wastewater	This study evaluated and optimized the influence of inoculum amount, initial pH, and nicotine load on the construction of Pseudomonas sp. HF-1 bioaugmented system for tobacco wastewater treatment. The results demonstrated that the optimum condition for the set-up of strain HF-1 bioaugmented system was 1.10 mg/g (dry weight of strain HF-1/dry weight of activated sludge) of inoculum amount, initial pH 7.0, and 250-1000 mg/L nicotine load. Higher than 1.10 mg/g could lead to noncolonization of strain HF-1 in activated sludge and failure of set-up of this bioaugmented system. Higher than pH 8.0 could restrain the colonization of strain HF-1 in activated sludge. Even though strain HF-1 colonizes in the activated sludge when pH was above 8.0, the removal of nicotine and total organic carbon (TOC) was suppressed due to low activities of bacteria in the activated sludge. Nicotine load did not show inhibition effect on set-up of bioaugmented system, but the ability of TOC removal was restrained when the nicotine load was above 1000 mg/L. This work could offer vital parameters for the set-up of bioaugmented system to treat tobacco wastewater in engineering.

84920879695	Design and optimization of low detectable wing structure based on LHM	Low detectable wing structure can meet the aerodynamic, structure and stealth requirement of aircraft wing, but when it is applied to the wing with limited space, its stealth effect is restricted because of its structural characteristics. In order to solve this problem, left-handed material (LHM) is added in the traditional stealth structure in this paper. Firstly, from the viewpoint of stealth design, a typical LHM is selected to study its electromagnetic property by using the backward absorption rate which is calculated from its radar cross section (RCS) at different incidence angles. Then the LHM is used in the wing stealth structure according to its electromagnetic property. With the same RCS reduction effect, the application of LHM can effectively reduce the volume of the stealth structure. Finally, to further enhance the RCS reduction effect, a sandwich low detectable wing structure with LHM is put forward and the structure parameters are optimized by the surrogate model. The results show that the optimal structure RCS is reduced by 15 dB compared to the RCS of metal wing; it is reduced by more than 10 dB compared to the same wing structure without LHM.
