2442612543	Quality evaluation of fingerprints of herbal medicine with chromatographic data	In this study, local least squares (LLS) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to deal with the disturbances in a data set of chromatographic fingerprints after necessary data transformations. It has been demonstrated that PCA with standard normal variate (SNV) transformation of data led to meaningful classification of 33 different Erigeron breviscapus herbal samples. The result was also corroborated by variance squares discriminant method. The quality of herbal objects was further evaluated, and the causes of this fact have been explained from a chemical point of view. At the same time, it implied an idea for qualitative evaluation of the herbal objects with a common class pattern of chromatographic fingerprints. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

27644498605	Improvement of the partial least squares model performance for oral glucose intake experiments by inside mean centering and inside multiplicative signal correction	Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has become a promising technique for the in vivo monitoring of glucose. Several capillary-rich locations in the body, such as the tongue, forearm, and finger, have been used to collect the in vivo spectra of blood glucose. For such an in vivo determination of blood glucose, collected NIR spectra often show some dependence on the measurement conditions and human body features at the location on which a probe touches. If NIR spectra collected for different oral glucose intake experiments, in which the skin of different patients and the measurement conditions may be quite different, are directly used, partial least squares (PLS) models built by using them would often show a large prediction error because of the differences in the skin of patients and the measurement conditions. In the present study, the NIR spectra in the range of 1300-1900 nm were measured by conveniently touching an optical fiber probe on the forearm skin with a system that was developed for in vivo measurements in our previous work.

3242726813	Monte Carlo cross-validation for selecting a model and estimating the prediction error in multivariate calibration	A new simple and effective method named Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV) has been introduced and evaluated for selecting a model and estimating the prediction ability of the model selected. Unlike the leave-one-out procedure widely used in chemometrics for cross-validation (CV), the Monte Carlo cross-validation developed in this paper is an asymptotically consistent method of model selection. It can avoid an unnecessarily large model and therefore decreases the risk of overfitting of the model. The results obtained from a simulation study showed that MCCV has an obviously larger probability than leave-one-out CV (LOO-CV) of selecting the model with best prediction ability and that a corrected MCCV (CMCCV) could give a more accurate estimation of prediction ability than LOO-CV or MCCV. The results obtained with real data sets demonstrated that MCCV could successfully select an appropriate model and that CMCCV could assess the prediction ability of the selected model with satisfactory accuracy.

33645351162	Moving window cross validation: A new cross validation method for the selection of a rational number of components in a partial least squares calibration model	A new cross validation method called moving window cross validation (MWCV) is proposed in this study, as a novel method for selecting the rational number of components for building an efficient calibration model in analytical chemistry. This method works with an innovative pattern to split a validation set by a number of given windows that move synchronously along proper subsets of all the samples. Calculations for the mean value of all mean squares error in cross validations (MSECVs) for all splitting forms are made for different numbers of components, and then the optimal number of components for the model can be selected. Performance of MWCV is compared with that of two cross validation methods, leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV), for partial least squares (PLS) models developed on one simulated data set and two real near-infrared (NIR) spectral data sets. The results reveal that MWCV can avoid a tendency to over-fit the data. Selection of the optimal number of components can be easily made by MWCV because it yields a global minimum in root MSECV at the optimal number of components. Changes in the window size and window number of MWCV do not greatly influence the selection of the number of components. MWCV is demonstrated to be an effective, simple and accurate cross validation method. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.

33646100742	Improvement of partial least squares models for in vitro and in vivo glucose quantifications by using near-infrared spectroscopy and searching combination moving window partial least squares	The aim of this study is to develop optimum partial least squares (PLS) models for glucose quantifications in bovine serum samples and human skin by using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and a chemometrics algorithm named searching combination moving window partial least squares (SCMWPLS). This chemometric method allows one to search for either an optimized spectral region or an optimized combination of the informative spectral regions selected by an early proposed wavelength interval selection method called moving window partial least squares regression (MWPLSR). By using SCMWPLS, we can find the optimum spectral regions for developing efficient PLS models of glucose in the bovine serum samples and the human skin. In the present study, we evaluate the performance of SCMWPLS with the two different NIR data sets, the in vitro NIR spectra of bovine serum samples and the in vivo NIR spectra of human skin. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33646102895	Ascertainment of the number of samples in the validation set in Monte Carlo cross validation and the selection of model dimension with Monte Carlo cross validation	Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV) is used in two data sets including 125 and 1643 near-infrared (NIR) spectra of biological samples, respectively, to ascertain the number of samples left out for validation in MCCV and the dimension of PLS models consequently. With the selected number of samples in validation set, the suitable number of latent variables (LV) may be chosen correctly. The results obtained show that root mean squared error of calibration (RMSEC), root mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) and LV number are sensitive to the number of samples left out for validation when too many samples are left out. Based on this, RMSEC and RMSECV are suggested as criteria to assist the ascertainment of the number of samples left out for validation in MCCV. This method is easy and convenient to use. For a larger data set, more samples may be left out, but the suitable number of samples left out will decrease if the measurement error level is high. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From the viewpoint of the path length and the peak height of spectra in the NIR region, vials with 1 mL volume (external diameter: 8 mm, inside diameter: about 6 mm, length: 40 mm) were selected as disposable vials for the samples. To investigate the causes of the variations in the predicted values, the optical path lengths and transmittance spectra of empty vials in five lots produced during the last four years were examined.

Weak anion exchange (WAX); LC was used as the first dimension separation mode and reversed-phase (RP) LC as the second dimension. Two 35 mm long columns (column 1 and column 2) were used as trap columns to retain the fraction from the first dimension) and forward-flushing was employed to pre-separate the components when the trap column was connected to the second dimension. The interface greatly increases the efficiency of the second dimension column without losing the separation speed. Rat serum sample was separated on this system to evaluate the performance of the constructed system. The viscous fingering (VF) phenomenon was generated attribute to the difference in the velocities of the mobile phases of the two dimensions. The separation efficiency was theoretically increased by 70% when the 35 mm trap columns were used in the forward-flush mode.

The method mainly includes 3 steps: (1) ICA decomposition for the mass spectra; (2) selection of discriminatory independent components (ICs) using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test; and (3) selection of special peaks (m/z locations) as potential biomarkers by executing of ULDA on a mass spectra data set which was reconstructed with the m/z locations that collected from the selected discriminatory ICs. A colorectal cancer data set and an ovarian cancer data set were analyzed with the proposed method. As results, 9 and 10. m/z locations were selected as potential biomarkers for the colorectal and ovarian cancer data set respectively. The classification results of ULDA using the selected potential biomarkers yielded better results than fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) and principal component analysis (PCA), and could distinguish the disease samples from healthy controls on the independent test sets with 100% of sensitivities and specificities for the colorectal cancer dataset and 100% of sensitivity and 96.77% of specificity for the ovarian cancer dataset. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84908226601	Determination of trace analytes based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopic techniques: Development of a multichannel membrane filtration-enrichment device to improve repeatability	The determination of trace analytes based on membrane filtration-enrichment and diffuse reflectance spectroscopic techniques has gained increasing interest in the past decade due to its simplicity, rapidity and high sensitivity. However, poor repeatability primarily attributed to the differences of characteristics between membrane filters limits the development of this technique. In the current study, a simple and effective multichannel device is specially designed for the membrane filtration-enrichment process. The device is able to enrich six samples simultaneously on different positions of a membrane filter and allows the spectroscopic measurement of six samples with only one membrane filter. The proposed approach avoided the effects caused by the nonuniform membrane filters on the performance of the enrichment process. Accuracy and repeatability have been improved significantly for the subsequent on-line spectroscopic detection. A case study was carried out to assess this method utilizing the carcinogenic dye rhodamine B (RhB) as a model analyte. Under the optimal conditions, linearity of the calibration curve based on the Kubelka-Munk function was achieved in the concentration range of 2-30 μg L

The application of the changeable size moving window principal component analysis (CSMWPCA) provided a notably improved classification model, with correct classification rates of 92.00%, 100.00%, 90.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00% and 100.00% for Fujian, Guangxi, Hunan, Baishe, Baofeng, Qiawan, Sanxi samples, respectively, as well as, a total classification rate of 97.52% in the wavelength range from 1007 to 1296 nm. To test and apply the proposed method, the procedure was applied to the analysis of 59 samples in an independent test set. Good identification results (correct rate of 96.61%) were also received. The improvement achieved by the application of CSMWPCA method was particularly remarkable when taking the low complexities of the final model (290 variables) into account.

Different from other GA based techniques, improvements have been made in GAVS, including fitness function and the strategy of elite warehouse. In the case of modeling the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) penetration, GAVS performed very well in variable selection. The training set consists of 151 structurally diverse compounds 154 molecular descriptors of which were calculated by E-Dragon. The best model generated by GAVS contained six descriptors with r=0.848, q=0.817, F=61.40. The model was further validated by two external test sets, with the predicted correlation coefficient of 0.837 for Test set I which contained 28 compounds and correct rate of 82.42% for Test set II which included 91 drugs or drug-like compounds with known BBB indication. To the CNS library containing 1283 CNS activities, the model performed with a success rate of 97.3% in predicting CNS active compounds. In comparison with other methods, GAVS performed best among Genetic Function Approximate (GFA) method and other published models.

5644298759	Removal of interference signals due to water from in vivo near-infrared (NIR) spectra of blood glucose by region orthogonal signal correction (ROSC)	A novel chemometric method, region orthogonal signal correction (ROSC), is proposed and applied to pretreat near-infrared (NIR) spectra of blood glucose measured in vivo. Water is the most serious interference component in such kinds of noninvasive measurements, because it shows very high absorbance in the spectra. In the present study, the spectra of blood glucose in the range of 1212- 1889 nm are used, in which the absorption of water around 1440 nm is very high. ROSC aims at removing the interference signal due to water from the spectra by selecting a set of spectra with a special region of 1404 - 1454 nm that mainly contain information about the variation of the interference component, water, and calculating the orthogonal components to the concentrations of glucose that will be removed. The difference between ROSC and orthogonal signal correction (OSC) is that ROSC uses a special region of spectra for the estimation of scores and loading weights of orthogonal components to pretreat the spectra in other regions, while OSC only uses one fixed region of spectra to calculate loadings, scores and weights of OSC components and removes the OSC components in the same region. A clear advantage of ROSC is that it is more interpretable than OSC, because one can select a spectral region to remove the variation of a special component such as water. Another chemometric method, moving window partial least squares (MWPLSR), is also used to select informative regions of glucose from the NIR spectra of blood glucose measured in vivo, leading to improved PLS models. Results of the application of ROSC demonstrate that ROSC-pretreated spectra including the whole spectral region of 1212- 1889 nm or an informative region of 1600- 1730 nm selected by MWPLSR provide very good performance of the PLS models. Especially, the later region yields a model with RMSECV of 15.8911 mg/dL for four PLS components. ROSC is a potential chemometric technique in the pretreatment of various spectra.

Firstly, a moving window partial least squares regression (MWPLSR) method was employed to locate the region due to water as a region of interference signals and to find the informative regions of glucose, albumin, cholesterol and triglyceride from NIR spectra of bovine serum samples. Next, a novel chemometrics method named searching combination moving window partial least squares (SCMWPLS) was used to optimize those informative regions. Then, the specific regions that contained the information of water, glucose, albumin, cholesterol and triglyceride were obtained. When an interested component in the bovine serum solution, such as glucose, albumin, cholesterol or triglyceride is being an analyte, the other three interests and water are considered as the interference factors. Thus, new approach for ROSC has employed for each specific region of interference signal to calculate the orthogonal components to the concentrations of analyte that were removed specifically from the NIR spectra of bovine serum in the region of 1280-1849 nm and the highest interference signal for model of analyte will be revealed. The comparison of PLS results for glucose, albumin, cholesterol and triglyceride built by using the whole region of original spectra and those developed by using the optimized regions suggested by SCMWPLS of original spectra, spectra treated OSC for orthogonal components of 1-3 and spectra treated ROSC using selected removing the highest interference signals from the spectra for orthogonal components of 1-3 are reported. It has been found that new approach of ROSC to remove the highest interference signal located by SCMWPLS improves of the performance of PLS modeling, yielding the lower RMSECV and smaller number of PLS factors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

84862791623	Stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (SCARS) and its applications to multivariate calibration of NIR spectra	A new variable selection method called stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (SCARS) is proposed based on competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS). In SCARS, variable is selected by an index of stability that is defined as the absolute value of regression coefficient divided by its standard deviation. SCARS algorithm consists of a number of loops. In each loop, the stability of each variable is computed. Then based on stability, enforced wavelength selection and adaptive reweighted sampling (ARS) is used to select important variables. The selected variables are kept as a variable subset and further used in the next loop. After running the loops, a number of subsets of variables are obtained and root mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) of PLS models established with subsets of variables is computed. The subset of variables with the lowest RMSECV is considered as the optimal variable subset. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by three near-infrared (NIR) datasets: tobacco, corn and glucose datasets. The results show that SCARS can select the least variables and supply the least RMSECV and latent variable number of the PLS model comparing with methods of Moving Window PLS (MWPLS), MCUVE and CARS. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

0036756922	Orthogonalization of block variables by subspace-projection for quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) research	A subspace-projection method is developed to construct orthogonal block variable, which is originally from some kinds of series of topological indices or quantum chemical parameters. With the help of canonical correlation analysis, the orthogonal block variables were used to establish the structure-retention index correlation model. The regression of only few new orthogonal variables obtained by canonical correlation analysis against retention index shows significant improvement both in fitting and prediction ability of the correlation model. Moreover, the quantitative intercorrelation between the different block variables of topological indices can also be evaluated with the help of the subspace-projection technique proposed in this work.

0037246748	Chemical rank estimation by noise perturbation in functional principal component analysis	Some kinds of chemical data are not only univariate or multivariate observations of classical statistics, but also functions observed continuously. Such special characters of the data, if being handled efficiently, will certainly improve the predictive accuracy. In this paper, a novel method, named noise perturbation in functional principal component analysis (NPFPCA), was proposed to determine the chemical rank of two-way data. In NPFPCA, after noise addition to the measured data, the smooth eigenvectors can be obtained by functional principal component analysis (FPCA). The eigenvectors representing noise are sensitive to the perturbation, on the other hand, those representing chemical components are not. Therefore, by comparing the difference of eigenvectors obtained by FPCA with noise perturbation and by traditional principal component analysis (PCA), the chemical rank of the system can be achieved accurately. Several simulated and real chemical data sets were analyzed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

84879226841	Improvement of near infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) analysis of caffeine in roasted arabica coffee by variable selection method of stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (SCARS)	Coffee is the most heavily consumed beverage in the world after water, for which quality is a key consideration in commercial trade. Therefore, caffeine content which has a significant effect on the final quality of the coffee products requires to be determined fast and reliably by new analytical techniques. The main purpose of this work was to establish a powerful and practical analytical method based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and chemometrics for quantitative determination of caffeine content in roasted Arabica coffees. Ground coffee samples within a wide range of roasted levels were analyzed by NIR, meanwhile, in which the caffeine contents were quantitative determined by the most commonly used HPLC-UV method as the reference values. Then calibration models based on chemometric analyses of the NIR spectral data and reference concentrations of coffee samples were developed. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to construct the models. Furthermore, diverse spectra pretreatment and variable selection techniques were applied in order to obtain robust and reliable reduced-spectrum regression models. Comparing the respective quality of the different models constructed, the application of second derivative pretreatment and stability competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (SCARS) variable selection provided a notably improved regression model, with root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 0.375 mg/g and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.918 at PLS factor of 7. An independent test set was used to assess the model, with the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.378 mg/g, mean relative error of 1.976% and mean relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.707%. Thus, the results provided by the high-quality calibration model revealed the feasibility of NIR spectroscopy for at-line application to predict the caffeine content of unknown roasted coffee samples, thanks to the short analysis time of a few seconds and non-destructive advantages of NIRS. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

No unique matrix was found to satisfy all three guanidines because of the extra C-O bonds in PEEG. Sinapic acid (SA), α-Cyano-4- hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) seemed to be ideal for PHMG and PHMB, but 2-(4-Hydroxybenzeneazo)benzoic acid (HABA), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) were for PEEG.

Prefractionation of crude oil into discrete chemical classes was performed by adsorption column chromatography using small quantities of neutral aluminum oxide and silicic acid. Subsequent high-resolution separation of individual components was achieved by using capillary column gas chromatography, and compound types were detected by mass spectrometer. In conjunction with a combined chemometric method, each principal chemical class was further resolved and separated, which made it possible to identify some nitrogen compounds in the investigated oils. To a certain extent, this method could relieve classical analysis of difficulty in identifying those species with poorly low contents or partially chromatographic overlaps, particularly in the cases where authentic standards were not available for addition into the unknown analytical systems to reveal what indeed existed in them. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Because the concentration of DMF in milk is very small, an enrichment method called fluidized bed enrichment was used to concentrate the analyte before NIR measurement. For correcting spectra between different brands and measurement dates, the spectra of Bright dairy measured on 2/5/2011 were assigned as primary spectra. And the spectra of Yili dairy measured on 2/5/2011 and Bright dairy measured on 17/5/2011 were set as secondary spectra for changes in brand and measurement date, respectively. Two spectral pretreatment methods were applied to preprocess spectra: multiple scattering correction (MSC) and the combination of MSC and differentiation (Savitzky-Golay differentiation). After spectral pretreatment, two calibration transfer methods including canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and piecewise direct standardization were used to correct the secondary spectra. The results showed that although the variations in both brand and measurement date can cause secondary spectra to deviate from primary spectra, the CCA under the combination of MSC and differentiation can correct the secondary spectra to use the model of primary spectra with high accuracy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Here the material is served as not only an enrichment medium but also an enhancement substrate base of the SERS detection. Sample solution is flowed through the material under a vacuum for an enrichment of the analytes and then the concentrated analytes on the material are detected with the Raman spectroscopy. With this method, SERS spectra of phosmet and disulfoton could be identified at concentrations of 5μg/L and 1μg/L, respectively. The quantitative curves show linear relationship between Raman intensities and the concentrations of analytes. Furthermore, in real samples detection, phosmet at 8.25μg/kg and disulfoton at 39.7μg/kg spiked on oranges can be detected by SERS. Based on the synthesized material and its application in SPE-SERS operation, the method represents ultrasensitive SERS performance in real samples detection with a simple and rapid pre-treatment, which indicates that it could be served as a useful means in monitoring pesticide residues. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

11144233619	Multicomponent spectral correlative chromatography applied to complex herbal medicines	In this study, a novel chemometric algorithm is presented to facilitate the comparison of relevant chemical components from different herbal samples. This so-called multicomponent spectral correlative chromatography (MSCC) is developed to detect and decide whether two chromatographic clusters are correlated spectrally with each other. The target chromatographic cluster is first partitioned from one herbal spectrochromatogram obtained by hyphenated chromatography. Then, a projection operator is constructed with the principal spectral features extracted from the target to judge the presence or absence of a spectral correlative chromatographic cluster within another herbal spectrochromatogram. For this judgment, congruence coefficient between the original spectral vector and its projected residual is proposed to eliminate the influences from background and noises, especially heteroscedastic noises in the original data. The performance of the MSCC algorithm is demonstrated on both simulated data and real data, and its advantages and disadvantages are also discussed in some detail.
