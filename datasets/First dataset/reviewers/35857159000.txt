84940384649	A integrated inventory model with imperfect production and inspection under trade credit financing	In this paper we develop an integrated inventory model with imperfect production and inspection process under two-level trade credit strategy. We assume both manufacturer and retailer adopt the marketing strategy of transactions on credit. Consumers' demand is affected by the length of credit period provided by retailer. The impact of imperfect production quality and inspection errors is incorporated in this paper. Mathematical models have been derived for obtaining the optimal solution so that the annual total profit is maximized. A numerical example is given to illustrate the results developed in this paper.

84941954239	Impact of defective items on (Q,r,L) inventory model involving controllable setup cost	In a recent paper, Ouyang et al. [10] proposed a (Q,r,L) inventory model with defective items in an arrival lot. The purpose of this study is to generalize Ouyang et al.'s [10] model by allowing setup cost (A) as a decision variable in conjunction with order quantity (Q), reorder point (r) and lead time (L). In this study, we first assume that the lead time demand follows a normal distribution, and then relax this assumption by only assuming that the first two moments of the lead time demand are given. For each case, an algorithm procedure of finding the optimal solution is developed.

9544239255	An inventory model for deteriorating items with stock-dependent demand under the conditions of inflation and time-value of money	In this paper, we incorporate the effects of inflation and time-value of money in inventory decision making when demand, at each time moment rather than being constant, is considered to be dependent upon current stock level. In addition, the shortages are neither completely backlogged nor completely lost assuming the backlogging rate to be linearly dependent on the amount of demand backlogged. We shall be concerned with finding the optimal number of replenishments and service rate to minimize the total relevant costs over a finite planning horizon. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed models.

9544241347	Integrated vendor-buyer cooperative models with stochastic demand in controllable lead time	This article presents the single-vendor single-buyer integrated production inventory models. We relax the assumption that lead time demand, X, is deterministic and assume that it is stochastic. Also, we assume that shortage during the lead time is permitted, and lead time can be reduced at an added cost. Two models are considered here. In the first model, the demand of lead time follows a normal distribution, and in the second model, it is distribution-free. For both cases, we develop effective iterative procedures for finding the optimal policy and numerical examples are used to illustrate the benefits of integration. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

16244398877	Retailer's optimal pricing and lot-sizing policies for deteriorating items with partial backlogging	Pricing is a major strategy for a retailer to obtain its maximum profit. Therefore, in this paper, we establish an economic order quantity model for a retailer to determine its optimal selling price, replenishment number and replenishment schedule with partial backlogging. We first prove that the optimal replenishment schedule not only exists but also is unique, for any given selling price. Next, we show that the total profit is a concave function of p when the replenishment number and schedule are given. We then provide a simple algorithm to find the optimal selling price, replenishment number and replenishment timing for the proposed model. Finally, we use a couple of numerical examples to illustrate the algorithm. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1642335463	Models for a fuzzy inventory of two replaceable merchandises without backorder based on the signed distance of fuzzy sets	This paper investigates the inventory problems for two mutually complementary merchandises. We first consider the merchandises in a monopoly market, and then in a perfect competitive market. With the fuzzy sets concept, we discuss how to determine the optimal ordering policy for the aforementioned inventory problem such that the total related cost is minimum. Three results are obtained and the numerical examples are provided to illustrate these results. In contrast with the previous studies that employed the extension principle and centroid method to derive the estimate of the total cost in the fuzzy sense, we show that using the decomposition principle and the signed distance can attain it easier. © 2002 Elsevier B.V.

14744280313	An EOQ model for deteriorating items with power-form stock-dependent demand	Datta and Pal established an EOQ model in which the demand rate is a power function of the on-hand inventory until down to a certain stock level, at which the demand rate becomes a constant. In this paper, we extend their EOQ model to allow for not only deteriorating items but also non-zero ending inventory. Due to the complexity of the demand function, the inventory problem here has three possible cases. We then establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for each case. Moreover, we propose an algorithm to determine the optimal replenishment cycle time and ordering quantity such that the total profit per unit time is maximized. Finally, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the proposed algorithm, and obtain the effects of the parameters on the replenishment time and ordering quantity.

18944385926	An EOQ model for deteriorating items under trade credits	In the classical inventory economic order quantity (or EOQ) model, it was assumed that the supplier is paid for the items immediately after the items are received. However, in practices, the supplier may simultaneously offer the customer: (1) a permissible delay in payments to attract new customers and increase sales, and (2) a cash discount to motivate faster payment and reduce credit expenses. In this paper, we provide the optimal policy for the customer to obtain its minimum cost when the supplier offers not only a permissible delay but also a cash discount. We first establish a proper model, and then characterize the optimal solution and provide an easy-to-use algorithm to find the optimal order quantity and replenishment time. Furthermore, we also compare the optimal order quantity under supplier credits to the classical economic order quantity. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.

0031232606	Mixture inventory model involving variable lead time with a service level constraint	In this article, both lead time and the order quantity are considered as the decision variables of a mixture inventory model. Instead of having a stockout term in the objective function, a service level constraint, which implies that the stockout level per cycle is bounded, is added to the model. In our studies, we first assume that the lead time demand follows a normal distribution, and then we relax the assumption about the form of the distribution function of lead time demand and apply the minimax distribution free procedure to solve the problem. We develop an algorithm procedure, respectively, to find the optimal order quantity and optimal lead time. Further, the effects of parameters are also included. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

24144438260	Deterministic economic production quantity models with time-varying demand and cost	In today's time-based competition, the unit cost of a high-tech product declines significantly over its short product life cycle. Consequently, in this paper, we relax the traditional economic production quantity model to allow for time-varying cost. We then prove that the optimal production schedule uniquely exists. In addition, we also show that the total cost is a convex function of the number of replenishments, which reduces the search for the optimal solution to finding a local minimum. Furthermore, we characterize the influences of both demand and cost over the length of production run time and the economic production quantity. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We first fuzzify the random lead-time demand to be a fuzzy random variable and obtain the total cost in the fuzzy sense. Then, we further fuzzify the total demand to be the triangular fuzzy number and derive the fuzzy total cost. By the centroid method of defuzzification, we derive the estimate of total cost in the fuzzy sense. Also, we find the optimal solution for order quantity and lead time in the fuzzy sense such that the total cost has a minimum value.

We consider that buyer lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost which depends on the lead time length to be reduced and the ordering lot size. Additionally, buyer ordering cost can be reduced through further investment. Two models are presented in this study. The first model assumes that the ordering cost reduction has no relation to lead time crashing. The second model assumes that the lead time and ordering cost reduction are interacted. An iterative procedure is developed to find the optimal solution and numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results of the proposed models. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

26444594875	Optimal inventory policy with noninstantaneous receipt under trade credit	In the last two decades, the models for inventory replenishment policies under trade credit have been widely studied by several researchers. However, the extant papers only consider the effects of permissible delay in payments in the inventory systems. In some situations, the supplier also may offer a cash discount to encourage retailer to pay for his purchases quickly. On the other hand, an inventory model with instantaneous receipt is not a common feature in actual practice. For generality, this study develops an inventory model with noninstantaneous receipt under trade credit, in which the supplier provides not only a permissible delay but also a cash discount to the retailer. We then characterize the optimal solution and provide an easy-to-use criterion to find the optimal order strategies. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

28844455123	The variable lead time stochastic inventory model with a fuzzy backorder rate	Cost and operation of inventory depends a great deal on what happens to demand when the system is out of stock. In real inventory systems, it is more reasonable to assume that part of the excess demand is backordered and the rest is lost. However, the amount of backorders (or lost sales) often incurs disturbance due to various uncertainties. To incorporate this reality, this article attempts to apply the fuzzy set concepts to deal with the uncertain backorders and lost sales. The purpose of this paper is to modify Moon and Choi's continuous review inventory model with variable lead time and partial backorders by fuzzifying the backorder rate (or equivalently, fuzzifying the lost sales rate). We first consider the case where the lost sales rate is treated as the triangular fuzzy number. Then, through the statistical method for establishing the interval estimation of the lost sales rate, we construct a new fuzzy number, namely statistic-fuzzy number. For each fuzzy case, we investigate a computing schema for the modified continuous review inventory model and develop an algorithm to find the optimal inventory strategy.

By analyzing total channel profit function, we developed an algorithm to simultaneously determine the buyer's optimal retail price, order quantity and the number of shipments per production run from the vendor to the buyer. The results of our analysis demonstrate that in an integrated vendor-buyer inventory model, the trade credit strategy can be a win-win business strategy for both the buyer and the vendor. Our study also identifies the total channel profit will increase while the vendor's production rate is close to the market demand rate.

27744566253	Periodic review inventory models with controllable lead time and lost sales rate reduction	The purpose of this study is to investigate two stochastic periodic review inventory models affected by the lead time and lost sales rate. In our models, we consider that the lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost, which depends on the length of lead time. Moreover, we assume that the lost sales rate can also be reduced by capital investment. The objective of our study is to simultaneously optimize the review period, the lost sales rate and the lead time. We first assume that the protection interval (i.e., review period plus lead time) demand follows a normal distribution. Then, the assumption is relaxed to consider a distribution-free case where only the mean and standard deviation of protected interval demand are known. For each case, an algorithm is developed to find the optimal investment strategy. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.

For both these models with a mixture of backorders and lost sales, we first assume that the lead time (L)/protection interval (T + L) demand follows a normal distribution, and then relax this assumption by only assuming that the mean and variance are known. For each case, we develop a procedure to find the optimal solution, and then an illustrative numerical example is given.

33746238732	Analysis of optimal vendor-buyer integrated inventory policy involving defective items	The concept of integrated inventory management has recently attracted a great deal of attention, but few studies have tackled the possible relationship between order lot and quality. As a result of weak process control, deficient planned maintenance, inadequate work instructions and/or damage in transit, an arriving order lot often includes defective items. In general, the defective rate may be certain or uncertain for various causes. This study examines three integrated vendor-buyer inventory models involving defective items. First, a crisp defective rate case is considered. Then, a triangular fuzzy number is used to represent an uncertain defective rate. Finally, statistics and fuzzy techniques are combined to formulate an uncertain defective rate. An iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal strategy for each model. Furthermore, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the results of the proposed models.

33751160850	A study on an inventory model for non-instantaneous deteriorating items with permissible delay in payments	In this study, an appropriate inventory model for non-instantaneous deteriorating items with permissible delay in payments is considered. The purpose of this study is to find an optimal replenishment policy for minimizing the total relevant inventory cost. This mathematical model is a general framework that comprises numerous previous models such as in Ghare and Schrader [Ghare, P. M., & Schrader, G. H. (1963). A model for exponentially decaying inventory system. International Journal of Production Research, 21, 449-460], Goyal [Goyal, S. K. (1985).

We have developed some useful theorems to characterize the optimal solutions and provide an easy-to-use method to find the optimal replenishment cycle time and order quantity under various circumstances. Several numerical examples are given to test and verify the theoretical results. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to major parameters is also included.

We then prove that the estimate of total variable cost per unit time in the fuzzy sense is a strictly pseudo-convex function. As a result, there exists a unique optimal solution to our proposed model. Moreover, we apply the Jamal et al. example to show the results and to compare with the Jamal et al. model. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition, we allow for shortages in the owned warehouse and assume that the backlogging demand rate is dependent on the duration of the stockout. We obtain the condition when to rent the warehouse and provide simple solution procedures for finding the maximum total profit per unit time.

33750985387	A comparison between two pricing and lot-sizing models with partial backlogging and deteriorated items	Recently, Abad [2003. Optimal pricing and lot-sizing under conditions of perishability, finite production and partial backordering and lost sale, European Journal of Operational Research, 144, 677-685] studied the pricing and lot-sizing problem for a perishable good under finite production, exponential decay, partial backordering and lost sale. In this article, we extend his model by adding not only the backlogging cost but also the cost of lost goodwill. We then analytically compare the net profits per unit time between Abad's (2003) model and Goyal and Giri's [2003. The production-inventory problem of a product with time varying demand, production and deterioration rates. European Journal of Operational Research, 147, 549-557] model. In Abad's model, the cycle starts with an instant production to accumulate stocks, then stops production to use up stocks, and finally restarts production to meet the unsatisfied demands. By contrast, in Goyal and Giri's model, the cycle begins with a period of shortages, then starts production until accumulated inventory reaches certain level, and finally stops production and uses up inventory. Our theoretical results show that there is no dominant one between these two models. Furthermore, we provide certain conditions under which one model has more net profit per unit time than the other. Finally, we give several numerical examples to illustrate the results. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition, we allow for shortages and completely backlogged. The objective is to find the optimal inventory and pricing strategies maximizing the net present value of total profit over the infinite horizon. For any given selling price, we first prove that the optimal replenishment schedule not only exists but is unique. Next, we show that the total profit per unit time is a concave function of price when the replenishment schedule is given. We then provide a simple algorithm to find the optimal selling price and replenishment schedule for the proposed model.

The demand and deterioration rates are continuous and differentiable function of price and time, respectively. In addition, we allow for shortages and the unsatisfied demand is partially backlogged at a negative exponential rate with the waiting time. Under these assumptions, for any given selling price, we first develop the criterion for the optimal solution for the replenishment schedule, and prove that the optimal replenishment policy not only exists but also is unique. If the criterion is not satisfied, the inventory system should not be operated. Next, we show that the total profit per unit time is a concave function of price when the replenishment schedule is given. We then provide a simple algorithm to find the optimal selling price and replenishment schedule for the proposed model.

34250886305	Integrated vendor - buyer inventory system with sublot sampling inspection policy and controllable lead time	This article investigates the impact of inspection policy and lead time reduction on an integrated vendor - buyer inventory system. We assume that an arriving order contains some defective items. The buyer adopts a sublot sampled inspection policy to inspect selected items. The number of defective items in the sublot sampling is a random variable. The buyer's lead time is assumed reducible by adding crash cost. Two integrated inventory models with backorders and lost sales are derived. We first assume that the lead time demand follows a normal distribution, and then relax the assumption about the lead time demand distribution function and apply the minimax distribution-free procedure to solve the problem. Consequently, the order quantity, reorder point, lead time and the number of shipments per lot from the vendor to the buyer are decision variables. Iterative procedures are developed to obtain the optimal strategy.

34547229624	Effective investment to reduce lost-sales rate in a periodic review inventory model	In 1973 Montgomery et al. proposed an (R, T) type of a periodic review inventory model in which the lost-sales rate caused by stockout is given. The purpose of this article is to investigate in this heuristic periodic review inventory model with partial lost-sales to effectively increase investment and to reduce the lost-sales rate. We discuss two models: complete (normal distribution) and partial (distribution free) information about the protection interval (i.e., review period plus lead time) demand distribution. For each model, two commonly used investment cost functional forms, logarithmic and power, are employed for lost-sales rate reduction. That is, for these two investment cost functions, we first assume that the protection interval demand follows a normal distribution, and then we assume that only first and second moments of the probability distribution of protected interval demand are known. Two algorithms are developed to find the optimal investment decision, and six numerical examples are given to illustrate the results. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

34748881254	An EOQ model with limited storage capacity under trade credits	In the classical economic order quantity (EOQ) inventory model, it was assumed that the retailer must pay for the received items immediately. However, in practice, the supplier not only allows retailer to settle the account after a certain fixed period but also may offer a cash discount to encourage the retailer to pay for his purchases as soon as possible. On the other hand, it is common practice in most inventory systems to hold excess stocks in a rented warehouse whenever the storage capacity of the owned warehouse is insufficient. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish an EOQ model with limited storage capacity, in which the supplier provides cash discount and permissible delay in payments for the retailer. In the model, we develop some useful theorems to characterize the optimal solution and provide a simple method to find the optimal replenishment cycle time and payment time. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results and some managerial insights are also obtained. © World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.

By analyzing the total channel profit function, we develop an algorithm to simultaneously determine the retailer's optimal order quantity and the number of shipment per production run from the supplier to the retailer. Our results demonstrate that the trade credit strategy is effective to supply chain system performance when customers are sensitive to the credit period length offered by the retailer. Moreover, when customers are sensitive to the credit period, if the retailer conveys partial advantage gained from the trade credit offered by the supplier to customers by suitably adjusting the customer's credit period then the entire system and every channel partner can benefit. © World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.

In the model, shortages are allowed and the backlogging rate is variable and dependent on the waiting time for the next replenishment. The necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution are shown.

33144481147	Optimal ordering policy for deteriorating items with partial backlogging under permissible delay in payments	In 1985, Goyal developed an Economic order quantity (EOQ) model under conditions of permissible delay in payments. Jamal et al. then generalized Goyal's model for deteriorating items with completely backlogging. However, they only ran several simulations to indicate that the total relevant cost may be convex. Recently, Teng amended Goyal's model by considering the difference between unit price and unit cost, and provided an alternative conclusion that it makes economic sense for some retailers to order less quantity and take the benefits of the permissible delay more frequently. However, he did not consider deteriorating items and partial backlogging. In this paper, we establish a general EOQ model for deteriorating items when the supplier offers a permissible delay in payments. For generality, our model allows not only the partial backlogging rate to be related to the waiting time but also the unit selling price to be larger than the unit purchase cost. Consequently, the proposed model includes numerous previous models as special cases. In addition, we mathematically prove that the total relevant cost is strictly pseudo-convex so that the optimal solution exists and is unique. Finally, our computational results reveal six managerial phenomena. © Springer 2006.

Instead of having a stock-out term in the objective function, a service level constraint is added to the model. In our paper, we first assume that the protection interval (i.e. the review period plus the lead time) demand follow s a normal distribution, and then we relax this assumption and only assume that the first two moments of the protection interval demand are given. For each case, we develop an algorithm to find the optimal review period and optimal lead time. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is also performed.

84897108047	Using a QCAC-Entropy-TOPSIS approach to measure quality characteristics and rank improvement priorities for all substandard quality characteristics	A key issue faced within the manufacturing industry is determining how to measure quality characteristics and prioritise improvements to be made to all substandard quality characteristics of a product with respect to resource requirements and performance improvement potential. This study proposes a QCAC-Entropy-TOPSIS approach in order to address this issue. It combines the Quality Characteristic Analysis Chart (QCAC), entropy method and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The proposed method is not only helpful to measure and determine whether the quality characteristics meet 6σ, 5σ, 4σ or 3σ but also to rank improvements in all substandard quality characteristics of a product in light of resource requirements and potential for performance improvements simultaneously, making it suitable to all manufacturing industries. Moreover, it also can be a powerful tool for analysing the problems that lead to substandard quality characteristics due to poor accuracy and/or precision. Firstly, using the QCAC, the substandard quality characteristics of the product can be determined and the corresponding values of the Discrimination Distance (DD) can then be computed. Subsequently, all the substandard quality characteristics can be regarded as alternatives when conducting entropy and TOPSIS analyses. Secondly, the weights of the evaluation criteria can be calculated by using the entropy method. Lastly, the weights of the evaluation criteria and the values of DD can be substituted into the TOPSIS method. The manufacturer can then categorically prioritise improvement options for all substandard quality characteristics with respect to resource requirements, and consider potential for performance improvements simultaneously. An example is provided for a bicycle quick release manufacturer to illustrate in detail the calculation process of the developed approach. Finally, the advantages of the proposed method are also given through comparisons with Process Capability Analysis Chart and TOPSIS methods. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

84898747947	An integrated inventory model with order-size-dependent trade credit and quality improvement	Chang et al. [1] proposed an integrated inventory model with an order-size-dependent trade credit. However, quality issues were not discussed in their model. It is unrealistic for a production system to produce 100 percent good products. The number of defective items in a lot will influence the buyer's on-hand inventory level, service level, and frequency of orders. Therefore, this paper extends Chang et al.'s [1] model with defective items. Moreover, we consider the capital investment in quality improvement. The objective of our analysis is to determine the optimal ordering, shipping, and quality improvement policies to maximize joint total profit per unit time. An iterative algorithm is established to obtain the optimal solution. © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

43149098985	Determining optimal lot size for a two-warehouse system with deterioration and shortages using net present value	In this paper, we develop a deterministic inventory model for deteriorating items with two warehouses by minimizing the net present value of the total cost. Deterioration rates of items in the two warehouses may be different. In addition, we allow for shortages and complete backlogging. We then prove that the optimal replenishment policy not only exists but also is unique under some condition. Further, the result reveals that the reorder interval based on the average total cost, if it exists, must be longer than that derived using net present value. Finally, we use Yang's [H.L. Yang, European Journal of Operational Research 157 (2004) 344-356] numerical example to illustrate the model and conclude the paper with suggestions for possible future research. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

49249098235	Optimal strategy for an integrated system with variable production rate when the freight rate and trade credit are both linked to the order quantity	This paper presents an integrated inventory model with variable production rate and price-sensitive demand rate. The buyer's purchases trade credit linked to the order quantity offered by the supplier. In addition, the buyer pays the freight charge according to a weight schedule. This paper attempts to offer a best policy that aims at maximizing the joint total profit while the trade credit and freight rate are simultaneously linked to the order quantity. The same policy also incorporates considerations on the optimal retail price, order quantity and delivery decision. We provide possible solutions for the buyer and the supplier to collaboratively agree on inventory control, warehouse management, transportation logistics, delivery and billing. Our study demonstrates that significant profit increase for the entire supply chain can be achieved by linking both trade credit policy and freight rate policy to order quantities. An algorithm is furnished to determine the optimal solution. In addition, numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In Payment Method 1, we assume that the retailer pays off the amount owed to the supplier whenever he/she has money obtained from sales. In Payment Method 2, the retailer keeps his/her profits for developing new products or other investment use. We then provide easy-to-use algorithms to find the optimal order receipt period and the optimal cycle time. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed model.

In this paper, we generalize [Goyal, S.K., 1985. EOQ under conditions of permissible delay in payments. Journal of the Operational Research Society 36, 335-338] economic order quantity (EOQ) model with permissible delay in payment to reflect the following real-world situations: (1) the retailer's selling price per unit is significantly higher than unit purchase price, (2) the interest rate charged by a bank is not necessarily higher than the retailer's investment return rate, (3) many items such as fruits and vegetables deteriorate continuously, and (4) the supplier may offer a partial permissible delay in payments even if the order quantity is less than W. We then establish the proper mathematical model, and derive several theoretical results to determine the optimal solution under various situations and use two approaches to solve this complex inventory problem.

61649121894	The optimal pricing and ordering policy for an integrated inventory model when trade credit linked to order quantity	In traditional inventory models, it is implicitly assumed that the buyer must pay for the purchased items as soon as they have been received. However, in many practical situations, the vendor is willing to provide the buyer with a permissible delay period when the buyer's order quantity exceeds a given threshold. Therefore, to incorporate the concept of vendor-buyer integration and order-size-dependent trade credit, we present a stylized model to determine the optimal strategy for an integrated vendor-buyer inventory system under the condition of trade credit linked to the order quantity, where the demand rate is considered to be a decreasing function of the retail price. By analyzing the total channel profit function, we developed some useful results to characterize the optimal solution and provide an iterative algorithm to find the retail price, buyer's order quantity, and the numbers of shipment per production run from the vendor to the buyer. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the theoretical results, and some managerial insights are also obtained. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Therefore, it is important to discuss the single-supplier and single-buyer supply chain problem which includes order-size dependent trade credit. In this study, an integrated inventory model with a price sensitive demand rate, determining jointly economic lot size of the buyer's ordering and the supplier's production batch, are developed to maximize the total profit per unit time.

In our studies, we first assume that the lead time demand follows a normal distribution, and then relax the assumption about the form of the distribution function of the lead time demand and apply the minimax distribution-free procedure to solve the problem.

We discuss two models that are perfect and partial informat on about the lead time demand distribution, that is, we first assume that the lead time demand follows a normal distribution, and then remove this assumption by only assuming that the first and second moments of the probability distribution of lead time demand are known.

77249169781	A fuzzy inventory system with deteriorating items under supplier credits linked to ordering quantity	The inventory problem associated with trade credit is a popular topic in which interest income and interest payments are important issues. Most studies related to trade credit assume that the interest rate is both fixed and predetermined. However, in the real market, many factors such as financial policy, monetary policy and inflation, may affect the interest rate. Moreover, within the environment of merchandise storage, some distinctive factors arise which ultimately affect the quality of products such as temperature, humidity, and storage equipment. Thus, the rate of interest charges, the rate of interest earned, and the deterioration rate in a real inventory problem may be fuzzy. In this paper, we deal with these three imprecise parameters in inventory modeling by utilizing the fuzzy set theory. We develop the fuzzy inventory model based on Chang et al.'s [1] model by fuzzifying the rate of interest charges, the rate of interest earned, and the deterioration rate into the triangular fuzzy number. Subsequently, we discuss how to determine the optimal ordering policy so that the total relevant inventory cost, in the fuzzy sense, is minimal. Furthermore, we show that Chang et al.'s [1] model (the crisp model) is a special case of our model (the fuzzy model). Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate these results.

As a result, in this paper, we establish an inventory model for the purchaser in which the supplier provides different trade credits. We then solve the inventory problem by using a discounted cash-flow (DCF) approach, characterize the optimal solution, and obtain some theoretical results to find the optimal order quantity and the optimal replenishment time.

78650306273	The optimal ordering policy with trade credit under two different payment methods	Suppliers' offering delay payment terms to retailers can be regarded as a type of price reduction. In today's ever competitive marketplace, offering delay payments has become a commonly adopted method to suppliers. Most of the inventory models with permissible delay in payments assumed that the entire lot size is delivered at the same time. However, in practice, goods ordered are usually arrived overtime in separate batches. In this study, we discuss an inventory problem with a finite replenishment rate under trade credit for two payment methods. We establish a theorem to find the optimal solution for each payment method. Numerical examples are also given to illustrate the solution procedure. Finally, to investigate the effect of changes of some main parameter values on the optimal solution, a sensitivity analysis is performed and some management interpretations are proposed. © 2008 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.

78650564253	A particle swarm optimization for solving joint pricing and lot-sizing problem with fluctuating demand and trade credit financing	Pricing is a major strategy for a retailer to obtain its maximum profit. Furthermore, under most market behaviors, one can easily find that a vendor provides a credit period (for example 30 days) for buyers to stimulate the demand, boost market share or decrease inventories of certain items. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a deterministic economic order quantity model for a retailer to determine its optimal selling price, replenishment number and replenishment schedule with fluctuating demand under two levels of trade credit policy. A particle swarm optimization is coded and used to solve the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem by employing the properties derived in this paper.

79955923569	Optimal order policy for deteriorating items in response to temporary price discount linked to order quantity	This paper investigates the possible effects of a temporary price discount offered by a supplier on a retailer's replenishment policy for deteriorating items, whereby the price discount rate depends on the order quantity. The purpose of this study is to develop a decision process for retailers to assist in determining whether to adopt a regular or special order policy. Furthermore, the optimal quantity of a special order policy for a selected case is determined by maximizing the total cost saving between special and regular orders for the duration of the depletion time. This research establishes an algorithm to determine the optimal solution and utilizes several numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical results and subsequently conducts a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to the main parameters. Finally, the results reveal that (1) the optimal special order quantity is determined by trading off the benefits of the price discount against the additional holding cost, (2) the retailer benefits in terms of total cost saving if the remnant inventory is as low as possible when adopting a special order policy, (3) for the retailer it is preferable to adopt the special order policy if the unit purchase cost, market demand rate and/or ordering cost increase, and (4) the retailer will order a lower quantity and the total cost saving will decrease when either the holding cost rate or deterioration rate is high. Thus, this study provides the basis for enterprises to make inventory decisions.

0036132297	A minimax distribution free procedure for mixed inventory model involving variable lead time with fuzzy demand	In a recent paper, Ouyang and Wu applied the minimax decision approach to solve a continuous review mixed inventory model in which the lead time demand distribution information is unknown but the annual demand is fixed and given. However, in the practical situation, the annual demand probably incurs disturbance due to various uncertainties. In this article, we attempt to modify Ouyang and Wu's model by considering two fuzziness of annual demand (i.e., fuzzy number of annual demand and statistic-fuzzy number of annual demand) and to investigate a computing schema for the continuous review inventory model in the fuzzy sense. We give an algorithm procedure to obtain the optimal ordering strategy for each case. In most of the early literature dealing with inventory problems, either using deterministic or probabilistic models, lead time is viewed as a prescribed constant or a stochastic variable. Recently, some researchers (e.g., Liao and Shyu, Ben-Daya and Raouf, and Ouyang and Wu) incorporated the crashing lead time idea to continuous review inventory models, in which the annual demand is given and fixed. However, in the real situation, the annual demand will probably have a little disturbance due to various uncertainties. The purpose of this article is to modify the Ouyang and Wu's model to accommodate this reality, specifically, we apply the fuzzy set concepts to deal with the uncertain annual demand. We first consider a case where the annual demand is treated as the triangular fuzzy number. Then, we employ the statistical method to construct a confidence interval for the annual demand, and through it to establish the corresponding fuzzy number (namely, the statistic-fuzzy number). For each fuzzy case, we investigate a computing schema for the new model and develop an algorithm to find the optimal ordering strategy. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In an unstable environment, the opportunity cost rate may not be fixed, rather it may slightly change from time to time due to various uncertainties. To capture this reality, this paper extends the EOQ model with investment in quality improvement to include the imprecision of opportunity cost rate, where the triangular fuzzy number is employed to handle the vagueness. We investigate the aforementioned problem and derive the optimal solution for lot size and quality level in the fuzzy sense.

However, in practice, the backorder (or lost sales) rate may change slightly due to some uncertainties. To incorporate this reality, this article attempts to apply the fuzzy set concepts to deal with the uncertain lost sales rate. For a situation where information about the lead time demand distribution is partial, we utilize the minimax distribution free procedure to find the optimal inventory strategy in the fuzzy sense.

Besides, the supplier also can offer cash discount to encourage retailer to pay the account quickly. This study develops an inventory model with credit period and cash discount simultaneously. The objective of this model is to determine the optimal replenishment cycle so that the total cost per unit time is minimized.

84860472806	The retailer's optimal ordering policy with trade credit in different financial environments	In business transactions, it is quite common for the supplier to offer the retailer a permissible delay in payments in order to stimulate the demand of the retailer. The retailer can either pay off all accounts at the end of the credit period or delay incurring interest charges on the unpaid and overdue balance due to the difference between interest earned and interest charged. In this study, we consider different financial environments when the supplier provides a permissible delay in payments. The proper mathematical models are developed to find the optimal order quantity and payoff time for maximizing the retailer's total profit for each financial environment. Furthermore, two theorems are established to determine the optimal solutions. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed model.

84862920174	A search space reduced algorithm for mining frequent patterns	Mining frequent patterns is to discover the groups of items appearing always together excess of a user specified threshold. Many approaches have been proposed for mining frequent patterns by applying the FP-tree structure to improve the efficiency of the FP-Growth algorithm which needs to recursively construct sub-trees. Although these approaches do not need to recursively construct many sub-trees, they also suffer the problem of a large search space, such that the performances for the previous approaches degrade when the database is massive or the threshold for mining frequent patterns is low. In order to reduce the search space and speed up the mining process, we propose an efficient algorithm for mining frequent patterns based on frequent pattern tree. Our algorithm generates a subtree for each frequent item and then generates candidates in batch from this sub-tree. For each candidate generation, our algorithm only generates a small set of candidates, which can significantly reduce the search space. The experimental results also show that our algorithm outperforms the previous approaches.

84863146915	Optimal ordering policy in response to a temporary sale price when retailer's warehouse capacity is limited	In this paper, we investigate the possible effects of a temporary price discount offered by the supplier on the retailer's replenishment policy under the premise that the capacity of the retailer-owned warehouse is limited. The purpose of this study is to develop a decision process for the retailer, which allows he/she to decide whether to adopt a special or regular order policy during a temporary sales period. For the case where a special order policy is selected, the optimal special order quantity by maximising the total cost saving between special and regular orders is determined. The model is developed when the temporary sales period coincides with one of the following: 1 the retailer's replenishment time 2 the retailer's sales period. Furthermore, we present useful results to characterise the optimal solutions. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results, and a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to the main parameters is also conducted.

0036778937	Quality improvement, setup cost and lead-time reductions in lot size reorder point models with an imperfect production process	This paper investigates the lot size, reorder point inventory model involving variable lead time with partial backorders, where the production process is imperfect. The options of investing in process quality improvement and setup cost reduction are included, and lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost. The objective is to simultaneously optimize the lot size, the reorder point, the process quality, the setup cost, and the lead time. We first assume that lead-time demand follows a normal distribution and develop an algorithm to find the optimal solution. Then, we relax the assumption of normality to consider a distribution-free case where only the mean and standard deviation of lead-time demand are known. We apply the minimax distribution-free procedure to solve this problem. Furthermore, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the results. In past two decades, the Japanese successful experience of using just-in-time (JIT) production has received a great deal of attention. The underlying goal of JIT is to eliminate waste, which can be achieved through various efforts, such as shortening lead time, reducing setup cost, and improving quality. In a recent paper, Moon and Choi (Comput. Oper. Res. 25 (1998) 1007) studied the lead time reduction problem on a lot size, reorder point (continuous review (Q,r) inventory model in which the quality issue is ignored and the setup cost is fixed. In this article, we extend Moon and Choi's model to include the possible relationship between quality and lot size. We also investigate the joint effects of quality improvement and setup cost reduction in which the lot size, reorder point, process quality, setup cost, and lead time are decision variables. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We consider that the lead time can be shortened at an extra crashing cost, which depends on the length of lead time to be reduced and the ordering lot size. The option of investing in reducing set-up cost is also included. Two commonly used investment cost functional forms, logarithmic and power, are employed for set-up cost reduction. We assume that the stochastic demand during lead time follows a Normal distribution. The objective is simultaneously to optimize the lot size, reorder point, set-up cost and lead time. An algorithm of finding the optimal solution is developed, and two numerical examples are given to illustrate the results.

0038060718	On an EOQ model for deteriorating items with time-varying demand and partial backlogging	For seasonal products, fashionable commodities and high-tech products with a short product life cycle, the willingness of a customer to wait for backlogging during a shortage period is diminishing with the length of waiting time. Recently, Chang and Dye developed an inventory model in which the backlogging rate declines as the waiting time increases. In this paper, we complement the shortcoming of their model by adding the non-constant purchase cost into the model. In addition, we show that the total cost is a convex function of the number of replenishments. We further simplify the search process by providing an intuitively good starting value, which reduces the computational complexity significantly. Finally, we characterize the influences of the demand patterns over the replenishment cycles and others.

84875241037	Joint pricing and ordering policies for deteriorating item with retail price-dependent demand in response to announced supply price increase	Recently, due to rapid economic development in emerging nations, the world's raw material prices have been rising. In today's unrestricted in-formation environment, suppliers typically announce impending supply price increases at specific times. This allows retailers to replenish their stock at the present price, before the price increase takes effect. The supplier, however, will generally offer only limited quantities prior to the price increase, so as to avoid excessive orders. The retail price will usually reect any supply price increases, as market demand is dependent on retail price. This paper considers deterio-rating items and investigates (1) the possible effects of a supply price increase on retail pricing, and (2) ordering policies under the conditions that special order quantities are limited and demand is dependent on retail price. The pur-pose of this paper is to determine the optimal special order quantity and retail price to maximize profit. Our theoretical analysis examines the necessary and suffcient conditions for an optimal solution, and an algorithm is established to obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the developed model and the solution procedure. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the optimal solutions with respect to major parameters.

84878492411	Retailer's optimal order and credit policies when a supplier offers either a cash discount or a delay payment linked to order quantity	To increase sales and reduce default risks, a supplier may offer its retailers either: 1 a cash discount 2 a fixed credit period M if the order quantity is greater than or equal to a predetermined quantity W. Likewise, a retailer in turn offers its customers a credit period N, which has a positive impact on its demand but a negative impact on its default risks. In this paper, we establish an inventory model for a retailer in a supply chain when a supplier offers either a cash discount or a delay payment linked to order quantity; meanwhile it offers its customers a permissible delay in payments. Then, we derive several theoretical results to determine the optimal solution under various situations and develop an algorithm to solve this complex inventory problem. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results and provide some managerial insights. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

84878831877	Optimal production lot with imperfect production process under permissible delay in payments and complete backlogging	The traditional economic production quantity (EPQ) model assumes that the production products are all perfect. It is not always true in the real production system, due to imperfect production process or other factors, imperfect quality items may be produced. Furthermore, it is well-known that the total production-inventory costs can be reduced by reworking the imperfect quality items produced with a relatively smaller additional reworking and holding costs. In addition, the permissible delay in payments offered by the supplier is widely adopted in the practical business market. In this study, we explore the effects of the reworking imperfect quality items and trade credit on the EPQ model with imperfect production processes and complete backlogging. A mathematical model which includes the reworking and shortage costs, interest earned and interest charged is presented. Besides, an arithmetic-geometric mean inequality approach is employed and an algorithm is developed to find the optimal production policy. Furthermore, some numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are provided to demonstrate the proposed model.

In this paper, we point out some inappropriate mathematical expressions in both interest charged and interest earned in Kreng and Tan. For generality, we then extend their model to allow the following facts: (1) the interest rate I

84885853972	Impacts of collaborative investment and inspection policies on the integrated inventory model with defective items	For an imperfect production system, to reduce quality-related costs, a manager may consider investing capital in quality improvement. In general, the investment expense in reducing the defective rate of items is often paid by the vendor. On the other hand, the buyer may inspect the product quality as the order is received which implies it incurs an inspection cost. In a supply chain integrated system, to accomplish global optimisation, the vendor and buyer can agree to jointly invest capital to improve the imperfect production processes, and the buyer can remove the inspection programme as the defective rate reaches a certain low-level. Hence, this paper investigates the impacts of collaborative investment and inspection policies on an integrated inventory model with defective items. The objective of this study is to seek the optimal order quantity, shipping times from the vendor to the buyer per production run, and the defective rate that minimise the joint total cost per unit time. An algorithm is developed to find the optimal solution. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed model and solution procedure, and then several management insights are obtained from the numerical examples. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

0042788773	Impact of backorder discounts on periodic review inventory model	The stochastic inventory model analyzed in this paper explores the problem of the back-order discount and protection interval (i.e., review period plus lead time) as control variables to widen applications for a periodic review inventory model. In this study, we discuss two models that posses perfect information and partial information about the protection interval demand distribution. That is, we first assume that the protection interval demand follows a normal distribution, and then remove this assumption by only assuming that the first and second moments of the probability distribution of protection interval demand are known. For each case, we develop an algorithm to find the optimal strategy. Also, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the results.

0242487825	An EOQ model for deteriorating items under supplier credits linked to ordering quantity	In the classical inventory economic order quantity (or EOQ) model, it was assumed that the purchaser must pay for the items received immediately. However, in practices, the supplier usually is willing to provide the purchaser a permissible delay of payments if the purchaser orders a large quantity. As a result, in this paper, we establish an EOQ model for deteriorating items, in which the supplier provides a permissible delay to the purchaser if the order quantity is greater than or equal to a predetermined quantity. We then characterize the optimal solution and provide an easy-to-use algorithm to find the optimal order quantity and replenishment time. Finally, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84893202208	An integrated inventory model with quality improvement and two-part credit policy	Trade credit financing plays a vital role in current business operations. Vendors extend payment dates to encourage sales, and buyers are not required to pay immediately after receiving products. This is equivalent to receiving a price reduction. Besides, buyers reduce their need for capital from bank loans. In addition, a number of defective products are produced during the production process. The number of defective items influences the on-hand inventory levels of buyers, service levels, and frequency of orders. To ensure that the analysis incorporates a realistic production environment, we developed an integrated inventory model with a two-part trade credit and considered an imperfect production process that can be improved by capital investment. The objective was to determine the optimal ordering, shipping, and quality improvement policies to maximize joint total profit. An iterative algorithm was established to determine the optimal strategy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of changing parameter values on the optimal solution. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.

84894662535	Optimal replenishment decisions under two-level trade credit with partial upstream trade credit linked to order quantity and limited storage capacity	This paper extends the previous economic order quantity (EOQ) models under two-level trade credit such as Goyal (1985), Teng (2002), Huang (2003, 2007), Kreng and Tan (2010), Ouyang et al. (2013), and Teng et al. (2007) to reflect the real-life situations by incorporating the following concepts: (1) the storage capacity is limited, (2) the supplier offers the retailer a partially upstream trade credit linked to order quantity, and (3) both the dispensable assumptions that the upstream trade credit is longer than the downstream trade credit N < M and the interest charged per dollar per year is larger than or equal to the interest earned per dollar per year I c < I e are relaxed. We then study the necessary and sufficient conditions for finding the optimal solution for various cases and establish a useful algorithm to obtain the solution. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results and provide the managerial insights. © 2013 Chih-Te Yang et al.

84898835504	An integrated inventory model with capacity constraint and order-size dependent trade credit	Trade credit has many forms in today's business practice. The most common form of trade credit policy that is used to encourage retailers to buy larger quantities is order-size dependent. When the number of ordered units exceeds the capacity of the own warehouse, an additional rented warehouse is required to store the excess units. Therefore, to incorporate the concept of order-size dependent trade credit and limited storage capacity, we proposed an integrated inventory model with capacity constraint and a permissible delay payment period that is order-size dependent. In addition, the unit production cost, which is a function of the production rate, is considered. Three theorems are developed to determine the optimal production and replenishment policies for both the supplier and the retailer. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the solution procedure.

84899984507	Optimal credit period and lot size for deteriorating items with expiration dates under two-level trade credit financing	In a supplier-retailer-buyer supply chain, the supplier frequently offers the retailer a trade credit of S periods, and the retailer in turn provides a trade credit of R periods to her/his buyer to stimulate sales and reduce inventory. From the seller's perspective, granting trade credit increases sales and revenue but also increases opportunity cost (i.e.; the capital opportunity loss during credit period) and default risk (i.e.; the percentage that the buyer will not be able to pay off her/his debt obligations). Hence, how to determine credit period is increasingly recognized as an important strategy to increase seller's profitability. Also, many products such as fruits, vegetables, high-tech products, pharmaceuticals, and volatile liquids not only deteriorate continuously due to evaporation, obsolescence and spoilage but also have their expiration dates. However, only a few researchers take the expiration date of a deteriorating item into consideration. This paper proposes an economic order quantity model for the retailer where: (a) the supplier provides an up-stream trade credit and the retailer also offers a down-stream trade credit, (b) the retailer's down-stream trade credit to the buyer not only increases sales and revenue but also opportunity cost and default risk, and (c) deteriorating items not only deteriorate continuously but also have their expiration dates. We then show that the retailer's optimal credit period and cycle time not only exist but also are unique. Furthermore, we discuss several special cases including for non-deteriorating items. Finally, we run some numerical examples to illustrate the problem and provide managerial insights. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84906216071	A note on "optimal replenishment policies for non-instantaneous deteriorating items with price and stock sensitive demand under permissible delay in payment"	Soni 2013. Int. J. Prod. Econ., 146 (1), 259-268 proposed optimal replenishment policies for non-instantaneous deteriorating items (i.e., the product starts deteriorating after a period of no-deterioration) with price and stock sensitive demand. With a stock-dependent demand, it is desirable to have non-zero ending inventory due to potential profit resulting from the increased demand. However, Soni 2013. Int. J. Prod. Econ., 146 (1), 259-268 treated those ending inventory as fresh stocks to go through another period of non-deterioration again. Additionally, he assumed for simplicity that the replenishment cycle time T must be longer than the period of non-deterioration td(i.e., T>td). In reality, one should consider all possible replenishment cycle time to maximize the profit. In this note, we complement the shortcomings of his model by (i) selling those ending inventory as salvages, and (ii) considering all possible replenishment cycle time, which may be shorter than the period of non-deterioration. With these modifications the repeatability of the replenishment cycle is ensured and the applicability of Soni's model is strengthened. The numerical examples indicate that the global optimal solution is indeed possible in the case of T≤td. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84910144394	Advance sales system with price-dependent demand and an appreciation period under trade credit	With globalization, companies are facing fierce competition. Offering an appreciation period has become a commonly adopted method by retailers to sustain competitive advantage. During the appreciation period, customers can request to return products for any reason. In addition, retailers provide advance sales to attract additional customers. The supplier usually provides the retailer with a trade credit, which they can use as a type of price reduction to attract additional customers. Price is viewed as an important vehicle to sell products and enhance revenues. Therefore, in this article, we establish an inventory model with price-dependent demand for a retailer who simultaneously receives trade credit from its supplier, and offers advance sales and an appreciation period to its customers. We first establish a proper model and then provide an easy-to-use method to obtain an ordering policy for the retailer to achieve its maximum total profit. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the solution procedure.

0346687119	The variable lead time stochastic inventory model with a fuzzy backorder rate	Cost and operation of inventory depends a great deal on what happens to demand when the system is out of stock. In real inventory systems, it is more reasonable to assume that part of the excess demand is backordered and the rest is lost. However, the amount of backorders (or lost sales) often incurs disturbance due to various uncertainties. To incorporate this reality, this article attempts to apply the fuzzy set concepts to deal with the uncertain backorders and lost sales. The purpose of this paper is to modify Moon and Choi's continuous review inventory model with variable lead time and partial backorders by fuzzifying the backorder rate (or equivalently, fuzzifying the lost sales rate). We first consider the case where the lost sales rate is treated as the triangular fuzzy number. Then, through the statistical method for establishing the interval estimation of the lost sales rate, we construct a new fuzzy number, namely statistic-fuzzy number. For each fuzzy case, we investigate a computing schema for the modified continuous review inventory model and develop an algorithm to find the optimal inventory strategy.

0347270151	A note on periodic review inventory model with controllable setup cost and lead time	In this study, we investigate the periodic review inventory models with a mixture of backorders and lost sales by controlling lead time and setup cost simultaneously to reduce the inventory operating cost. It is assumed that the probability distribution of the protection interval, i.e., review period plus lead time, demand is unknown but its first two moments are given, we apply the minimax distribution free procedure to solve this problem. An algorithm to find the optimal solutions is developed. Specifically, from the results of numerical examples, it can be shown that, the significant savings can be achieved through the reductions of lead time and setup cost. In most of the literature dealing with periodic review inventory problems, both lead time and setup cost are treated as constants. Recently, Ouyang and Chuang (J. Inf. Mange. Sci. 9 (1998) 25) presented a minimax distribution free procedure for the periodic review inventory model which involves a controllable lead time. We note that the paper is focusing on the benefits from lead time reduction in which setup cost is viewed as a fixed constant. From the Japanese experience of Just-In-Time (JIT) production, it has been observed in many manufacturing settings including job shops, batch shops and flow shops, whose setup cost can be reduced by investing capital. For this reason, attempt to extend Ouyang and Chuangs's model by formulating a modified periodic review model to accomodate more practical features of the real inventory systems. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

1342267163	Fuzzy Mixture Inventory Model with Variable Lead-Time Based on Probabilistic Fuzzy Set and Triangular Fuzzy Number	This article considers the fuzzy problems for the mixture inventory model involving variable lead-time with backorders and lost sales. We first use the probabilistic fuzzy set to construct a new random variable for lead-time demand, and derive the total expected annual cost in the fuzzy sense. Then, the average demand per year is fuzzified as the triangular fuzzy number. For this case, two methods of defuzzification, namely signed distance and centroid, are employed to find the value of total expected annual cost in the fuzzy sense. Next, the backorder rate of the demand during the stock-out period is also fuzzified as the triangular fuzzy number, and the value of total expected annual cost in the fuzzy sense is derived using the signed distance. For the proposed models, we provide a solution procedure to find the optimal lead-time and the optimal order quantity such that the total expected annual cost in the fuzzy sense has a minimum value. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

84922010828	Optimal ordering policy for an economic order quantity model with inspection errors and inspection improvement investment	The rise of consumer rights has caused businesses to focus increasingly on product quality. The inability of businesses to identify defective items before selling them results in higher return costs, decreased sales revenue, damaged reputations, and decreased competitiveness. This study examines the economic order quantity (EOQ) model in which the retailer discovers defective goods among received products. Although retailers conduct quality inspections, the inspection process is imperfect. We assume that Type I and Type II inspection errors occur during product quality inspection and that the market demand rate is sensitive to Type II inspection errors. To improve inspection, the retailer invests capital to decrease Type II inspection errors. This study investigates the optimal order quantity and the power of the test to maximize total profit per unit time. Mathematical analysis is used to show the optimal solution exists. An algorithm is then developed to calculate the optimal solution. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the solution process and sensitivity analysis with respect to major parameters is carried out.
