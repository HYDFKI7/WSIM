26644441917	Analysis and three-series solution to high-rise structure's galloping oscillation	The three-series solution is taken up to the nonlinear differential equation of the galloping movement caused by the cross wind force acting on a high-rise structure, thus giving a reduced 3D expression in terms of steady-state response and critical wind speed. Analyzes theoretically the vital factors which may lead to the occurrence of galloping oscillation as follows. The structure may form an airflow breakaway only if the slope of airflow lifting line is of a great negative value, i.e., the structure has a non-streamlined cross-section. The sufficient conditions to an instable structure are heavy mass, small stiffness and damping and tall with high aspect ratio. The equations derived shows that the nonlinear quadratic term of wind speed does not affect the value of critical wind speed but intensify the steady-state response and decrease the response frequency. It implies that the critical wind speed just depend on the first degree term of the speed, on which the initial few minutes to response to galloping oscillation almost depend. A numerical example indicates that the approach proposed is effective and easy to apply to engineering practice.

The development of the bond stress between bars and mortar was calculated. Test results show that the maximum bond-stress is not influenced by the bar bond length and increases as the increased splitting strength of mortar for block. The local bond stress-slip curve was obtained. Then, based on the regressive analysis of test data, two bond shearing stress-slip constitutive models between bars and mortar were proposed.

The tensile status of Z-shaped and ring shaped plastic steel ties were simulated through an experiment on mortar joint sample of L-shaped and U-shaped plastic steel ties. The uneven forcing characteristics of ring shaped plastic steel tie were studied through performing the unilateral alternate drawing experiment on ring shaped plastic steel tie.

When wall crack seriously, the ties can play an important role in supporting the wall and preventing wall collapse. The reinforced concrete strip ears and ties are the main constructional measures to coordinate the internal and external walls. Moreover, deformation capacity of the cavity wall is improved efficiently with constructional columns.

In this paper, uniaxial tensile test of Q460C (14 mm thickness), the high-strength construction-structure steel was tested at the low temperature to obtain the intensity index (including yield strength, tensile strength), the plastic index (including elongation at break, reduction of area), and the relations of these indexes along with the temperature changing; as well as calculate the Q460C steel's temperature sensitive coefficient, which may be used to forecast the intensity index of Q460C at low temperature; furthermore, analyze the scanning electronic microscope of the tensile specimen fracture surfaces. The experimental data show that the yield ratio of the Q460C was found to increase with the elongation at break, and the reduction of area decrease while the plasticity and toughness decrease as the testing temperature drops. In addition, the fracture surface takes on the transition from toughness to brittle fracture whose abruption occurs at -40°C. Moreover the significant feature of brittle morphology is shown on the tension fracture which takes place at -60°C. The result indicates that the Q460C steel is inclined to low temperature brittle fracture, so brittle fracture prevention measures should be strengthened.

In order to consider impacts of different factors to the compression performance of foam-in-place thermal insulation mortar, the compression performance experiments on 6 groups of specimens were carried out. The group of specimens were divided by two major factors: different kinds of masonry and different thickness of foam-in-place thermal insulation mortar. Its compression performance is analyzed by comparison with XPS board and EPS board that fills cavity wall. The results show that compression capacity of specimens made with normal blocks is higher than that of specimens made with sintered porous brick; its compression capacity declined obviously when the thickness of thermal insulation layer increase. The compression capacity of foam-in-place thermal insulation mortar is obvious higher than that of EPS board and XPS board which were filled in Cavity Wall. The average compression strength of foam-in-place thermal insulation mortar is 2.65 times higher than the EPS board and 1.39 times higher than the XPS board.

The comparison analysis of the model tests and numerical tests shows that the failure patterns, carrying capacity, deformation ability and coordination deformation ability of the numerical tests of foam-in-place cavity wall are agree with the data of model tests, and the validity and accuracy of the numerical tests are verified. The numerical tests of the in-plane and out-of-plane seismic property of the foam-in-place cavity wall acted upon different vertical pressures are carried out. In general, vertical pressure makes a greater effect on out-of-plane seismic property than in-plane seismic property. The seismic carrying capacity, displacement and relative displacement difference of the in-plane and out-of-plane foam-in-place cavity wall will increase and coordination deformation capacity will reduce when vertical pressure increases. The influence of vertical pressure on coordination deformation capacity of foam-in-place cavity wall is obvious. The coordination deformation capacity will reduce remarkably when vertical pressure is greater than 0.5 MPa. It is therefore recommended that vertical pressure is not appropriate to be greater than 0.5 MPa when the foam-in-place cavity wall with great cavity thickness or in the buildings of high earthquake intensity regions.

84904509684	Analysis of loading capacity of steel bar truss and concrete superimposed two-way slab	In order to test the capacity of steel bar truss and concrete composite two-way slab in prefabricated construction and to give reference to the finite element analysis and the application of concrete bilateral composite slab in engineering project, stress analysis of bilateral composite slab has been conducted in Huimin affordable housing project in Shenyang. The secondary loading process of the concrete composite two-way slab has been simulated with ABAQUS software and the skill of "birth-and-death element". Slab behaviour with different constraints and thickness ratios has been received and compared with the result of cast-in-plate floor. It shows that mechanical properties of concrete composite two-way slab is similar to the cast-in-place floor's. The less proportion of the prefabricated layer thickness is, the more overall carrying capacity improves. But the prefabricated layer thickness should not be less than the minimum thickness to resist the construction loads. The secondary stress in the process of construction is beneficial to the improvement of the overall carrying capacity. It indicates that this kind of composite floor slab can be applied in the engineering because of the good loading capacity and convenient construction.

84907233035	Experimental study on flexural behavior of t-shaped concrete beam strengthened with angle steel	In order to study flexural behavior and influence factors of T-shaped concrete beam strengthened with angle steel, this paper designed eight T-shaped concrete beams with different angle steel reinforcement, concrete grade, reinforcement ratio and U-hoop pitch to test the corresponding flexural behaviors. Results show that the increase amplitude of ultimate bearing capacity is the largest in all tests when the number of angle steel reinforcement increases. But the increase amplitude is the least with increasing reinforcement ration. Too large number of angle steel reinforcement and U-hoop pitch can reduce ductility of reinforcement part. For small U-hoop pitch specimen, the rebar strain shows a slowly change. But the number of angle steel reinforcement has a little effect on the rebar strain. It indicates that the method of reinforcement with angle steel can effectively improve flexural behavior of T-shaped concrete beam and delay the development of cracks and strains, which can be used in engineering practice to reinforce T-shaped concrete beam.

84907241981	Finite element analysis of concrete shear wall with sleeve connection	This paper studied the mechanical behavior of concrete shear wall with sleeve connection, such as stress state, load capacity, stiffness and deformability by different loadings. Using the finite element software ABAQUS, mechanical properties of 14 concrete shear walls with different axial compression ratios, reinforcement ratios and sleeve lengths under horizontal monotonic loading by displacement control were analyzed. Results show that the yield of vertical edge reinforcement and the bending failure of bottom concrete crushing appear and the failure mostly occurs in the range from bottom to the height of 1m. With increase of axial compression ratio, the ultimate capacity and stiffness increase, but the deformability decreases. With increase of reinforcement ratio, the ultimate capacity and deformability both increase, but the stiffness has no obvious change. Using the larger sleeve, the ultimate capacity increases, but stiffness and deformability have no obvious changes. It is concluded that the concrete shear wall with sleeve connection has good load capacity, stiffness and deformability and reinforcement stresses can also be transmitted effectively by the sleeve connection.

84920365017	Parameter influence analysis of T-shaped concrete beams strengthened with near surface mounted FRP bars	To study the influences of different parameters of FRP bars on flexural performance of concrete beams strengthened with near surface mounted FRP bars, six T-shaped concrete beams strengthened with different surface conditions, diameters and materials of FRP bars were studied in flexural experiment. The results indicate that the surface condition of FRP bars is an important factor to affect the failure mode of strengthened beams, and the bond failure happens more easily in the strengthened beams with CFRP bars than GFRP bars. The cracking load of strengthened beams isn't increased obviously with near surface mounted FRP bars, while the yield load and ultimate load are increased significantly, while the ultimate mid-span displacement is decreased. The surface condition and diameter of FRP bars have no obvious effect on yield load except for the material of FRP bars. The surface condition, diameter and material of FRP bars have significant effect on the ultimate load. The ultimate load is larger in the beams strengthened with CFRP bars, ribbed and larger diameter in GFRP bars. Ribbed FRP bars can make use of the material property more fully, and the diameter of FRP bars shouldn't be larger than the half of depth and width of the groove, otherwise the material property won't be taken full advantage. Though the FRP bars with larger elastic modulus can't be taken full advantage, the capacity of strengthened beams can be increased significantly. The surface condition, diameter, and material of FRP bars have little effect on the strain of steels, so how to make full use of the material property of FRP bars is the most urgent problem in the method of strengthening beams with near surface mounted FRP bars.

84920370328	Experimental study on concrete short columns under axial compression in an environment of freeze-thaw cycles	The objective of this test was to research the compressive behavior of concrete short columns. The columns' parameters such as age, curing environment, number of freeze-thaw cycles and design strength of concrete were taken into account. The axial compression concrete short columns in an environment of freeze-thaw cycles were studied by experimental test. The results show that the surface failures of the columns are more serious with shorter curing age, larger number of freeze-thaw cycles or lower design strength of concrete. Being cured under humid environment, the surface failures of the columns will be reduced. After freeze-thaw cycles, the mechanical properties of concrete short columns are evidently changed, but the failure modes of the axial compressive columns are unchanged. The influence of freeze-thaw cycles is significant when curing age is less than 14 days, otherwise the in fluence is not obvious. The influence of freeze-thaw cycles is not obvious when the number of freeze-thaw cycles is less than 15, otherwise the influence is obvious. The humid curing environment can reduce freeze damage. The behavior of axial compression concrete short columns in an environment of freeze-thaw cycles is closely related to concrete design strength. Increasing design strength can enhance the resistance to freeze damage. The development of tiny cracks of concrete are often not obvious when concrete design strength is higher than C30.

84920455396	Study on flexural behavior of T-shaped concrete beams strengthened with CFRP	In order to study on the flexural behavior of T-shaped concrete beams strengthened with CFRP, eight T-shaped concrete beams with different CFRP reinforcement, concrete grade, reinforcement ratio and U-hoop spacing were designed to test the corresponding flexural behaviors. Results show that strengthening method can effectively improve the flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beams and the development of crack and strain is delayed. All T-shaped concrete beams show tension steel yielding, CFRP rupture and concrete crushing. The increase of characteristic load is the largest when increasing CFRP reinforcement. CFRP will not fail when increasing U-hoop spacing. So U-hoop spacing has little effect on the characteristic load and U-hoop anchorage works well. The flexural rigidity of strengthened specimens is the same before steel yields. The flexural rigidity of strengthened specimens is enhanced after steel yields and CFRP reinforcement has the largest impact on the flexural rigidity. CFRP reinforcement and reinforcement ratio have a great effect on steel strain and CFRP strain, which is mainly reflected after cracking. As to concrete grade and U-hoop spacing, there is little influence on steel strain and CFRP strain.

84920476754	Bond tests of concrete strengthened with CFRP sheet under acid erosion cycle condition	Bond tests of concrete strengthened with CFRP sheet under acid erosion cycle condition were conducted. The specimens were treated under acid erosion cycle condition for 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 times and axial tension. The failure modes, ultimate tensile strength, adhesive strength were analyzed comparatively. The experimental results show that the longer time the specimen are treated in acid erosion cycle condition, the more tensile failure of concrete from surfaceor. The acid erosion has a great influence on bond strength with same concrete grades and different treating time, but its further change is not obvious later. The attenuation model of ultimate adhesive strength developed by the method of least squares can be approximately expressed by exponential function. Acid erosion has a significant impact on adhesive property of low strength concrete and FRP.

84920732923	Shearing performance of rectangle plate natural rubber bearings under thermal aging treatment	The paper aims to study the shearing performance of plate natural rubber bearings used in roads and bridges in the thermal aging conditions. The specimen were dealt in thermostatic air-blower-driven drying closet for 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100d and sheared horizontally. The dimensions, ultimate strength, ultimate shearing strength, level equivalent stifmess and shearing elastic modulus were analyzed comparatively. The results show that the longer day the specimen are dealt in thermostatic air-blower-driven drying closet, the more obvious local damage phenomenon, the greater deformation, the more prone to brittle failure, and ultimate shearing strength and shearing elastic modulus are decreased more seriously. Through the comparative analysis of the test results, the attenuation model of ultimate shearing strength and shearing elastic modulus created by the method of least squares basically meets the requirements.
