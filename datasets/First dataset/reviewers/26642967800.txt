Finally, further simulations are performed to analyze the effects of different cushion materials on the properties of rigid-pile composite foundation. The results show that (1) with the increase of cushion stiffness, the settlement decreases, the pile-to-soil stress ratio increases, and the penetration of the pile top into the cushion decreases; (2) the range of negative skin friction area of the pile is determined as follows: 0.30 L of medium and coarse sand, 0.25 L of crushed stone, and 0.20 L of graded sand and stone; and (3) with the increase of cushion stiffness, the negative skin friction decreases, while the axial force of the pile increases.

26644453966	Design method of CFST connections with steel ring plate and steel corbels through tubular core	The use of concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) as the primary columns in high-rise and ultrahigh-rise reinforced concrete buildings is now becoming more and more popular worldwide. However, the usage has been limited due to the lack of the safe, economic and convenient connections between CFST and reinforced concrete beams. Some experimental studies and theoretical analyses were undertaken on CFST connections with steel corbels through the core by the authors. As an improvement, a new type of CFST connection with steel ring plate and without RC ring beam has been presented in this paper. The test results on two full-scale specimens have shown that the new type connection has an excellent performance in both ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state. Based on the results of the test and nonlinear finite element analysis, the calculating formulas of the ring plate have been deduced, and then the chart of the ring plate has been given for design. Finally, the design method of CFST connections with steel ring plate and steel corbels through tubular core were obtained. The new connection has been used in a tall building with 43 storeys in Guangzhou.

They are prestressed concrete outer-jacketing frame structure for adding story, outer-jacketing frame structure for adding story with encased prestressed steel-truss-concrete composite beam for first floor of new-added structure, and prestressed steel-concrete composite outer-jacketing frame for adding story. Characteristics of these outer-jacketing structures were compared and analyzed. The results show that using the method of prestressed steel-concrete composite outer-jacketing frame for adding story, the weight of the first floor can be carried by the structure itself during construction, in addition, the structural whole cost is lower and the construction period is shorter than using other schemes. So prestressed steel-concrete composite frame structure should be firstly chosen in outer-jacketing structure reconstruction for adding story around existing building.

The influences of silica sol on nucleation process of soap-free emulsion polymerization, particle size and distribution of composite latex and stability of composite emulsion were discussed. The results show that added silica sol reduces particle size, and emulsion stability is improved by introduction of colloidal silica. The composite latex was characterized by transmission electronic microscope (TEM). The result indicates that the composite emulsion particles exist. Based on the experiment results, a composite mechanism was proposed, that precursor particles of polyacrylate, which are formed in the early stage of soap-free emulsion polymerization, are very unstable, so they tend to be absorbed on colloidal silica particles to lower interfacial energy, thus forming composite particles.

84867854877	Experimental research on the behavior of spatial intersecting connections of a diagrid structure subjected to axial loading	In an innovative structural system known as the diagrid structure, connection commonly consists of four obliquely intersecting columns. On the basis of a newly developed concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) planar intersecting connection, this paper presents a type of spatial intersecting connection with both in-plane and out-of-plane angles. Two specimens were tested under monotonic axial compressive loading, with the purpose of investigating the failure mode, performance, and bearing capacity of the connections. The parameter in this study was the thickness of elliptical plate. The lateral constraints of the connection were simulated by three steel bars, and their diameters were determined by an elastic finite element analysis (FEA) before the test was conducted. As a result, the connection exhibited strain-hardening characteristics, and the failure was due to the tube bulging in the column zone. The ratios of the bearing capacity to the maximum design load of the connections were 4.41 and 4.47 for specimen 1 and 2, respectively. The thickness of elliptical plate has no significant influence on the behavior of the connection. The results show that both connections can fulfil the seismic design criteria "stronger connection, weaker components" defined by current Chinese codes. FEA result is substantiated to be accurate by comparing to the test results. In addition, an adequate lateral constraint is verified to be essential for the connection in practical use.

The FEA model of a single pile composite foundation was established in ABAQUS adopting the Modified Cam-clay constitutive model and pore element to simulate the soil between piles. The calculation fit well with the experimental results, which proved the validity of numerical simulation. The influences of thickness and modulus of cushion, the length of pile on the mechanical and consolidation settlement of rigid-pile composite foundation were further analyzed. The results show that: the consolidation rate of rigid-pile composite foundation is quite faster than natural foundation; the consolidation rate is faster with larger cushion modulus and minor drain diameter ratio; the consolidation is almost finished during the construction process; the increase of cushion modulus leads to decrease of consolidation settlement, but the increase of thickness of cushion and drainage soil layer leads to the opposite effect.

An optimum formulation for light-color coatings was obtained by the orthogonal design method. Further analysis of the relationship between the spectra and the values of reflectance was carried out in order to develop new species of dark-color pigments with high near-infrared reflectance. Consequently, five dark-color pigments were prepared. The results suggested that the optimum formulation involved rutile type titanium dioxide with 25% weight content, white ceramic microspheres with 13% weight content and heavy calcium carbonate with 10% weight content. The refractive index varied in direct proportion to the heat-reflective performance; compared to normal coatings, the back temperatures of coatings mixed with these highly reflective pigments were lowered by 10-20deg;C, which implied a significant decrease in absorbed energy on the face of the samples.

70449729426	Behavior of concrete-filled steel tubular planar intersecting connections under axial compression, Part 1: Experimental study	In the innovative structural system known as the diagrid structure, a connection commonly consists of four obliquely intersecting columns and several beams. This paper presents two types of concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) planar intersecting connection, which are applicable to CFST diagrid structures with structural beams mounted on them. An equation to calculate the bearing capacity of the connections is proposed based on the Chinese design code for CFST columns. Eight specimens were tested under monotonic axial loading with the purpose of investigating the performance, bearing capacity, and failure mechanism of the connections under axial compressive load. The parameters in this study were connection detail, intersecting angle between columns, and loading type. The deflection, stress, failure modes, and bearing capacity of the specimens were obtained. The result shows that the angle between the CFST columns has a considerable influence on the failure modes. In addition, lining plates provide a larger confinement effect than flange plates. The loading type has little effect on the behavior of the connections. The ratio of compressive loading capacity to the results calculated by the proposed formula ranged from 0.99 to 1.31, which shows that the calculated bearing capacity is accurate or conservative for structural design. Finally, the behavior of the connections presented here was verified to be similar to that of an CFST stub column. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The as-synthesized Ni-P alloy arrays have the amorphous phase structure with nanograin of crystalline Ni. The length and outer diameter predominantly determined by the deposition time and pore diameter of the AAO membranes achieve 40 μm and 200 nm, respectively. The formation of nanotubes or nanowires during electrodeposition mainly depends on the current densities, deposition time and phosphorous acid concentration in the electroplating bath. The magnetic properties of these nanostructure arrays have also been studied. From the hysteresis loops, it is obtained that the nanotube and nanowire arrays have anisotropy with the easy magnetization along the direction of the arrays. Moreover, as the soft magnetic materials, the nanotube array is better than nanowire array in magnetic performance of saturation magnetization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77950987907	Comparison of axial bearing capacity formulas of high-strength concrete-filled steel tube short columns	Bearing capacity of short columns under axial compression is an important mechanical index for concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) structures. The lack of intensive researches and the existence of inconsistent formulas lead to difficulties in practical application of high strength CFST structures. This paper analyses and compares the bearing capacity formulas under axial compression of high strength CFST short columns from 11 different specifications, which are divided into three categories according to the calculating theory; confined concrete theory, unification theory and superposition principle theory. The formulas are compared with test results of three large scale short column specimens under axial compression, it is found the results based on unification theory and superposition principle theory generate 9%~31% lower estimates than experiment results. On the other hand, the formula from 'Technical specification for high strength concrete structures (CECS 104:99)' has good agreements with the experimental results. Therefore, specification CECS 104:99 is proposed for practical project. It is noteworthy that the confined effect on core concrete provided by steel tubes is taken into lower or no account in specifications of Europe, Japan and US, which will lead to underestimated concrete strength in structural design.

77950552724	Experimental study on plannar intersecting connections used in obliquely crossing mega lattice of the Guangzhou West Tower	The Guangzhou West Tower is an ultrahigh-rise building with a height of 432 m, with the structural pattern of a reinforced concrete core tube enclosed by an outer lattice tube made of obliquely crossing concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) columns. To assure that the capacities of connections exceed those of structural components, two details of the connections were proposed and studied. One connection type was reinforcing plate with lining board and the other was connection with flange plates. Eight 1:5.5 scale models were tested using a specially designed self-balancing equipment with two 10000 kN capacity jacks and pinion rack, in order to verify the rationality of the details and to investigate the performance, capacity and failure mechanism. Test results indicate that the connections exhibit the characteristic of confined concrete. The connections are validated to meet the design requirement of the Guangzhou West Tower, with sufficient loading capacity. Compared with the connections with flange plates, the connections with reinforcing plate plus lining board have larger confining effects on concrete core and thereby better mechanical behaviors.

77950560794	Experimental study on spatial intersecting connections used in obliquely crossing mega lattice of the Guangzhou West Tower	Due to the out-of-plane angles of the mega lattice used in the Guangzhou West Tower, planar intersecting connection test cannot fully reflect the actual structural performance of the connection nor take into account the influence of structural beams. In order to investigate the mechanical behavior of the connection in practical use, one spatial intersecting connection was designed based on the planar connection with reinforcing plate and lining board, and four 1:5.86 scale models were tested under multi-step monotonic axial loads. Experimental results indicate that the capacity of connections can meet the design requirement, and the design principle of strong connection can be assured. The tests verified that the out-of-plane displacement can affect the capacity of connections considerably. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of the structure, the out-of-plane displacement must be controlled strictly by enhancing the intersecting beams or by applying prestressed tendons.

77950584424	Parametric analysis and simplified calculating method for diagonal grid structural system	Diagonal grid (or diagrid) structural system consists of obliquely intersecting columns in lattice form. Since lateral and vertical loads were both resisted by the diagonal components, diagrid structural system had great lateral stiffness and performance, which had been applied to the exterior tube of the Guangzhou West Tower (with a height of 432 m). For the diagrid exterior tube of tube-in-tube structure used in ultra high-rise buildings, the relationships between the diagonal angles, plan forms, lateral stiffness and internal forces were analyzed by three-dimensional models. The optimal angle of diagonal members and the influence of plan form on structural stiffness were derived from mechanical methods and comparisons of the models. As a result, the optimal angles for diagrid structures with or without corner column are 53°~69° and 63°~76°, respectively. With the increase of the diagonal angle, the axial stiffness increases while the torsional stiffness decreases, yet the structure still exhibits great torsional capacity. Furthermore, the plan form has a slight influence on the lateral stiffness, optimal angle and axial force of columns. However, the shear force and bending moment of columns and the axial force of beams decrease with the increase of side dimension. In addition, according to lateral stiffness-based design method, a simplified calculating method which is applicable for structural design is proposed to estimate the cross-sectional area of diagonal members in structures with square plan.

Analogous to the deformation characteristics of an ideal cantilever element, the lateral stiffness requirements of the transfer story in a high-rise building is put forward, which is determined according to the deformation of an ideal element. A number of elastic and elastic-plastic analyses of typical frame-supported shear wall structures are carried out.

78650386279	Summary on research of blind analysis contest of E-Defense shaking table test	This paper presents a summary on blind analysis contest prior to a shaking table test of a full scale steel frame which was carried out on E-Defense in Japan. Different numerical analysis methods used by the researchers in the contest are studied. There are mainly four kinds of methods containing as follows; fiber model, plastic hinge model, microscopic model, and collaborative structural analysis. The first two models have more assumption, less DOFs, and are suitable in the whole structure analysis. On the contrary, microscospic model has fewer assumptions , its mechanical concept is clear and can represent local buckling of components accurately. But it is difficult to apply to the whole structure analysis. Collaborative structural analysis, which belongs to hybrid-element method, simulates different components with different elements, even with different programs. Dynamic analysis can be realized when stiffness matrix is assembled in the host program. Advantages of both macroscopic and microscopic model are adopted in the collaborative structural analysis.

78650403509	The influence of axial compression ratios on the strong-column and weak-beam actualization of RC frames	As slab reinforcement will make the longitudinal beam overstrengthen in cast-in-place RC frame structures , a series of RC frame structures with different axial compression ratios are simulated by ABAQUS. The influences of axial compression ratios on the participation extent of the slab reinforcement in longitudinal beam overstrength are studied. The actualization of strong-column and weak-beam philosophy is analyzed in the RC frame structures with different axial compression ratios and at different connections. The occurring condition of a plastic hinge at beam end is discussed. It indicates that the axial compression ratios can greatly influence the participation extent of the slab reinforcement and it is easier for the occurring of plastic hinges at beam end in the RC frame structures with low axial compression ratio than that with high axial compression ratios. Moreover, it is more difficult for the occurring of plastic hinges at beam end at interior connections than that at exterior connections in the same structure. In order to actualize the no collapsing target of structures in strong earthquakes more effectively, it is recommended that the actual capacity of the beam end with considering the slab participation should be still smaller than the actual capacity of column end at the same connection.

It was found that the anodized film was eroded from the porous outer layer to the dense inner layer under cavitation conditions. AFM images showed that the different phases with different properties were subjected to differing degrees of cavitation, resulting in the formation of a rough cavitation corroded surface. The mean roughness of the corroded surface decreased with increasing cavitation time. The electrochemical corrosion process during cavitation corrosion was controlled by mixed cathodic and anodic processes, and was accelerated by cavitation conditions compared with quiescent conditions. © 2011, NACE International.

An atmospheric pressure glow discharge generator is used to activate the PSf membrane surface, with subsequent chemical binding of heparin in the presence of EDC and NHS. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and XPS measurements confirm successful surface modification. The PSf-Hep membrane shows good blood compatibility, with a relatively low amount and normal morphology of adherent platelets.

The failure process of the specimen was observed and the load-axial displacement curves of the specimens were obtained. According to the experimental results, the influences of section size of specimens, battens spacing and concrete strength on the bearing capacity of the ARC stub columns were analyzed. The experimental process was simulated by finite element software ANSYS. The results show that the convex bulging deformation occurs in angle and batten of specimens near the middle position of columns when the specimens fail. With the increase of the distance between the battens, the bearing capacity of specimens becomes smaller and the load-displacement curve decreases more obviously. So battens spacing is the important factor influencing the bearing capacity of the ARC stub columns under the same condition. Based on the experimental data and simulation analysis, a simple calculation formula for the bearing capacity of the ARC stub columns under axial compression is proposed.

In order to construct an affinity surface for preferential adsorption of LDL, heparin-modified gold surface(GS-Hep) was fabricated by a self-assembling method and hydrophobic-modified gold surfaces(GS-Hydro) was used as a control. The morphologies of the modified gold surfaces were investigated by atomic force microscopy(AFM) and the quantity of heparin bound to gold surface was assayed by the toluidine blue(TB) colorimetric method. Water contact angles were determined to investigate wettability on GS-Hep and GS-Hydro. Surface plasmon resonance(SPR) technique was used subsequently to detect the selective binding of LDL with heparin. And the investigation on the effect of pH on LDL adsorption suggests that lower pH lead to higher quantities of LDL adsorption on GS-Hep. Compared with GS-Hydro, GS-Hep is selective for LDL from both single and binary protein solutions. Moreover, adsorbed LDL on GS-Hep could be washed off by injecting elution solution, such as NaCl solution, for the purpose of the regeneration of GS-Hep for further LDL adsorption.

The resulting GCB with a high degree of graphitization was analyzed by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and was then used as the support material for synthesizing a platinum-GCB (Pt/GCB) hybrid catalyst. This catalyst was obtained through a simple chemical reduction using ethylene glycol as the reducing agent, which is amenable to large-scale production. The results show that the Pt nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the GCB with an average diameter of 3.6 nm and a narrow particle size distribution. The electrochemical results obtained using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) utilizing a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) show that the Pt/GCB electrocatalyst exhibits higher conductivity, stability, and electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. The ORR proceeds through a four-electron process and when compared with Pt nanoparticles supported on Vulcan XC-72 (Pt/Vulcan XC-72) prepared under the same conditions, the Pt/GCB exhibits a significant enhancement for the ORR reaction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

As a complex girder transfer structure is used and several indexes exceed the limitation of current design codes, the building belongs to special complex high-rise building. In order to investigate the seismic behaviour of this structure, a 1:20 scale model is fabricated and tested in a large-scale shaking-table. The total weight of this model is 59.9t, and the similarity radio of acceleration descends to 1.69. It is one of the largest shaking-table tests in china, by which the shear strength of vertical components can be accurately estimated. Three seismic waves were adopted in the test, which were The EI-CENTRO, LIVERMOR and an artificial one. The shaking-table test was carried out under 7 kinds of seismic level and 59 cases. It can be observed from the results that some components were damaged under 8 degree severe earthquake and the model began to collapse under 9 degree severe earthquake. Moreover, the seismic responses of the model are analyzed by finite element analysis program-Sap2000. By comparing the results between the analysis and the tests, the dynamic properties, dynamic time history, acceleration response, relative displacement response, inter-story drift response, torsion response of the structure were discussed.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to characterize the as-synthesized silver products. The results show that a variety of silver nanostructures, such as silver dendrites, the triangular, hexagonal, disk nanoplates and spherical nanoparticles, can be yielded in large scale by facilely tuning the silver nitrate concentrations, temperature and concentration of PVP in aqueous solutions. The as-synthesized silver dendrites were deposited in ethanol without any field (UV or visible light irradiation) or thermally induced activation, a significantly spontaneous evolution in morphology occurred from the fractal structure to silver nanoparticles at room temperature. Moreover, the mechanisms of the architectural reconstruction of silver nanostructures in ethanol at room temperature by self-assemble were discussed.

Different from any other joint subassemblies, the specimen here is a whole structure which is a single layer, bidirectional, three-span with 1/3 scale. Moreover, it is a conventional beam with secondary beam structure. The capacity of the structure is verified; the beam and slab crack patterns are illustrated; the load-strain responses are compared; and the contradiction of Strong Column Weak Beam philosophy with the actual failure mode is analyzed. The origin of this inconsistency is mainly attributed to slab monolithically connected to the surrounding beams.

84892590835	Failure mode classification of reinforced concrete column using Fisher method	In order to apply the performance-based seismic design, an engineer must first find out whether the column is expected to fail in shear before or after flexural yielding. According to column failure characteristics and failure mode of reinforced concrete column, the UW-PEER structure performance database was discussed and analyzed. In order to investigate the relevance of failure mode and factors such as longitudinal reinforcement ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio, hoop spacing to depth ratio, aspect ratio, shearing resistance demand to shear capacity ratio and axial load ratio, Fisher's discriminant analysis (FDA) of the above factors was carried out. A discriminant function was developed to identify column failure mode. Results show that three factors, i.e., Vp/Vn, hoop spacing to depth ratio and aspect ratio have important influence on the failure mode. The failure mode has less to do with longitudinal reinforcement ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio and axial load ratio. Through using these three factors and the model proposed, over 85.6% of the original grouped cases were correctly classified. The value of coefficient of Vp/Vn is the largest, which means that discriminant equation is most sensitive to the shearing resistance demand to shear capacity ratio. © Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

84893869082	Revisit to the self-assembled hybrid acrylate/silica core-shell structured particles in the presence of unmodified silica particles	Polyacrylate/silica nanocomposite particles are synthesized by soap-free emulsion polymerization using negatively charged silica particles, where the anionic initiator, potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS), is used. The influence of the content of hydrophilic silica particles on the composite particle growth and conversion is investigated. Nucleation process of unmodified silica-stabilized emulsion polymerization is studied by characterizing the structures of composite particles forming at different polymerization stages with transmittance electron microscope (TEM) and laser light scattering (DLS). The results show that the presence of silica particles on latex particles reinforces the barrier to radical absorption and retards the polymerization rate and therefore the growth of the latex particles. However, the composite particle size does not decrease much when the content of silica sol is increased to more than 5. wt%. A mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of the core-shell structured particles when an electrostatic repulsive force between the silica and polyacrylate particles is present. The polyacrylate precursors forming in the early stage of the soap-free emulsion polymerization are unstable and tend to aggregate and absorb silica particles to lower their interfacial free energy, thus forming the composite particles. In contrast to the monomer droplets dispersed in the sole acrylic soap free emulsion polymerization, the monomer droplets dispersed in the aqueous system containing silica sol can work as polymerization loci due to their relatively small size and the large quantity (or the large specific surface areas), hence enhancing the ability to capture radicals. © 2014.

In order to fully understand the performance of rigid-pile composite foundation in tall buildings, this article set up an overall FEA model of a 25-storey frame-tube structure by considering the interaction of superstructure, foundation and ground. Thereafter, a detailed parametric study was performed by changing values of different key site factors. These parameters include: Ground soil range, distance of neighboring buildings and deformation modulus of cushion. The results show that 1) Ground soil range has a great influence on the stress and settlement of raft, the effective influence range is 2-3 times of the raft dimension; 2) Influence of neighboring buildings on the stress and settlement of the raft can be neglected; 3) With the increase of cushion modulus, the raft stress increases while the settlement decreases, an optimal cushion modulus is recommended to be 20-40MPa. © Han et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

By employing inequality proving theory and the corresponding inequality proving analysis software DISCOVERER, the classification result of specific four-anchor localization is derived. The mathematical description of location problem is given at first and the nonlinear equations arising from traditional method are transformed into polynomial equations with inequality constraints. Inequality proving theory and tools are then used to explore the solution classification with some parameters fixed to give the complete distribution of solutions in this case. The solution classification criterion has important guiding role in practical applications and also can improve the performance of node layout and precise information perception.

The organization of silica particles at the oil-water interface is a function of the nucleation model. The present results show that nucleation model, together with monomer hydrophobicity, can be used as a trigger to modify the packing density of silica particles at the oil-water interface: Less hydrophobic methylmethacrylate, more wettable with silica particles, favors the formation of core-shell-structured composite when the composite particles are prepared by miniemulsion polymerization in which monomers are fed in batch (droplet nucleation). By contrast, hydrophobic butylacrylate promotes the encapsulating efficiency of silica when monomers are fed dropwise (homogeneous nucleation). The morphologies of polyacrylate-nano-SiO
