14344250740	Investigation of the PMD compensation system with the DOP as a feed back signal	The monitoring performance of monitor window and degree of polarization (DOP) sensitivity to differential group delay (DGD) can be improved greatly by using the band-pass and band-reject filters presented in the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) compensation system, where the DOP is used for the feed back signals. A comparison is made for the filters in improving the monitoring performance of the feed back signals between the 40 Gbit/s return-to-zero (RZ) and 10 Gbit/s nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) transmission system, and numerical analysis is made for the selection of the bandwidth of the filters. The results showed that the local extremum can be avoid in the searching process of the searching algorithm, so a bypass searching is reduced greatly, which is significant for the compensation effects and the stabilization of the system.

17044433916	Optimization of index modulation profile of sampling period for sampled fiber Bragg gratings	Using the simple inverse Flourier transformation of the target channels, we can get the index modulation structure of the sampled period for the sampled fiber Bragg gratins (FBGs). In this method, the enable channels are identical wavelength operation while the unable channels are almost suppressed completely, and the enable and unable channels can be established at will based on the applications. However, the efficient of the sampled FBGs of which the index modulation is obtained by the simple inverse Fourier transformation is very slow. To get a high efficient, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to design the phase of the target spectrum. Combing the two methods together, a high efficient multi-level phase sampled FBG that each channel is suppressed or not at will, can be obtained. We also use the particle swarms optimizations (PSO) algorithm to optimize the pure phase sampling profiles of the sampled FGB. Results showed that a much high efficient of the FBG can be obtained compared with that obtained from the simple inverse Fourier transformation technology. If appropriate grating period chirp and sampled period chirp is applied to such a grating, a novel FBGs based OADM or interleaver devices with dispersion or dispersion slope compensation can be designed.

This all-fiber PMD compensation technique is cost-effective and flexible in designing the differential group delay (DGD). Based on the numerical simulations, a 10 Gb/s NRZ transmission system is compensated by this grating.

23944485260	Explanation of unusual photoluminescence behavior from InAs quantum dots with InAlAs capping	The effect of different kinds of cap layers on optical property of InAs quantum dots (QDs) on GaAs (100) substrate was studied. Temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) indicates that the PL integrated intensity from the ground state of InAs QDs capped with an intermediate InAlAs layer drops very little as compared to QDs capped with a thin InGaAs or GaAs cap layer from 15 K up to room temperature. PL integrated intensity ratio of the first excited to ground states for InAs QDs capped with an intermediate InAlAs layer is unexpectedly decreased with increasing temperature, which are attributed to phonon bottleneck effect. A virtual barrier is proposed to describe this physics process and shows good agreement with experimental results when fitting the curve with the value of the virtual barrier 30 meV.

The bandwidth of each channel could be adjusted by the chirped period of the grating, and the total dispersion of each channel was dependent on the length of the seed grating. Finally the dispersion slope could be altered by adjusting the sampled function. So this technology is very attractive in design the multi-channel dispersion compensation devices for wavelength division multiplex system.

Because PMD possesses the time-varying and the statistical properties, to establish an effective control algorithm for adaptive or automatic PMD compensation is a challenging task. Widely used control algorithms are the gradient-based peak search methods, whose main drawbacks are easy being locked into local sub-optima for compensation and no ability to resist noise.

The results show that the period distributions especially for the longitude period distribution have obvious influences to the strain field. The influence of the longitudinal and transverse periods on the strain field are just opposite in effect, especially for the line-scan path along the quantum dot's center-axis. Under suitable conditions, the effects of both periods on the strain field distribution can be partly eliminated. The results also demonstrate that one must take the quantum dot's period distribution into account when the effect of the strain field on the electronic structure is calculated. We conclude that using the isolated quantum dot model is not appropriate to simulate the strain field, or evaluate the influence of it on electronic structure.

34547950898	The electronic structure of truncated-conical shaped InAs/GaAs quantum dot with wetting layers	Semiconductor quantum dots have been of major interest in recent years. This has largely been simulated by progress in quantum dot growth technology, whereby self-organized quantum dots array can be achieved using Stranski-Krastanow growth mode. Quantum does material has achieved broad applications in optoelectronic devices and quantum information fields because of the unique 3-D electron confinement. Based on the 1-band effective-mass theory, a finite element technique is developed to calculate the electronic structure of conical shaped InAs/GaAs quantum dot, including the wetting layer. Using the axis-symmetry model, the 3-D effective-mass Schrödinger equation with step potential barrier can be reduced to a 2-D problem by separating variable, which greatly reduced the calculation cost. Based on the result, we found, compared without wetting layer, the wetting layer can influence the electron level. This may attribute to the increase of the confining potential width rather than the potential height.

The three-dimensional finite element analysis for an array of dots was used for the strain calculation. The dependence of the strain energy density distribution on the thickness of the capping layer was investigated in detail when the elastic characteristics of the matrix material were anisotropic. It is shown that the elastic anisotropic greatly influences the stress, strain, and strain energy density in the quantum dot structures. The anisotropic ratio of the matrix material and the combination with different thicknesses of the capping layer, may lead to different strain energy density minimum locations on the capping layer surface, which can result in various vertical ordering phenomena for the next layer of quantum dots, i.e. partial alignment, random alignment, and complete alignment. © 2007 University of Science and Technology Beijing.

The positive hyperbolic-tangent profile is taken for example and it will demonstrate that a proper selection of the apodization strength factor can effectively improve the results obtaining minimum deviation of the dispersion from the required value, maximum reflection bandwidth and minimum group delay ripple impact. Owing to the fact that shorter links minimize the group delay ripple amplitude, whereas the longer ones maximize the bandwidth of interest, the influence of the fiber link length is discussed.

In another section, we gave a detail analysis about the strain distribution for quantum wire and quantum dot intergrowth structure, and there are two situations: the first, a little bigger quantum dot grown within a single quantum wire, the second, Y shaped quantum wires where quantum dot grown in the cross section of the wires, and the angle of the Y shaped wires lessen than 12 degree. All the low-dimension structures discussed have been observed in the laboratory. For the lens-shaped quantum dot with and without capping layer, the results showed that in both circumstances, the strain distribution would become more uniform in the quantum dot if the transverse size becomes larger. Compared with the open quantum dot (without capping layer), the capping layered quantum dot has a more sufficient strain relaxation, and even excessive strain relaxation is observed in the simulation. This phenomenon can be used to qualitative explain the quantum dot cave in and cavern out in the sequential capping layer growth interruption observed in laboratory. It is very promising for the quantum wire and quantum dot intergrowth structure. The phenomena of photoluminescence spectrum not changing with the variation of temperature have been observed recently in the intergrowth structure. For convenience, we used a simplified model to calculate such a structure, which we adopted rectangle quantum wire and rectangle quantum dot. The growth is along the [001] direction, and the wire is along the [110] direction. The results showed that the strain in quantum dot is greatly enhanced in the intergrowth structure compared with the single quantum dot system. There are strain-focusing region around the interface of quantum dot and quantum wire.

33644981001	The multi-mode behaviour of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers under a spatially periodical current infection	A two-dimensional spatially independent rate equation model of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) is derived and then used to analysis the multi-mode behaviour of VCSELs. The transverse mode characteristics of VCSELs, the carrier distribution in both the radial and the azimuthal directions, and the effects of the azimuthal non-uniformity of the injection current on the transverse mode behaviours are investigated in detail. By using both Bessel and Fourier expansion of carrier density, the 2D spatially independent rate equations for transverse mode are formulated, which take into account carrier diffusion both in the radial and in the azimuthal direction as well as gain non-uniformity in the lateral direction. The equations are numerical solved self-consistently using the Runge-Kutta method for different spatial periodic injection current. Results show that a proper current injection profile can separate the sine mode and cosine mode of the same order transverse modes observably. It is found that an injection current with periodic change in the azimuthal direction is favourable for the excitation of the modes whose mode profile match the current profile best. The results are useful to the design and control of transverse mode characteristics of a VCSEL.

These microstructure fibers and waveguides become more and more important in the future optical devices for their novel and spurious optical characteristics. To give a full understand of these devices, the exact mode fields solver is very critical. In this paper, we use the full-vector finite difference approach free of spurious modes to solve mode field characteristics of the photonic crystal and 2-D plane photonic crystal waveguides. The photonic band structures within an irreducible Brillouin zone are investigated for both in plane and out plane propagation. The out of plane propagation can be used for the photonic crystal fiber. The coupled difference equations are in terms of the transverse magnetic filed components. Based on the appropriate transparent boundary conditions, a unique set of couple five-point difference equation are developed, and an efficient numerical technique to solve the deterministic equations by the Eispark in Matlab. For the in plane propagation, the guides mode are either TE or TM modes, the difference equations are uncoupled. Using the appropriate period boundary condition and combined with the transparent boundary condition, we derived the five point difference equations that can be used for the 2-D plane photonic crystal waveguides. Based on these finite difference equations, we analyzed the optical mode field characteristics of the crystal fiber and the plane optical crystal waveguides. The filling materials either dielectric or air are also analyzed. Good agreements are obtained compared the numerical results with the experiment data and the published literature. The mode fields' solver can also be used for the other waveguides such as Bragg fibers.

The degree of polarization (DOP) ellipsoid obtained by using a polarization scrambler can be used as either a feedback or feedforward monitoring signal for automatic polarization mode dispersion compensation. Generally, more than several thousands of sampling data of states of polarization (SOP) must be collected to insure getting a correct DOP ellipsoid.

In this work, randomly distributional disorders are applied to the air holes in the photonic crystal structure. Based on this, we investigate the influence of the slight disorder on the photonic crystal band structure and the performance of photonic crystal based devices (waveguide and slab cavity). The studies indicate that the slight disorder provides small influence on the band structure of the photonic crystal. But, the random disorder in photonic crystal waveguide may increase transmission loss obviously when the wavelength of the light and the distribution of disorder break the balance of multiple interferences. Also, the slight disorder can reduce the Q factor of the photonic crystal cavity at a certain degree. The studies may provide some useful guides for further photonic crystal device research.

The former, with multiple air holes periodically arranged around the core, possess numerous unusual properties, such as structure controllable chromatic dispersion, large mode areas, birefringence and stronger optical nonlinenarity.Based on the full vector, semi vector or even the approximate-scalar model, Lots of methods have been used to design the PCFs, such as the effective index approach, the localized function expansion method, the plane wave expansion method, the multipole method, the beam propagation method, the finite difference method, the finite difference time domain method, and the finite element method. Each of theses method mentioned above are accurate and efficient for ideal PCF, however, for the real fabricated PCFs, the geometry structure may not perfect, induced the base mode degeneracy may be destructive, and posses birefringence properties. Sometime the birefringence properties is necessary for special usefulness, such as polarization mode dispersion (PMD) compensation, and PCFs based polarized optical devices. In this paper, a full vector finite element is applied to investigate the mode birefringence, mainly focus on the rectangle lattice PCFs with elliptical or circular holes. It has been demonstrated from the calculated results that high birefringence to the order of 0.01 can be achieved by decreasing both the pitch and the x and y ratio of the elliptical hole. To increase the birefringence of the circular holes rectangle lattice, reduction of the width and height ratio of the lattice is necessary. Based on the simulation results, we conclude that both single polarization transmission and high birefringence polarization maintaining can be achieved by using the proposed structure with suitable parameters respectively. The available high birefringence at relative high frequency regime in the fibers and also the sufficiently broad single mode region would make the fabrication of highly birefringent photonic crystal fibers with novel properties possible.

42549124683	Influence of flux on the growth of InAs quantum dots on GaAs patterned substrate	Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are applied on the investigation of the epitaxial growth of self-assembled InAs quantum dots on GaAs substrate with periodic strain-relief patterns. The study is focused on the initial stage when the first sub-monolayer is forming on top of the wetting layer. The flux is one of the most important growth parameters, which are studied in detail. It is demonstrated that uniformly sized and regularly ordered island arrays can be obtained by controlling flux, by means of analyzing the surface morphology, average island size, island size distribution and the standard deviation of island size distribution. If interruption is introduced, the influence of flux will significant different. The uniformity and order of islands will greatly affect the locating of quantum dots in sequent 3-D growth.

The effect of different apodization sharpness on the spectral response is compared. It is demonstrated that the apodization sharpness parameter plays a more important role in the behavior of the mean dispersion, group delay ripple and some other spectral responses even than the type of apodization profile itself. The spectral response of three apodization function Cosine, Cauchy and Hamming are compared, with the apodization sharpness parameter is changed gradually. The results show that an apodization parameter is about 0.75 in better spectral response, minimum group delay ripple impact, minimum deviation from the required dispersion value.

The simulations showed that N atoms and Ga atoms were absorbed on the lattice of substrate and took on a distinct samdwich structure; the crystalline character of the films became weaker from bottom to top. Time evolution of the number of the atoms deposited on every layer, the vacancy ratio of every layer, the height of the centre of mass of the deposited clusters and the mean square displacements of the atoms were observed, the results showed that the clusters became stable with the time steps increasing and the first three layers had reached the stable state in the first 5000 steps, besides, N atoms reached the equilibrium positions more quickly than Ga atoms.

60649102249	Effects of the thickness of spacing layer and capping layer on the strain distribution and wavelength emission of InAs/GaAs quantum dot	A systematic investigation is given about the influence of thickness of the spacing layer on the strain distribution during the capping stage of the quantum dot. The calculated results show that the mismatch between the lattice constant of the spacing layer along the growth direction and that of the quantum dot is very important for the strain distribution. The height of the quanta dot is compressed during the capping stage, which is qualitatively interpreted form the strain distributions. When the thickness of the spacing layer equals the quantum dot, the influence of thickness of the capping layer on strain distribution is also discussed. Based on the deformation potential theory, the dependence of the emission wavelength on the thickness of the capping layer is investigated. The calculated results agree well with the experiment results. We conclude that, during the capping stage of the quantum dot, the strain is very critical for both the shape of the quantum dot and the optical characteristics; extension of the emission wavelength via quantum dot strain engineering is an effective means. © 2009 Chin.

62649169276	Strain engineered quantum dots for long wavelength emission	A systematic investigation about the strain distributions around the InAs/GaAs quantum dots using the finite element method is presented. A special attention is paid to the influence of InGaAs strain reducing layer. The numerical results show that the horizontal, vertical strains components and the biaxial strain are reinforced in the InAs quantum dot due to the strain-reducing layer. But the hydrostatic strain in the quantum dot is reduced. In the framework of eight-band k. p theory, we studied the band edge modifications due to the presence of strain reducing layer. Results demonstrate that, the strain reducing layer yield the decreasing of band gap, i.e., the redshift phenomenon observed in experiments. Our calculated results show that the degree of the redshift will increase with increasing of the thickness of strain-reducing layer. In calculating the influence of SRL, we discussed two circumistances: the height of the strain reducing layer larger and smaller than that of QD. The composition of the strain reducing layer on the degree of redshif is also investigated. The calculated results can explain the experiment results in literatures, and further confirmed that the long wavelength emission used for optical fiber communications is realizable by adjusting the dependent parameters. © 2008 SPIE.

62749186317	Molecular dynamics simulations on process of sige superlattice relaxation	Molecular dynamics simulations using Tersoff potential were performed to investigate the process of SiGe superlattice relaxation. Time evolution of the lattice constant and total potential of Si/Ge/Si or Ge/Si/Ge structure, mean square displacements and vibrational spectra of atoms in the trilayer lattice were studied. The simulations show that Si/Ge/Si structure is stretched in the laterally directions and compressed in the vertical direction after relaxation. However, Ge/Si/Ge structure is compressed in the three directions after relaxation, and more obviously in the vertical direction. Ge/Si/Ge structure needs more time to finish the relaxation. Total potential and the mean square displacements of the atoms reach the constant when the relaxation is finished. The potential of the relaxed structure is lower than that of the initial structure. Vibrational spectra of atoms are attenuated with the increasing of the wavenumbers. Spectra shape of the Ge/Si/Ge structure is not stable and has more peaks at proper wavemumbers, this results in obvious broaden of the spectra bands. All of above are because the crystallinity and symmetry degree of the Ge/Si/Ge structure are not as satisfying as those of the Si/Ge/Si structure.

Analytical expressions are derived for the strain fields with Green-function, which is simple for the regular shaped quantum-wire. The strain fields for arbitrary-shaped quantum-wire can be calculated by continuum elasticity theory and the influences of elastic constants are considered for different materials, although the results are less accurate. The effect of quantum-wire width on strain distribution and bandgap is analysed for InGaAs/GaAs quantum-wire nanostructures. The absolute magnitude of the strain in the bulk of the wire is attenuated significantly along the width direction. At the wire center, the strain-modified direct bandgap increases with the decrease in wire width. ©2009 Chin. Phys. Soc.

When determining the Hamiltonian matrix elements, we develop the Fourier transform method instead of the widely used analytical integral method. Using Fourier transform, we have investigated the energy levels as functions of the geometrical parameters of the rings and compared our results with those obtained by the analytical integral method. The results show that the energy levels in the quantum rings change dramatically with the inner radius, outer radius, average radius, width, height of the ring and the distance between two adjacent rings. Our method can be adopted in low-dimensional structures with arbitrary shape.

66449114893	Critical thickness and radius for axial heterostructure nanowires using finite-element method	Finite-element methods are used to simulate a heterostructured nanowire grown on a compliant mesa substrate. The critical thickness is calculated based on the overall energy balance approach. The strain field created by the first pair of misfit dislocations, which offsets the initial coherent strain field, is simulated. The local residual strain is used to calculate the total residual strain energy. The three-dimensional model shows that there exists a radius-dependent critical thickness below which no misfit dislocations could be generated. Moreover, this critical thickness becomes infinity for a radius less than some critical values. The simulated results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The critical radius from this work is smaller than that obtained from previous models that omit the interaction between the initial coherent strain field and the dislocation-induced strain field. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

67649442516	Rate equations and gain characteristics of quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers	To investigate the properties of quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers (QD-SOA), we establish a three-energy-system model in the conduction band of the QD-SOA. Optimize and compare the rate equations with those in references. Temporal solutions and distribution of electronic states derived by numerical calculation certify the discrete nature of the energy levels of the quantum-dot. Using the fact that the occupation probabilities of electrons and holes are linear in the ground state, we solve the rate equations at steady state to obtain the gain characteristics of QD-SOA and its relation to the occupation probabilities of electrons of the ground state. The results show that the QD-SOA has larger saturated optical gain, higher differential gain and lower operation current. The QD-SOA has more merits than the bulk or quantum-well optical amplifiers, which provide the instructions on designing optical amplifiers.

67650761058	The strain relaxation of InAs/GaAs self-organized quantum dot	This paper presents a detailed analysis of the dependence of degree of strain relaxation of the self-organized InAs/GaAs quantum dot on the geometrical parameters. Differently shaped quantum dots arranged with different transverse periods are simulated in this analysis. It investigates the total residual strain energy that stored in the quantum dot and the substrate for all kinds of quantum dots with the same volume, as well as the dependence on both the aspect ratio and transverse period. The calculated results show that when the transverse period is larger than two times the base of the quantum dots, the influence of transverse periods can be ignored. The larger aspect ratio will lead more efficient strain relaxation. The larger angle between the faces and the substrate will lead more efficient strain relaxation. The obtained results can help to understand the shape transition mechanism during the epitaxial growth from the viewpoint of energy, because the strain relaxation is the main driving force of the quantum dot's self-organization. © 2009 Chin.

The impact on strain relaxation, originating from the shape and the inter-island distance, was also quantitatively analyzed. The results indicate that when ignoring the surface energy, the relaxation degree increases with the increase of the aspect ratio regardless of the shape, among which the truncated pyramid quantum dots tend to become steady earlier than others. With the increase of the inter-island distance, the strain energy in the dots decreases, especially in the cubic dots.

Lattice distortion, mean square displacement, pair correlation function and vibrational spectra are studied. It is found that Ge substitution lead to little distortion of the Si matrix. However, vacancy and C substitution lead to more distortion. Diffusion directions of Si atoms around different kinds of point defects are different. When C substitution is introduced in the relaxed Si matrices or Ge substitution is introduced in the strained Si matrices, the system needs longer time to reach equilibrium. The crystallinity and symmetry degree of relaxed Si matrices are more satisfying than those of strained Si matrices after relaxation. Changes of the vibrational spectra caused by vacancy and C substitution are obvious. All above have a great effect on the photoelectric properties of the materials. © 2009 SPIE-OSA-IEEE.

The results are presented as a function of photon energies and QD radii. The optical absorption spectrum and refractive index changes have a blueshift in the presence of the impurity. With increasing distance of the impurity's position along the growth direction, the peak values of the refractive index changes decrease and shift to higher photon energy. When the sizes of the QDs increase, redshift effects are observed and the relative amplitudes diminish. It can be found that the nonlinear effect becomes obvious with increase of the incident optical intensity. Then there is a "hole-burning" in the absorption coefficient spectra and two new peaks will appear in the total refractive index change spectrum when the optical intensity becomes larger enough. Finally it can be concluded that the intensity of the incident light and the position of the impurity play an important role in the linear and nonlinear optical properties. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventionally, the F-P spectrum filter and normal dispersion fiber were used to eliminate chirp in GS-DFB-LD pulse sources. In this paper, a new method for eliminating chirp of high repetition pulses generated from DFB laser diodes is proposed. The use of a linearly chirped fiber grating for chirp elimination is discussed theoretically and numerically. A new apodized coupling profile function for the grating, which we call it the inverse Gaussian, is given. Its characteristics are analyzed and compared with other profiles. The numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.

79958735676	Donor-bound electron states in a two-dimensional quantum ring under uniform magnetic field	The electron states in a two-dimensional GaAs/AlGaAs quantum ring are theoretically studied in effective mass approximation. On-centre donor impurity and uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the ring plane are taken into account. The energy spectrum with different angular momentum changes dramatically with the geometry of the ring. The donor impurity reduces the energies with an almost fixed value; however, the magnetic field alters energies in a more complex way. For example, energy levels under magnetic field will cross each other when increasing the inner radius and outer radius of the ring, leading to the fact that the arrangement of energy levels is distinct in certain geometry of the ring. Moreover, energy levels with negative angular momentum exhibit the non-monotonous dependence on the increasing magnetic field. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

Based on the principle of the least energy, the transition between vertically aligned and anti-aligned quantum dot multilayers is studied. We investigate the influence of quantum dot base size and density on critical spacer thickness for the transition.

79960844867	Electronic structures of alloy quantum dots with nonuniform composition	In this study, the significant effect of the nonuniform composition in alloy quantum dots (QDs) on electronic structure is analyzed in depth. The equilibrium composition profiles in experimentally observed dome and barn shaped GeSi/Si QDs are determined by combining the finite element method and the method of moving asymptotes. Due to the composition variation, the total band edge of heavy hole is dominated by the band offset and spin-orbit coupling rather than the strain effect. The numerical results reveal that the wave function of heavy hole trends to be localized in the Ge-rich region at the top of the large QD. Moreover, the size effect gradually compensates the composition effect as the size of QD decreases. © 2011 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The results of off-resonance study indicate that a frequency-stabilized single photon source can be achieved by controlling either pure dephasing rate or incoherent pumping rate.

The optimal structure is obtained by combining the Geometry Projection Method and Finite Element Method. Both gradient information and symmetric control points are introduced to reduce the calculation cost. For benefit to the fabrication in reality, the structure is simplified by the combination of triangle and rectangular geometry. Through parameter optimization, the absolute band gap of the new structure is improved to 0.1735 (2πc/a), which is much larger than those reported before.

The results show that either square or triangular array arrangement, it is easier for the dielectric cylinder type photonic crystal to form TM-polarized mode band gap; while, in the air-hole photonic crystal it is much easier to form TE-polarized-mode band gap. For a given filling ratio, with the increase of relative dielectric constant, the maximum gap width does not always increase, but it is peaked. Similarly, for a given relative dielectric constant, with the increase of filling ratio, it is also peaked for the maximum gap width. Moreover, no matter the erystal is air hole type or dielectric cylinder type in structure, the triangular lattice structure is much easier to form bands gap. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society.

It is shown that the photonic band of this PhC structure is very dispersive over a broad bandwidth so that light will be efficiently diffracted in the wavelength region of solar radiation. The PhC structure also creates resonance modes leading to further diffraction and funnelling of light so that the light propagates in many pathways in the whole PhC lattice region, which will greatly facilitate lightmatter interaction when light-absorbing elements are embedded in the PhC structure.

Two kinds of users are considered: best-effort-only service users and multiple services users. Unlike most previous works, the integrated scheduling algorithm is responsible for assigning resource blocks to different SU, as well as distributing the assigned resource blocks among multiple services for the same user. Moreover, by use of the convex optimization theory, a Lagrangian dual method is proposed, in which the joint subcarrier assignment and power allocation are performed to achieve the optimal solution. To simplify the computation complexity, a low complexity dynamic subcarrier allocation algorithm, named Max Utility for Multiple Services on Cognitive Radio (CR-MUMS), is formulated to extend the non-linear integer optimization to a continuous convex optimization. Simulation results of system spectral efficiency, ftp and video throughputs illustrate that the CR-MUMS with low computational complexity provides better performance than Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) and Proportional Fair (PF) algorithms.

Compared with sphere, single torus and horizontal dimer under perpendicular polarization are characterized with narrower line width and wider tunability throughout visible and infrared frequencies. These properties make single torus and horizontal dimer suitable for high sensitivity sensing. Furthermore, Purcell factor and local field enhancement of horizontal dimer which are important to high efficient single photon devices are one order of magnitude higher than those of single torus respectively.

Four different kinds of quantum dots are introduced at the same height and aspect ratio. We found that 0.5 nm wetting layer is an appropriate thickness for InAs/GaAs quantum dots. Strain shift down about 3%∼4.5% for the cases with WL (0.5 nm) and without WL in four shapes of quantum dots. For band edge energy, wetting layers expand the potential energy gap width. When WL thickness is more than 0.8 nm, the band edge energy profiles cannot vary regularly. The electron energy is affected while for heavy hole this impact on the energy is limited. Wetting layers for the influence of the electronic structure is obviously than the heavy hole. Consequently, the electron probability density function spread from buffer to wetting layer while the center of hole's function moves from QDs internal to wetting layer when introduce WLs. When WLs thickness is larger than 0.8 nm, the electronic structures of quantum dots have changed obviously. This will affect the instrument's performance which relies on the quantum dots' optical properties. © © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The investigation of the transient propagation of the Gaussian pulse in the waveguide indicated that low group velocity dispersion can cause a small expansion of the pulse.

The results show that both the hydrostatic and biaxial strain inside the QDs with a GaNAs SCL are reduced compared with those with GaAs capping layers. Moreover, most of the compressive strain in the growth surface is compensated by the tensile strain of the GaNAs SCL, which implies that the influence of the strain environment of underlying QDs upon the next-layer QDs' growth surface is weak and suggests that the homogeneity and density of QDs can be improved. Our results are consistent with the published experimental literature. A GaNAs SCL is shown to influence the strain and band edge. As is known, the strain and the band offset affect the electronic structure, which shows that the SCL is proved to be useful to tailor the emission wavelength of QDs. Our research helps to better understand how the strain compensation technology can be applied to the growth of stacked QDs, which are useful in solar cells and laser devices. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The strain, the electron energy levels, and heavy hole energy levels of InAs/GaAs(001) quantum dots with vertical nanomechanical force are investigated. Both the lattice mismatch and nanomechanical force are considered at the same time. The results show that the hydrostatic and the biaxial strains inside the QDs subjected to nanomechanical force vary with nanomechanical force. That gives the control for tailoring band gaps and optical response. Moreover, due to strain-modified energy, the band edge is also influenced by nanomechanical force. The nanomechanical force is shown to influence the band edge. As is well known, the band offset affects the electronic structure, which shows that the nanomechanical force is proven to be useful to tailor the emission wavelength of QDs.

By properly designing the geometrical parameters of the metal grating, we propose a structure for a nanodome solar cell with an α-Si layer thickness of only 26 nm, with calculation results showing the averaged active layer absorption is as high as 71.3%.

Also, the dependence of active layer absorption on structure symmetry and incidence angle is analyzed. For asymmetrical structures, the averaged active layer absorption is increased for the enhanced asymmetrical cavity modes, giving a largest absorption of 74.59% when the asymmetrical factor f is 0.17. For incident angles from 10° to 90°, the active layer absorption of the symmetrical proposed structure is enhanced on average by 112%. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Due to geometrical symmetry determined by {1 3 7} facets, typical 60° straight dislocations, along [-1 1 0] and [-1 -1 0], are considered separately. We adopt both P-K approach and full finite element method (FEM) model to predict the equilibrium position of misfit dislocation in pure InAs nanoislands. Consistent results are obtained: the positions of two dislocations for maximum strain relaxation are different in pyramid while the positions are same in dome. Based on the full FEM model, the critical dimensions of coherency are evaluated by comparing total energy stored in coherent and dislocated nanoislands. The results indicate that misfit dislocation along [-1 1 0] should generate first in pyramid, while almost identical critical volumes of dome shapes can be expected for both dislocation configurations. Moreover, the critical volume of dome nanoisland rises as the aspect ratio increases. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

The GMCM precedes the early work with a larger scope of applications. Early work which the authors did can only deal with the recognition work with the number of powers of 2 classes, while GMCM can cope with the classes of any number. This article further illustrates the MSCM, the algorithm of result reliability and their functions in the GMCM. Three sets of cases are demonstrated and formats of grouping are discussed.

84886914175	Dependence of electronic properties of germanium on the in-plane biaxial tensile strains	The hybrid HSE06 functional with the spin-orbit coupling effects is used to calculate the habituation of the electronic properties of Ge on the (0 0 1), (1 1 1), (1 0 1) in-plane biaxial tensile strains (IPBTSs). Our motivation is to explore the nature of electronic properties of tensile-strained Ge on different substrate orientations. The calculated results demonstrate that one of the most effective and practical approaches for transforming Ge into a direct transition semiconductor is to introduce (001) IPBTS to Ge. At 2.3% (0 0 1) IPBTS, Ge becomes a direct bandgap semiconductor with 0.53 eV band gap, in good agreement with the previous theoretical and experimental results. We find that the (111) and (10 1) IPBTSs are not efficient since the shear strain and inner displacement of atoms introduced by them quickly decrease the indirect gap of Ge. By investigating the dependence of valence band spin-orbit splitting on strain, we prove that the dependency relationship and the coupled ways between the valence-band states of tensile-strained Ge are closely related to the symmetry of strain tensor, i.e., the symmetry of the substrate orientation. The first- and second-order coefficients describing the dependence of indirect gap, direct gap, the valence band spin-orbit coupling splitting, and heavy-hole-light-hole splitting of Ge on IPBTSs have been obtained by the least squares polynomial fitting. These coefficients are significant to quantitatively modulate the electronic properties of Ge by tensile strain and design tensile-strained Ge devices by semiconductor epitaxial technique. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

All GaX systems transfer from the typical wurtzite to pseudographitic phases when the in-plane tensile strains are large enough. Our findings indicate that the elastic stiffness coefficients have a direct correlation with the strains. The variations of the band gap energy are diverse with respect to the compressive and tensile biaxial strains. For tensile biaxial strains, the band gap decreases substantially as the increasing of the strains. Upon compressive biaxial strains, the band gap initially increases, and then undergoes a decline. In addition, we find that there exists an indirect to direct band gap transition of GaP at certain in-plane biaxial strains.

It is observed that for the total coverage lower than 0.5 ML, the number of islands decreases with the temperature increasing and other growth parameters fixed and the number of islands increases with the flux rate increasing when the deposition is lower than 0.6 ML and the other parameters are fixed. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84893595439	A utility-based adaptive resource scheduling scheme for multiple services in downlink multiuser MIMO-OFDMA systems	In this paper, a utility maximization-based resource scheduling and sharing (UM-RSS) scheme is proposed for downlink multiuser multiple-input-multiple- output orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (MU-MIMO-OFDMA) systems. Before performing the UM-RSS scheduling scheme, we first allocate the best antenna sequence for every served user by a suboptimal multiuser antenna selection (MAS) algorithm according to the channel state information (CSI). To balance efficiency and fairness, the integrated scheduling algorithm of UM-RSS is responsible for assigning subcarriers to different users, as well as distributing the assigned subcarriers among multiple services for the same user. For a MU-MIMO-OFDMA system, the joint spatial and frequency scheduling may improve the system spectrum efficiency by exploiting the multiuser diversity gain in both frequency and spatial domain. Finally, numeric result simulated show that the UM-RSS scheduling scheme outperforms traditional scheduling schemes in terms of system throughput, system spectral efficiency, and fairness criterion. © 2013 IEEE.

84895063730	Vanadium doping on magnetic properties of H-passivated ZnO nanowires	A comprehensive theoretical investigation on the electronic and magnetic properties of V-doped and H-passivated ZnO nanowires (NWs) was performed using spin-polarized density functional theory. The magnetic couplings of six configurations of V-doped ZnO NWs are studied in detail and stable ferromagnetism (FM) ordering is found in certain configurations. The FM mechanism originated from the strong hybridization of V 3d and O 2p around the Fermi level. Our results show that the uniaxial strain is an effective method to tune the magnetic properties of this material system. Room temperature ferromagnetism in these V-doped ZnO NWs indicates that these materials have a promising application in nanoscale spintronics. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84896448619	The sensing characteristics of plasmonic waveguide with a single defect	A novel two-dimensional nanoscale structure for sensing which consists of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide with a defect, is designed and numerically simulated by using the finite element method (FEM). Both of the refractive index sensing characteristics and the temperature sensing characteristics of the structure are analyzed systematically by investigating the transmission spectrum. The numerically simulated results show that the dip positions of the transmission spectrum have linear relationships with the refractive index of the material under sensing and the ambient temperature, respectively. Based on the relationships, the refractive index of the material under sensing or the ambient temperature can be obtained from the dip wavelength shift detection. When the width and the height of the defect are set to be 50 nm, 300 nm, respectively, the refractive index sensitivity can be obtained as high as 1736 nm RIU

We develop an effective cavity quantum electrodynamics model, demonstrate the polarization-related nonlinear response under a linearly polarized pulse excitation by calculating the timeresolved intracavity photon number, and investigate the dependence of system parameters on the nonlinearity. In addition, we show that, when driven by two pulses with perpendicular polarization and a relative time delay, the coupled system suppresses the delayed one, which can be applied to polarized optical switching at a single-photon level. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84898895929	Electronic and optical properties of InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots with tunable aspect-ratio	In this paper, a combined approach of finite element method (FEM) and quadratic programming optimization method is proposed to investigate the nonuniform equilibrium composition profile of InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) in the framework of Gibbs energy optimization (GEO). The proposed QDs are varied with aspect ratio from 0.3 to 0.5. The wave functions of electron and heavy hole are predicted by using the k ṡ p method. The changes of wave functions before and after optimization can be observed by using composition optimization. Both the eigenvalues and transition energy change obviously with the increasing aspect ratio. The linear optical absorption coefficients corresponding to the interband ground state transition are obtained via the density matrix approach and perturbation expansion method. The numerical results reveal that the aspect ratio and composition profile play significant roles in determining the electronic and optical properties. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84899118405	Optimal photon antibunching in a quantum-dot-bimodal-cavity system	We theoretically investigate the photon statistics in a cavity quantum electrodynamics system of a single quantum dot coupled to a bimodal nanocavity. It is shown in a recent work [A. Majumdar, M. Bajcsy, A. Rundquist, and J. Vučković, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 183601 (2012)PRLTAO0031-900710. 1103/PhysRevLett.108.183601] that the system can generate strongly sub-Poissonian light when one of the cavity modes is driven coherently and resonantly. We study the two-mode coherent driving regime of the coupled system. The effect of additional cavity mode driving on statistical characteristics of photon emission is presented by evaluating the zero-delay second-order correlation function g2(0). The antibunching character can be optimized by regulating the ratio between driving strengths of two cavity modes to achieve optimal combination of superbunched and coherent light. As a result g2(0) can be reduced up to several orders of magnitude [g2(0)∼10-7] with proper system parameters, compared with the one-mode driving system [g2(0)∼0.1]. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84900410070	Plastic relaxation of mixed dislocation in axial nanowire heterostructures using Peach-Koehler approach	In this Letter, the plastic relaxation introduced by typical 60° mixed dislocation in zinc-blende axial nanowire (NW) heterostructures is evaluated by numerical Peach-Koehler approach which reflects the interaction between coherent strain field and misfit dislocation. Cylindrical NW epilayers grown on NW and bulk substrate are separately modeled. We reveal that straight 60° dislocation with Burgers vector (a /2) 〈101〉 would always generate at NW center orienting [111], while aspect ratio dependent off-center equilibrium position should be expected for NW epilayer along [001]. Moreover, the critical diameters, below which coherency is maintained, are predicted based on energy balance criterion for axial NW heterostructures along predominating growth direction [111]. The results are compared with existing theory and experimental observations. Our work provides a necessary quantitative complement to the understanding of plastic relaxation and coherency limit in axial NW heteroepitaxy. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84900481582	The mechanical properties and stabilities of pristine, hydrogenated, and fluorinated silicene under tension	A first principles study has been performed to systematically evaluate the mechanical properties and stabilities of pristine, hydrogenated and fluorinated silicene (H-silicane and F-silicane) under tension. The uniaxial tension along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions and the equiaxial tensile strain are considered in this work. The calculated results have shown that the deformation, failure behavior and the ideal strength are anisotropic along the three deformed directions. After hydrogenation and fluorination, the ideal strengths in three deformed directions all reduce while the ideal strains increase. Therefore, the hydrogenation and fluorination increase the toughness. The phonon calculations based on the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) confirm stabilities of the pristine silicene, H- and F-silicane. The Poisson ratios of three materials along the AC and ZZ directions all exhibit monotone decreasing changes with increasing strain, except that the Poisson ratio of pristine silicene in the zigzag direction increases with increasing strain. The tensile strains decrease the buckling height, as expected, but in a complex function. The second- and third-order elastic constants are determined by least-squares polynomial fitting to the first principles calculations. Our results can help to understand the effect of hydrogenation and fluorination of silicene on its mechanical properties and provide some useful data for the experiments. © 2014 SPIE.

The effects of geometric structure on the dispersion properties of dual-concentric core photonic crystal fibers are carefully studied by finite element method. The first layer of holes around the core area is enlarged in a new manner with the near-core point fixed.

The eccentricity of the general model ranges from 0 to 1, which means that a circular orbit can be introduced reasonably. Moreover, the geocentric-equatorial coordinate system, which can utilize the two-line elements, is used in the general model. Two kinds of simulations are performed, and we found that the rotations of polarization state are obviously influenced by the APT system. Our model could be applied in a realistic satellite-to-ground quantum communication system. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The multiple random phase screen simulation method and vortex extracting method are utilized to calculate the optical vortex positions (x,y) on the receiver plane. Numerical results reveal that x and y are Gaussian random variables. However, the errors of Gaussian fitting become larger and the Gaussian fitting curves become broader as topological charge of optical vortex increases through the same atmospheric turbulence.

It is found that V atom favors to substitute for Al site with the lowest formation energy. The magnetic coupling of three different configurations are studied and configuration I is demonstrated to possess room temperature ferromagnetism. The stable ferromagnetic coupling is mediated by double exchange mechanism. In addition, the in-plane biaxial strains corresponding to tensile and compressive strains can affect and manipulate the magnetic interaction of V-doped AlN nanosheet in different ways.

The formation energy of seven different configurations is studied. The strength of covalent bonding largely depends on the strong s-p hybridization among In-5s, P-3p and Bi-6p states. The band gap of InPBi shrinks clearly with the increasing Bi concentration and the band edge shifts when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered. The insertion of Bi atom leads to hybridization of In/P/Bi p states which contributes a lot around Fermi level.

84906823299	Phonon instability and ideal strength of silicene under tension	The stress-strain relationships of low-buckle silicene are investigated in the framework of the density functional theory for equiaxial tensile strain and uniaxial tensile strain along armchair and zigzag directions. The ideal strengths for equiaxial tension and armchair uniaxial tensions are 7.59 N/m and 6.76 N/m, respectively. For zigzag uniaxial tension, there exists two ideal strengths (5.26 N/m and 5.29 N/m) due to the phase transition of silicene from original low-buckle structure to true planar structure. The phonon dispersions of silicene under three types of tensions are calculated using the finite differences method to examine stability conditions. The results show that failure mechanisms of silicene under armchair and zigzag uniaxial tensions are elastic instability (phonon instability occurs behind the elastic instability). We find that phonon instabilities occur near the center of the Brillouin zone and phonon soft modes for armchair and zigzag uniaxial tensions are longitudinal acoustical (LA) modes along the pulling direction like graphene. The failure mechanism of silicene under equiaxial tension is only attributed to elastic instability unlike graphene. The phonon instability is dictated by out-of-plane acoustical (ZA) mode rather than K

84906501291	Design of plasmonic solar cells combining dual interface nanostructure for broadband absorption enhancement	We propose an ultra-thin film solar cell structure combining front semicircular dielectric grooves and back trapezoidal metal reflector. The back trapezoidal metal structure traps light by the excitation of plasmonic modes and the outstanding scattering effect of our optimized shape to enhance the absorption at long wavelengths. The front groove structure boosts absorption at short wavelengths by the mechanisms of Fabry-Perot resonance, scattering and the interaction with back plasmonic structure. The total absorption efficiency over the entire spectrum in 100 nm thick active layer is as high as 78.4% under normal incident light and it can also be maintained in a high level even if the incident angle varies from -60° to 60°. Broadband absorption, efficiency enhancement and insensitivity to the angle indicate the dual interface nanostructure to be a practical reference. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84907664794	Comparative study on the nonlinear properties of bilayer graphene and silicene under tension	Atomic structures and nonlinear properties of single layer graphene (SLG), bilayer graphene (BLG), single layer silicene (SLS), and bilayer silicene (BLS) under equiaxial tension and uniaxial tensions along armchair and zigzag directions have been investigated comparatively using first-principles calculations. First, we have calculated the dependences of atomic structures (bond length, interlayer distance, and buckling height) of BLG and BLS on strain under three types of tensions. There exists the weak Van der Waals interaction between two layers of BLG and the interlayer distance is not variable with strain for three types of tensions. However, the interlayer of BLS is the covalent bond interaction, and the distance decreases with the increasing strain for three types of tensions. The continuum description of elastic response is formulated by expanding the elastic strain energy density in a Taylor series in strain truncated after the third-order term. The in-plane second- and third-order elastic constants of BLG and BLS have been obtained by fitting to the strain energy density versus Lagrangian strain relationships. The results show the in-plane stiffnesses of BLG and BLS become slightly larger than those of their single layer counterparts. In spite of the interlayer Si-Si covalent bond between two layers of BLS, its stiffness is still much less than BLG and SLG. Poisson's ratios of BLG and BLS basically maintain unchanged compared to their single layer counterparts.

84913554154	Two-photon emission in coupled biexciton quantum dot-cavity system: Phonon-assisted model	We theoretically analyze the steady state emission spectrum and transient temporal dynamics in a coupled biexciton quantum dot (QD)-cavity system. For steady state, a phonon-assisted biexciton-exciton cascade model under continuous wave (CW) excitation is presented to explain the asymmetric QD-cavity emission spectrum intensities (intensities of cavity, exciton, and biexciton emission peak) in off-resonance condition. Results demonstrate that the electron-phonon process is crucial to the asymmetry of emission spectrum intensity. Moreover the transient characteristics of the biexciton-exciton cascade system under pulse excitation show abundant nonlinear temporal dynamic behaviors, including complicated oscillations which are caused by the four-level structure of QD model. We also reveal that under off-resonance condition the cavity outputs are slightly reduced due to the electron-phonon interaction.
