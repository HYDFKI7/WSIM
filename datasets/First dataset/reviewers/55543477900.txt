84940349976	Glucomannan-mediated facile synthesis of gold nanoparticles for catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol	A facile one-pot approach for synthesis of gold nanoparticles with narrow size distribution and good stability was presented by reducing chloroauric acid with a polysaccharide, konjac glucomannan (KGM) in alkaline solution, which is green and economically viable. Here, KGM served both as reducing agent and stabilizer. The effects of KGM on the formation and stabilization of as-synthesized gold nanoparticles were studied systematically by a combination of UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, the gold nanoparticles exhibited a notable catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. © 2014 Gao et al.; licensee Springer.

21644438838	A simplified kinetic model for enzymatic hydrolysis of bovine serum albumin	On the basis of the mechanism of protein enzymatic hydrolysis, the hydrolysates were combined into several lumps according to their molecular mass. The reaction of lumps was described with a simplified kinetic equation. Then the kinetic model for bovine serum albumin tryptic hydrolysis reaction was established. The rate constant of each reaction was estimated by a nonlinear regression rule in two steps. The ability of prediction and extrapolation of the simplified kinetic model and the good quality of the obtained rate coefficients was tested by comparing the computed values with the experimental values.

0030460064	Prediction of the secondary structure content of globular proteins based on structural classes	The prediction of the secondary structure content (α-helix and β- strand content) of a globular protein may play an important complementary role in the prediction of the protein's structure. We propose a new prediction algorithm based on Chou's database [Chou (1995), Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 21, 319]. The new algorithm is an improved multiple linear regression method, taking the nonlinear and coupling terms of the frequencies of different amino acids into account. The prediction is also based on the structural classes of proteins. A resubstitution examination for the algorithm shows that the average errors are 0.040 and 0.033 for the prediction of α-helix content and β-strand content, respectively. The examination of cross-validation, the jackknife analysis, shows that the average errors are 0.051 and 0.044 for the prediction of α-helix content and β-strand content, respectively. Both examinations indicate the self- consistency and the extrapolative effectiveness of the new algorithm. Compared with the other methods available currently, our method has the merits of simplicity and convenience for use, as well as a high prediction accuracy. By incorporating the prediction of the structural classes, the only input of our method is the amino acid composition of the protein to be predicted.

0031778451	Effect of electrostatic interaction on retention behavior of proteins in HPSEC	The retention behavior of nine proteins was experimentally detected by using high performance size exclusion chromatography (SEC). At low ionic strength of mobile phase, the retention behavior of proteins is dependent of not only size exclusion but also electrostatic interaction. At the same pH value of mobile phase as the isoelectric point of a protein, the protein molecule is neutral. When the pH value of mobile phase is higher than the isoelectric point of a protein, the protein molecule carries a negative charge, resulting in size exclusion and ionic exclusion occuring together. Otherwise, ionic adsorption dominates in electrostatic interaction. At middle ionic strength of mobile phase, the retention behavior is governed by size exclusion mechanism. The experimental result indicated that in order to achieve ideal size exclusion the elution conditions for proteins should be ionic strength 0.1 ~ 0.3 M and pH value near its isoelectric point. A linear 'calibration curve' was correlated by eight proteins except hemoglobin, in which the related coefficient was as high as 0.9977.

0031924352	Prediction of the secondary structure contents of globular proteins based on three structural classes	The prediction of the secondary structural contents (those of α-helix and β-strand) of a globular protein is of great use in the prediction of protein structure. In this paper, a new prediction algorithm has been proposed based on Chou's database [Chou (1995), Proteins 21, 319-344]. The new algorithm is an improved multiple linear regression method, taking into account the nonlinear and coupling terms of the frequencies of different amino acids and the length of the protein. The prediction is also based on the structural classes of proteins, but instead of four classes, only three classes are considered, the α class, β class, and the mixed α+β and α/β class or simply the αβ class. Thus the ambiguity that usually occurs between α+β proteins and α/β proteins is eliminated. A resubstitution examination for the algorithm shows that the average absolute errors are 0.040 and 0.035 for the prediction of α-helix content and β-strand content, respectively. An examination of cross-validation, the jackknife analysis, shows that the average absolute errors are 0.051 and 0.045 for the prediction of α-helix content and β-strand content, respectively. Both examinations indicate the self-consistency and the extrapolating effectiveness of the new algorithm. Compared with other methods, ours has the merits of simplicity and convenience for use, as well as high prediction accuracy. By incorporating the prediction of the structural classes, the only input of our method is the amino acid composition and the length of the protein to be predicted.

24044501032	Monte Carlo simulation of radical initiated gelation	The complex structure of polymer gels was studied with dynamic Monte Carlo simulation based on the principle of gelation theory in a 2D network with periodic condition. The effect of polymerized monomer's (monomers of polymer) movement on the structure of polymer gels was studied. Simulation results indicated that the threshold concentration of gelation and the fractal dimension of polymer gels could be considerably decreased compared with the kinetic gelation model and the DLA model when polymerized monomers were allowed to move, especially when the total monomer concentration is low. The pore size distribution was acquired by moving bubble method. It was found that the ratio of big pores in our gel network was higher than that based on the Ogston's model. That indicates the simulated gels was of great inhomogeneity.

25444474463	The quantitative analysis of reactive distillation products from transesterification of phenol with dimethyl carbonate	A gas chromatographic method, with an OV-101 capillary column, was established for analyzing the products and the distillates from the transesterificatin of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with phenol quantitatively. The products were analyzed simultaneously using ethyl benzoate (EB) as internal standard. A good linear relationship of the mass percent of DMC, diphenyl carbonate (DPC) and anisole versus the peak area ratio of DMC to EB, DPC to EB as well as anisole to EB was observed. The regression equation of DMC, DPC and anisole were Y = 48.92X + 0.69, Y = 32.82X - 1.75, and Y = 13. 17X + 0.07 with the correlation coefficient of 0.9976, 0.9972 and 0.9978, respectively. The distillates of DMC and methanol were quantified using acetone as the internal standard. The linear regression equations of DMC and methanol were Y = 150.57X + 0.37 and Y = 71.20X - 0.07 with the correlation coefficient of 0.9985 and 0.9996 respectively. The precision experiments showed that the relative standard deviations of the analytes were less than 2.0% (n = 4). According to the results of the accuracy experiments, the internal standard method was exact with the relative standard deviation of the analytes ranging from 0.3% to 1.5%.

It was shown that the deactivation of lipase had a great influence on the reaction kinetics. Based on whether the enzyme deactivation and influences of both product and substrate on enzyme stability were included or not, four different kinetic models were established. The simulating results demonstrated that the kinetic model, which including product inhibition, enzyme deactivation and the improvements of lipase stability by both product and substrate, fit the experimental data best with an overall relative error of 4.68%. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

29544443449	Development and optimization of a method for analysis of the products from the transesterification of dimethyl carbonate and phenol	A high-purity sample of methyl phenyl carbonate (MPC) was obtained by developing a novel reaction route followed by a series of separation and purification procedures. Identification and quantification of the MPC sample (98.32%) was performed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Karl Fisher titration. The laboratory-prepared MPC was then used as a standard to optimize quantitative analysis of the products synthesized by transesterification of dimethyl carbonate and phenol. The advantage of the improved method was that MPC can be quantified directly rather than being calculated by subtracting the yield of diphenyl carbonate (DPC) and by-product anisole from the conversion of dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The resulting method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limit, and quantification limit. With the improved method, simultaneous accurate quantification of DMC, MPC, DPC, phenol, and anisole in the transesterification products can be achieved. This enables evaluation of the activity and selectivity of different catalysts and control of the reaction processes.

33644642236	Neural network model for backflushing in enzymatic membrane reactor	In the enzymatic membrane reactor for separating casein hydrolysate, backflushing technology has been used to decrease the fouling of the membrane. Predication of the backflushing efficiency poses a complex non-linear problem as the system integrates enzymatic hydrolysis, membrane separation and periodic backflushing together. In this paper an alternative artificial neural network approach is developed to predict the backflushing efficiency as a function of duration and interval. A contour plot of backflushing performance is presented to model these effects, and the backflushing conditions have been optimized as duration of 10 s and interval of 10 min using this neural network. Also, simple neural networks are established to predict the time evolution of flux before and after backflushing. The results predicted by the models are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the average deviations for all the cases are well within ±5%. The neural network approach is found to be capable of modeling the backflushing with confidence.

33646937432	Continuous preparation of casein phosphopeptides by integration of enzymatic hydrolysis and membrane separation	Casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) were continuously prepared by coupling of enzymatic hydrolysis and membrane separation. In order to prepare target active peptides with high purity and good yield, operating stability of trypsin and membrane rejection of casein were studied respectively. The influences of operating parameters, including substrate mass concentration, enzyme mass concentration, reaction volume and permeation flux, on the reaction conversion and reactor capacity were investigated. The continuous hydrolysis system was also analyzed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and a mathematical model was established to describe the relationship between reaction conversion and modified space-time. The characteristic of hydrolysis process in a CSTR/UF was compared with BSTR. The results show that taking advantage of the integrated reaction-separation technique, the productivity or utilization efficiency of enzyme can be increased greatly, and the product is purified simultaneously. Therefore, enzymatic membrane reactor provided a more efficient way to prepare active peptides.

33748947715	Quantitative analysis of complex casein hydrolysates based on chromatography and membrane	The enzymatic hydrolysates of casein are so complex that there is no effective method to do quantitative analysis. The common techniques, such as high performance chromatography and SDS-PAGE, can only carry out qualitative analysis. On the basis of membrane separation and high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), standard peptides with different molecular mass range were prepared, and the linear relationships between mass concentration of the standard peptides and the ultraviolet absorption of corresponding peak areas were established. Consequently, mass concentration of the different hydrolysates at different reaction times could be accurately calculated. The combination of chromatography and membrane separation is of great importance to the quantitative analysis of the complex hydrolysates, which can also be applied to the other macromolecular systems, such as carbohydrates. © Higher Education Press 2006.

33748576905	Flow rate and concentration-dependent effects of molecular dynamics on elution behaviors of flexible polymers in gel permeation chromatography: A multi-angle laser light scattering study	Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) provides a tool to simultaneously measure the elution behavior and molecular shape of flexible polymers in their dependence on column flow rate and solute concentration. As flow rate was increased, the radius of gyration ( R g ) of flexible polymers first decreased a little and then increased gradually. In all cases, the values of R g , the hydrodynamic radius ( R h ), and ( R g / R h ) decreased as the concentration increased. As a result, flow-induced molecular stretch and concentration-induced molecular shrinking for flexible polymers in the gel pores were deduced from the size-related elution behaviors and tested by light scattering. In addition, the flow rate and concentration-dependent effect of elution behavior parameters such as the elution volume ( V e ), the weight-averaged molecular weight ( M w ), and polydispersity index (PI) were interpreted in terms of molecular deformation and orientations of flexible polymers.

33749459009	Molecular weight distribution and kinetic model for enzymatic hydrolysis of water-soluble polysaccharides	Using the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and the intrinsic viscosity measurement, the changes in molecular weight of a water-soluble polysaccharide undergoing enzymatic hydrolysis were studied, and the enzymatic hydrolysis of the konjac glucomannan (KGM) solutions with β-mannanase was chosen as the investigated object to conduct this study. During the degradation process, the molecular weight of the enzymatic products decreases with reaction time, while the molecular weight distribution (MWD) broadens at first and then becomes narrow. According to the reaction mechanism, there are four factors which could cause the above variations of MWD: the sparsely inlaid distribution of enzyme molecules in KGM solutions, the maldistribution of mannose and glucose units on the KGM backbone, the different pathways for enzymatic cleavage of KGM and the binding pattern between enzyme and KGM. In addition, based on the Michaelis-Menton equation and the changes in the weight-average molecular weight of hydrolystates, a kinetic model was established to simulate the hydrolysis process, and it was demonstrated in good agreement with the experimental results. The inverse relationship between the reaction rate constant k and the concentration of polymer suggests that, for frequently-used polysaccharide concentration, the enzymatic hydrolysis is a zero-order reaction.

34147094696	Identification and release kinetics of peptides from the process of peptic hydrolysis of bovine hemoglobin by LC-ESI-MS/MS	Bovine hemoglobin was hydrolyzed with pepsin in a batch stirred tank reactor; the resulting peptides were identified, in a time dependent and comprehensive manner, using reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) by means of database searching. Peptic digestion of bovine hemoglobin yields more hydrophobic peptides at a low degree of hydrolysis, and more hydrophilic peptides at a later stage of hydrolysis. The release kinetics of the bioactive peptides was also followed based on the RP-HPLC profiles. In addition, the behavior of peptic digestion of hemoglobin α and β chains was compared in terms of profiling the identified peptides. Thirty-two peptides were recovered by a process of hydrolysis from the α chain of the peptide; whereas the corresponding result for the β chain was 19 peptides with around 67% sequence coverage. The main factor responsible for non-peptic susceptibility of the central region of the β chain was their relatively higher hydrophilicity. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The modification conditions, such as the ratio of the reagents (acrylic acid: catalyst=1:0.05), temperature (30°C) and reaction time (60 min), were optimized based on the contact angle measurements. The grafting of carboxyl group to the membrane surface was confirmed by IR spectrum and wettability analysis, and no degradation of the modified membrane skin or framework was observed with scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results of filtrating bovine serum albumin solutions indicated that the property of resisting protein adsorption on the membrane surface for the modified membrane was much better than that for unmodified membrane. In the process of separating casein hydrolysates, the advantages of modified membrane were also shown by comparing the permeate flux and molecular mass distribution with those of unmodified membrane.

34547580178	Time-dependent nature in peptic hydrolysis of native bovine hemoglobin	Native bovine hemoglobin was digested with pepsin at pH 4.5 in a batched stirred tank reactor. The resulting peptides in the time-course samples were separated and identified by RP-HPLC coupled with ESI-MS/MS. The secondary structure of bovine hemoglobin was not significantly changed after acid-treatment at pH 4.5 based on far-UV circular dichroism spectra. The α-helix contents of peptic hydrolysates decreased gradually with time according to 'one-by-one' mechanism. MS/MS analysis enabled unambiguous identification of 31 and 15 peptides released respectively from α-chain and β-chain, which resulted in their sequence coverage of 100 and 76%. The discrimination of peptic susceptibility between different protein areas was compared in terms of the time-dependent release of peptides. At first, peptic cleavage sites were concentrated around N- and C-terminal regions of α-chain and β-chain. Later, pepsin hydrolyzed the middle part of α-chain from N- to C-terminal, while little enzymatic cleavage occurred in the center region of β-chain due mainly to their high hydrophilic nature. The release kinetics of peptides was discussed in relation to the hydrophobicity of amino acid residues of polypeptide chains. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

35448990075	Pancreatic hydrolysis of bovine casein: Changes in the aggregate size and molecular weight distribution	The effect of pancreatic hydrolysis on the aggregate size and molecular weight distribution (MWD) of bovine casein was investigated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), coupled with multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The concentrations of both casein aggregates and monomers decreased as the reaction proceeded and almost disappeared after a 10 min hydrolysis. The ratio of aggregates to monomers was maintained at 1:(2-2.5) during the initial 10 min hydrolysis, which shows that the caseins in the solution are in a dynamic equilibrium system, between aggregates and monomers. Upon limited hydrolysis, casein aggregates displayed a continuous growth in their sizes and molecular weights, together with a decrease in the intermolecular repulsion. This result was further supported by on-line DLS measurements, which showed the increase in the hydrodynamic radii and the decrease in light scattering intensities of casein hydrolysates. Moreover, the release kinetics of peptide fractions with different molecular weights were also followed. It was suggested that the increase in the hydrophobic attraction and the reduction in the protein repulsion might promote casein aggregation, during the limited pancreatic hydrolysis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0032874901	Solvation energy and thermal stability of hydrophilization-modified α- chymotrypsin	As reported in the literature [Mozhaev et al. (1988), Eur. J. Biochem. 173, 147-154], when a series of modifiers, especially the cyclic anhydrides of pyromellitic and mellitic acids, are introduced into each lysine located in the α-chymotrypsin (CT) surface, a substantial hydrophilization of the enzyme surface can occur and remarkable stabilization effects of modified enzymes can be obtained. In this paper, four models are applied to calculate the solvation energy of native and the modified CT based on their tertiary structures, which can be built by the CVFF force field. Analyzing the relationship between the solvation energy and the thermal stability in detail, we find that the results of three solvation energy models (Ooi model, WE-1 model, and WE-2 model) can be used to illustrate the relative stability among these enzymes qualitatively. The present study should be of practical value as well as of some theoretical interest.

0033871658	Progress of process development of enzymatic reactions in reversed micelles	Enzymatic reactions in reversed micelles were received much attention for its combination of the advantages of enzymatic reactions in aqueous solution and in organic solvent. One important problem which restricts the application of this technique was the reuse of the enzyme. Originally the enzyme was extracted from the reversed micelles by aqueous solution. The remaining of the enzyme activity was low because of the severe conditions. The enzyme can also be reused by phase separation caused by changes in the temperature. This method was manageable, but the remaining of the enzyme activity was also low. The continuous enzymatic reactions in reversed micelles became feasible by using continuous-flow two-phase centrifugal reactor. But the conversion in the reactor was limited by the lower transfer rate of substrate and product. Membrane reactor was mostly studied and was looked as the most promising reactor for enzymatic reaction in reversed micelles. The methods of enzyme reuse of enzymatic reactions in reversed micelles were introduced in this article. The progress of process development of enzymatic reactions in reversed micelles was reviewed.

The MPEG- modified Ti was more stable against temperature than the native form, the larger molecular mass moiety of MPEG showing higher thermostabillty. To investigate the mechanism of thermal inactivation, a new kinetic model, which has the ability of taking the thermal denaturation and autolysis effects of the proteases into account, has been used to analyze the thermal inactivation process of the native and modified Ti in detail. The kinetic analysis showed that the stabilization effect caused by MPEG modification was the result of a decrease in autolysis rate and a decrease in the rate of thermal denaturation. In addition, the possible mechanism of reduced autolysis and lower thermal denaturation rate were also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Three additives (sucrose, chitosan and sorbitol) showed good performance to improve the activity of β-mannanase when their concentrations were kept at 2 g/L. The optimal combination additive (sucrose:chitosan:sorbitol is 1:2:2) was obtained using the orthogonal experimental design. These additives (sucrose, chitosan, glycerol, sorbitol and combination additive) may increase the optimal reaction temperature from 50°C to about 60°C due to their good protection effect. The thermal inactivation curves of β-mannanase accorded with the rules of the first order reaction at 65°C and corresponding kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Meanwhile, the protective mechanism of stabilizing additives against inactivation of enzyme was also discussed.

41549101433	In vitro evaluations of konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum mixture as the sustained release material of matrix tablet	The objective of the present investigations was to develop sustained release matrix tablets with a mixture of the polysaccharides, konjac glucomannan (KGM) and xanthan gum (XG), as the sustained release material. A simple enzymatic procedure was selected to mimic the environment of colon in vitro assessments. The concentration of β-mannanase solution in mimic colon media was determined by comparing the hydrolytic ability of the mimic colon solution with that of 4% (w/v) rat cecal content media. In vitro, investigations were carried out to characterize the drug release process. The model drug cimetidine released from polysaccharides gel layer of matrix tablets over 10 h. It was shown that the synergistic interaction between konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum in the gel phase affects on the drug diffusion, which can effectively retard the drug release from the matrix tablets. Further research on the mixed polysaccharides indicated that there was a strong synergistic interaction between KGM and XG in solution and in the gel phase. The experimental results predicted that the polysaccharide mixtures of konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum has a good potential to be applied to sustained release drug delivery systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

59249090167	Fractionation of lignocellulose by formic acid pretreatment	Based on corn cobs, a pretreatment process in modest conditions (atmospheric pressure and moderate reaction temperature) was designed to fractionate lignocellulose by using formic acid. During the pretreatment, the hemicellulose was hydrolyzed quickly and most of the lignin was dissolved in the solution, but the cellulose almost could not be hydrolyzed. After solid-liquid separation and reagent recycling, corn cobs were separated into cellulose, hemicellulose hydrolysates and lignin. The effects of reaction temperature, pretreatment time and concentration of formic acid on the separated components and the obtained hydrolysates (soluble sugars) during the fractionation were studied. The HPLC results showed that the masses of soluble sugars and lignin increased quickly at first, and then changed slowly. The effect of temperature from 50 to 75°C was not obvious. By considering efficiency and cost, the optimal operating conditions were chosen as: reaction temperature 60°C, reaction time 3 h, and concentration of formic acid 88%(ω). Under the conditions the recovery rates of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin could reach 91.4%, 88.5% and 63.7%, respectively.

80052891175	Enhancement of activity of cross-linked enzyme aggregates by a sugar-assisted precipitation strategy: Technical development and molecular mechanism	The precipitation of enzyme causes the major activity loss in the conventional protocol for CLEAs preparation. Herein, a sugar-assisted strategy was developed to minimize the activity loss in the step of enzyme precipitation by adding sugar as the stabilizer, which contributed to improve the activity yield of resulting CLEAs. Penicillin G acylase (PGA) was employed as a model enzyme. The effects of glucose, sucrose and trehalose on the activity yields of CLEAs were investigated. The highest activity was obtained in the case of adding trehalose. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the polar microenvironment and the secondary structure of native enzyme were preserved to some extent when PGA was prepared as sugar-assisted CLEAs, resulting in PGA's higher activity than sugar-free CLEAs. Scanning electron microscope revealed the different inner morphologies, and the kinetic studies showed the higher affinity and resist-inhibition capacity of sugar-assisted CLEAs. Furthermore, stability experiments demonstrated that CLEAs prepared in sugar-assisted strategy remained higher thermal stability when it was incubated at high temperature. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84866640341	Physicochemical strategies for inhibition of amyloid fibril formation: An overview of recent advances	Protein aggregation and amyloid fibrillation can lead to several serious human diseases and protein drug ineffectiveness. The complexity and dynamics of protein folding present unique challenges for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in protein aggregation and designing effective amyloid inhibitors. Continuous development of creative approaches to identify an ultimate solution for controlling protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals and clinical pathology is clearly required. This review describes and discusses the most recent advances on the physicochemical strategies for inhibiting protein aggregation and amyloid fibrillation, with emphasis on giving a brief overview of creative approaches and chemistries used. Physical strategies for inhibiting amyloid fibril formation, including high hydrostatic pressure, low temperature, and laser irradiation, are critically evaluated. Recent advances in chemical strategies including small molecules, metal chelators, and nanomaterials, as well as in the use of biomolecules (peptide, protein, nucleic acid, and saccharide) as amyloid inhibitors, are also highlighted. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

84877757548	Intensive protein digestion using cross-linked trypsin aggregates in proteomics analysis	In this study, cross-linked enzyme aggregates of tissue-culture-grade trypsin (CLEAs-T) were prepared and introduced to the proteomics analysis instead of the expensive proteomics-grade trypsin, which benefits from the protein purification during the preparation of the CLEAs. Bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, bovine hemoglobin, and α-casein were used as model proteins, and three intensive strategies (high-enzyme-concentration, high-temperature, and ultrasound-assisted digestion) were applied to the rapid and efficient digestion of model proteins by CLEAs-T. The peptide fragments were then identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, which revealed the higher sequence coverage and sharply reduced digestion time of these strategies compared with the conventional in-solution 12 h digestion method. Morphology studies demonstrated that the excellent performance of CLEAs-T in proteomics analysis came from the "scaffoldlike" supermolecular structure, which provided a high resistance to the autolysis and denaturation of trypsin under high-enzyme-concentration, high-temperature, and ultrasound-assisted digestion. Easy to swallow: Cross-linked enzyme aggregates of tissue-culture-grade trypsin (CLEAs-T) were prepared and introduced to the protein-digestion process in proteomics analysis (see figure). High-analysis throughput was obtained by using CLEAs-T with intensive digestion strategies, such as high enzyme concentration, high temperature, and ultrasound-assisted. The excellent performance of CLEAs-T is attributed to their unique "scaffoldlike" structure. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

50149115630	Reaction-diffusion kinetics for enzymatic hydrolysis of konjac glucomannan	Enzymatic hydrolysis of konjac glucomannan (KGM) by β-mannanase was studied at constant mass ratio of enzyme to substrate to investigate the reaction-diffusion mechanism. By using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), the changes in molecular weight distribution of KGM were followed during the process of hydrolysis. When the ratio of enzyme to substrate was constant, the changes in molecular weight at different KGM concentrations were remarkably different, which showed that the reaction depended on the diffusion of enzyme. The changes in molecular weight showed a zero-order kinetics. Integrating the empirical reaction kinetics and diffusion characteristics, a reaction-diffusion model was established from a series of chromatographic results. But the degradation rate was shown to be greatly affected by the diffusion of enzyme as well as the concentration of substrate. This equation of reaction kinetics indicated the importance of diffusion, and the experimental data can be well predicted at semi dilute concentrations of KGM.

53149113777	Solvation energy and thermal stability of hydrophilizationmodified oc-chymotrypsin	As reported in the literature [Mozhaev et al. (1988), Eur. J. Biochem. 173, 147-154], when a series of modifiers, especially the cyclic anhydrides of pyromellitic and mellitic acids, are introduced into each lysine located in the α-chymotrypsin (CT) surface, a substantial hydrophilization of the enzyme surface can occur and remarkable stabilization effects of modified enzymes can be obtained. In this paper, four models are applied to calculate the solvation energy of native and the modified CT based on their tertiary structures, which can be built by the CVFF force field. Analyzing the relationship between the solvation energy and the thermal stability in detail, we find that the results of three solvation energy models (Ooi model, WE-1 model, and WE-2 model) can be used to illustrate the relative stability among these enzymes qualitatively. The present study should be of practical value as well as of some theoretical interest. © 1999 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

53349102670	Prediction of the secondary structure content of globular proteins based on structural classes	The prediction of the secondary structure content (α-helix and β-strand content) of a globular protein may play an important complementary role in the prediction of the protein's structure. We propose a new prediction algorithm based on Chou's database [Chou (1995), Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 21, 319]. The new algorithm is an improved multiple linear regression method, taking the nonlinear and coupling terms of the frequencies of different amino acids into account. The prediction is also based on the structural classes of proteins. A resubstitution examination for the algorithm shows that the average errors are 0.040 and 0.033 for the prediction of a-helix content and β-strand content, respectively. The examination of cross-validation, the jackknife analysis, shows that the average errors are 0.051 and 0.044 for the prediction of α-helix content and β-strand content, respectively. Both examinations indicate the self-consistency and the extrapolative effectiveness of the new algorithm. Compared with the other methods available currently, our method has the merits of simplicity and convenience for use, as well as a high prediction accuracy. By incorporating the prediction of the structural classes, the only input of our method is the amino acid composition of the protein to be predicted. © 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

53549110238	Process of multi-enzyme assisted extraction of Danshensu from Salvia mitiorrhiza	Objective: To study the effect of enzyme in the extraction of Salvia mitiorrhiza and the influence of different factors on enzymatic extraction. Methods: Monofactorial experiments were employed to examine the effects of the substrate size, enzyme consumption, ratio of solid to liquid, 1st enzymatic extraction time, and 2nd water extraction time on the extraction of S. mitiorrhiza. Ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry was used to analyze the results and Danshensu extraction rate was regarded as standard. Results: The data showed that the highest Danshensu extraction rate (84.61%) could be achieved at: t= 50 °C, pH = 4.6, granularity = 20 - 35 meshes, E-S = 1: 200, 1st enzymatic extraction time = 80 min, S-L = 1: 15, 2nd water extraction time = 40 min S-L = 1:9. Conclusion: This process could be conducted under mild conditions and in relatively simple equipment, which could help reduce energy cost, alleviate gelatinization, and lower the possibility of product oxidation, and thus it is considerably feasible.

56049086601	Enhancing thermostability of β-mannanase by protective additives	The effects of some sugars (glucose, mannose, fructose, sucrose and chitosan) and polyols (glycol, glycerol and sorbitol) as protective additive on the thermostability of β-mannanase were studied. The optimal reaction temperatures of β-mannanase and the thermodynamics and the deactivation kinetics with or without additives were also investigated. The experimental results show that sucrose, chitosan and sorbitol could apparently improve the thermal stability of β-mannanase when their concentration was kept at 2 g/L. The optimal combination additive proportion was sucrose: chitosan: sorbitol = 1: 2: 2 (molar ratio) using the orthogonal experimental design. The sucrose, chitosan, glycerol, sorbitol and the combination additive might increase the optimal reaction temperature from 50°C to about 60°C due to their good protection effect. The thermal deactivationcurves of β-mannanase accorded with the kinetic rules of first order reaction, and the corresponding kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Meanwhile, the protective mechanism of the additives against deactivation of enzyme was also discussed. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.

Insights into conformational changes and formation processes during amyloid fibrillation are essential for the clinical diagnosis and drug discovery. To study the changes in secondary, tertiary, quaternary structures, and the alteration in the collective vibrational mode density of states during the amyloid fibrillation, bovine insulin in 20% acetic acid was incubated at 60 °C, and its multi-level structures were followed by various biophysical techniques, including circular dichroism (CD), thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT), dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron microscopy, and terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy. The experimental data demonstrated a transformation of α-helix into β-sheet starting at 26 h. This was followed by the aggregation of insulin, as shown by ThT binding, with a transition midpoint at 41 h, and by the bulk formation of mature aggregates after about 71 h. THz is a quick and non-invasive technique, which has the advantage of allowing the study of the conformational state of biomolecules and tissues. We first applied THz spectroscopy to study the amyloid fibrillation. At the terahertz frequency range of 0.2-2.0 THz, there was an apparent increase in both the absorbance and refractive index in THz spectra. Thus, THz is expected to provide a new way of looking into amyloid fibrillation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77649231742	Fractionating lignocellulose by formic acid: Characterization of major components	Treatment of corn (Zea mays L.) cob under mild reaction conditions (60 °C and atmospheric pressure) in 88% formic acid was an effective method for separating cellulose from hemicellulose and lignin components in lignocellulose. Most of the hemicellulose degradation and lignin removal occurred within the first 90 min. After 6 h treatment, the decomposition of hemicellulose and the recovery of lignin were over 85% and 70%, respectively. Multi-level structures of lignin and solid residues were further characterized by FTIR, XRD, TG/DTG, SEM and SEC. Peaks attributable to lignin or hemicellulose disappeared in FTIR spectra, indicating complete removal of these two components. The remaining solid residues had a higher crystalline index. The major pyrolysis temperature of corncob was increased after formic acid treatment; the molecular weight (MW) of cellulose in solid residues was higher than that in intact cobs, whereas the hemicellulose remaining in the pulp had a lower MW than the original.

77949292885	Enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of Lignocellulose by optimizing enzyme complexes	To enhance the conversion of the cellulose and hemicellulose, the corncob pretreated by aqueous ammonia soaking was hydrolyzed by enzyme complexes. The saturation limit for cellulase (Spezyme CP) was determined as 15 mg protein/g glucan (50 filter paper unit (FPU)/g glucan). The accessory enzymes (β-glucosidase, xylanase, and pectinase) were supplemented to hydrolyze cellobiose (cellulase-inhibiting product), hemicellulose, and pectin (the component covering the fiber surfaces), respectively. It was found that β-glucosidase (Novozyme 188) loading of 1.45 mg protein/g glucan [30 cellobiase units (CBU)/g glucan] was enough to eliminate the cellobiose inhibitor, and 2.9 mg protein/g glucan (60 CBU/g glucan) was the saturation limit. The supplementation of xylanase and pectinase can increase the conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose significantly. The yields of glucose and xylose enhanced with the increasing enzyme loading, but the increasing trend became low at high loading. Compared with xylanase, pectinase was more effective to promote the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. The supplementation of pectinase with 0.12 mg protein/g glucan could increase the yields of glucose and xylose by 7.5% and 29.3%, respectively. © 2009 Humana Press.

An ethanol concentration as high as 69.2 g/L was achieved with 19% dry matter (DM) using batch SSF, resulting in an 81.2% overall ethanol yield. A fed-batch process using a high solid concentration was also investigated. Fresh substrate was pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid-sodium hydroxide, and then added at different amounts during the first 24 h, to yield a final dry matter content of 25% (w/v). SSF conditions with cellulose loading of 22.8 FPU/g glucan, dry yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) loading of 5 g/L and substrate supplementation every 4 h yielded the highest ethanol concentration of 84.7 g/L after 96 h.

The result shows that as mass fraction of Tween 80 and enzyme loading increase, the cellulase recovery first increases and then decreases gradually. The cellulase recovery increases gradually with the increasing of substrate mass fraction. The optimum process conditions are as follows: mass fraction of Tween 80 is 0.23%, enzyme loading (based on glucan) is 40 FPU/g, the mass fraction of substrate is 3.6%. Under such conditions, the recovery rate of cellulase is 83.0%. This research provides a good solution to reduce the cellulase cost.

77950908335	Understanding the key factors for enzymatic conversion of pretreated lignocellulose by partial least square analysis	The relationship between the physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic substrates and enzyme digestion is still not well known. After different pretreatments, cellulase hydrolysis and measurements of physicochemical characteristics by column solute exclusion, particle size analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance were performed in this study. Partial least squares was then applied to seek the key factors limiting the rate and extent of cellulose digestion. According to the PLS results, the most important factor for cellulose digestion was accessible interior surface area, followed by delignification and the destruction of the hydrogen bonds. The cellulose digestion at 2 and 24 hr were improved with the increased accessibility of interior surface area to the reporter molecules of 5.1-nm diameter. Removal of lignin and breaking of hydrogen bonds were also found to significantly promote cellulose conversion. Other properties, including the breakdown of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, cellulose crystallinity, and hemicellulose content, had less effect on the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Diffusion of cimetidine from compression coated tablets was investigated by release experiment in Vitro. 0.22U/mL β-mannanase was applied in the mimic colon solution. The structure of the mixture polysaccharide was studied by an atomic force microscope (AFM). The experimental results indicate that a KGM70 tablet with a 0.4 g coat is of good design, due to a less than 5% drug loss in the mimic upper gastrointestinal solution by the synergistic interaction between XG and KGM, and due to about 50% cumulative release in the mimic colon solution by degradation after 24 hours. The release mechanism and model are discussed based on different periods of drug release including the delay of the drug, the constant release without an enzyme and the delay of degradation. Under hydrolysis by β-mannanase, drug release from the tablet with KGM coat shows an exponential increase, while that from the dosage with the mixture polysaccharide coat is an approximately zero-order process in which the constant release rate relates to the release velocity of a non-degraded system, the content of KGM within the coat and the average molecular weight ratio of KGM to XG. It was found that XG was the framework of the polysaccharide mixtures by AFM, which is similar to the analysis results from experiments on drug release. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

CLEAs-MSG was obtained from simple adsorption, precipitation and one-step-cross-linking. CLEAs-MSG was characterized by stable structure that did not leak out enzyme from the macropores because of covalent bonding between CLEAs and MSG. The optimal temperature of papain CLEAs in MSG was 40-90 °C and the optimal pH was 7.0, which were improved compared to free papain and CLEAs. The CLEAs-MSG also enhanced the storage stability and thermal stability. Moreover, the CLEAs-MSG exhibited good reusability due to its suitable size and active properties.

In this paper, papain-CLEAs were prepared and the effects of precipitation and cross-linking on CLEAs activity were investigated. It is shown that the highest activity of papain-CLEAs were obtained when using pure ethanol as precipitant, 40% glutaraldehyde as cross-linker and cross-linking at 4°C for 16 h. Moreover, the optimal catalytic conditions and operational stabilities of papain-CLEAs were characterized. Papain-CLEAs shifted the optimal pH from 7.0 to 6.0 and broaden the optimal temperature to the range of 50-80°C. Papain-CLEAs also enhanced thermal and storage stabilities compared with free enzyme. It is indicated from the morphology that these improved performances resulted from the high surface area and multi-points covalent cross-linking structure of every single papain-CLEAs. These improved characters show practical advantages of papain-CLEAs in biocatalysis.

Structure, crystallinity and morphology of the IL-treated Avicel were also investigated as follows: the hydrogen bonding, detected by FTIR, decreased; the crystallinity, monitored by XRD, changed significantly from crystalline to amorphous pattern; the morphology, examined by SEM, demonstrated that the orderly structure was destroyed remarkably with some pores and holes appearing in the cellulose substrates. These changes of Avicel pretreated with [BMIM]Cl led to the increase of sugar conversion during cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis.

Compared with conventional batch reactor (CBR), cellulose conversion increased by 5% in a MBR because of the removal of glucose and cellobiose inhibitors. More than 15% increment in cellulose conversion was obtained using fed-MBR, and the reaction rate improved significantly. Enzyme utilization efficiency in a fed-batch MBR were 1.94-fold of CBR and 1.34-fold of fed-CBR for corn stover pretreated by soaking in aqueous ammonia and 3.31-fold of CBR and 1.32-fold of fed-CBR for corn stover pretreated by diluted sulfuric acid-sodium hydroxide. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79955817856	Hierarchical, interface-induced self-assembly of diphenylalanine: Formation of peptide nanofibers and microvesicles	To gain insight into the hierarchical self-assembly of peptides and the surface effect on assembly formation, an aromatic peptide of diphenylalanine (FF) was used in this study as the model peptide. We found that the diphenylalanine peptide could self-assemble into a core-branched nanostructure through non-covalent interactions in aqueous solution. The pre-assemblies further assembled into nanofibers and microvesicles on the glass surface and microporous membrane, respectively, showing a significant dependence on surface characteristics. The structural and morphological differences between nanofibers and microvesicles were investigated directly using several spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. Our results revealed a hierarchical and interface-induced assembly behavior of diphenylalanine peptide. The novel strategy based on the surface effect allows one to controllably fabricate various peptide-based nanostructures. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

0035816515	Stabilization mechanism of MPEG modified trypsin based on thermal inactivation kinetic analysis and molecular modeling computation	Thermal inactivation kinetic analysis and molecular modeling computation were jointly utilized to illuminate the detailed stabilization mechanism of trypsin caused by methoxypolyethylene glycol (MPEG) modification. First, trypsin was modified by MPEG (molecular mass 350 Da) to enhance its thermal stability. As expected, the modified trypsin was more stable against temperature than the native form. Second, a new kinetic model, which has the ability of taking the thermal denaturation and autolysis effects of proteases into account, was established and used to analyze the thermal inactivation process of the native and modified trypsin. The kinetic analysis showed that the increased thermal stability of MPEG modified trypsin is the joint result of a reduction in autolysis and a decrease in thermal denaturation. Finally, the molecular modeling technique was also employed to calculate some structural information change, i.e. solvent accessible surface, intramolecular hydrogen bond and root mean square fluctuation, between the native and modified trypsin. The results of molecular modeling computation demonstrated that (i) the steric hindrance caused by MPEG chain would result in the decreased rate of autolysis, (ii) the decreased rate of thermal denaturation should be ascribed to the increased number of hydrogen bond, not the result of the increased molecular rigidity. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

It was found that the movement of solute in gel is quite different from the Brownian movement in free solution. The difference increased with the solute size. A significant effect of the interaction between solute and gel fiber on the movement of solute molecule was also observed. Attraction and repulse both hindered the diffusion obviously. Decreasing the size of the solute and increasing the interaction would enhance the hindering effect markedly.

79956352217	Ethanol from corn stover using SSF: An economic assessment	Increasingly rising oil prices and serious environmental problems make biofuel ethanol production from biomass urgent; fuel ethanol plants are being commissioned and constructed at an unprecedented rate. In this article, economic analyses of ethanol production from corn stover were preformed, and the annual production rate was 1.42 million kg, the results from the study indicated that the unit cost for ethanol production was 15.21 US$/kg, which showed this process had a long way before approaching economic feasibility. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to study the effect of enzyme recycling on the production cost. When the recovery ratio of enzyme was increased from 50% to 90%, the unit cost of ethanol production decreased from 9.45 US$/kg to 4.96 US$/kg. In addition, when the pentose could also be utilized to produce ethanol, the cost of ethanol would drop to 3.36 US$/kg, which was close to economically feasible.

79957920202	Photo-induced inhibition of insulin amyloid fibrillation on online laser measurement	Protein aggregation and amyloid fibrillation can lead to several serious diseases and protein drugs ineffectiveness; thus, the detection and inhibition of these processes have been of great interest. In the present study, the inhibition of insulin amyloid fibrillation by laser irradiation was investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), far-UV circular dichroism (far-UV CD), and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. During heat-induced aggregation, the size distribution of two insulin solutions obtained by online and offline dynamic light scattering were different. The laser-on insulin in the presence of 0.1. M NaCl exhibited fewer fibrils than the laser-off insulin, whereas no insulin fibril under laser irradiation was observed in the absence of 0.1. M NaCl for 45 h incubation. Moreover, our CD results showed that the laser-irradiated insulin solution maintained mainly an α-helical conformation, but the laser-off insulin solution formed bulk fibrils followed by a significant increase in β-sheet content for 106 h incubation. These findings provide an inhibition method for insulin amyloid fibrillation using the laser irradiation and demonstrate that the online long-time laser measurements should be carefully used in the study of amyloid proteins because they may change the original results. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79959493687	Self-assembling peptide-polysaccharide hybrid hydrogel as a potential carrier for drug delivery	Here we report a novel peptide-polysaccharide hybrid hydrogel as a potential carrier for sustained delivery of hydrophobic drugs. The hybrid hydrogel composed of Fmoc-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) peptide and konjac glucomannan (KGM) was prepared through molecular self-assembly of Fmoc-FF in the KGM solution. The physicchemical properties of the Fmoc-FF-KGM hybrid hydrogel were further evaluated. This hybrid hydrogel exhibited a highly hydrated, rigid and nanofibrous gel network in which self-assembled peptide nanofibers were interwoven with the KGM chains. The results of a stability test and rheology study showed that the hybrid hydrogel has much higher stability and mechanical strength compared to Fmoc-FF hydrogel alone. Both CD and FTIR analysis indicated an anti-parallel β-sheet arrangement of Fmoc-FF peptide in self-assembled nanofibers, regardless the presence of KGM. Moreover, docetaxel was chosen as a model of hydrophobic drugs and incorporated into hydrogels to study the in vitro release behavior. The sustained and controlled drug release from this hybrid hydrogel was achieved by varying the KGM concentration, molecular weight, aging time or β-mannanase concentration. Our results not only provide a new strategy for fabricating Fmoc-FF-KGM hybrid hydrogel as a sustained-release drug carrier but also open an avenue for the design of new self-assembling peptide-polysaccharide hybrid hydrogels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

81355147042	Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose with different crystallinities studied by means of sec-malls	The reactions of exo-cellulase (cellobiohydrolase, CBH) and endo-cellulase (endoglucanase, EG) were investigated by analyzing the insoluble residues of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and filter paper cellulose (FPC) during enzymatic hydrolysis. Molecular parameters including molecular weight and its distribution, degree of polymerization, and radii of gyration were measured by size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering. No significant change in MCC chains was found during the whole reaction period, indicating that CBH digestion follows a layer-by-layer solubilization manner. This reaction mode might be the major reason for slow enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. On the other hand, the degree of polymerization of FPC chains decreases rapidly in the initial reaction, indicating that EG digestion follows a random scission manner, which may create new ends for CBH easily. The slopes of the conformation plots for MCC and FPC increase gradually, indicating stronger chain stiffness of cellulose during hydrolysis. © 2011 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

82855161474	Bioconversion of Lignocellulose into Bioethanol: Process Intensification and Mechanism Research	Biofuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass can significantly reduce the energy dependency on fossil fuels and the resulting effects on environment. In this respect, cellulosic ethanol as an alternative fuel has the potential to become a viable energy source in the near future. Over the past few decades, tremendous effort has been undertaken to make cellulosic ethanol cost competitive with conventional fossil fuels. The pretreatment step is always necessary to deconstruct the recalcitrant structures and to make cellulose more accessible to enzymes. A large number of pretreatment technologies involving physical, chemical, biological, and combined approaches have been developed and tested at the pilot scale. Furthermore, various strategies and methods, including multi-enzyme complex, non-catalytic additives, enzyme recycling, high solids operation, design of novel bioreactors, and strain improvement have also been implemented to improve the efficiency of subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. These technologies provide significant opportunities for lower total cost, thus making large-scale production of cellulosic ethanol possible. Meanwhile, many researchers have focused on the key factors that limit cellulose hydrolysis, and analyzing the reaction mechanisms of cellulase. This review describes the most recent advances on process intensification and mechanism research of pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation during the production of cellulosic ethanol. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

A commercially available and low-cost protease (papain) was used as biocatalyst with Z-Ala-OMe and Gln as acyl donor and nucleophile, respectively. The dipeptide yield was 35.5% under the optimized reaction conditions: 35°C, pH 9.5, and the ratio of acyl donor/nucleophile is 1:10.

The hydrogel, composed of 10% casein and 1% konjac glucomannan (KGM), was formed with 0.4 wt% transglutaminase (MTG) as the cross-linker. The physicochemical properties of the protein-polysaccharide hydrogel were investigated by SEM observation, FT-IR analysis, swelling ratio test, and stability test. The results of the stability test proved that the hydrogel with KGM had an obviously improved stability. Its degradation rate also decreased from 100% to less than 60% compared with the hydrogel without KGM at the end of the test. The results of the swelling ratio test demonstrated that the addition of KGM restricted the mobility of the chains, and decreased the swelling ratio of the hydrogel. The results of the FT-IR revealed hydrogen bond interactions during the gelation process upon the addition of KGM. To investigate in vitro release behavior, docetaxel was chosen as a model drug incorporated into the casein/KGM hydrogels. The hydrogel with 1% KGM exhibited a good drug release behavior. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84857225184	Cellulase recycling and reuse: Comparison of immobilization, ultrafiltration and Re-adsorption	Until now, the enzyme cost is still the dominating economic barrier to produce ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, lower enzyme cost is being pursued for the industrialization of cellulosic bioethanol. The recycling of enzymes has been explored as an effective way of reducing the high cost of enzymes [1, 2]. After enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates, some enzymes remain free in the hydrolysate, while others are bound to the residual substrates. In our lab, we compare several strategies developed to recover and reuse the enzymes, including ultrafiltration, readsorption onto fresh substrates, and enzyme immobilization. (1) Immobilization. Immobilization of enzymes is an important approach for enzyme recycling. Among cellulases, b-glucosidase is frequently used to supplement cellulase preparations for hydrolysis of cellobiose to glucose. Compared to free cellobiase, immobilized cellobiase had improved thermal stability and mechanical strength. It could be reused several times in a continuous reaction packed column. Moreover, immobilized cellobiase is readily separated from the substrate and products, which can simplify subsequent purification processes. However, few studies have used lignocellulosic biomass as substrates and none have been done at high solids loadings. The use of immobilized cellulases for lignocellulose hydrolysis is still a technically difficult task because immobilization may hinder enzyme access to insoluble cellulose. Multi-enzymes complex that are required for hydrolysis of lignocellulose also increase the difficulty in immobilization process. (2) Ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration has been proven to be capable of recovering cellulases and b-glucosidase, and it has the capacity to continuously remove sugars and other small compounds that may potentially inhibit enzyme activity. For this reason, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) may provide some advantages in performing enzymatic hydrolysis. The MBR combines product inhibitor removal and cellulase reuse in one device, which facilitates operation and reduces equipment costs by eliminating an extra reactor. Another advantage of MBR is that the enzymatic hydrolysis rate increases because product inhibition is lowered compared with that in a conventional batch reactor. In the fed-batch MBR, fresh substrate was supplemented five times at the rate of 10 g cellulose per liter each time, resulting in a total cellulose loading of 7%. After 60 h, the enzyme utilization efficiency was 3.13-fold of MBR. An additional process, like reverse osmosis, is required on the downstream processes to concentrate the sugar products. (3) Re-adsorption. Cellulases have relatively high stability and high affinity for cellulose. After hydrolysis, most cellulases are free in the hydrolysate. Therefore, free cellulases can be recovered for further use by readsorption onto fresh substrates and subsequent microfiltration. One of the most important factors that limit enzyme recovering in the readsorption process is the adsorption of cellulases to lignin. To reduce the nonproductive adsorption, nonionic surfactants, such as Tween 80, were added to increase free enzymes in the supernatant. In this case, the enzymes (e.g. Spezyme CP) can be used in four successive rounds of enzyme recycling, achieving an above 80% hydrolysis yield after the fourth round. Compared to ultrafiltration, enzyme recycling by readsorption is unable to recover b-glucosidase because it does not typically bind to the cellulosic substrate. Therefore, the supplementation of fresh b-glucosidase is commonly necessary to subsequent rounds of hydrolysis.

84860516556	Effect of Formic Acid on Conversion of Fructose to 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural in Aqueous/Butanol Media	Acid-catalyzed dehydration of carbohydrates into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a valuable biomass-derived intermediate, has received increasing attention. Efficient methods for HMF production are needed for successful commercialization of HMF in the near future. A new process for the dehydration of sugars into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in aqueous/butanol media enhanced by using formic acid was developed. The effects of formic acid concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time on the fructose conversion and HMF yield showed the significant influences of these process variables. The optimum conditions were found to be 2.5 mol/L formic acid concentration, 170°C and 70 min. Under such conditions, a fructose conversion of 98.3% with a HMF yield of 69.2% was achieved. The application of the butanol solvent and formic acid led to the conversion of fructose to HMF with high yield. The catalytic system in this study has prospects for commercial application due to its less corrosion and convenient downstream separation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84862815592	Controlled adsorption of cellulase onto pretreated corncob by pH adjustment	The effective recycling of cellulase requires an in-depth understanding of cellulase adsorption and desorption. In the present study, we examined the adsorption behaviors and stabilities of cellulase at different pH values. Acidic pH (<4. 8) was found to favor adsorption, whereas neutral and alkaline pH (especially pH 7 and 10) favored desorption. The influence of pH on cellulase activity was temperature dependent. Under mild conditions (e. g., pH 7 and 25 °C), the effect of pH on cellulase activity was reversible, and the cellulase activity can return to almost 100% by adjusting the pH value to 4. 8. However, under severe conditions (e. g. pH 10 and 50 °C), irreversible inactivation may take place. We also explored the roles of pH and temperature in cellulase adsorption kinetics and isotherms. At pH 4. 8, temperature had no remarkable effect on the adsorption capacity of the cellulases onto substrate. However, at pH 7 and 10, high temperatures lead to more cellulase desorption. Only at pH 4. 8 does cellulase adsorption well fit (R

84863339068	An overview on lignocellulose pretreatment and recalcitrant characteristics	Lignocellulose is the most abundant renewable biomass on the earth. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic polysaccharide is key step of lignocellulose biorefineries. To enhance efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis, pretreatment is necessary for effectively breaking its recalcitrant structure. So, great attentions have been paid for design of pretreatment technologies to crack recalcitrant characteristics of lignocellulose. In this paper, the latest research progresses on lignocellulose pretreatment and recalcitrant characteristics were reviewed, focusing on the new pretreatment technologies and their main advantages, including combined pretreatment, cold pretreatment, green solvents pretreatment and electrochemical approach. Otherwise, the influence of recalcitrant characteristics, such as lignin, crystallinity, accessibility, on cellulose hydrolysis was discussed. The new methods used for analysis of recalcitrant characteristics and the new insight obtained are highlighted in this review. These are useful for evaluation of pretreatment technologies, and identification of key factors that limit cellulose hydrolysis, and can also be a basis for design and screen of appropriate pretreatment technologies, as well as for understand of lignocellulose hydrolysis mechanism. © All Rights Reserved.

Bovine serum albumin and insulin were used as model proteins for in vitro assessments. It was observed that KGM could be contained within beads, and faintness hydrogen binding and electrostatic interaction exist between ALG and KGM by infrared spectra. Clear dents were found on the surface of beads using KGM by scanning electron microscopy. Use of KGM could help increase the payload of drug. After beads were treated by 0.1 N HCl for 4 h and put into pH 7.4 buffers, protein was released from ALG-CHI beads within 1 h, while it was lost from ALG-KGM-CHI beads for 3 h. However, the leaking of protein from ALG-KGM-CHI beads was also increased in 0.1 N HCl solution. Concentration of gelling ion had great effect on release rate and gel structure. Studies of water of hydration had shown that swelling of ALG-KGM-CHI beads was higher than that of ALG-CHI beads in acidic solution, but the opposite result was obtained in alkali solution. The result indicated that the diffusion of protein was related to the viscosity and swelling properties of KGM. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the information of casein micelle structure, the possible reaction mechanism was deduced from a series of chromatographic results and experimental analysis. Taking into account the primary structure of whole casein and the target amino acid of trypsin, the distribution of theoretical peptides was accurately calculated by determining the split sites of complete enzymatic hydrolysis.

However, the effective strategies for the shape control of protein crystals are lacking. The conventional sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed to investigate the influence of pH and temperature on the crystal nucleation behavior of hen egg white lysozyme. Moreover, the size distributions of protein crystals grown at different conditions were analyzed. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of lysozyme crystals. The results indicated that pH and temperature will affect the supersaturation and electrostatic interactions among protein molecules in the nucleation process. In particular, the crystals with different aspect ratios can be selectively nucleated, depending upon the choice of pH and temperature. Therefore, this study provided a simple method for obtaining shape-controlled lysozyme crystals and supplied some information on thermal behaviors of lysozyme crystals grown at different pH values. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84872346810	Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose: SEC-MALLS analysis and reaction mechanism	The measurement of molecular parameters, such as molecular weight and degrees of polymerisation, in lignocellulosic feedstock are critical during the hydrolysis process, because following the changes in these parameters can provide insight into the mechanism of hydrolysis. This work employs SEC-MALLS to monitor the changes in the absolute values of these parameters of lignocellulosic samples during enzymatic hydrolysis. The lignocellulosic samples were directly dissolved in 8.0% LiCl/DMAc without any change. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the cellulose fraction decreased initially and increased slightly thereafter, indicating that a "layer-by-layer" mechanism is adapted for enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose fraction of lignocellulose. Similar changes in the molecular weights of the hemicellulose fraction indicates that hemicellulose and cellulose are always together in the recalcitrant substrates during enzymatic hydrolysis. Finally, the reaction mechanism of cellulase on lignocellulose was defined by SEC-MALLS analysis combining HPLC and XRD data. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84872834912	Conversion of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in aqueous/organic media using formic acid as catalyst	Due to the increasing energy demand and the diminishing petroleum reserves, the production of biofules and chemicals from biomass have attracted increasing attentions. Recently, multiple catalytic methods have been used to transform carbohydrates into chemical compounds. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which could be converted from carbohydrates (Roman-Leshkov et al., 2007), is an important platform chemical with many potential applications in energy field and chemical industry. HMF and its derivatives could be converted into a great many of chemicals, such as diesel fuel additives, alternative fuels and bioderived chemicals (Chheda et al., 2007). Althrough very good works have been done, efficient methods for HMF production are still needed for successful commercialization of HMF to make overall costs be competitive with petroleum-based chemicals. In this work, a new process of formic acid-catalyzed dehydration of carbohydrates into HMF in water/butanol media was developed (Fig. 1a). We investigated the effects of formic acid concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time on the fructose conversion and HMF yield. According to the experiment results, it is found that fructose is in the aqueous phase, while formic acid and HMF are dominantly in the organic phase. The main conclutions are drawn as follows: 1) The application of formic acid in aqueous/butanol media as catalyst led to high yield of HMF (Fig. 1b). In this reaction, the addition of formic acid and n-butanol limited the side reaction such as HMF rehydration and removed HMF from the reactive aqueous medium rapidly, thus increased the efficiency of fructose dehydration and the yield or selectivity of HMF. 2) As increasing formic acid concentration, the HMF yield gradually increased and then decreased after reaching a maximum value. Higher reaction temperature and longer reaction time would increase the fructose conversion, but there was no significant influence when it was in the range of 170-190°C and over 70min. 3) Fig 1c presented the HMF yields transformed from different sugar feedstocks at 170°C for 70min. Very low HMF yield was achieved from glucose. Compared to the reaction of fructose, the lower HMF yields transformed from inulin and sucrose were 54.0% and 36.1%, rseparately. 4) A HMF yield of 69.2% with 98.3% fructose conversion was achieved under the optimum conditions: 2.5mol/L formic acid concentration, 170°C and 70min. The application of this reaction system has prospects for commercial application due to high yield of HMF, less corrosion and convenient downstream separation.

It showed good fermentation ability on both soluble sugar mixture and lignocellulose. Nearly all the glucose and xylose in sugar mixture can be consumed, corresponding to 86 % of theoretic ethanol yield. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) of NaOH-pretreated corncob was then carried out in a high dry matter (DM) loading of 15-25 w/v%. At the DM loading of 15 %, the suitable operating conditions were determined, i. e., Z. mobilis loading of 0. 30 g dry weight/L at 30 °C (pH 5. 5), under which the ethanol concentration reached 49. 2 g/L. Higher final ethanol concentrations were obtained when SSCF was operated at the fed-batch mode. Several amounts of substrate (1 % to 10 %) were added, and the highest final ethanol concentration (60. 5 g/L) was obtained at 10 % DM addition. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84873738019	Interaction between lysozyme and procyanidin: Multilevel structural nature and effect of carbohydrates	The interaction of procyanidins with proteins has aroused extensive attention due to its important relationship with the bioavailability and astringent property of polyphenols. In the present work, we have investigated the interactions of lysozyme with procyanidin dimer (B3) using various biophysical approaches, which aims to provide insights into the mechanism of protein/polyphenol aggregation. Procyanidin B3 spontaneously binds lysozyme, inducing the multilevel structural changes in lysozyme and the formation of insoluble complexes. The relationship between lysozyme aggregation and the loss of enzymatic activity was monitored using dynamic light scattering and fluorescence quenching. The influences of two carbohydrates (gum arabic and sucrose) on lysozyme/B3 aggregation were also studied. Gum arabic effectively inhibited the formation of insoluble aggregates, but was unable to restore the fluorescence and activity of lysozyme. However, sucrose concomitantly decreased the aggregate size with the recovery of fluorescence and lysozyme activity. These results proposed two probable mechanisms by which these two carbohydrates inhibit protein/polyphenol aggregation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results suggested that the fractal dimension of enzyme molecule was greater than the fractal dimension of its active site. With increasing temperature, the calculated box-counting dimensions of global enzymes and their active sites all increased, especially for active sites. When enzyme was combined to the inhibitor, the dimensions of global enzymes did not change obviously, while the dimensions of active sites all decreased, indicating the decline of complexity for active sites. © All Rights Reserved.

In this article, we introduce the use of an amphiphilic dipeptide derivative, aspartame, as an effective dispersing agent in preparing highly stable suspensions under ultrasonication. The results demonstrate that aspartame was absorbed by the nanotube surface possibly because of non-covalent π-π stacking between the aromatic group of aspartame and the CNT backbone. In addition, the resulting MWCNT/aspartame composites remained stably dispersed over a wide range of pH values. The chronoamperometric measurements of MWCNT/aspartame composite-coated electrodes for hydrogen peroxide demonstrated better electrochemical detection performance, as characterized by significantly enhanced step current, higher sensitivity, and reduced potential compared with bare electrodes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84878317885	Cross-linked lysozyme crystal templated synthesis of Au nanoparticles as high-performance recyclable catalysts	Bio-nanomaterials fabricated using a bioinspired templating technique represent a novel class of composite materials with diverse applications in biomedical, electronic devices, drug delivery, and catalysis. In this study, Au nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized within the solvent channels of cross-linked lysozyme crystals (CLLCs) in situ without the introduction of extra chemical reagents or physical treatments. The as-prepared AuNPs-in-protein crystal hybrid materials are characterized by light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. Small AuNPs with narrow size distribution reveal the restriction effects of the porous structure in the lysozyme crystals. These composite materials are proven to be active heterogeneous catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. These catalysts can be easily recovered and reused at least 20 times because of the physical stability and macro-dimension of CLLCs. This work is the first to use CLLCs as a solid biotemplate for the preparation of recyclable high-performance catalysts. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84879643058	An effective and green method for the extraction and purification of aglycone isoflavones from soybean	In this paper, an effective and green strategy was developed to obtain aglycone isoflavones from soybean through the extraction, hydrolysis, and purification steps. Firstly, a novel ethanol-alkaline extraction method was designed and optimized. The high extraction yield (94.34%) of isoflavones was achieved under the optimal extraction conditions of pH 9.0, 70°C, 60 min, ethanol concentration of 65%, and 1:15 of the solid to liquid ratio. Then, the cellulase (GC-220) was used instead of traditional β-glucosidase to hydrolyze the glycoside isoflavones into aglycone isoflavones which gave an excellent conversion of 95%. Finally, the crude aglycone isoflavones have been purified by an environmental-friendly procedure comprised of ethanol precipitation, ethyl acetate extraction, and water rinse. The final amount of aglycone isoflavones obtained was 1.279 mg for every gram of defatted soybean by this strategy, and the final recovery, and purity of aglycone isoflavones could achieve 80.38 and 87.21%, respectively. © 2013 The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The reaction was performed at 37 °C and pH 8.0 for 3 h followed by ultrafiltration. ACEIPs were purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) from permeate fractions with molecular weight (MW) below 1 kDa.

84880046455	Backbone fractal dimension and fractal hybrid orbital of protein structure	Fractal geometry analysis provides a useful and desirable tool to characterize the configuration and structure of proteins. In this paper we examined the fractal properties of 750 folded proteins from four different structural classes, namely (1) the α-class (dominated by α-helices), (2) the β-class (dominated by β-pleated sheets), (3) the (α/ β)-class (α-helices and β-sheets alternately mixed) and (4) the (α+ β)-class (α-helices and β-sheets largely segregated) by using two fractal dimension methods, i.e. "the local fractal dimension" and "the backbone fractal dimension" (a new and useful quantitative parameter). The results showed that the protein molecules exhibit a fractal behavior in the range of 1 ≤ N≤ 15 (N is the number of the interval between two adjacent amino acid residues), and the value of backbone fractal dimension is distinctly greater than that of local fractal dimension for the same protein. The average value of two fractal dimensions decreased in order of α> α/ β> α+ β> β. Moreover, the mathematical formula for the hybrid orbital model of protein based on the concept of backbone fractal dimension is in good coincidence with that of the similarity dimension. So it is a very accurate and simple method to analyze the hybrid orbital model of protein by using the backbone fractal dimension. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885332120	Self-assembled oligomeric procyanidin-insulin hybrid nanoparticles: A novel strategy for controllable insulin delivery	Natural oligomeric procyanidin (OPC) with high biological and pharmacological activities was successfully used to synthesize OPC-insulin (OPC-INS) nanoparticles with different aggregation sizes for sustained and controlled delivery of hydrophilic insulin. The aggregation size of OPC-INS nanoparticles was regulated by OPC concentration, pH value, and incubation time. The fabrication mechanism would be that OPC and insulin self-assembled into a mixture of insulin aggregates via intermolecular interactions. In the self-assembly of insulin, OPC could serve both in the encompassing of insulin aggregates as a stabilizer and cross-linking different amounts of insulin aggregates into OPC-INS nanoparticles as interphase. OPC-INS nanoparticles not only demonstrated effective insulin drug loading but also exhibited aggregation-size-dependent and controlled insulin release performance in vitro. In the best case for OPC-INS nanoparticles, only ∼21% of insulin was released in 37 days. This study showed that the OPC-INS nanosystem is promising to serve as a long-acting insulin release formulation, and OPC has great potential as a drug carrier for nanomedicine. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Here we designed a novel bioorganometallic molecule, ferrocene-diphenylalanine (Fc-FF), and investigated its self-assembly behavior. We directly observed a morphological transition from metastable nanospheres to nanofibers, which led to the formation of a self-supporting hydrogel. The strong hydrophobic interaction of the Fc moiety was suggested to have a key role in this kinetically controlled self-assembly process. Moreover, the redox center of the ferrocene group further allowed us to reversibly control the self-assembly behavior of Fc-FF by altering its redox state. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Practically, the functional groups exposed on the fiber surface can provide locations to anchor Ag ions when immersed into metal precursor solution. The synthesized small-sized Ag nanoparticles with uniform distribution is well decorated on the surface of interwoven fibers of eggshell membrane. The effectiveness of the as-prepared AgNPs/ESM composites as a solid phase heterogeneous catalyst has been evaluated, for the first time, on the well-known 4-nitrophenol reduction to 4-aminophenol in the presence of excess borohydride. Moreover, the kinetics of the reduction reaction was investigated at different temperatures to determine the activation energy.

The fluorescence of CuNCs was quenched effectively by KA, but not by the possible coexisting substances. Based on multiple spectroscopic studies, we propose that selective binding of KA to copper ions of CuNCs promotes the formation of copper kojate on the surface of CuNCs, which statically quenches CuNCs fluorescence. The as-proposed biosensor allows selective determination of KA in the range from 0.2 μM to 50 μM, with a detection limit of 0.07 μM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The CuNC-based fluorescent sensor provides a simple, rapid, cost-effective, and label-free platform for KA detection.

84898075182	Jet flow directed supramolecular self-Assembly at aqueous liquid-liquid interface	Self-Assembly of molecular units at an interface has been an active area of research over the past few decades because of its advantages to prepare highly ordered materials. Here we demonstrated jet flow directed supramolecular self-Assembly at the interface between two aqueous solutions, one containing a cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) and the other, a small self-Assembling Fmoc-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) peptide bearing opposite charge. By controlling the jet flow of CPAM solution, we can fabricate macroscopic sac membranes, or microfibers composed of well-Aligned Fmoc-FF nanofibers at the interface between two solutions. Moreover, the structure of microfibers may be hollow or solid depending on the intensity of jet flow. The entrainment of the jet flow will enhance the mixing between Fmoc-FF and CPAM solutions, which can be utilized for the fast fabrication of well-defined Fmoc-FF/CPAM microfibers. These microfibers can encapsulate functional components facilely for controlled drug release. Moreover, functional components such as QDs can also be integrated into the self-Assembling system to easily achieve additional functionalities. We believe that the organization of components at the aqueous liquid-liquid interface will have great potential for the discovery of highly ordered and functional materials with potential applications in areas such as controlled drug release, wound dressing, enzyme immobilization, biosensors and other non-biological applications.

84898427090	Facile in situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles on procyanidin-grafted eggshell membrane and their catalytic properties	Facile, efficient, and robust immobilization of metal nanostructures on porous bioscaffolds is an interesting topic in materials chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. This study reports a facile in situ method for the synthesis and immobilization of small silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at room temperature on natural eggshell membrane (ESM), which presents interwoven fibrous structure and can be used as a unique protein-based biotemplate. Procyanidin (Pro), a typical plant polyphenol extracted from grape seeds and skins, was first grafted onto ESM fibers to serve as both reductant and stabilizer during the synthesis process. As a result, the AgNPs were facilely synthesized and robustly immobilized on the ESM fibers without additional chemical reductant or physical treatments. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared AgNPs@Pro-ESM composites were characterized by combined microscopy and spectroscopy technologies. The results indicate that small AgNPs with mean diameter of 2.46 nm were successfully prepared on the Pro-ESM biotemplate. The composites exhibited good catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). More importantly, these composite catalysts can be easily recovered and reused for more than eight cycles because of their high stability. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Four kinds of K1 carriers with different surface hydrophilicities (water surface contact angle were 41°, 62°, 75°, and 87°) treated via oxidation, acid, alkaline and untreated were prepared and studied. The results showed that the stronger hydrophilic, the more quantity of microorganism hanged on carriers, and at the same time, the more compact of membrane structure. In the situation of low hydrophilic, the quantity of microorganism is a limiting factor of wastewater treatment; in the situation of higher hydrophilic, membrane structure becomes a limiting factor of wastewater treatment. comparing with four kinds of hydrophilic carriers, surface contact angle of 62° was best for wastewater treatment, for which the average removal rates of COD and ammonia nitrogen were 87% and 61%, respectively. The order of others were carriers with water surface contact angle of 41°, 75° and 87°.

The influence of each pretreatment on the adsorption and desorption of cellulase and on the recycling effect of cellulase after re-adsorption by the fresh substrate were also discussed. The results showed that acid-base coupling pretreatment was much better than a single acid or alkali pretreatment, i.e. the cellulose content of the corncob substrate reached 73.84% after pretreatment; the desorption percent and recycling percent of cellulase after 96 h of SSF and re-adsorption in the first round was 57.7% and 62.4% respectively; ethanol concentration amounted to 62.0% of the first time in the second round of SSF after the enzyme re-adsorption.

84903819959	Recycling cellulases by pH-triggered adsorption-desorption during the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass	Recycling of cellulases is an effective way to reduce the cost of enzymatic hydrolysis for the production of cellulosic ethanol. In this study, we examined the adsorption and desorption behaviors of cellulase at different pH values and temperatures. Furthermore, we developed a promising way to recover both free and bound cellulases by pH-triggered adsorption-desorption. The results show that acidic pH (e.g., pH 4.8) was found to favor adsorption, whereas alkaline pH (e.g., pH 10) and low temperature (4-37°C) favored desorption. The adsorption of cellulases reached an equilibrium within 60 min at pH 4.8 and 25°C, leading to approximately 50 % of the added cellulases bound to the substrate. By controlling the pH of eluent (citrate buffer, 25°C), we were able to increase the desorption efficiency of bound cellulases from 15 % at pH 4.8 to 85 % at pH 10. To recover cellulases after enzymatic hydrolysis, we employed adsorption by fresh substrate and desorption at pH 10 to recover the free cellulases in supernatant and the bound cellulases in residue, respectively. The recycling performance (based on the glucose yield) of this simple strategy could reach near 80 %. Our results provided a simple, low-cost, and effective approach for cellulase recycling during the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84903902387	Preparation and thermal kinetic deactivation of cross-linked enzyme aggregates of penicillin acylase	Cross-linked enzyme aggregates(CLEAs) is an efficient approach to obtain immobilized enzymes without the use of any pre-existing carriers. The preparation of CLEAs usually consisted of two simple steps: precipitation and cross-linking. In this work, CLEAs of penicillin acylase was preparaed using 50% ammo-nium sulphate solution as precipitant and 0.35% glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent. The resulting CLEAs obtained an activity yield of 30.1% and higher optimal temperature(57°C) than free penicillin acylase(47°C) as well as an obvious shift of optimal pH from 8.3 to 10.0. Moreover, compared with free enzyme, the thermal stability of CLEAs was largely enhanced which facilitated the application of penicillin acylase in high-temperature reaction systems. Based on the thermal deactivation kinetics study, it was found that the deactivation model of penicillin acylase changed from one-step model to serial model through immobilizing as CLEAs. The higher deactivation energy of CLEAs(549.2 kJ/mol) than free enzyme(248.8 kJ/mol) also explained the excellent stability of CLEAs under high temperature environment. In addition, CLEAs exhibited favorable reusability after using 7 times.

In this work, a simple fluorescence sensor for scissor-based detection of pepsin activity was developed by using lysozyme-stabilized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs@Lyz) in aqueous media. Under acidic conditions (pH 3.0), enzymatic digestion of AuNCs@Lyz with pepsin results in a significant decrease of fluorescence intensity. Notably, its acidic environment not only helps maintain the maximum fluorescence of gold nanoclusters, but also ensures the highest enzymatic activity of pepsin. In addition to offering high selectivity because of the unique proteolytic action of pepsin under acidic conditions, this facile method provides high sensitivity.

A new protein-resistant surface made through the chemical grafting of easily available hyaluronic acid (HA) onto gold (Au) substrate demonstrates excellent antifouling performance against protein adsorption. AFM images showed the uniform HA layer with a thickness of ∼10.5 nm on the Au surface.

Here, we report the temperature-induced reversible self-assembly of diphenylalanine peptide to microtubes, nanowires, or organogel in different solvents. We also find that the organogel in isopropanol transforms into crystalline flakes or nanowires when the temperature increases. The reversible self-assembly in polar solvents may be mainly controlled by electronic and aromatic interactions between the FF molecules themselves, which is associated with the dissociation equilibrium and significantly influenced by temperature. We found that the organogel in the isopropanol solvent made a unique transition to crystalline structures, a process that is driven by temperature and may be kinetically controlled. During the heating-cooling process, FF preferentially self-assembles to metastable nanofibers and organogel. They further transform to thermodynamically stable crystal structures via molecular rearrangement after introducing an external energy, such as the increasing temperature used in this study. The strategy demonstrated in this study provides an efficient way to controllably fabricate smart, temperature-responsive peptide nanomaterials and enriches the understanding of the growth mechanism of diphenylalanine peptide nanostructures.
