20544445959	Evaluation of scar proliferation degree by expressive characteristics of cyclin D1 in scar tissue	Aim: To observe the expression of cell cycle protein (cyclin D1) in scar tissue, and try to find an objective marker to assess hyperplasic scars. Methods: The experiment was completed in the Laboratory of Plastic Surgery of the Southeast Hospital of Third Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from October 2000 to April 2001. The expressions of cyclin D1 in the tissues of nonhyperplasic scars, hyperplasic scars and their surrounding normal tissues from 24 patients were observed with immunohistochemical staining. Results: Cyclin D1 in normal skin tissue, nonhyperplasic scar tissue and hyperplasic scar tissue were weakly positive, positive and strongly positive respectively, and the positive cell rates were (2.1 ± 0.4)%, (12.6 ± 5.6)% and (45.3 ± 12.6)% respectively. The paired t test showed that the cyclin D1 positive rate in hyperplasic scar tissue was obviously higher than that in normal skin (t = 17.036, P < 0.001) and nonhyperplasic scar tissue (t = 11.398, P < 0.001), and there was insignificant difference between the latter two tissues (t = 2.121, P > 0.05). Conclusion: The positive cell rate of cyclin D1 expression in scar tissue is correlated with the type of scar, which is more obvious in the hyperplasic scar tissue, so it can be used to diagnose the proliferating degree of scar tissue.

To explore prevention and treatment of the pain caused by passive mobilization post functional disability of the knee joints. Methods. Thirty-two patients with handicaps of the knee joints after fractures were divided into two groups treated with manipulative and combinative treatments respectively. The ROMs of all the patients were measured before and after the treatment and the rehabilitating extent(RE) was obtained from dividing the differences between them with the normal ROM. The pain was assessed through numerical rating scale(NRS). Results. The active and passive ROM before the treatment in the simple manipulative therapy group were (64 ± 30)° and (73±27 ° respectively; while in the combinative therapy group, (57 ± 30)° and (67 ±30)° respectively. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the two groups, but improved ROM of the combinative treatments group was higher than that of the other group significantly at the end of the treatments. The NRS score of the combinative treat group was lower than that of the simple manipulative group significantly. Conclusions. The combinative treatments can prevent and cure the pain caused by the manipulative therapy to the handicapped knee joints after fractures, and promote functional rehabilitation of the affected joints.

26944440541	High-spin states in Gd152	High-spin states of Gd152 have been studied via the Nd148(Be9,5n)Gd152 fusion-evaporation reaction at a beam energy of 54 MeV. The ground-state band, octupole band, and β band have been extended up to spins 20+, 21-, and 16+, respectively. A possible aligned two quasineutron band, which becomes the yrast band above the spin 16+, was observed for the first time. The kinematic behaviors of the ground-state bands and yrast bands in Gd152,154 indicate that the shape of Gd152 may change with increasing rotational frequency and the difference of quadrupole deformations between Gd152 and Gd154 obviously reduces around the first band crossing region. These observations are consistent with the theoretical calculations using cranked Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky methods. The first band crossing observed in Gd152 can be ascribed to the alignment of a pair of i13/2 neutrons. The identical ground-state bands in Gd152 and Dy154 were extended. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

28244477117	Adaptive evolution of primate TRIM5α, a gene restricting HIV-1 infection	Recent studies showed that nonhuman primate TRIM5α can efficiently block HIV-1 infection in human cell lines. It can also restrict other retroviruses, therefore, suggested as a general defender against retrovirus infection. Here, we present an evolutionary analysis of TRIM5α in primates. Our results demonstrated that TRIM5α has been evolving rapidly in primates, which is likely caused by Darwinian positive selection. The SPRY domain of TRIM5α, which may be responsible for recognition of incoming viral capsids showed higher nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratios than the non-SPRY domain, indicating that the adaptive evolution of TRIM5α in primates might be an innate strategy developed in defending retrovirus infection during primate evolution. In addition, the comparative protein sequence analysis suggested that the amino acid substitution pattern at a single site (344R/Q/P) located in the SPRY domain may explain the differences in susceptibilities of HIV-1 infection in diverse primate species. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

30344475797	A study of Legionella pneumophilia in Tianjin, China	Legionella is a bacterium identified as the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease commonly found in water and soil in natural environments and human habitats. While most studies are focused on cooling tower water as the source of infection, few studies have compared Legionella from cooling-tower water and water in man-made environments. This cross-sectional study with a randomized cluster sampling design aims to provide information on Legionella found in cooling-tower water and water in man-made environments. Legionella was identified using a dual analytical approach: the serological and the 16SrRNA semi-nest PCR methods. Nine different types of Legionella were identified with the Lp7 type detected in China for the first time. Results indicated slight but insignificantly increased odds (OR = 1.64, 95%CI = 0.54-4.98) of Legionella detection in cooling tower water as compared to water obtained from fountains and parks, suggesting that the mechanism of exposure plays an important role in the causal pathway of outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

3142568829	Effect of anaerobic digestion on nitrogen removal in treatment process of piggery wastewater	Anaerobic digestion is commonly used to remove the organic matter from the piggery wastewater. Complete digestion can remove most of the organic matters, but this also lowers the mass ratio of COD to N (usually as 1-3). Based on the theory of two-step digestion, the mass ratio of COD to N is kept high (7-10) by stopping the digestion at the step of hydrolysis, which benefits the denitrification later. A sequence batch reactor was used to treat these two kinds of wastewater. And the nitrogen removal of partly digested wastewater was more efficacious than that of the complete digested wastewater because of its high influent the mass ratio of COD to N. The effect of influent the mass ratio of COD to N on nitrogen removal was studied, the results indicate that the effluent NH

Batch washings were conducted on the sediment with different solution pH values and rhamnolipid concentrations. The speciation of heavy metals in the sediment before and after washing was analyzed by sequential extraction. The results show that rhamnolipid can remove cadmium and lead from sediment efficiently. The heavy metal removal efficiency is the best when the pH value of rhamnolipid solution is 10.0, and the removal ratio is the highest when the sorption of rhamnolipid on the sediment reaches a plateau. The speciation of the heavy metals has an effect on the removal efficiency, and the exchangeable and organic fractions can be removed efficiently. Four successive washings can remove 80.1% cadmium and 36.5% lead.

Objective: To observe the effects of collagenase on collagen degradation in nude mice with graft of hypertrophic scar and its therapeutic effects on hyertrophic scar. Design: Controlled experiment was designed. Sett ing: Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University of Chinese PLA. Materials: The experiment was performed in Experimental Center of the Third Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from July 1995 to April 1997, in which, 10 specimens of hypertrophic scar were employed, collected from the removed hypertrophic scars in Department of Plastic Surgery. All of patients were in the known before the operation. Experimental animals were 15 BACB/C nude mice, of which, 8 mice were male and 7 mice female. Totally 15 mice were grafted with hypertrophic scar tissue, 10 mice of which were survived after once graft; with second graft in the rest mice, 2 mice were survived and 3 mice were dead. The survival nude mice were randomized into experimental group and the control, 6 mice in each one. Methods: The removed hypertrophic scars in plastic operation were grafted in the wound on the dorsum of nude mice to establish graft model of hypertrophic scar. In experimental group, 1% collagenase was injected locally in scar tissue; in the control group, collagease solvent was injected locally, once a week, for 4 weeks totally. After treatment, the materials were collected for macroscopic observation and observation and analysis with optic and electronic microscopes. Main outcome measures: 1 Macroscopic observation of scar tissue before and after treatment. 2 Optic microscopic observation of scar tissue before and after treatment. 3 Electronic microscopic observation of scar tissue before and after treatment. Results: Twelve nude mice were survived after scar graft and all of them entered result analysis, 6 mice of which were in experimental group and 6 mice in the control group. 1 In the experimental group, the scar was smaller in size, thinner in thickness and softer in quality compared with the control group, indicating quite significant difference. 2 With HE staining, Van Gieson's collagenous fiber staining and compound staining on slices, it was displayed that in experimental group, dermal layer became thin, collagenous fiber was unclear in structure and disperse in arrangement, but in the control, the dermal layer of scar tissue was hypertrophic with rich collagenous fibers and disarranged structure. 3 With electronic microscopic observation, in experimental group, collagenous fibers were destroyed and unclear in structure, but in the control, collagenous fibers were disturbed in arrangement with distinct strips and clear structure. Conclusion: Collagenase degrades collagen of hypertrophic scar, lessens and softens scar, suggesting that local injection of collagease is probably a good therapy for hypertrophic scar.

In this study, the effects of Tween 80 and rhamnolipid on the extracellular amylase, carboxymethyl cellulose enzyme (CMCase), xylanase and protease of Penicillium simplicissimum isolated from compost were investigated during solid-state fermentation. The results showed that the enzyme activities of amylase, CMCase and xylanase were increased by Tween 80 and rhamnolipid, which, however, had a negative effect on the protease production. The stimulative effects on the three enzymes were quite different during the whole fermentation process. Tween 80 and rhamnolipid also increased the fungal biomass slightly. As a result of the enhanced enzyme activities, the organic matter were also improved to different extents by both surfactants, and the decomposition rates of hemicellulose and cellulose were increased about 8.0% and 11.6% by Tween 80 at best, respectively, as well as 5% and 5.5% by rhamnolipid. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Three parallel beakers A, B, C are adopted with the same components of soil, yard waste, straw and bran for aerated composting to degrade the PCP in soil. A was with no inoculants as control, B was added with the inoculants of immobilized P. chrysosporium, C was inoculated with non-immobilized P. chrysosporium, and additionally D contained only PCP-contaminated soils also as control. By contrastive analyses, the feasibility of applying composting to the bioremediation of the PCP-polluted soil was discussed. From the experimental results, it could be seen that the degradation rate of PCP by the immobilized fungi exceeded 50% at day 9, while that of the non-immobilized fungi achieved the same rate at day 16. However, the final degradation rates of PCP for both of them were beyond 90% at day 60 and that the rate of A was much lower than the others. The above data have shown that the degradation effect of inoculating P. chrysosporium was better than that of no inoculation, and that of the immobilized fungi was better than that of non-immobilized ones. Meanwhile, shown by all the indicators the composts of A, B and C were mature and stabilized at the end of the experiment. Therefore, the method of composting with immobilized P. chrysosporium is effective for the bioremediation of PCP-contaminated soil. © Springer 2006.

33846371104	Biological features of bone marrow stromal cells and their application in the recovery of spinal cord injury	Objective: Recently, it is found that bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) have great proliferation capability and multi-directional differentiation potential, especially MSCs can differentiate into nerve cells at specific induction, which indicates that MSCs transplantation is a hopeful way for the recovery of spinal cord injury (SCI). This paper aims to review the biological features of MSCs and their application in the recovery of SCI. Data sources: An online search at PUBMED between January 2000 and December 2004 was undertaken to identify the related articles with the key words of "MSCs, SCI", and the language was limited to English. Meanwhile, the Chinese articles were retrieved in Wanfang database during the same period by imputing the key words of "bone marrow stromal cells, spinal cord injury". Study selection: After the primary check, the quotation of each literature was looked over. Inclusive criteria: the biological features, orientated differentiation and evaluation of MSCs, together with the current research or mechanism about the treatment of SCI by MSCs. Exclusive criteria: repetitive study or Meta analysis. Data extraction: Totally 38 related articles were collected, and 12 of them were excluded due to the dated or repetitive contents. Among 26 articles met the inclusive criteria, 13 ones were about the biological features of MSCs, 3 ones were about the orientated differentiation of MSCs into nerve cells, 1 was about the evaluation of MSCs, 3 ones were about the current researches of the treatment of SCI by MSCs, and 6 ones were about the mechanism of MSCs transplantation in the recovery of SCI. Data synthesis: With great proliferation capability and multi-directional differentiation potential, MSCs are dominant in the cell transplantation and gene treatment, thus MSCs are considered as the replacement sources of various tissue cell transplantations and the effective vehicles of gene treatment. Under the specific induction, MSCs may differentiate into nerve cells. The study results imply, MSCs can be used as a selective source of treating SCI cells due to the convenient material-drawn, easy amplification and simple induced differentiation. MSCs transplantation is a potential treatment for the recovery of SCI. Conclusion: With the profound researches of transgene treatment and associated cell transplantation, MSCs can extend their application on the recovery of SCI owing to the self-renewing and multi-directional differentiation.

33947194417	Robust reliable guaranteed cost control of linear descriptor time-delay systems with actuator failures	This paper deals with the problem of robust reliable guaranteed cost control for a class of uncertain linear descriptor time-delay systems with actuator failures. The parameter uncertainty in the state matrix is assumed in fractional form, which contains the popular norm-bounded uncertainty. And the actuator mold adopted in this paper is in complete form to describe variation of the actuator. The purpose is to design a memoryless state feedback controller such that, for admissible uncertainties as well as actuator failures occurring among the prespecified subset of actuators, the plant remains asymptotically stable and guarantees an adequate level of a quadratic cost index. A sufficient condition for the existence of such controller is derived in the form of Lyapunov inequality. Furthermore, it is showed that a group of linear matrix inequalities provides a parameterized representation of robust reliable guaranteed cost controllers. Based on that, the design problem of the optimal robust guaranteed cost controller is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved by the existing convex optimization techniques. Finally, an example provided in this paper show the technical potentional of this method. © 2006 IEEE.

33847396884	Variations of organic nitrogen forms during composting process using three stages controlled by temperature	Compost is one of the disposal ways for the municipal solid wastes (MSW), and the content of nitrogen (N) effects compost quality. Dynamic changes of organic nitrogen were discussed during MSW composting with three stages controlled by temperature (TSCT) technology. At different compost phases, the samples were taken for the determination of the nitrogen forms, and the effect of TSCT technology on nitrogen forms was studied. During MSW composting, the acid hydrolysis N, total N and amino acid N had a significant correlation and all decreased at the initial stage of composting. While at final stage composting, the contents of acid hydrolysis N, amino acid N, aminosugar N and unidentified N of TSCT treatment increase by 10.67%, 16.17%, 7.17%, 22.44% compared to CK. The results indicate the composting with TSCT technology would reduce the loss of N, improve the quality of MSW compost.

This strain was identified as a gram-negative bacterium, Achromobacter xylosoxidans that could grow on bisphenol A (BPA, a representative endocrine disruptor) as a sole carbon source under aerobic condition. BPA-degrading characteristics of strain B-16 were investigated in liquid cultures. The results show that BPA degradation was influenced by several factors (e.g. inoculum size, substrate concentration, temperature and pH, etc). The half-lives, optimum temperature and pH were found to be 0.58-3.1 d, 35 °C and 7.0, respectively. BPA-degrading activity and cell growth were inhibited at high substrate concentration. Metabolic intermediates detected during the degradation process were identified as p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-hydroquinone, respectively. Metabolic pathway of BPA degradation was proposed in this study. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the compost consisted of residual MSW with the metal, plastic and glass removed. In order to enhance degradation processes and the degree of composting humification, complex microorganisms (Bacillus casei, Lactobacillus buchneri and Candida rugopelliculosa) and ligno-cellulolytic (Trichoderma and White-rot fungi) microorganisms were respectively inoculated in the composting process. During the MSW composting, humic acid (HA) was extracted and purified. Elements (C, N, H, O) and spectroscopic characteristics of the HA were determined using elementary analyzer, UV, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and fluorescence spectroscopy. The elements analysis, UV, FTIR and fluorescence spectra all led to the same conclusion, that is inoculations with microbes led to a greater degree of aromatization of HA than in the control process (CK) with no inoculation microbes. This indicated that inoculation with microbes in composting would improve the degree humification and maturation processes, in the following order: lingo-cellulolytic > complex microorganisms > CK. And mixed inoculation of MSW with complex microorganisms and lingo-cellulolytic during composting gave a greater degree of HA aromatization than inoculation with complex microorganisms or lingo-cellulolytic alone. But comparing with the HA of soil, the HA of MSW compost revealed a lower degree of aromatization. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34047220908	Input-output energy decoupling control for linear neutral time-delay systems	This paper presents an input-output energy decoupling method for linear neutral time-delay systems. It is an approximate decoupling method, under which the energy of every input controls mainly the energy of a corresponding output and influences the energy of other outputs as weakly as possible. The decoupling performance of this method is a compromise between the dynamic decoupling and the static decoupling. By Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions, and applying the LMI technology, this paper gives a sufficient condition for existence of input-output energy decoupling control for linear neutral time-delay systems in the form of matrix inequalities and provides the design of input-output energy decoupling controller for the kind of systems. A numerical example shows the potential of the method proposed in this paper. © 2006 IEEE.

34247272959	Bioremediation of lead-contaminated soils by white-rot fungi as feasible inocula	The simulative lead-contaminated soils were prepared for laboratory experiments. White-rot fungi were used as feasible inocula to bioremedy the contaminated soils. The soil samples essential physico-chemical characteristics, Pb content, and biological parameters including microbial biomass, microbial metabolic quotient, microbial quotient, microbial C/N and microbial community metabolism, were all determined during the bioremediation process to study the soils' changes in physicochemical characteristics, bioavailability of Pb, and microbiological effects. The results showed that the white-rot fungi as the inocula led to the reduction of Pb bioavailability, the alleviation of the potential harm to soil microorganisms from Pb, and the improvement of microbiological effects. After the bioremediation by exogenous white-rot fungi, the Pb mainly existed in residual fractions and Fe-Mn oxides in the soils, and the distribution coefficient of Pb in soluble-exchangeable fraction is 0, and the microbial biomass, community richness and Shannon index reached 2.258 mg/g, 72 and 4.995, respectively.

It was first calibrated and validated using the measured data for the period of 2000-2004. Then the model was used to simulate the effects of watershed delineation scenarios on flow and nutrients loadings, using six watershed delineations, each with a different number of sub-watersheds. The max relative error is 19.6% for the annual mean flow under different watershed delineation scenarios. The flow increase first and then decrease with the number of sub-watersheds. The efficiencies coefficient is 0.52-0.82 for annual mean flow and 0.80-0.83 for monthly mean flow under six delineation scenarios. Outlet nutrients simulations are slightly affected by changes in watershed delineation scenarios. The relative errors of organic nitrogen and organic phosphorous are 16.2% and 7.7% respectively and no explicit trend is observed.

34547102213	A temperature-guided three-stage inoculation method for municipal solid wastes composting	Inoculation is a human-induced measure that can significantly enhance the composting process by increasing the initial microbial population, formulating viable microbial communities, and generating desired enzymes. However, the inoculation efficiency was usually subjected to competitions of indigenous microorganisms. In this study, a temperature-guided three-stage inoculation (TGTSI) method was developed to control the indigenous cell concentrations, and in turn, enhance the composting efficiency. The experimental results indicated that the TGTSI method could effectively suppress the initial cell concentrations of indigenous microorganisms, which resulted in significantly enhancement of biodegradations as well as the reduction of odor emissions. Moreover, a two-stage kinetics method was employed to analyze the TGTSI mechanisms. The model results were consistent with the experimental data. In conclusion, this study implied that TGTSI could not only enhance the composting process but also save system cost. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

The experiments showed that the adsorption isotherms on three sorbents agreed well with linear relation and conformed to Freundlich isotherm; the adsorption ability of soil was stronger than that of ditch sediment, and for the blank ammonium concentrations of soil were higher than that of sediments. The adsorption mechanisms were related to the characteristics of interface, and ion exchange was the main adsorption function under certain concentration range. Effects of temperature on the adsorption of sorbents were observed. The results showed that the quantity of absorbed ammonium slightly decreased with the increasing of temperature under higher concentrations of ammonium.

In contrast to even-even nuclei, odd-odd nuclei can have coexisting low-lying two-quasiparticle states. The low excitation energy and high angular momentum can lead to long-lived isomers. Also, because of the hindrance by spin selection, the probabilities of Î and proton decays from high-spin isomers can be reduced significantly. The present calculations reproduce reasonably well the available data for observed isomers in such nuclei. Unobserved high-spin isomers are predicted, which could be useful for future experimental studies of exotic nuclei at and beyond the proton drip line. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

In Cd106, the mean-lifetimes of the Iπ=12+ state at Ex=5418 keV and the Iπ=11- state at Ex=4324 keV have been deduced as 11.4(17)ps and 8.2(7)ps, respectively. The associated β2 deformation within the axially-symmetric deformed rotor model for these states are 0.14(1) and 0.14(1), respectively. The β2 deformation of 0.14(1) for the Iπ=12+ state in Cd106 compares with a predicted β2 value from total Routhian surface (TRS) calculations of 0.17. In addition, the mean-lifetimes of the yrast Iπ=152- states in Pd103 (at Ex=1262 keV) and Cd107 (at Ex=1360 keV) have been deduced to be 31.2(44)ps and 31.4(17)ps, respectively, corresponding to β2 values of 0.16(1) and 0.12(1) assuming axial symmetry. Agreement with TRS calculations are good for Pd103 but deviate for that predicted for Cd107. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

However, the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) is an exception and is susceptible to HIV-1 infection. This study dissects the molecular mechanism of the pig-tailed macaque's susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. METHODS: Genomic sequencing and expression analysis of the TRIM5α gene was conducted in the pig-tailed macaque. A novel TRIM5-Cyclophilin A fusion gene isoform was identified and subsequently cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector. This construct was transfected into HeLa-T4 or HeLa cells which were then infected with the HIV-1IIIB or HIV-GFP-VSVG pseudotyped virus, to examine the effects of the TRIM5-Cyclophilin A fusion protein on HIV-1 infection. RESULTS: A novel TRIM5-Cyclophilin A fusion gene (mnTRIMCyp) in the pig-tailed macaque was found and its fusion pattern is different from the known fusion gene in the owl monkey (owlTRIMCyp). TRIMCyp protein expression in transfected cells was confirmed by western blotting. The tests using HIV-1IIIB and HIV-GFP-VSVG pseudotyped virus indicated that mnTRIMCyp did not inhibit HIV-1 replication at various multiplicities of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The mnTRIMCyp fusion protein does not restrict replication of HIV-1, which provides a potential molecular mechanism that might explain why the pig-tailed macaque is prone to HIV-1 infection, the only known exception in Old World monkeys. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

The composite specimens were immersed in distilled water and salt solution at 95 and 65 C for more than 1000 h and the moisture absorption was recorded. The diffusion rate of moisture into the composite was found to fit Fickian's diffusion model. SEM observation revealed that the fiber-matrix interface was weakened due to the invasion of moisture leading to debonding. Three-point flexural and interlaminar shear tests showed that both flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the composite specimens deteriorated to some extent after hygrothermal aging, while stiffness was less affected. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) results indicated that the glass transition temperature of the matrix underwent complicated changes, which was attributed to the combinational effects of plasticization and the formation of hydrogen bonds in the systems. © 2006 SAGE Publications.

In the present study, inoculating microbes (ZJ, MS) were used in municipal solid wastes composting, and the composting process was assisted using industrial technology. During composting, DOM was extracted from compost and purified. The spectroscopic characteristics of the DOM were determined using UV, FTIR, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The result showed that at the final stage of composting, the UV, FTIR and fluorescence spectra were similar in shape among all treatments, but the characteristic peaks intensities were different compared with the control process (CK) with no inoculation microbes, and the DOM spectral characteristics of inoculation with microbes showed that the shoulder peak of UV spectra near 280 nm obviously weakened; The FTIR spectrum exhibited a reduction in polysaccharides, and a relative increase in aromatic components; the fluorescence spectra exhibited an increase in aromatic compounds, and the fluorescence spectra of DOM were similar to that of fulvic acid in sewage sludge. Indeed, the UV, FTIR and fluorescence spectra all led to the same conclusion, i.e. treatments by inoculation with microbes led to a greater degree of aromatization of DOM than in CK, in the following order: MS + ZJ >ZJ > MS > CK. At final stage of MSW composting, the DOM spectra of the mixed inoculation of MSW with MS and ZJ was more similar to fulvic acid in sludge. It was indicated that DOM from composting with inoculation MS and ZJ has more activity than that of other treatments.

Humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA), and hydrophilic (HyI) fractions were isolated and purified by the XAD-8 resin combined with the cation exchange resin method. The analytical results of fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) revealed that the fluorescence peaks were protein-like fluorescence for young landfill leachate, while the fluorescence peaks for medium and old landfill leachate were humic-like and fulvic-like fluorescence, respectively. Elemental analysis showed that carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content decreased with landfill age, while the oxygen content increased. Moreover, the nitrogen content in these isolated fractions followed: HA > HyI > FA. The results of elemental analysis, FT-IR, and fluorescence EEMs also confirmed that aromatic carbons and portions of aliphatic functional groups were more abundant in leachate samples with increasing landfill age. © 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Uptake of cadmium was higher in weak acid condition than in strong acid condition. Nearly no sorption of cadmium occurred when the pH value was lower than 2.5. Biosorption isothermal data could be well simulated by Freundlich model, and then Langmuir and Temkin model. Langmuir simulation of the biosorption showed that the maximum uptake of cadmium was 5.58 mmol/g in weak acid condition, which was much higher than many other biosorbents. The exchanged proton was highly related to the uptake of cadmium in weak acid condition. Fourier transform infrared spectrums and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyzer were used to reveal ion-exchange mechanism between cadmium and the functional groups or participated inorganic metal ions during biosorption. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

44649155154	Expression of inhibitor of DNA Binding-2 in the development of neural stem cells in the anterior subventricular zone of developing rat brains	Objective: To know the role of inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) in the development of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the anterior subventricular zone(SVZa). Methods: To examine the expression of Id2 in SVZa, rostral migratory stream (RMS) and olfactory bulb (OB) in E14, P0, P7, P14, P30 adult and old rat brains by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: The expression of Id2 peaked at the area of RMS, and was less positive in SVZa and the least in OB at different time courses of developing rat brains. The expression of Id2 in the three areas in E14 were higher than that on the postnatal day, higher in OB and RMS in adult than that on P0, and remain high in old. However, the expression of Id2 in SVZa in adult was weaker than that on P0. Conclusion: The expression of Id2 in the deveolpment of SVZa NSCs indicates that Id2 plays an important role in blocking the differentiation of SVZa NSCs and increasing the proliferation of SVZa NSCs.

46849121980	Degradation of lead-contaminated lignocellulosic waste by Phanerochaete chrysosporium and the reduction of lead toxicity	Lead, as one of the most hazardous heavy metals to the environment, interferes with lignocellulosic biomass bioconversion and carbon cycles in nature. The degradation of lead-polluted lignocellulosic waste and the restrain of lead hazards by solid-state fermentation with Phanerochaete chrysosporium were studied. Phanerochaete chrysosporium effectively degraded lignocellulose, formed humus and reduced active lead ions, even at the concentration of 400 mg/kg dry mass of lead. The highest lignocellulose degradation (56.8%) and organic matter loss (64.0%) were found at the concentration of 30 mg/kg of lead, and at low concentration of lead the capability of selective lignin biodegradation was enhanced. Microbial growth was delayed in polluted substrate at the initial stage of fermentation, and organic matter loss is correlated positively with microbial biomass after 12 day fermentation. It might be because Phanerochaete chrysosporium developed active defense mechanism to alleviate the lead toxicity. Scanning electron micrographs with energy spectra showed that lead was immobilized via two possible routes: adsorption and cation exchange on hypha, and the chelation by fungal metabolite. The present findings will improve the understandings about the degradation process and the lead immobilization pathway, which could be used as references for developing a fungi-based treatment technology for metal-contaminated lignocellulosic waste. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

46449100971	High-spin states in Yb156 and structure evolutions at large angular momenta in even-A Yb isotopes	High-spin states of Yb156 have been studied via the Sm144(O16,4n)Yb156 fusion-evaporation reaction at beam energy 102 MeV. The positive-parity yrast band and negative-parity cascade have been extended up to higher-spin states, respectively. In the present work, the negative-parity sequence above the 25- state was found to be irregular and fragment into many parallel branches. This pattern may related to the excitation from the nucleon in the Z=64,N=82 core. The characteristics of alignment plot and E-GOS curve for the positive-parity yrast sequence in Yb156 indicate that this nucleus may undergo an evolution from quasivibrational to quasirotational structure with increasing angular momentum. Based on a systematic summary of the available experimental alignments for the even-A Yb156,158,160,162,164 isotopes, the structural evolutions induced by the increase in angular momentum, as well as by the change in neutron numbers, in these even-A Yb isotopes have been discussed in comparison with the cranked Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky calculations by means of total-Routhian-surface (TRS) methods. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

4744358487	Ecological risk assessment of Dongting Lake watershed	The regional ecological risk assessment is studied for Dongting Lake watershed. The research contents include analysis of risk resources, receptor analysis, exposure and hazard analysis, and comprehensive assessment. The results show that the biological and important index, whose values are 40 and 40.9, respectively, of the west part of Dongting Lake is the highest. This means that the ecological structure is presently reasonable and the attention to its eco-system is yet necessary for avoidance of its deterioration. The diversity index of the south part of Dongting Lake is the highest, which means that the species are rich and their protection is the urgent affairs. The fragility and disaster index of the east part of Dongting Lake, with the values of 3.7 and 12.4, respectively, are bigger. So preventing the change of peripheral condition and increasing plant coverage rate are necessary. The toxicity pollution index of the south part of Dongting Lake is higher, so decreasing the wastewater discharge is necessary. Analyzed from risk resources, the flood disaster is the biggest restrictive factor, and the pollution is the next. It's also concluded from the research that the ecological risk of the west part of Dongting Lake is the highest, that is, facing the same risk, the damage of the west part of Dongting Lake is the most serious.

The purpose of this study is to tackle uncertainties in determining the index system of ecosystem health assessment. After analyzing large amounts of unknown variability of the index system, and adopting the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we proposed an integrated fuzzy assessment model for urban river ecosystem. A three-level indicator system of river ecosystem health assessment was developed, which included ecological identity indicators, integrated functions indicators and social influence indicators. Furthermore, the method was applied, as a case study, to the ecosystem health assessment of Xiangjiang River, Changsha city. The research result has shown that its health grade is 0.51, which is close to sick and need to be guarded against. It has also suggested that the assessment model can provide decision-making basis for ecosystem protection, maintenance and restoration.

50949134239	Form distribution and transformation of Pb in composting of Pb-polluted lignocellulosic waste with white-rot fungi	A major limitation of land application of compost is the potential heavy metal pollution, and lead (Pb) has been recognized as one of the most hazardous heavy metal. To reduce the hazards of Pb to the compost application, composting of Pb-polluted wastes by inoculating white-rot fungi was investigated. The parallel waste composting with no inoculants was performed as control. The form distribution and transformation of Pb during composting were discussed. Results showed that the active Pb ion was transformed into the inactive phase during composting. The soluble-exchangeable Pb with high toxicity in composting with white-rot fungi was reduced to 0 mg/kg dry weight compost at day 50, while that of the control only achieved 100.5 mg/kg till day 60. The higher content of organic-bound Pb (121.0 mg/kg) and residual Pb (141.9 mg/kg) with low toxicity was found after 60-day composting with white-rot fungi, compared to those in control. Meanwhile, the higher microbial biomass was observed in composting with white-rot fungi, and Pb concentrations correlated to the microbial biomass. All the results indicated that the method of composting with white-rot fungi reduced the transfer and bioavailability of Pb in compost so as to alleviate the potential stress of metal, and also improved the microbial growth. © 2008 IEEE.

In this study, fast responsive thermo- and pH-sensitive poly[(N,N-diethylacrylamide)-co-(acrylic acid)] hydrogels were prepared by free radical copolymerization in aqueous solution using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a pore-forming agent. Results: Swelling studies showed that the hydrogels produced had both temperature and pH sensitivity. The deswelling kinetics at high temperature demonstrated that the shrinking rates were influenced by the addition of the pore-forming agent and the amount of acrylic acid in the initial total monomers. The deswelling curves in low-buffer solutions had two stages. Pulsatile swelling studies indicated that the PEG-modified hydrogels were superior to the normal ones. These different swelling properties were further confirmed by the results of scanning electron microscopy. Conclusion: Such fast responsive thermo- and pH-sensitive hydrogels are expected to be useful in biomedical fields for stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.

54149091398	An inexact multi-objective dynamic model and its application in China for the management of municipal solid waste	With the development of science and technology, solid waste management has become a serious environmental problem for most communities all over the world. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model for the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) via an uncertainty approach. In this model, the system cost of solid waste management and the environmental impact are considered as the main objectives, and some necessary constraints based on the characteristics of China are included; additionally, Pollution loss theory is applied to evaluate the environmental impact. This model is applied to the City of Fo Shan, China. Compared with the primary project of Fo Shan, which is provided by the government, the results of the optimization procedure show that the overall system cost could be reduced by $1-2.4/ton, i.e., $3.7 million/yr. The model presented in this paper was proven to be an effective response to the multi-objective solid waste management problem, and provides a new technique to optimize MSW management and operation. Why is the optimization result better? By analyzing the modelling with respect to function, constraints, and results, we conclude that the profit would be augmented due to the amount of the waste that would be treated by recycling technology, which would increase rapidly during the planning time; thus, the total system cost could be reduced accordingly. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The correlation between growing weeks, plant height, crown diameter, leaf number of "White Swan" and flower bud differentiation period was also discussed. The results are as follows: (1) The plant height, crown diameter and leaf number of "White Sawn" appeared significant difference in different time under two photoperiods. It is indicated that they are sensitivity to photoperiod in different extents. (2) According to first flowering time, it is concluded that "White Swan" is a facultative short day plant. (3) Under the short days, "White Swan" is shorter, and flower diameter is smaller when flowering. (4) The flower bud differentiation period of "White Swan" could be divided into eight stages. (5) Significant correlation exists between growing weeks, height, leaf number, and crown diameter of "White Swan" and flower bud differentiation period. (6) According to flower bud differentiation, the best treatment is that "White Swan" is cultivated under the condition of short day until the plant height is 9cm, leaf number is 8, and crown diameter is 16 cm, and then induced by long day. Under the conditions, "White Swan" can bloom early and the flower quality is good.

57149086940	Study on fluorescence characteristic of dissolved organic matter from municipal solid waste landfill leachate	In the present study, the samples of leachate of 0, 5, 10-years-old landfill were respectively taken from landfill plant, the dissolved organic matter (DOM) was extracted from landfill leachate, and the fluorescence spectra of DOM were determined. The fluorescence synchronous scan spectra of DOM in 0-year-old leachate exhibited a primary peak at 335 nm, a secondary peak at 455 nm, and a shoulder peak at 385 nm. While the fluorescence intensities of DOM at different peaks were decreased for 5-year-old leachate, especially those of the peaks at shorter wavelengths (335 and 385 nm) which may be ascribed that the simpler structural components were decreased sharply. Compared with 5-year-old leachate, the fluorescence intensity of DOM in 10-year-old leachate decreased slightly. Three-dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra (3DEEM) of DOM in 0-year-old leachate exhibited two peaks at Ex/Em wavelength pairs of 270/355 and 220/350, respectively, which were all associated with protein-derived compounds, while the peaks of protein-like disappeared in 5-year-old leachate, and new peaks of complex structural fulvic acid-like were formed at Ex/Em wavelength pair of 330/412.5 and 250/416.5, respectively. This indicated the component of DOM in the leachate of 5-year-old landfill led to a decrease in low molecular compound, and an increase in high molecular compound compared to that of the 0-year-old. 3DEEM of DOM of 10-year-old leachate was similar to that of DOM in the 5-year-old, but the fluorescence intensity of the peaks of fulvic acid-like in DOM was different, and compared with that of 5-year-old leachate, the peak of DOM in 10-year-old leachate shifted from Ex/Em wavelength pair of 250/416.5 to 250/427.5. This indicated that the DOM formed similar structures, but the structure of fulvic acid-like in DOM of 10-year-old leachate had a greater degree of aromatization and quantity than that of 5-year-old leachate. The results obtained from fluorescence synchronous scan spectroscopy and 3DEEM indicate that aromatic structures of DOM are enriched with the age of landfill leachate.

Non-human primates such as Chinese Rhesus Macaque (CRM) are the favorable models for preclinical study of potential therapeutic drugs, vaccines and mechanisms of human diseases. However, the phenotypical characterization of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from CRM has not been elucidated. Monocytes from CRM were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 in RPMI-1640. Six days later, these cells were differentiated with typical dendritical morphology. CD11c and DC-SIGN were highly expressed. The immature MDDCs expressed the low levels of CD25, CD80, CD83, moderate CD40, CD86, and high MHC. After stimulation, the mature MDDCs increased expression of mature molecules CD25 and CD83, co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86 and CD40, and kept a high level of MHC. The capacity of endocytosis decreased with maturation. The mature MDDCs have strong ability of inducing allogeneic T cell proliferation and producing IL-12. In conclusion, we have characterized the phenotype and ultimate function of MDDCs from CRM for the first time. ©2009 Chinese Society of Immunology and University of Science & Technology of China.

70249145854	Experimental study and numerical simulation on propagation characteristics of wing type cracks under compression	The propagation characteristics of wing type cracks under compression were studied experimentally. The propagation path and the characteristic of propagation load were obtained. On this basis, the propagation process of cracks was further studied by numerical simulation. The secondary development of software ABAQUS was implemented to automatically re-mesh the finite element meshes, and the maximum circumferential stress fracture criterion was used to determine the growth direction of cracks. Then, the growth of wing type cracks was simulated by using FEM and the propagation path as well as the mixed-mode stress-intensity factor of cracks can be obtained. The comparison of numerical simulation with experimental result shows that the propagation path of wing type crack towards an asymptotic line which passing through the center of the crack and parallel to the direction of maximum main stress. The mixed-mode stress-intensity factor of the wing type cracks is reduced gradually following the increase of crack length. For the cracks on finite plate, the boundary effect should be taken into account.

70349558419	Effects of hygrothermal aging on the thermal- mechanical properties of vinylester resin and its pultruded carbon fiber composites	Hygrothermal aging was carried out on vinyl ester (VE) resin cast and its pultruded carbon fiber reinforced composite (CF/VE) by immersing them in distilled water at 65 and 95°C. Hygrothermal aging effects on the samples were studied in terms of thermal-mechanical properties, as well as moisture absorption behavior, interfacial adhesion, and transverse mechanical properties. Moisture absorption behaviors of the VE casts and the CF/VE composites were characterized as Fick- ian behavior. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) tests showed that the tan δ peak temperatures of the VE casts and CF/VE composites decreased with immersion time at 65 and 95°C. Moreover, there existed a splitting in the tan δ peaks at 95°C, which was reversible and could be recovered by dehydration. Three- point flexural test indicated that flexural strengths of both the VE casts and the composites decreased by hygrothermal aging with a trend related to their moisture absorption behaviors, while flexural modulus of the composites was less affected. The ILSS of the CF/ VE composites was also depressed by deterioration in interfacial adhesion, which was proved by the interfa- cial adhesion parameters, A and α. © 2009 Society of Plastics Engineers.

70749101564	A hybrid uncertainty programming for long-term planning of municipal solid waste in Beijing City	An interval-parameter chance-constraint mixed integer linear programming modeling was proposed based on the system analysis of the municipal solid waste management system of Beijing. The treatment facility expansions, waste flows and system costs resulting from confidence levels of constraints were analyzed. The optimal solution indicated that the increased violation level may lead to the high utilization rate, but may cause high system cost. Take the current waste management situation and the goal of "the Eleventh 5-year Planning" of Beijing into account, 3 different policy scenarios were predefined: scenario 1 was based on the current waste management situation; scenario 2 was assumed to reach higher diversion rates to composting and incinerating facilities; scenario 3 was pre-regulated according to "the Eleventh 5-year Planning" of Beijing. The optimization results demonstrated that scenario 2 and scenario 3 could prolong the landfills' lifespan for 5 and 10 years, respectively, while it might lead to high system cost.

72149106156	In vitro cytotoxicity and drug release properties of pH- and temperature-sensitive core-shell hydrogel microspheres	A simple method has been developed to prepare smart P(N,N-diethylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (P(DEA-co-MAA)) microspheres that consist of well-defined temperature-sensitive cores and pH sensitive shells. The microgels have been prepared by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization using water as the solvent. The core-shell hydrogel microspheres have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV spectrometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron micrograph (TEM). Preliminary characterization of the biocompatibility of hydrogel microspheres has been done by the cytotoxicity assays using the HeLa human breast cancer cell line as probes. The in vitro drug release indicates that drug release rate, encapsulation efficiency (EE) and release kinetics depend upon the pH value and copolymer composition. According to this study, the hydrogel microspheres based on P(DEA-co-MAA) could serve as suitable candidate for drug site-specific carrier in intestine. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

73649088337	Structure of the N=126 nuclide Rn212: Valence and core excited configurations	The level scheme of Rn212 has recently been expanded and extended to spins of ~39 and excitation energies of about 13 MeV using the Hg204(C13,5n)Rn212 reaction and γ-ray spectroscopy. Time-correlated techniques were used to obtain channel selectivity and improved sensitivity. New γ-ray branches from states associated with valence proton configurations as well as a number of new states below the 22+ isomer have been identified. The excitation energy of the 22+ core excited isomer itself has been established through the observation of several branches parallel to the main decay, implying a transition energy of 7.6 keV for the previously unobserved decay to the 202+ state. The level scheme above the 22+ isomer includes two new isomers with τ=25(2) ns and τ=12(2) ns placed at 12,211 and 12,548 keV, respectively. These are attributed to configurations involving triple neutron core excitations coupled to the aligned valence protons. The results are compared to semiempirical shell-model calculations, which can account for many of the states observed, with considerable precision for the valence proton configurations but with significant energy discrepancies for some core excited configurations. Calculations within the deformed independent particle model (DIPM) have also been carried out for the main core excited configurations at high spin and compared with both experiment and the empirical shell-model approach. The possible sources of discrepancies in both approaches are discussed, and it is suggested that anomalously low excitation energies are predicted for specific configurations in the DIPM. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

75849134438	A novel method to prepare temperature/pH-sensitive poly (N, N-diethylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels with rapid swelling/deswelling behaviors	Fast responsive temperature-and pH-sensitive hydrogels of poly(N, N-diethylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (P(DEA-co-AA)) have been synthesized successfully by a two-step procedure, in which the initial polymerization was conducted at constant temperature for 15 min, followed by further polymerization at S30°C for 12 hr. Swelling studies showed that hydrogels thus prepared had almost the same temperature and pH sensitivity compared with the conventional ones (polymerized at 24°C for 12 hr). However, hydrogels thus prepared had faster swelling/deswelling rates in distilled water than the conventional ones, and their deswelling rates in low pH buffer solutions were also faster than the conventional ones. These improved properties were attributed to the porous network structure, which was confirmed by the results of scanning electron microscopy. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

76749147307	Changes of microbial population structure related to lignin degradation during lignocellulosic waste composting	Microbial populations and their relationship to bioconversion during lignocellulosic waste composting were studied by quinone profiling. Nine quinones were observed in the initial composting materials, and 15 quinones were found in compost after 50 days of composting. The quinone species Q-9(H2), Q-10 and Q-10(H2) which are indicative of certain fungi appeared at the thermophilic stage but disappeared at the cooling stage. Q-10, indicative of certain fungi, and MK-7, characteristic of certain bacteria, were the predominant quinones during the thermophilic stage and were correlated with lignin degradation at the thermophilic stage. The highest lignin degradation ratio (26%) and good cellulose degradation were found at the cooling stage and were correlated with quinones Q-9, MK-7 and long-chain menaquinones attributed to mesophilic fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes, respectively. The present findings will improve the understandings of microbial dynamics and roles in composting, which could provide useful references for development of composting technology. © 2010.

77949567587	Dual-stimuli sensitive composites based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes and poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels	A strategy to prepare dual-stimuli sensitive poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) composite hydrogels has been demonstrated. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with vinyl groups were copolymerized with N,N-diethylacrylamide (DEA), acrylic acid (AA) and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (NNMBA) to obtain the composites (NCG). As expected, the compression properties of the NCG were greatly improved without noticeably reducing the response rates to temperature changes. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface of the NCG was denser, which affords the NCG better compression properties, while there was obvious MWCNTs aggregation on the surface of the hybrid gel sample by physical mixing of the MWCNTs (HYG). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of this additive on the property of resulting PDEA hydrogels was investigated and characterized. The interior morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that PDADMAC introduced PDEA hydrogels have large and interconnected porous network structures. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies showed the difference in the state of the water between PDEA and semi-IPN hydrogels. The incorporating of PDADMAC significantly improved the equilibrium swelling ratio of modified hydrogels when comparing with a normal PDEA hydrogel. The semi-IPN hydrogels exhibited improved thermosensitive characteristics, such as faster deswelling and swelling rates and great oscillating deswelling-swelling behavior, and the level of improvement depended on the PDADMAC content. The swelling dynamic transport of the hydrogels was analyzed based on the Fickian equation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77952671004	Progesterone attenuates neurological behavioral deficits of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis through remyelination with nucleus-sublocalized Olig1 protein	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelination disease of central nervous system (CNS). The deterioration of the disease is characterized by the axonal loss with defective remyelination. Progesterone can promote the remyelination, but whether it exerts beneficial effect on treatment of MS still remains unclear. Olig1 protein is a key regulator in the remyelination, when the intracellular sublocalization plays an import role too. We observed the effect of progesterone on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats by injecting the progesterone after the neurological behavioral deficits were shown up. The results showed no continuous increase of the nervous function score from day 10 after injection (p<0.05). Electron microscopy and LFB staining found prominent increase of OD value of normal myelin in the brain from day 6 after injection (p<0.05). Olig1 protein was localized almost completely in the cytoplasm of Olig1-positive cells from normal rats' brain. In EAE rats, the Olig1 protein has been translocated to the nucleus of 32.17% of Olig1-positive cells, which was increased to 68.52% after injection with progesterone at day 6 after injection (p<0.01). The results indicate that the progesterone is beneficial to attenuating neurological behavioral deficits, for it can promote more successful remyelination of EAE with aid of the nucleus-sublocalized Olig1 protein. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77953051342	Emission control strategies for nitrogen and phosphorus in the Poyang Lake Watershed based on computable general equilibrium model	Lake eutrophication as a result of economic growth, has become one of the most serious environment problems. This paper aims to explore the decision making information for coordinating economic growth and the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions in the Poyang Lake Watershed. An Environmental Computable General Equilibrium (ECGE) model based on the theory of mathematical optimization solution is introduced in this paper. On the basis of the 2008 provincial statistic data from yearbooks, an input-output table were created with indispensable parameters for this study. Following this, an inter-regional trade matrix was built to describe the regional trade and emissions among provinces. The coupled relationship between economic growth and emission reduction were explored and illustrated by applying the ECGE model. According to the estimates, a couple of strategies and one scenario for reducing the emission of nitrogen and phosphorus from those sectors with high emissions were identified. In addition, investment in scientific research and management also plays an important role in the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions at a regional level.

Methods: Stratified sampling in 55 villages were selected in 3 areas with slight, moderate and severe fluorosis regions in Tianjin from April to June in 2008. Water fluorine were tested and clinical osteofluorosis examinations were conducted to the population aging 16 and above in the villages. Tweenty villages were selected randomly in the slight, moderate and severe fluorosis regions. X-ray osteofluorosis examination were conducted to patients and suspected patients in these 20 villages. Results: The geometric mean fluoride content in the water for the 3 areas were 1.35 mg/L, 3.44 mg/L, 5.49 mg/L, respectively. The prevalence of osteofluorosis were 36.7% (44/120), 20.6% (33/160), 39.4% (43/109), respectively. The prevalence of osteofluorosis was increased gradually (r = 0.534, P < 0.01) and the symptoms and signs of the disease were more serious (H = 84.813, P < 0.01). The prevalence of X-ray diagnosis was increased gradually (r = 0.990, P < 0.01) and signs of the disease were more severe (H = 25.169, P < 0.01) with an increase in age.

77955032876	Determination and comparison of digestion kinetics of two fibre sources in geese (Anseris)	The aim of this study was to determine and compare the digestion kinetics of two fibre sources (lucerne, maize stalk) in different segments of the digestive tract of geese. Sixty Jilin nongan white geese were divided into two groups and fed with a lucerne or maize stalk diet. After 30 days of feeding, all of the geese were fed with Co-EDTA as the marker of liquid digesta, and n-alkane was used as an internal marker. At 1.0 h, 2.0 h, 3.0 h, 4.0 h and 5.0 h after Co-EDTA was fed, five geese per treatment per time period were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Content of the glandular stomach, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and rectum were collected for the evaluation of the parameters of digestion kinetics. The results showed that digestion kinetics of fibre in geese fed with a lucerne diet is consistent with that of a maize stalk diet. Within the digestive tract, digesta flow was the highest in the jejunum, and the slowest in the gizzard. Mean retention time of the digesta was the longest in the gizzard and duodenum. The digestibility of NDF, ADF and HC was the highest in duodenum, gizzard and duodenum and caecum respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that the gizzard and duodenum might play important roles in the digestion of crude fibre in geese. © South African Society for Animal Science.

The number-average weight of three macromonomers determined by gel permeation chromatography of the terminal hydroxyl groups was 8355, 10,516 and 15,953, respectively. The comb-type grafted poly(DEA-co-DMAEMA) hydrogels having the different lengths of the grafted chains were synthesized in the presence of crosslinker. Equilibrium and dynamic swelling/deswelling properties of the prepared hydrogels responding to temperature and pH were investigated. Compared to normal-type hydrogel, the comb-type grafted hydrogels exhibited excellent variational values in response to an alternation of the temperature and pH. Moreover, the grafted hydrogels showed quite fast reswelling and deswelling behaviors in response to simultaneous dual temperature and pH stimuli. This is because that the introduction of side chains with freely mobile ends in the comb-type grafted hydrogels made the mobility of the networks increased. The responsive rates of the grafted hydrogels were also controlled by modifying the length of the grafted chains. The dual thermo- and pH-sensitive comb-type grafted poly(DEA-co-DMAEMA) hydrogels in this study may find various potential applications. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0035674189	Relative efficiency of marker assisted selection when marker and QTL are incompletely linked	The relative superiority in selection response of two basic marker-assisted selection strategies, marker-assisted BLUP (MBLUP) and two-stage selection, in comparison to standard BLUP was investigated using stochastic simulation of a closed nucleus herd. In marker-assisted BLUP the marker information and the phenotypic information were utilized simultaneously for selecting parental animals, whereas in two-stage selection they were utilized separately in two stages. Different heritabilities and QTL sizes were considered in the simulation. The QTL was assumed to be referred only via flanking markers, which were incompletely linked to the QTL. It was shown that both MBLUP and two-stage selection increased the QTL response but decreased the polygenic response. When the heritability was low or the QTL effect was large MBLUP was superior to standard BLUP by up to 5% with respect to total genetic response. While the two-stage selection did not show any superiority although it gave extremely large increase in QTL response due to a rapid increase in favorable QTL allele frequency. The relative responses of MAS were stark associated with the generations of selection. The superiority or inferiority of MAS was large in the early generations and became small or vanished in the later generations.

80052424625	Exponential stability of nonlinear neutral stochastic differential equations with Markovian switching	Neutral stochastic differential equations (NSDEs) have recently been studied intensively. Given that many systems are often subject to component failures of repairs, changing subsystem interconnections and abrupt environmental disturbances etc., the structure and parameters of underlying NSDEs may change abruptly. One way to model such abrupt changes is to use the continuous-time Markov chains. As a result, the underlying NSDE become NSDE with Markovian switching which are hybrid systems. So few results are known about the NSDEs with Markovian switching and the aim of this paper is to close this gap. In this paper, a new condition for the exponential stability in the mean-square sense of such systems is given, which improved the existed condition, and its proof also implies the almost sure stability of such systems. © 2011 IEEE.

By applying an input delay approach, the system is transformed into a continuous time-delay system. Using the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMIs) method, a robust guaranteed cost sampled-data control law is derived to guarantee that the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system and the quadratic performance index less a certain bound for all admissible uncertainties. Sufficient conditions for the existence of state-feedback controller are obtained in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A convex optimization problem is formulated to obtain the optimal state-feedback controller which can minimize the quadratic performance level. The effectiveness of the proposed method can be illustrated by the simulation example. © 2011 IEEE.

Under an artificial marine environment with high ion-strength, the prepared polyelectrolytes/AuNPs hybrid film becomes rougher and possesses a higher water ratio, which in turn endows the film with superoleophobicity and low underwater oil adhesion.

84878030062	Cytophilic/cytophobic design of nanomaterials at biointerfaces	To control interactions between cells and nanomaterials has been a great challenge because numerous nanomaterials have been intensively explored in the fields of biology and medicine. However, current surface modification of nanomaterials is mainly carried out in an empirical way. Herein, a general strategy to tune the surface chemistry of nanomaterials is proposed based on cell affinity, that is, cytophilic or cytophobic. The cell affinity of nanomaterials directly affects cellular response to materials at the very early stage of cell-material interactions before other events, such as endocytosis, cell spreading, and cell differentiation, occur. In this Concept, it is suggested that there is a developing library of cytophilic and cytophobic moieties, and how the cell affinity of nanomaterials functions at biointerfaces is discussed by exemplifying several applications, namely therapy, tissue engineering, and biosensors. It is believed that control of the cytophilic/cytophobic property will be helpful in guiding the design of functional nanomaterials for their biomedical applications. A general strategy for designing the surface chemistry of nanomaterials is proposed on the basis of cytophilic/cytophobic affinity. Based on the strategy, nanomaterials can be designed with controlled cell affinity, or new cytophilic/cytophobic moieties can be explored. Controlling the surface cytophilic/cytophobic properties of nanomaterials is crucial for their biomedical applications, such as therapy, tissue engineering, and biosensors.

84878237164	Dual-responsive surfaces modified with phenylboronic acid-containing polymer brush to reversibly capture and release cancer cells	Artificial stimuli-responsive surfaces that can mimic the dynamic function of living systems have attracted much attention. However, there exist few artificial systems capable of responding to dual- or multistimulation as the natural system does. Herein, we synthesize a pH and glucose dual-responsive surface by grafting poly(acrylamidophenylboronic acid) (polyAAPBA) brush from aligned silicon nanowire (SiNW) array. The as-prepared surface can reversibly capture and release targeted cancer cells by precisely controlling pH and glucose concentration, exhibiting dual-responsive AND logic. In the presence of 70 mM glucose, the surface is pH responsive, which can vary from a cell-adhesive state to a cell-repulsive state by changing the pH from 6.8 to 7.8. While keeping the pH at 7.8, the surface becomes glucose responsive - capturing cells in the absence of glucose and releasing cells by adding 70 mM glucose. Through simultaneously changing the pH and glucose concentration from pH 6.8/0 mM glucose to pH 7.8/70 mM glucose, the surface is dual responsive with the capability to switch between cell capture and release for at least 5 cycles. The cell capture and release process on this dual-responsive surface is noninvasive with cell viability higher than 95%. Moreover, topographical interaction between the aligned SiNW array and cell protrusions greatly amplifies the responsiveness and accelerates the response rate of the dual-responsive surface between cell capture and release. The responsive mechanism of the dual-responsive surface is systematically studied using a quartz crystal microbalance, which shows that the competitive binding between polyAAPBA/sialic acid and polyAAPBA/glucose contributes to the dual response. Such dual-responsive surface can significantly impact biomedical and biological applications including cell-based diagnostics, in vivo drug delivery, etc. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Inspired by the anisotropic protein nanofibers in scab, a polyurethane (PU) nanofibrous membrane with an aligned structure was fabricated. The membrane showed good affinity for wound-healing-related cells and could guide cell migration in the direction of PU nanofibers. Also, the morphology and distribution of F-actin and paxillin of attached cells were influenced by the underlying nanofibers. The randomly distributed PU nanofibers and planar PU membrane did not show a distinct impact on cell migration.

However, in other areas, such as rare cancer-cell capture and isolation, the importance of the softness of materials has not yet been studied. Extracellular matrix suitable for cell contact and survival is formed from soft materials with specific molecules and nanostructures. Herein, we report a soft polystyrene nanotube substrate inspired by the cell microenvironment that achieves rapid and highly efficient breast cancer-cell capture from whole-blood samples with high cell viability by integrating the soft nature of polystyrene polymer with specific capture agents and surface structures.

To investigate the mechanism of iodide- and fluoride-induced thyroid cytotoxicity, human thyroid follicular epithelial cells (Nthy-ori 3-1) were treated with different concentrations of potassium iodide (KI), with or without sodium fluoride (NaF). Cell morphology, viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, apoptosis, and expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway-related molecules were assessed. Results showed 50. mM of KI, 1. mM of NaF, and 50. mM of KI +1. mM of NaF changed cellular morphology, decreased viability, and increased LDH leakage and apoptosis. Elevated expression of binding protein (BiP), IRE1, and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA and protein, as well as spliced X-box-binding protein-1 (sXBP-1) mRNA, were observed in the 1. mM NaF and 50. mM KI +1. mM NaF groups. Collectively, excessive iodide and/or fluoride is cytotoxic to the human thyroid. Although these data do not manifest iodide could induce the IRE1 pathway, the cytotoxicity followed by exposure to fluoride alone or in combination with iodide may be related to IRE1 pathway-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, exposure to the combination of excessive iodide and fluoride may cause interactive effects on thyroid cytotoxicity. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84896141610	Brain sensorimotor system atrophy during the early stage of spinal cord injury in humans	Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually leads to severe sensory and motor deficits below the spinal lesion. Previous animal models have shown significant atrophic changes in the neural sensorimotor system following SCI. However, specific anatomical changes in the human brain following SCI remain poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to investigate structural changes during the early stage of SCI, and to investigate further the association between the structural changes and patients' sensorimotor functions. The study participants included 20 patients with SCI and 30 matched healthy controls. The mean period post-SCI was 8.9 ± 2.7. weeks (range 4-12. weeks). Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the regions with gray and white matter volume changes. Compared to healthy controls, patients with SCI showed significant gray matter atrophy in the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), supplementary motor area (SMA), and thalamus, as well as white matter atrophy in the corticospinal tracts at the level of the bilateral cerebral peduncles. In addition, gray matter volume in the primary motor cortex was positively correlated with the total American Spinal Injury Association motor score in patients with SCI. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SCI causes significant anatomical changes in the human sensorimotor system, and that these anatomical changes may occur in the early phase of SCI. Future treatments that aim to restore sensorimotor functions following SCI need to attend to these anatomical changes in the brain. © 2014 IBRO.

84899452392	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based thermo-responsive surfaces with controllable cell adhesion	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-based thermo-responsive surfaces can switch their wettability (from wettable to non-wettable) and adhesion (from sticky to non-sticky) according to external temperature changes. These smart surfaces with switchable interfacial properties are playing increasingly important roles in a diverse range of biomedical applications; these controlling cell-adhesion behavior has shown great potential for tissue engineering and disease diagnostics. Herein we reviewed the recent progress of research on PNIPAAm-based thermo-responsive surfaces that can dynamically control cell adhesion behavior. The underlying response mechanisms and influencing factors for PNIPAAm-based surfaces to control cell adhesion are described first. Then, PNIPAAm-modified two-dimensional flat surfaces for cell-sheet engineering and PNIPAAm-modified three-dimensional nanostructured surfaces for diagnostics are summarized. We also provide a future perspective for the development of stimuli-responsive surfaces. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84905444791	The effects and underlying mechanism of excessive iodide on excessive fluoride-induced thyroid cytotoxicity	In many regions, excessive fluoride and excessive iodide coexist in groundwater, which may lead to biphasic hazards to human thyroid. To explore fluoride-induced thyroid cytotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the effects of excessive iodide on fluoride-induced cytotoxicity, a thyroid cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1) was exposed to excessive fluoride and/or excessive iodide. Cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, apoptosis, and the expression levels of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway-related molecules were detected. Fluoride and/or iodide decreased cell viability and increased LDH leakage and apoptosis. ROS, the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), IRE1, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and spliced X-box-binding protein-1 (sXBP-1) were enhanced by fluoride or the combination of the two elements. Collectively, excessive fluoride and excessive iodide have detrimental influences on human thyroid cells. Furthermore, an antagonistic interaction between fluoride and excessive iodide exists, and cytotoxicity may be related to IRE1 pathway-induced apoptosis. © 2014.

10944231272	Factors influencing the organic solid waste biodegradation in aerobic vessel compost system	The main factors influencing the organic solid waste biodegradation in aerobic vessel compost system, which included the kinds of composting materials, temperature, moisture content, particle size and C/N ratio in aerobic composting, were investigated by doing a set of bench-scale laboratory experiments. The study shows that the optimum process conditions are 40-50°C, 50% moisture content 30 mm particle size and the C/N ratio of 30:1. The experiment results show that these factors shall be strictly controlled in a proper range to ensure composting reactions. The factors were compared through orthogonal experiments. The results show that moisture content is the most significant factor in TOC biodegradation, C/N ratio the next, and the temperature and particle size the least.

10044247391	Structural performance of the staggered-truss system	According to basic theory of structural mechanics and earthquake engineering mechanical performance of the staggered-truss system under the action of vertical load, seismic load and wind load was expounded based upon mechanical principium. The whole system mainly bears axial force under the action of all sorts of loads and there is almost neither shearing force nor moment on the side column. Based on mechanical character of the staggered-truss system, anti-seismic performance of this system was discussed. The staggered-truss system has nice and seismic performance with very small story drift under the action of both weak earthquake and strong earthquake. Anti-seismic performances of three kinds of trusses were analyzed and compared deeply and thoroughly, as indicated that Pratt truss has poor hysteresis property but Vierendeel truss has nice hysteresis property and has uniformly yielding distribution, and the truss integrated with Pratt truss and Vierendeel truss has good anti-seismic performance and gives us the feeling of clear arrangement line of defence.

11344280075	Marker of hyperplastic scar: Expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in scar tissues	Aim: To observe the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA) in scar tissues, and find an objective marker to assess hyperplastic scars. Methods: Twenty-four cases of the expression of PCNA in nonproliferative scars, hyperplastic scar tissues and their surrounding normal tissues were observed with immunohistochemical staining. Results: The expression of PCNA was weakly positive in normal skin tissues with a positive cell rate of (12.3 ± 2.6)%, was positive in nonproliferative scar tissues with a positive cell rate of (18.4 ± 6.8)%, was strongly positive in hyperplastic scar tissues with a positive cell rate of (45.3 ± 12.6)%. The paired sample t test analysis showed that the positive cell rate of PCNA in the hyperplastic scar tissues was obviously higher than that in the nonproliferative scars tissues(P < 0,01), but there was no significant difference between the nonproliferative scars and the normal tissues(P > 0.05). Conclusion: The positive cell rate in the expression of PCNA is related with the type of scars, especially in the hyperplastic scar tissues are obvious, which can be used to judge the proliferative level of scar tissues.
