0030925023	Identification of a kinetically distinct activity of 11β- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in rat leydig cells	Leydig cells are susceptible to direct glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of testosterone biosynthesis but can counteract the inhibition through 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), which oxidatively inactivates glucocorticoids. Of the two isoforms of 11β-HSD that have been identified, type 1 is an NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductase that is relatively insensitive to inhibition by end product and carbenoxolone (CBX). The type I form has been shown to be predominantly reductive in liver parenchymal cells and other tissues. In contrast, type II, which is postulated to confer specificity in mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated responses, acts as an NAD-dependent oxidase that is potently inhibited by both end product and CBX. The identity of the 11β-HSD isoform in Leydig cells is uncertain, because the protein in this cell is recognized by an anti-type I 11β-HSD antibody, but the activity is primarily oxidative, more closely resembling type II. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the kinetic properties of 11β-HSD in Leydig cells are consistent with type I, type II, or neither. Leydig cells were purified from male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g), and 11β- HSD was evaluated in Leydig cells by measuring rates of oxidation and reduction, cofactor preference, and inhibition by end product and CBX. Leydig cells were assayed for type I and II 11β-HSD and MR messenger RNAs (mR- NAs), and for type I 11β-HSD protein. Leydig cell 11β-HSD had bidirectional catalytic activity that was NADP(H/-dependent. This is consistent with the hypothesis that type I 11β-HSD is present in rat Leydig cells. However, unlike the type I 11β-HSD in liver parenchymal cells, the Leydig cell 11β- HSD was predominantly oxidative. Moreover, analysis of kinetics revealed two components, the first being low a Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) NADP- dependent oxidative activity with a K(m) of 41.5 ± 9.3 nM and maximum velocity (V(max)) of 7.1 ± 1.2 pmol·min·10

27944503010	Stress hormone and male reproductive function	The Leydig cell is the primary source of testosterone in males. Levels of testosterone in circulation are determined by the steroidogenic capacities of individual Leydig cells and the total numbers of Leydig cells per testis. Stress-induced increases in serum glucocorticoid concentrations inhibit testosterone-biosynthetic enzyme activity, leading to decreased rates of testosterone secretion. It is unclear, however, whether the excessive glucocorticoid stimulation also affects total Leydig cell numbers through induction of apoptosis and thereby contributes to the stress-induced suppression of androgen levels. Exposure of Leydig cells to high concentrations of corticosterone (CORT, the endogenously secreted glucocorticoid in rodents) increases their frequency of apoptosis. Studies of immobilization stress indicate that stress-induced increases in CORT are directly responsible for Leydig cell apoptosis. Access to glucocorticoid receptors in Leydig cells is modulated by oxidative inactivation of glucocorticoid by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD). Under basal levels of glucocorticoid, sufficient levels of glucocorticoid metabolism occur and there is likely to be minimal binding of the glucocorticoid receptor. We have established that Leydig cells express type 1 11βHSD, an oxidoreductase, and type 2, a unidirectional oxidase. Generation of redox potential through synthesis of the enzyme cofactor NADPH, a byproduct of glucocorticoid metabolism by 11βHSD-1, may potentiate testosterone biosynthesis, as NADPH is the cofactor used by steroidogenic enzymes such as type 3 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. In this scenario, inhibition of steroidogenesis will only occur under stressful conditions when high input amounts of CORT exceed the capacity of oxidative inaction by 11βHSD. Changes in autonomic catecholaminergic activity may contribute to suppressed Leydig cell function during stress, and may explain the rapid onset of inhibition. However, recent analysis of glucocorticoid action in Leydig cells indicates the presence of a fast, non-genomic pathway that will merit further investigation. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

34247143380	Phthalate ester toxicity in Leydig cells: Developmental timing and dosage considerations	Humans have significant exposures to phthalates, as these chemical plasticizers are ubiquitously present in flexible plastics. Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that boys born to women exposed to phthalates during pregnancy have an increased incidence of congenital genital malformations and spermatogenic dysfunction, signs of a condition referred to as testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). TDS is thought to develop as a result of environmental factors that cause a testicular disturbance at an early fetal stage with a resultant spectrum of clinical testicular dysfunction, ranging from impaired spermatogenesis and genital malformations to increased risk for development of testicular cancer. Proposed environmental factors in the etiology of TDS include endocrine disrupting compounds such as the phthalates. Leydig cells have been classified as one of the main targets for phthalate ester toxicity in the body based on studies in rodents. In support of this hypothesis, two Leydig cell products - insulin-like growth factor 3 (INSL3) and testosterone (T) - are both suppressed after phthalate exposures. Both fetal and adult generations of Leydig cells are affected by phthalate esters, although their sensitivities may differ. In rodent models, when pregnant dams are exposed to phthalate esters, fetal Leydig cells form enlarged clusters that are retained in the testis even after birth, in contrast to untreated controls. Despite the retention of fetal Leydig cells, however, their numbers and average cell volume of total in exposed males are reduced, as are INSL3 production and steroidogenic competence. These alterations are directly associated with clinical features of TDS, including cryptorchidism and impaired spermatogenesis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34447314180	Biphasic effects of postnatal exposure to diethylhexylphthalate on the timing of puberty in male rats	Phthalate esters such as di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), which are commonly found in cosmetics and in flexible plastics distributed by the food, construction, and medical products industries, have been classified as anti-androgens. High-dose DEHP exposure in utero is associated with decreased androgen levels. However, when administered after birth, low doses of DEHP (eg, 10 mg/kg body weight) may stimulate androgen production. In the present study, the potential of phthalate exposure to advance or delay the timing of puberty was assessed. Male Long-Evans rat pups were chronically subjected to low or high doses of DEHP, with the androgen-driven process of preputial separation serving as an index of pubertal timing. Rats were treated with 0, 10, 500, or 750 mg/kg body weight DEHP for 28 days starting at day 21 postpartum. The average age at which the animals completed preputial separation was measured in each group. The age of preputial separation was 41.5 ± 0.1 days postpartum in controls (vehicle). The 10 mg/kg DEHP dose advanced pubertal onset significantly to 39.7 ± 0.1 days postpartum, whereas the 750 mg/kg DEHP dose delayed pubertal onset to 46.3 ± 0.1 days postpartum. The 10 mg/kg DEHP dose also significantly increased serum testosterone (T) levels (3.13 ± 0.37 ng/mL) and seminal vesicle weights (0.33 ± 0.02 g) compared with control serum T (1.98 ± 0.20 ng/mL) and seminal vesicle weight (0.26 ± 0.02 g), while the 750 mg/kg dose decreased serum T (1.18 ± 0.18 ng/mL) as well as testes and body weights. Direct action of the DEHP metabolite, monoethylhexylphthalate (MEHP), on Leydig cell steroidogenic capacity was investigated in vitro. MEHP treatment at a low concentration (100 μM) increased luteinizing hormone-stimulated T production, whereas 10 mM concentrations were inhibitory. In conclusion, data from the present study indicate that DEHP has a biphasic effect on Leydig cell function, with low-dose exposure advancing the onset of puberty. High doses of DEHP, which are anti-androgenic, may also be outside the range of real environmental exposure levels. Copyright © American Society of Andrology.

38049062619	Gene expression during development of fetal and adult Leydig cells	In rats and mice, Leydig cells are formed as two morphologically and functionally different generations. The first generation develops in utero, from undifferentiated stem Leydig cells (SLCs) that differentiate into fetal Leydig cells (FLCs). After birth, SLCs that may differ from the fetal SLCs undergo lineage-specific commitment and give rise to adult Leydig cells (ALCs). The intermediates of ALCs first become apparent by day 11 postpartum. These first-appearing intermediates, progenitor Leydig cells (PLCs), are spindle shaped and identifiable as steroidogenic because they express luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD). The next step in the transition of PLCs to ALCs is the appearance of the immature Leydig cells (ILCs), most commonly seen in the testis during days 28 to 56 postpartum. ILCs have a more abundant smooth endoplasm reticulum (SER), the network of membranes providing a scaffold for steroidogenic enzyme localization, compared to PLCs, but are considered immature because they secrete higher levels of 5α-reduced androgen than testosterone. ILCs undergo a final division before ALC steroidogenic function matures by postnatal day 56. ALCs mark the point of maximum differentiation, and at this stage, the Leydig cell secretes testosterone at the highest rate. In this review, trends of gene expression during development of the two Leydig-cell generations, and recent information from gene profiling by microarray, are evaluated. The expression profiles are distinct, indicating that FLCs and ALCs may originate from separate pools of stem cells. © 2007 New York Academy of Sciences.

77954199230	Glucocorticoid suppresses steroidogenesis in rat progenitor Leydig cells	Glucocorticoid (GC) inhibits testosterone production in adult Leydig cells by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, whether GC affects the development of Leydig cells is unclear. The goal of the present study is to investigate the effects of GC on steroidogenesis of rat progenitor Leydig cells (PLCs) in vitro. Dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited androsterone (AO) production in PLCs. The GR antagonist RU38486 reversed the DEX-induced inhibition of AO, whereas the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist RU28318 did not. RU38486 also reversed DEX-induced reductions in steady-state mRNA levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star) and 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (Hsd3b1). Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) protein expression and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3bHSD) enzyme activity were affected similarly. These results show that GCs inhibit steroidogenesis of PLCs by suppression of StAR and 3bHSD via a GR-mediated mechanism. Copyright © American Society of Andrology.

77954386238	Morphological and proteomic analysis of early stage of osteoblast differentiation in osteoblastic progenitor cells	Bone remodeling relies on a dynamic balance between bone formation and resorption, mediated by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Under certain stimuli, osteoprogenitor cells may differentiate into premature osteoblasts and further into mature osteoblasts. This process is marked by increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralized nodule formation. In this study, we induced osteoblast differentiation in mouse osteoprogenitor MC3T3-E1 cells and divided the process into three stages. In the first stage (day 3), the MC3T3-E1 cell under osteoblast differentiation did not express ALP or deposit a mineralized nodule. In the second stage, the MC3T3-E1 cell expressed ALP but did not form a mineralized nodule. In the third stage, the MC3T3-E1 cell had ALP activity and formed mineralized nodules. In the present study, we focused on morphological and proteomic changes of MC3T3-E1 cells in the early stage of osteoblast differentiation - a period when premature osteoblasts transform into mature osteoblasts. We found that mean cell area and mean stress fiber density were increased in this stage due to enhanced cell spreading and decreased cell proliferation. We further analyzed the proteins in the signaling pathway of regulation of the cytoskeleton using a proteomic approach and found upregulation of IQGAP1, gelsolin, moesin, radixin, and Cfl1. After analyzing the focal adhesion signaling pathway, we found the upregulation of FLNA, LAMA1, LAMA5, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL4A6, and COL5A2 as well as the downregulation of COL4A1, COL4A2, and COL4A4. In conclusion, the signaling pathway of regulation of the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion play critical roles in regulating cell spreading and actin skeleton formation in the early stage of osteoblast differentiation. © 2010.

84877730312	Gossypol induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells through oxidative stress	In the present work, metabolomic and redox proteomic analyses were carried out on an untreated- and gossypol-treated ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3. Gossypol treatment resulted in cell death through oxidative stress. Metabolite analysis showed that gossypol induces a decrease of the cellular levels of GSH, aspartic acid, and FAD. Using a combination of double labeling and LC-MS-MS, we identified changes in thiol-redox states of 545 cysteine-containing peptides from 356 proteins. The frequently occurring amino acid residue immediately before or after the cysteine in these peptides is the non-polar and neutral leucine, valine, or alanine. These redox sensitive proteins participate in a variety of cellular processes. We have characterized the redox-sensitive cysteine residues in PKM2, HSP60, malate dehydrogenase and other proteins that play important roles in metabolism homeostasis and stress responses. The three cysteine residues of HSP60 exhibit different responses to gossypol treatment: an increase of thiol/disulfide ratio for the Cys447 residue due to a decrease of the cellular GSH level, and a decrease of thiol/disulfide ratios for Cys442 and Cys237 residues due to oxidation and sulfation. This study suggests that thiol/disulfide ratios are dependent on the level of cellular GSH. Our data provide a valuable resource for deciphering the redox regulation of proteins and for understanding gossypol-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84877295440	Comparison of cell types in the rat Leydig cell lineage after ethane dimethanesulfonate treatment	The objective of this study was to purify cells in the Leydig cell lineage following regeneration after ethane dimethanesulfonate (EDS) treatment and compare their steroidogenic capacity. Regenerated progenitor (RPLCs), immature (RILCs), and adult Leydig cells (RALCs) were isolated from testes 21, 28 and 56 days after EDS treatment respectively. Production rates for androgens including androsterone and 5α-androstane-17β, 3α-diol (DIOL), testosterone and androstenedione were measured in RPLCs, RILCs and RALCs in media after 3-h in vitro culture with 100 ng/ml LH. Steady-state mRNA levels of steroidogenic enzymes and their activities were measured in freshly isolated cells. Compared to adult Leydig cells (ALCs) isolated from normal 90-day-old rat testes, which primarily produce testosterone (69.73%), RPLCs and RILCs primarily produced androsterone (70.21%) and DIOL (69.79%) respectively. Leydig cells isolated from testes 56 days post-EDS showed equivalent capacity of steroidogenesis to ALCs and primarily produced testosterone (72.90%). RPLCs had cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and 17α-hydroxylase but had almost no detectable 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 and 117β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 activities, while RILCs had increased 177β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 activities. Because RPLCs and RILCs had higher 5α-reductase 1 and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities they produced mainly 5α-reduced androgens. Real-time PCR confirmed the similar trends for the expressions of these steroidogenic enzymes. In conclusion, the purified RPLCs, RILCs and RALCs are similar to those of their counterparts during rat pubertal development. © 2013 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

84897972415	Exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate in utero reduces testosterone production in rat fetal leydig cells	Background: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a synthetic material that has been widely used in industrial applications for decades. Exposure to PFOS has been associated with decreased adult testosterone level, and Leydig cell impairment during the time of adulthood. However, little is known about PFOS effects in utero on fetal Leydig cells (FLC). Methods and Results: The present study investigated effects of PFOS on FLC function. Pregnant Sprague Dawley female rats received vehicle (0.05% Tween20) or PFOS (5, 20 mg/kg) by oral gavage from gestational day (GD) 11-19. At GD20, testosterone (T) production, FLC numbers and ultrastructure, testicular gene and protein expression levels were examined. The results indicate that exposures to PFOS have affected FLC function as evidenced by decreased T production, impaired FLC, reduced FLC number, and decreased steroidogenic capacity and cholesterol level in utero. Conclusion: The present study shows that PFOS is an endocrine disruptor of male reproductive system as it causes reduction of T production and impairment of rat fetal Leydig cells. © 2014 Zhao et al.

84908473703	11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase types 1 and 2 in postnatal development of rat testis: Gene expression, localization and regulation by luteinizing hormone and androgens	11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) and type 2 (11β-HSD2) are expressed in rat testis, where they regulate the local concentrations of glucocorticoids. Here, we investigated the expression and localization of 11β-HSD in rat testis during postnatal development, and the regulation of these genes by luteinizing hormone (LH) and androgens. mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively, in testes collected from rats at postnatal day (PND) 7, 14, 21, 35, and 90, and from rats treated with LH, 7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) and testosterone at PND 21 and PND 90. Immunohistochemical staining was used to identify the localization of the 11β-HSD in rat testis at PND 7, 14, and 90. We found that 11β-HSD1 expression was restricted to the interstitial areas, and that its levels increased during rat testis development. In contrast, whereas 11β-HSD2 was expressed in both the interstitial areas and seminiferous tubules at PND 7, it was present only in the interstitial areas at PND 90, and its levels declined during testicular development. Moreover, 11β-HSD1 mRNA was induced by LH in both the PND 21 and 90 testes and by MENT at PND 21, whereas 11β-HSD2 mRNA was induced by testosterone and MENT in the PND 21 testis and by LH in the PND 90 testis. In conclusion, our study indicates that the 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 genes have distinct patterns of spatiotemporal expression and hormonal regulation during postnatal development of the rat testis.

43449126555	Inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymatic activities by glycyrrhetinic acid in vivo supports direct glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of steroidogenesis in leydig cells	Previous studies have suggested that glucocorticoid (GC) can directly affect testicular testosterone (T) biosynthesis by Leydig cells through a receptor-mediated mechanism. Interconversion of corticosterone (CORT), the active form in rodents, and 11-dehydroCORT, the biologically inert 11-keto form, is catalyzed by 11βHSD1. This enzyme thus controls the intracellular concentration of active GC. We have postulated that elevated CORT levels resulting from stress exceed the Leydig cell's capacity for metabolic inactivation of CORT, resulting in suppressed T production. The present study tested whether inhibition of 11βHSD1 in vivo, by the administration of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), increases intracellular active GC concentration and thereby affects serum T concentration and Leydig cell T production. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle (corn oil), CORT, GA, or GA + CORT. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH), CORT, and T levels were measured, as were the steroidogenic capacities of purified Leydig cells. Twofold elevations of CORT were achieved by the administration of either CORT or GA alone, but in both cases there was no effect on serum T levels. However, when CORT and GA were administered in combination, serum CORT levels increased 3.5-fold (to 420 ± 34 ng/mL) and serum T levels were reduced significantly (to 0.72 ± 0.07 ng/mL; control, 2.12 ± 0.23 ng/mL). Serum levels of LH were not affected by CORT, GA, or GA + CORT. Consistent with the reduced serum T levels following GA + CORT, steroidogenic enzyme expression and capacities were significantly reduced compared to control. These data support a role for 11βHSD1 in modulating intracellular CORT concentrations and, in turn, for a direct effect of GC on Leydig cells in response to stress.

44449094728	Involvement of testicular growth factors in fetal Leydig cell aggregation after exposure to phthalate in utero	Exposures to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) have been shown to be associated with decreased adult testosterone (T) levels and increased Leydig cell numbers. As yet, little is known about DEHP effects in utero on fetal Leydig cells (FLC). The present study investigated effects of DEHP on FLC function. Pregnant Long-Evans female rats received vehicle (corn oil) or DEHP at 10, 100, or 750 mg/kg by oral gavage from gestational day (GD)2-20. At GD21, T production, FLC numbers and distribution, and testicular gene expression were examined. The percentage of FLC clusters containing 6-30 cells increased in all treatment groups, with 29 ± 2% in control vs. 37 ± 3, 35 ± 3, and 56 ± 4% in rats receiving 10, 100, and 750 mg/kg DEHP, respectively. In contrast, FLC numbers were 33% and 39% lower than control after exposures to 100 and 750 mg/kg DEHP, respectively. At these doses, mRNA levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) increased. LIF was found to induce cell aggregation in FLCs in vitro, consistent with the hypothesis that DEHP induced FLC aggregation. Testicular T levels were doubled by the 10 mg/kg dose and halved at 750 mg/kg. The mRNA levels of IGF-1 and c-Kit ligand (KITL) were induced by 10 mg/kg DEHP. These results, taken together, indicate that fetal exposures to DEHP have effects on FLC number, distribution, and most importantly, steroidogenic capacity and suggest that abnormal expressions of IGF1, KITL, and LIF genes may contribute to the reproductive toxicity of phthalates. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

44649201559	Rapid mechanisms of glucocorticoid signaling in the Leydig cell	Stress-mediated elevations in circulating glucocorticoid levels lead to corresponding rapid declines in testosterone production by Leydig cells in the testis. In previous studies we have established that glucocorticoids act on Leydig cells directly, through the classic glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and that access to the GR is controlled prior to the GR by a metabolizing pathway mediated by the type 1 isoform of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD1). This enzyme is bidirectional (with both oxidase and reductase activities) and in the rat testis is exclusively localized in Leydig cells where it is abundantly expressed and may catalyze the oxidative inactivation of glucocorticoids. The predominant reductase direction of 11βHSD1 activity in liver cells is determined by an enzyme, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH), on the luminal side of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Generation of the pyridine nucleotide cofactor NADPH by H6PDH stimulates the reductase direction of 11βHSD1 resulting in increased levels of active glucocorticoids in liver cells. Unlike liver cells, steroidogenic enzymes including 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (17βHSD3) forms the coupling with 11βHSD1. Thus the physiological concentrations of androstenedione serve as a substrate for 17βHSD3 utilizing NADPH to generate NADP+, which drives 11βHSD1 in Leydig cells primarily as an oxidase; thus eliminating the adverse effects of glucocorticoids on testosterone production. At the same time 11βHSD1 generates NADPH which promotes testosterone biosynthesis by stimulating 17βHSD3 in a cooperative cycle. This enzymatic coupling constitutes a rapid mechanism for modulating glucocorticoid control of testosterone biosynthesis. Under stress conditions, glucocorticoids also have rapid actions to suppress cAMP formation thus to lower testosterone production.

47849117951	Androgen-forming stem Leydig cells: Identification, function and therapeutic potential	Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in the male, and differentiation of Leydig cells in the testes is one of the primary events in the development of the male body and fertility. Stem Leydig cells (SLCs) exist in the testis throughout postnatal life, but a lack of cell surface markers previously hindered attempts to obtain purified SLC fractions. Once isolated, the properties of SLCs provide interesting clues for the ontogeny of these cells within the embryo. Moreover, the clinical potential of SLCs might be used to reverse age-related declines in testosterone levels in aging men, and stimulate reproductive function in hypogonadal males. This review focuses on the source, identification and outlook for therapeutic applications of SLCs. Separate pools of SLCs may give rise to fetal and adult generations of Leydig cell, which may account for their observed functional differences. These differences should in turn be taken into account when assessing the consequences of environmental pollutants such as the phthalate ester, diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP). © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

49449108915	The biological roles of extracellular and intracytoplasmic glucocorticoids in skeletal cells	Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic disease characterized by loss of the normal density of bone, resulting in fragile bone and a higher risk of fractures. Patients under glucocorticoids treatment are susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO). The normal bone turnover depends on a balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The skeletal cells including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes and their precursors demonstrate altered features while they are cocultured with different extracellular glucocorticoids, or their intracytoplasmic glucocorticoids modified by genetic manipulation of 11β-HSD isozyme. However, recent studies have also demonstrated different or even contradictive outcomes on whether the glucocorticoids inhibit or increase biological activity of these skeletal cells. Focusing on the roles of extracellular glucorticoids, intracytoplasmic glucocorticoids and the mechanism of transmembrane passage of the glucocorticoids, this review reveals that glucocorticoids may exert either inhibitive or enhancing influence on these skeletal cells, but relying on the difference in cell origins, methodology, and types of glucocorticoids. In addition, the effects of glucocorticoids may be dose- and time-dependent. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

58149291590	Adjudin targeting rabbit germ cell adhesion as a male contraceptive: A pharmacokinetics study	Adjudin (1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carbohydrazide; formerly called AF-2364) has been shown to inhibit spermatogenesis by disrupting anchoring junctions at the Sertoligerm cell interface. This, in turn, leads to germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium, and transient infertility. Adjudin's efficacy in inhibiting spermatogenesis, the recovery of spermatogenesis after cessation of the drug, and side effects were examined in adult male Japanese rabbits. The pharmacokinetics profiles of adjudin in rabbits after oral administration and after intravenous injection were compared, Rabbits received 25 mg/kg adjudin once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks either by intravenous injection or by gavage. Vehicle-treated rabbits were used as controls. At 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks after treatment, testes were removed for microscopic examination to assess the status of spermatogenesis. Four weeks after intravenous cessation of adjudin, the recovery of spermatogenesis also was monitored. Blood was withdrawn after first administration to measure plasma concentrations of adjudin by high-performance liquid chromatography. Four weeks after intravenous treatment, examination of testis sections showed rapid exfoliation of elongated/elongating spermatids and the presence of large multinucleated cells; more than 95% of germ cells were absent from the seminiferous epithelium. Intravenous treatment showed a more severe disturbance of spermatogenesis compared with gavage treatment, which was correlated with bioavailability of the drug. The areas under the curve for intravenous injection and gavage were 20.11 ± 1.90 and 2.23 ± 0.45 mg·h·L

61349164790	The (+)- and (-)-gossypols potently inhibit human and rat 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2	Gossypol has been proven to be a very effective male contraceptive. However, clinical trials showed that the major side effect of gossypol was hypokalemia. Gossypol occurs naturally as enantiomeric mixtures of (+)-gossypol and (-)-gossypol. The (-)-gossypol is found to be the active component of antifertility. 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11βHSD2) has been demonstrated to be a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) protector by inactivating active glucocorticoids including corticosterone (CORT) in rats, and therefore mutation or suppression of 11βHSD2 causes hypokalemia and hypertension. In the present study, the potency of gossypol enantiomers was tested for the inhibition of 11βHSD1 and 2 in rat and human. Both (+) and (-)-gossypols showed a potent inhibition of 11βHSD2 with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC

63149132002	Deprival of testicular innervation induces apoptosis of Leydig cells via caspase-8-dependent signaling: A novel survival pathway revealed	Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in adult males. Recently, a growing body of evidence has shown that testicular innervation functions as a major regulator in Leydig cell steroidogenesis. The question then arises whether this novel regulatory pathway also plays an important role in other biological behaviors of this cell type. In the present study, we selectively resected the superior spermatic nerves (SSNs) or the inferior spermatic nerves (ISNs) to investigate the effects of testicular denervation on survival of Leydig cells. After testicular denervation, Leydig cells displayed morphological characteristics of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and apoptotic body formation. Flow cytometry combined with TUNEL labeling demonstrated dramatic and persistent apoptosis of Leydig cells in the denervated testes 14 and 21 days after operation. Meanwhile, serum T concentrations in the SSN- or ISN-denervated rats dramatically decreased on day 14 and declined further on day 21. Plasma LH levels underwent a remarkable rise, while serum FSH levels remained unchanged. Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry further demonstrated that testicular denervation activated caspase-3 and caspase-8, but not caspase-9 in Leydig cells. Our data indicate that testicular innervation functions as an important survival factor for Leydig cells in vivo. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

61549132523	Peptidergic not monoaminergic fibers profusely innervate the young adult human testis	Numerous studies have reported that intratesticular nerves exert important regulatory effects on the functions of the male gonad; however, as yet little is known about their distribution in the young adult human testis. The purpose of this study was to explore whether peptidergic and adrenergic nerves occur in the male gonad of this age, and, if present, to depict their distribution further. Thirty testes were collected from 15 reproductively healthy donors aged 21-32 years. Antibodies against protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), neuropeptide Y (NPY), C-terminal flanking peptide of NPY (CPON) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were employed for immunohistochemical detection of intratesticular peptidergic nerves, and those against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) for monoaminergic ones. The testicular parenchyma exhibited a rich innervation by PGP 9.5-positive fibers, mainly associated with Leydig cell nests, blood vessels, and seminiferous tubules. Numerous NPY- and CPON-immunoreactive (IR) nerves also appeared in the gonads, but the vast majority were confined to blood vessels. A small number of VIP-IR fibers were detected in some arterioles. By contrast, however, no fibers displaying DBH or 5-HT immunoreactivity were observed within the testis. Additionally, expression of PGP-9.5, NPY, CPON, VIP, DBH and 5-HT was found in Leydig cells, PGP 9.5 in spermatogonia, and NPY and CPON in peritubular myoid cells. Our results suggest that the young adult human testis is devoid of monoaminergic nerves but profusely innervated by peptidergic fibers, which may serve as major neuronal regulators for testicular functions at this age. © Journal compilation © 2009 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

62649088559	Phthalate-induced testicular dysgenesis syndrome: Leydig cell influence	Phthalates, the most abundantly produced plasticizers, leach out from polyvinyl chloride plastics and disrupt androgen action. Male rats that are exposed to phthalates in utero develop symptoms characteristic of the human condition referred to as testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). Environmental influences have been suspected to contribute to the increasing incidence of TDS in humans (i.e. cryptorchidism and hypospadias in newborn boys and testicular cancer and reduced sperm quality in adult males). In this review, we discuss the recent findings that prenatal exposure to phthalates affects Leydig cell function in the postnatal testis. This review also focuses on the recent progress in our understanding of how Leydig cell factors contribute to phthalate-mediated TDS. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

65949110564	In utero and lactational exposures to diethylhexyl-phthalate affect two populations of leydig cells in male long-evans rats	Diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) has been classified as an antiandrogen. However, whether in utero and lactational exposures of DEHP affect Leydig cells has not been well established. In the present study, the effects of DEHP exposures on fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) and adult Leydig cells (ALCs) were assessed. Pregnant dams of Long-Evans rats were treated with 0, 10, and 750 mg/kg body weight DEHP from Gestational Day 12.5 to Postnatal Day (PND) 21.5. Fetal Leydig cell clustering and FLC-specific gene expression were examined. Anogenital distances (AGDs) of male pups were assessed at PND 2. Serum testosterone levels of male pups and mRNA levels of ALC-specific genes were measured at PNDs 21 and 49. The AGDs of male pups were significantly shorter in the group treated with 750 mg/kg DEHP (mean ± SEM, 3.68 ± 0.16 mm) compared with control (4.62 ± 0.13 mm). The FLCs were aggregated after 10 and 750 mg/kg DEHP exposures. Several FLC-specific genes, including luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) and steroidogenic enzyme genes, were downregulated at both doses. Serum testosterone levels were significantly lower compared with control at PND 21 after treatment of 10 or 750 mg/kg DEHP, and continued to be lower even up to 49 days postpartum at the higher dose. The mRNA levels for Lhcgr and steroidogenic enzyme genes were significantly lower at both doses of DEHP at PND 21, whereas there were no significant differences for these genes at PND 49. In conclusion, in utero and continued lactational exposures to DEHP exert long-term disruption of steroidogenesis of ALCs. © 2009 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

70349485725	Normal responses to restraint stress in mice lacking the gene for neuronal nitric oxide synthase	The hormonal changes associated with immobilization stress (IMO) include a swift increase in corticosterone (CORT) concentration and a decrease in circulating testosterone (T) levels. There is evidence that the production of the short-lived neuromodulator nitric oxide (NO) is increased during stress in various tissues, including the brain. NO also suppresses the biosynthesis of T. Both the inducible and the neuronal isoforms of NO synthase (iNOS and nNOS, respectively) have been implicated in this suppression, but the evidence has not been conclusive. We used adult wild-type (WT) and nNOS knockout male mice (nNOS-/-) to assess the respective roles of CORT and nNOS-derived NO in stress mediated inhibition of T production. Animals were assigned to either basal control or 3-hour IMO groups. No difference in basal plasma and testicular T levels were observed between WT and nNOS-/-, although testicular weights of mutant mice were slightly lower compared to WT animals. The plasma contents of luteinizing hormone (LH) and CORT in unstressed mice of both genotypes were similar. Exposure to 3 hours of IMO increased plasma CORT and decreased T concentrations in mice of both genotypes. However, comparable levels of plasma LH and testicular nitrite and nitrate (NOx), NO stable metabolites, were detected in control and stressed WT and nNOS-/-mice. Adrenal concentrations of NOx declined after IMO, but the reduction was not statistically significant. These findings implicate CORT rather than NO generated by nNOS in the rapid stress-induced suppression of circulating T. Copyright © American Society of Andrology.

70249134259	Phthalate Levels and Low Birth Weight: A Nested Case-Control Study of Chinese Newborns	Objective: To assess maternal-fetal exposure to phthalates and investigate whether in utero phthalate exposure is associated with low birth weight (LBW). Study design: A total of 201 newborn-mother pairs (88 LBW cases and 113 controls) residing in Shanghai were enrolled in this nested case-control study during 2005-2006. Maternal blood, cord blood, and meconium specimens were collected and analyzed for phthalates by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Nonparametric tests were used to compare demographic characteristics in cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression and Spearman correlation were used to analyze the association between phthalate exposure and LBW. Results: No significant differences in gestational age, prepregnancy body mass index, prenatal care, vitamin supplementation, or socioeconomic levels were found between the LBW and control infants. More than 70% of the biosamples had quantifiable levels of phthalates, with higher levels in the LBW infants compared with the controls. Prenatal di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) exposure was associated with LBW, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) was negatively associated with birth length. After adjusting for the potential confounders, DBP concentrations in the highest quartile were associated with an increased risk of LBW. Conclusions: Newborns in China are ubiquitously exposed to phthalates; significantly higher phthalate levels were detected in LBW cases compared with controls. In utero DBP and DEHP exposures were associated with LBW in a dose-dependent manner. Prenatal phthalate exposure may be a risk factor for LBW. © 2009 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

70349333524	Mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) regulates glucocorticoid metabolism through 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 in murine gonadotrope cells	Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and its metabolite mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) have been classified as toxicants to the reproductive system at the testis level and DEHP may also impair reproductive axis function at the pituitary levels. However, MEHP is 10-fold more potent than DEHP in toxicity and little is known about the toxicological effect of MEHP on pituitary. In this study, we demonstrated that 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2), not 11β-HSD1, is strongly expressed in murine gonadotrope LβT2 cells. Interestingly, MEHP inhibited Hsd11b2 mRNA level and 11β-HSD2 enzyme activity in LβT2 cells at as low as 10

70450233538	Activation of the AMP activated protein kinase by short-chain fatty acids is the main mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of a high fiber diet on the metabolic syndrome	The metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions including abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and elevated blood pressure, is a natural consequence of over nutrition and a sedentary lifestyle. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome has increased to epidemic proportions in the world. The exact pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome remains unclear, but it is known to be a complex interaction between genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. Promotion of physical activity and dietary management are still the main methods for the prevention and management of the metabolic syndrome. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of high fiber diet on the metabolic syndrome. The principal beneficial effects of a fiber-rich diet in these patients are: prevention of obesity, improved glucose levels, and control of the profile of blood lipids. Dietary fiber may also favor the control of arterial blood pressure. How dietary fiber exerts its beneficial effects on the metabolic syndrome is not well understood. AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a major cellular fuel gauge and a master regulator of metabolic homeostasis. Several lines of evidence suggest that AMPK can be activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) either directly or indirectly. It is our hypothesis that the main mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of a high fiber diet on the metabolic syndrome is the increased SCFA production in the colon leading to a higher concentration of SCFA in the portal vein, which activates the AMPK in the liver. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

71349087068	Structure-dependent inhibition of human and rat 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 activities by phthalates	Phthalates are diesters of phthalic acid and an alcohol moiety. Phthalates have been classified as endocrine disruptors and have a broad range of effects with unknown mechanisms. Some of the effects of phthalate are consistent with disruptions of normal glucocorticoid homeostasis, and in particular, with defective function of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2). In the present study, we tested 12 phthalate diesters and four monoesters for the inhibition of human and rat kidney 11β-HSD2. We examined the modes of inhibition and looked for a relationship between the potency for inhibition and the chemical structures. Of the phthalate diesters we tested, dipropyl phthalate (DPrP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) significantly inhibited both human and rat 11β-HSD2 activities. The IC

74449084952	Regulation of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and 2 by IGF-1 in mice	Two isoforms of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2) play an important role in regulation of glucocorticoid corticosterone (CORT, the active form in rodents) by the interconversion between CORT and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11DHC, the biologically inert form). 11β-HSD1 is an NADP+/NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase which is mainly expressed in liver and kidney, while 11β-HSD2 is an NAD+-dependent oxidase which is predominantly expressed in kidney. The regulation of 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 mRNA (Hsd11b1 and Hsd11b2) levels and their activities by IGF-1 was performed in liver, kidney, and testis of IGF-1 knockout male mice. Real-time PCR showed that Hsd11b1 in liver was decreased while Hsd11b2 mRNA level was decreased in kidney of IGF-1 null mice. 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 activities fluctuated with the changes of their respective Hsd11b1 or Hsd11b2 mRNA levels. In conclusion, IGF-I tissue-specifically regulates Hsd11b1 and Hsd11b2 expression. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

74949101637	7α-hydroxytestosterone affects 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 direction in rat leydig cells	The cytochrome P450 2A1 (CYP2A1) is a P450 enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of testosterone. CYP2A1 has been reported to be present in rat testis. However, its developmental changes and function have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to measure the abundance of CYP2A1 (Cyp2a1) mRNA in the developing rat testis and Leydig cells and examine the effects of its product, 7α-hydroxytestosterone (7HT), on an important enzyme, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) that interconverts active corticosterone and inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone. As detected by real-time PCR, Cyp2a1 was found to be present exclusively in the Leydig cell. CYP2A1 activity in adult Leydig cells was 5-fold higher than those in progenitor or immature Leydig cells. 7HT competitively suppressed 11β-HSD1 oxidase and reductase activities in rat testis microsome with inhibitory constant of 1.2 and 2.9 μM, respectively. In intact Leydig cells, 7HT did not inhibit 11β-HSD1 reductase activity, but it stimulated its reductase activity. Thus, at 100 nM and higher concentrations, 7HT significantly switched 11β-HSD1 oxidoreductase activities toward reductase. The present data shows that 7HT, the product formed by CYP2A1 from testosterone, regulates the direction of 11β-HSD1 activity in rat Leydig cells. Copyright © 2010 by The Endocrine Society.

75749115886	Inhibition of LH-stimulated androgen production in rat immature Leydig cells: Effects on nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 by FGF2	Both fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and luteinizing hormone (LH) have been reported to regulate androgen production in Leydig cells in progenitor Leydig cells. The objective of the present study is to examine the regulation of androgen production in rat immature Leydig cells (ILCs). ILCs were isolated from 35-day-old rat testes and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium with LH (1 ng/ml) or FGF2 (10 ng/ml). 5α-Androstane-3α, 17β-diol (3α-DIOL), the primary androgen in ILCs, and testosterone (T) were measured by Radioimmuno assay. The results showed the LH stimulated androgen production in ILCs, and FGF2 did not. However, FGF2 decreased the LH-stimulated androgen production. Real-time PCR and enzyme assay showed that FGF2 decreased levels of several steroidogenic enzymes, inhibited the expressions of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and steroidogenic factor 1 (Nr5a1) in LH-stimulated ILCs. FGF2-mediated inhibition of Nr5a1gene expression may be the mechanism through which FGF2 inhibits LH-stimulated androgen production. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

77149168196	Genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells: The ongoing research for bone tissue engineering	Bone grafting is crucial in the surgical treatment of bone defects and nonunion fractures. Autogenous bone, allogenous bone, and biomaterial scaffold are three main sources of bone grafts. The biomaterial scaffold, both natural and synthetic, is widely accessible but weak in osteogenic potential. One approach to solve this problem is cell-based bone tissue engineering (BTE), established by growing living osteogenic cells on scaffold in vitro to build up its osteoinducitive capability. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is suitable for use in cell-based BTE, but it remains a considerable challenge to induce MSCs to form solely bone and while preventing MSCs from differentiating into fats, muscles, and possibly neural elements in vivo. Recently, there is a drastic rise in use of genetically engineered MSCs, which can secrete growth factors or alter the transcription level, leading to osteoblast lineage commitment, bone formation, fracture repair, and spinal fusion. In this article, we reviewed the literatures regarding applications of genetically engineered MSCs in BTE. We addressed the currently applicable genes and candidate genes for MSCs modification, transduction efficiency and safety issues of the transfect vectors, and administration routes, and we briefly described in vivo tracking and potential clinical application of the genetically modified MSCs in BTE. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77950664531	11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors as promising therapeutic drugs for diabetes: Status and development	Glucocorticoids (GC) play a fundamental role in controlling physiologic homeostasis and, when present in excess, can have a detrimental impact on glucose control, blood pressure and lipid levels. The oxidoreductase 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) mainly catalyzes the intracellular regeneration of active GCs (cortisol, corticosterone) from inert inactive 11-keto forms (cortisone) in liver, adipose tissue and brain, amplifying local GC action. Multiple lines of evidence have indicated that 11β-HSD1-mediated intracellular cortisol production may have a pathogenic role in type 2 diabetes and its co-morbidities. The 11β-HSD1 becomes a novel target for anti-type 2 diabetes drug developments, and inhibition of 11β-HSD1 offers a potential therapy to attenuate the type 2 diabetes. In the past several years, a lot of 11β-HSD1 inhibitors have been designed, synthesized, screened and discovered. Lowering intracellular glucocorticoid concentrations through administration of small molecule 11β-HSD1 selective inhibitors, significantly attenuates the signs and symptoms of disease in preclinical animal models and clinical trials of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Among published inhibitors, DIO-902 from DiObex Inc. and INCB13739 from Incyte Inc. are now being investigated under Phase 2B clinical trials. However, the selectivity of current selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitors has been just focused on the difference between 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2. They inhibit the bi-directional activities of 11β-HSD1, both 11β-HSD1 reductase (major) and oxidase (minor). In our lab, we have recently found novel chemicals that not only inhibit 11β-HSD1 reductase activity but also increase its oxidase activity without inhibition against 11β-HSD2. We propose that this dual modulation on 11β-HSD1 may provide a better therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

77956488453	Perinatal exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate leads to restricted growth and delayed lung maturation in newborn rats	Background: Pregnant women and infants have significant exposures to the most commonly used plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of DEHP exposure on growth and lung maturation in rats and determine if DEHP regulation of 11β- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 gene (Hsd11b1) expression in the lung tissue plays a role in its effects on lung maturation. Method: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated from gestational day 12 to postnatal day (PND) 21 with DEHP orally at dosages of 0, 10, 100 or 750 mg/kg/day, respectively (n=8 for each group). Two rat pups (one male and one female) from each litter were sacrificed at PND 1 and 21. Body weight was measured and the lung was processed for histology and calculation of lung interstitial tissue proportion as well as real-time PCR determination of the expressions of Hsd11b1, surfactant associated protein-A1 gene (Sftpa1) and B gene (Sftpb). Results: The perinatal DEHP exposure led to a dose dependent intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction (P<0.001). High dose DEHP (750 mg/kg/day) exposure led to decreased gas-exchange space as evidenced by increased lung interstitial tissue proportion (P<0.001), but did not cause significant changes in Hsd11b1, Sftpa1 or Sftpb gene expression in the rat lung at PND 1. The DEHP-induced change in lung histology remained significant at PND 21 with improvement despite continual exposure to DEHP. Conclusion: Perinatal DEHP exposure leads to growth restriction and delayed lung maturation in newborn rats. © 2010 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.

84455170934	The inhibitory effects of perfluoroalkyl substances on human and rat 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1	Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are man-made polyfluorinated compounds that are widely used and persistent in the environment. PFASs have potential effects on many biological systems including the development of lung. Glucocorticoids have been reported to promote fetal and neonatal lung development at the late stage, and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1(11βHSD1) in the lung is critical for the generation of local active glucocorticoid cortisol (human) or corticosterone (rodents) from biologically inert 11keto-steroids. The purpose of the present study is to study the direct inhibitory effects of PFASs on 11βHSD1 activities and action modes. Microsomal 11βHSD1 was subjected to the exposure to various PFASs, including perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), potassium perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and potassium perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS).

84555189838	Inhibitors of testosterone biosynthetic and metabolic activation enzymes	The Leydig cells of the testis have the capacity to biosynthesize testosterone from cholesterol. Testosterone and its metabolically activated product dihydrotestosterone are critical for the development of male reproductive system and spermatogenesis. At least four steroidogenic enzymes are involved in testosterone biosynthesis: Cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) for the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone within the mitochondria, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B), for the conversion of pregnenolone into progesterone, 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) for the conversion of progesterone into androstenedione and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B3) for the formation of testosterone from androstenedione. Testosterone is also metabolically activated into more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone by two isoforms 5a-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) and 2 (SRD5A2) in Leydig cells and peripheral tissues. Many endocrine disruptors act as antiandrogens via directly inhibiting one or more enzymes for testosterone biosynthesis and metabolic activation. These chemicals include industrial materials (perfluoroalkyl compounds, phthalates, bisphenol A and benzophenone) and pesticides/biocides (methoxychlor, organotins, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane and prochloraz) and plant constituents (genistein and gossypol).

84855298464	The metabolism of steroids, toxins and drugs by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1	11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoform 1 (11β-HSD1) is a member of the alcohol short-chain family enzyme, and catalyzes the interconversion between active glucocorticoid cortisol (in human) and inactive cortisone. The redox ratio of NADP+/NADPH determines its direction with NADPH favoring its reductase activity and NADP+ favoring its oxidase activity. In many tissues such as the liver and lung, 11β-HSD1 behaves primarily as a reductase because of the intracellular enzyme coupling with hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which uses the NADP+ as cofactor to supply NADPH driving 11β-HSD1 to function as a reductase. 11β-HSD1 catalyzes the metabolism of 7- or 11-keto steroids as well as many toxins and drugs. Some steroids, drugs and toxins are metabolically activated. The present review discusses the steroid, drug and toxin metabolism by 11β-HSD1. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84862785574	Gene expression profiling in fetal rat lung during gestational perfluorooctane sulfonate exposure	Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent environmental contaminant found in the tissues of humans and wildlife. It has been reported that gestational exposure to PFOS causes neonatal death of rats. However, the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of gestational PFOS exposure on the gene expression profiling of fetal rat lung at pseudoglandular stage. Adult Sprague Dawley dams were dosed orally from gestational day 12-18 with 0 (control), 5. mg/kg/day or 20. mg/kg/day PFOS. Animals were euthanized on day 18.5, fetal lung samples were collected for histochemical staining and RNA profiling analysis. PFOS did not cause apparent microscopic changes of fetal lungs. Gene expression profiling revealed that PFOS dose-dependently up-regulated the expression of 21 (5. mg/kg) and 43 (20. mg/kg) genes. These genes include five PPARα target genes (Acot1, Hmgcs2, Fabp4, Fabp1 and Myh7), and 4 of them are involved in lipid metabolism. The other genes were primarily included in the categories of cytoskeletal structure (Tpm1, Tnnt2, Actn3, Myoz2, Tmod1, and Mfap5), extracellular matrix (Ckm, Lum, Tnnc1, Art3, Dcn, Col17a1, Aspn, Ctsk, Itm2a, Spock2 and Orm1), transporting (Cox8h,Cox6a2 and Scnn1a) and secreted proteins (Scgb3a1, Nppb and Spp1). Our study demonstrates that in utero PFOS exposure resulted in the alteration of a set of genes which are involved in significant cytoskeletal, extracellular matrix remodeling, lipid metabolism and secreted proteins in the fetal rat lung. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of our study is to investigate the effects of (+)-gossypol (G+) on 11β-HSD. Adult ICR mice were given B and B + (G+) by intraperitoneal injection. The activity of 11β-HSD was evaluated by measuring the ratio of A and B, meanwhile the effects of (+)-gossypol on the conversion rate of B to A was determined with HPLC. Serum A/B levels of the B+(G+) group decreased by 2.42, 7.32, 17.85, 31.39, and 40.02 % compared to the B group at each measured time interval. A/B levels at 1 h for the B + (G+) group decreased by 43.78, 21.29 and 34.47% in liver, kidney and adrenal glands, respectively, in comparison to the B group. However, (+)-gossypol had no effect on brain and testis. (+)-Gossypol was an inhibitor of 11β-HSD.

0037474148	Mechanisms of glucocorticoid-induced Leydig cell apoptosis	The high levels of corticosterone (CORT) that are typically achieved during stress induce apoptotic death of Leydig cells. The intracellular mechanisms by which CORT acts on Leydig cells to induce apoptosis are unknown, and the present study tested for mediation by Fas ligand (FasL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand family, in association with caspase activation. In addition, another apoptotic pathway involving in the participation of mitochondria was studied by evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) loss and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are early apoptotic events in many cell types. Rat Leydig cells were isolated from adrenalectomized rats on day 90 postpartum at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after the start of CORT administration (at a dose of 5 mg total/100 g body weight per day intraperitoneally in two daily injections starting 3 days after surgery). Both FasL and Fas receptor protein levels, analyzed by Western blot and fluorescent immunohistochemistry, increased at 6 h after the start of CORT administration, peaking at 24 h and declining thereafter. Leydig cell caspase-3 activity was analyzed in vitro. Low molecular weight DNA fragments that are characteristic of apoptosis were evident in Leydig cells by 12 h of exposure to 100 nM CORT in vitro, and the abundance of the fragments was more pronounced at 24 h. In the presence of a specific caspase inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, Leydig cell apoptosis was suppressed, corroborating the hypothesis that caspase-3 is involved in CORT-mediated cell death. Western blotting analysis revealed that procaspase-3 was present only at low levels in untreated control Leydig cells, and increased by 6 h of CORT administration. By 12 h, however, procaspase-3 was significantly reduced, and the cleaved, active caspase-3 forms appeared and increased through 24 h. These results indicated that FasL/Fas and caspase were implicated in CORT-mediated Leydig cell apoptosis. Decreased ΔΨ and increased ROS generation were also measurable in Leydig cells for up to 2 days following CORT administration in vitro. These data indicate that activation of the Fas system, cleavage of procaspase-3, loss of ΔΨ and increased ROS generation are all implicated in the process of CORT-induced Leydig cell death. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

84868304996	Adverse effects of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate on Leydig cell regeneration in the adult rat testis	The objective of the present study is to determine whether di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure at adulthood affects regeneration of rat Leydig cells. 90-day-old Long-Evans rats received intraperitoneal injection of 75. mg/kg ethane dimethanesulfonate (EDS) to eliminate mature Leydig cells, and then were randomly divided into 3 groups, in which rats were gavaged with the corn oil (control) or 10 or 750. mg/kg DEHP daily for 35 days. Serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were assessed by RIA, Leydig cell numbers and proliferation rate were evaluated, and the mRNA levels of Leydig cell specific genes were measured by qPCR. Both 10 and 750. mg/kg DEHP treatments increased Leydig cell numbers on day 14, 21 and 35 post-EDS, due to significant increase of the number of Leydig cell precursors from day 14 to 21 post-EDS. However, serum testosterone levels were halved in 10 and 750. mg/kg DEHP groups compared to control on day 35 post-EDS despite the increased Leydig cell numbers. Quantitative PCR showed that Leydig cell specific genes including Lhcgr, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1, and Insl3 were significantly down-regulated in 750. mg/kg DEHP-treated testes on post-EDS day 21 and beyond. The present study suggests that DEHP increases Leydig cell proliferation but inhibits differentiation during the regeneration of Leydig cells. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Materials & Methods: We amplified all nine exons of the CYP2C19 gene in 2127 unrelated healthy Chinese Han subjects from two geographical locations (Zhejiang province, n = 1127; Hebei province, n = 1000), using direct sequencing. Results: In total, six previously reported alleles were found in our study, in which two alleles CYP2C19*6 and CYP2C19*18 were reported for the first time in Chinese Han subjects. In addition, 35 novel variants were detected in the present work, which included 11 new named alleles, 12 nonsynonymous mutations and one insert variant. Conclusion: This study provides important data on the pattern of CYP2C19 polymorphisms in Chinese Han subjects, using the largest group of individuals. Furthermore, the study also detects the largest number of novel alleles in one population. These findings are of potential benefit to the development of personalized medicine for the Chinese Han population.

Healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to be given 20 mg/kg1cortisol (F group) or cortisol combined with 10 mg/kg glycyrrhetinic acid (F+GA group). The serum concentrations of cortisol were determined by HPLC and pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by double-compartmental method. The urine concentrations of cortisol and cortisone were determined by HPLC and the ratio of cortisone/cortisol was measured to evaluate the activity of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD2).

Healthy male SD rats were randomized to be given 20 mg/kg E or E combined with 10 mg/kg GA. Blood samples were collected at 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min after administration. The serum concentrations of E and F were determined by HLPC and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using DASver2.0 software. The parameters of AUC (0 - t), AUC (0 - ∞), and C max for E in the group of E + GA were significantly higher than those in the group of E (P <0.01); the half-time (t 1 / 2 β) was extended compared to E (P <0.05) and CL/F was dropped obviously (P <0.01). The rise in AUC (0 - t), AUC (0 - ∞), and C max for cortisol in the group of E + GA was significantly compared to the group of E (P <0.01). CL/F was lower than E (P <0.01) and the half-time (t 1 / 2 β) was slightly extended. In this study, we find that GA restrains the metabolism of E and F and thus increases AUC, t 1 / 2 β, and C max of E and F, which may be related to its inhibition effect on 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). © 2012 Dan Lin et al.

84872411541	Self-administration of propofol is mediated by dopamine D1 receptors in nucleus accumbens in rats	As a widely used intravenous short-acting anesthetic, propofol is recently indicated by clinical and animal studies for its abuse potential, but the mechanism underlying propofol abuse is largely unknown. This study examined the contribution of dopamine receptor subtype (D1 and D2 receptors) and neuroanatomical locus (i.e. nuclear accumbens) in the maintenance of propofol self-administration in rats. After the acquisition and maintenance of self-administration of propofol (1.7. mg/kg/infusion) under a fixed ratio (FR1) schedule of reinforcement over 14. days, rats were treated by either intraperitoneal injection or intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) injection of D1 receptor antagonist (SCH23390) or D2 receptor antagonists (spiperone and eticlopride) 10. min prior to the subsequent propofol self-administration. We demonstrated (i) systemic administration of SCH23390 (10, 30, 100 μg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the rate of propofol-maintained self-administration, suggesting a critical role of the D1 receptor in mediating propofol self-administration; (ii) the blockade of the propofol self-administration by SCH23390 was specific since spiperone and eticlopride did not affect propofol self-administration and SCH23390 at these doses did not affect food-maintained responding under an FR5 schedule; (iii) intra-accumbenal injection of SCH23390 (2.5 μg/site) but not eticopride (3.0 μg/site) attenuated the propofol self-administration, localizing nuclear accumbal D1 receptors as a critical locus in the reinforcement of propofol. Together, these findings provide the first direct evidence that D1 receptors in nuclear accumbens play an important role in the maintenance of propofol self-administration. © 2012 IBRO.

84879605557	NGF induces adult stem Leydig cells to proliferate and differentiate during Leydig cell regeneration	Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been reported to be involved in male reproductive physiology. However, few reports have described the activity of NGF during Leydig cell development. The objective of the present study was to examine the role of NGF during stem-Leydig-cell (SLC) regeneration. We investigated the effects of NGF on Leydig-cell (LC) regeneration by measuring mRNA levels in the adult rat testis after ethane dimethanesulfonate (EDS) treatment. Furthermore, we used the established organ culture model of rat seminiferous tubules to examine the regulation of NGF during SLC proliferation and differentiation using EdU staining, real-time PCR and western blotting. Progenitor Leydig cells (PLCs) and immature Leydig cells (ILCs) were also used to investigate the effects of NGF on LCs at different developmental stages. NGF mRNA levels changed significantly during Leydig-cell regeneration in vivo. In vitro, NGF significantly promoted the proliferation of stem Leydig cells and also induced steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and 3β-HSD protein expression. The data from PLCs and ILCs showed that NGF could increase Cyclin D1 and Hsd 17b3 mRNA levels in PLCs and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels in ILCs. These results indicate that NGF may play an important role during LC regeneration by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of LCs at different developmental stages, from SLCs to PLCs and from PLCs to ILCs. The discovery of this effect of NGF on Leydig cells will provide useful information for developing new potential therapies for PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84883467651	Effects of luteinizing hormone and androgen on the development of rat progenitor Leydig cells in vitro and in vivo	Progenitor Leydig cells are derived from stem cells. The proliferation and differentiation of progenitor Leydig cells significantly contributes to Leydig cell number during puberty. However, the regulation of these processes remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to determine whether luteinizing hormone (LH) or androgen contributes to the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor Leydig cells. Fourteen-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 7 days with NalGlu, which is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, to reduce the secretion of LH in the pituitary and thus, androgen in the testis. Rats were co-administered with LH or 7α-methyl- nortestosterone (MENT), which is an androgen resistant to metabolism by 5α-reductase 1 in progenitor Leydig cells, and the subsequent effects of LH or androgen were measured. 3 H-Thymidine was also intravenously injected into rats to study thymidine incorporation in progenitor Leydig cells. Progenitor Leydig cells were examined. NalGlu administration reduced progenitor Leydig cell proliferation by 83%. In addition, LH or MENT treatment restored Leydig cell proliferative capacity to 73%or 50%of control, respectively. The messenger RNA levels of proliferation-related genes were measured using real-time PCR. The expression levels of Igf1, Lifr, Pdgfra, Bcl2, Ccnd3 and Pcna were upregulated by MENT, and those of Pdgfra, Ccnd3 and Pcna were upregulated by LH. Both LH and MENT stimulated the differentiation of progenitor Leydig cells in vitro. We concluded that both LH and MENT were involved in regulating the development of progenitor Leydig cells. © 2013 AJA, SIMM & SJTU. All rights reserved.

84891474391	Environmental Pollutants and Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases	Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD) are a group of steroidogenic enzymes that are involved in the steroid biosynthesis and metabolism. Four classes of HSDs, namely, 3β-, 11β-, 17β-, and 20α-HSDs, are discussed. 3β-HSDs catalyze the conversion of pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone to progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and androstenedione, respectively. 11β-HSDs catalyze the interconversion between active cortisol and inactive cortisone. 17β-HSDs catalyze the interconversion between 17β-hydroxyl steroids and 17-ketoandrogens and estrogens. 20α-HSDs catalyze the conversion of progesterone into 20α-hydroxyprogesterone. Many environmental pollutants directly inhibit one or more enzymes of these HSDs, thus interfering with endogenous active steroid hormone levels. These chemicals include industrial materials (perfluoroalkyl compounds, phthalates, bisphenol A, and benzophenone), pesticides/biocides (methoxychlor, organotins, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane, and prochloraz), and plant constituents (genistein, gossypol, and licorice).

84893644129	CYP2C9 polymorphism analysis in Han Chinese populations: Building the largest allele frequency database	Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 significantly influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of some drugs, which might result in adverse drug effects and therapeutic failure. Several studies have been performed on CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms in Han Chinese populations. However, these studies only focused on two commonly investigated alleles, *2 and *3, in relatively small sample sizes. To scale up the gene-scanning region and determine relatively precise data on the genetic distribution pattern in Chinese populations, unrelated healthy Han Chinese volunteers from Zhejiang Province (n=1127) and Hebei (n=1000) Province were recruited as subjects for the direct sequencing of all exons of CYP2C9. As a result, 14 previously reported alleles were detected in this work, and 8 of these alleles (*14, *16, *19, *23, *27, *29, *33 and *34) were described for the first time in Chinese populations. In addition, 37 novel mutations were also detected, of which 22 variants were non-synonymous, and 21 new alleles, *36-*56, were designated by the Human CYP Allele Nomenclature Committee. In vitro functional analysis of these 22 novel CYP2C9 variants revealed that 17 mutations had a significant influence on the protein's catalytic activity. Our study provides the most accurate data on CYP2C9 polymorphisms in Han Chinese populations and detects the largest number of novel allelic variants existing to date. These new alleles will greatly enrich the current knowledge of naturally occurring CYP2C9 variants in Chinese populations. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84893689581	Effects of methoxychlor and its metabolite 2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane on human and rat 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase activity	Exposure to methoxychlor, an agricultural pesticide, has been associated with reduced testicular androgen secretion. However, methoxychlor is converted to 2,2-bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (HPTE) in the liver, which then acts as its biologically active metabolite. Both methoxychlor and HPTE have been credited with estrogenic properties and have a weak anti-androgenic activity. However, the exact mechanisms of steroidogenic enzyme inhibition remain to be clarified. In the present study, human and rat testis microsomes were employed to investigate the inhibitory activities of methoxychlor and HPTE on 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1). The CYP17A1 enzyme is critical for androgen biosynthesis and catalyzes conversion of progesterone into androstenedione. The results demonstrated that HPTE directly inhibited human and rat CYP17A1 activities, while methoxychlor had no effects on this enzyme activity even at a concentration of 100μM. The IC

84895072228	Effects of hydroxysafflor yellow A on the activity and mRNA expression of four CYP isozymes in rats	Ethnopharmacological relevance In traditional therapy with Chinese medicine, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), a main active component isolated from the dried flower of Carthamus tinctorius L., is the principal efficiency ingredient of Safflor Yellow Injection. Now HSYA has been demonstrated to have good pharmacological activities of antioxidation, myocardial and cerebral protective and neuroprotective effects. The purpose of this study was to find out whether HSYA influences the effect on rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C11, CYP2D4 and CYP3A1) by using cocktail probe drugs in vivo; the influence on the levels of CYP mRNA was also studied. Materials and methods A cocktail solution at a dose of 5 mL/kg, which contained phenacetin (20 mg/kg), tolbutamide (5 mg/kg), dextromethorphan (20 mg/kg) and midazolam (10 mg/kg), was given as oral administration to rats treated with short or long period of intravenous HSYA via the caudal vein. Blood samples were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0. In addition, real-time RT-PCR was performed to determine the effect of HSYA on the mRNA expression of CYP1A2, CYP2C11, CYP2D4 and CYP3A1 in rat liver. Results HSYA had significant inhibition effects on CYP1A2 and CYP2C11 in rats as oriented from the pharmacokinetic profiles of the probe drugs. Furthermore, HSYA had no effects on rat CYP2D4. However, CYP3A1 enzyme activity was induced by HSYA. The mRNA expression results were in accordance with the pharmacokinetic results. Conclusions HSYA can either inhibit or induce activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C11 and CYP3A1. Therefore, co-administration of some CYP substrates with HSYA may need dose adjustment to avoid an undesirable herb-drug interaction. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84899949874	Effects of estradiol and methoxychlor on Leydig cell regeneration in the adult rat testis	The objective of the present study is to determine whether methoxychlor (MXC) exposure in adulthood affects rat Leydig cell regeneration and to compare its effects with estradiol (E2). Adult 90-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats received ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS) to eliminate the adult Leydig cell population. Subsequently, rats were randomly assigned to four groups and gavaged with corn oil (control), 0.25 mg/kg E2 and 10 or 100 mg/kg MXC daily from days 5 to 30 post-EDS treatment. The results showed that MXC and E2 reduced serum testosterone levels on day 58 post-EDS treatment. qPCR showed Hsd17b3 mRNA levels were downregulated 7-15 fold by E2 and MXC, indicating that development of the new population of Leydig cells was arrested at the earlier stage. This observation was supported by the results of histochemical staining, which demonstrated that Leydig cells in MXC-treated testis on day 58 post-EDS treatment were mostly progenitor Leydig cells. However, Pdgfb mRNA levels were downregulated, while Lif transcript levels were increased by MXC. In contrast, E2 did not affect gene expression for these growth factors. In conclusion, our findings indicated that both MXC and E2 delayed rat Leydig cell regeneration in the EDS-treated model, presumably acting by different mechanisms. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84903779798	Regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of leydig stem cells in the adult testis	We reported previously that stem cells associated with adult rat testis seminiferous tubules are able to give rise to differentiated Leydig cells in vitro. The regulatory mechanisms by which they do so, however, are uncertain. Herein, we hypothesized that the proliferation and differentiation of Leydig cell stem cells (stem Leydig cells, SLCs) depend upon locally produced factors from the seminiferous tubules. Microarray analysis revealed that platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) is up-regulated and PDGFRbeta is downregulated with postnatal differentiation of SLCs. This suggested that their ligands, PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB, respectively, might have important roles in SLC proliferation and differentiation. To test this, we developed a unique in vitro culture system in which SLCs proliferate on the surfaces of cultured seminiferous tubules largely during Week 1 of culture and their progeny subsequently differentiate to testosterone-forming Leydig cells during Weeks 2 through 4. Using this system, seminiferous tubules from adult rat testes were cultured with PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB for up to 4 wk. Both ligands stimulated SLC proliferation during the first week of culture, with PDGF-BB significantly more potent than PDGF-AA. Furthermore, PDGF-AA had a stimulatory effect on SLC differentiation from Weeks 2 through 4 of culture. In contrast, PDGF-BB, which stimulated cell proliferation during Week 1, had a significant inhibitory effect on differentiation during Weeks 2 through 4. These findings, made possible by the development of the seminiferous tubule culture system, reveal distinct roles by locally produced PDGFs in SLC regulation. © 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

84907459434	Phosphoproteomic analysis of gossypol-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell line, HOC1a	Ovarian cancer is a major cause for death of gynecological cancer patients. The efficacy of traditional surgery and chemotherapy is rather compromised and platinum-resistant cancer recurs. Finding new therapeutic targets is urgently needed to increase the survival rate and to improve life quality of patients with ovarian cancer. In the present work, phosphoproteomic analysis was carried out on untreated and gossypol-treated ovarian cancer cell line, HOC1a. We identified approximately 9750 phosphopeptides from 3030 phosphoproteins, which are involved in diverse cellular processes including cytoskeletal organization, RNA and nucleotide binding, and cell cycle regulation. Upon gossypol treatment, changes in phosphorylation of twenty-nine proteins including YAP1 and AKAP12 were characterized. Western blotting and qPCR analysis were used to determine expression levels of proteins in YAP1-related Hippo pathway showing that gossypol induced upregulation of LATS1, which phosphorylates YAP1 at Ser 61. Furthermore, our data showed that gossypol targets the actin cytoskeletal organization through mediating phosphorylation states of actin-binding proteins. Taken together, our data provide valuable information to understand effects of gossypol on protein phosphorylation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells.

84908096932	Basic fibroblast growth factor promotes stem Leydig cell development and inhibits LH-stimulated androgen production by regulating microRNA expression	Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in the testes, and their steroidogenic function is strictly controlled by the hypothalamuspituitarygonad axis. Emerging evidence has indicated that fibroblast growth factors play a role in regulating stem Leydig cell development and steroidogenesis, but little is known about the regulatory mechanism. Using a seminiferous tubule culture system, we demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can promote stem Leydig cell proliferation and commitment toward differentiation in testosterone-producing Leydig cells. However, these promoting effects decreased with an increase in the bFGF dose. Previous studies have reported that bFGF inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated androgen production by downregulating the mRNA expression of steroidogenic genes in immature Leydig cells. However, the expression levels of 677 microRNAs did not change significantly during the LH-mediated process of testosterone synthesis. Five microRNAs (miR- 29a, -29c, -142-3p, -451 and -335) were identified, and their expression in immature Leydig cells was regulated simultaneously by bFGF and LH. These results suggested that the inhibition of LH-stimulated androgen production may be modulated by a change in bFGF-mediated microRNA expression, which further impacts the signaling pathway of testosterone biosynthesis and steroidogenic gene expression.

84910134522	Time-course changes of steroidogenic gene expression and steroidogenesis of rat leydig cells after acute immobilization stress	Leydig cells secrete testosterone, which is essential for male fertility and reproductive health. Stress increases the secretion of glucocorticoid (corticosterone, CORT; in rats), which decreases circulating testosterone levels in part through a direct action by binding to the glucocorticoid receptors (NR3C1) in Leydig cells. The intratesticular CORT level is dependent on oxidative inactivation of glucocorticoid by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11B1) in Leydig cells. In the present study, we investigated the time-course changes of steroidogenic gene expression levels after acute immobilization stress in rats. The plasma CORT levels were significantly increased 0.5, 1, 3 and 6 h after immobilization stress, while plasma testosterone levels were significantly reduced 3 and 6 h, after stress and luteinizing hormone (LH) did not change. Immobilization stress caused the down-regulation of Scarb1, Star and Cyp17a1 expression levels in the rat testis starting at the first hour of stress, ahead of the significant decreases of plasma testosterone levels. Other mRNA levels, including Cyp11a1, Hsd3b1 and Hsd17b3, began to decline after 3 h. Hsd11b1 and Nos2 mRNA levels did not change during the course of stress. Administration of glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 significantly restored plasma testosterone levels. In conclusion, Scarb1, Star and Cyp17a1 expression levels are more sensitive to acute stress, and acute immobilization stress causes the decline of the steroidogenic pathway via elevating the levels of glucocorticoid, which binds to NR3C1 in Leydig cells to inhibit steroidogenic gene expression.

84910635992	Down-regulation of ras-related protein rab 5C-dependent endocytosis and glycolysis in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines	Drug resistance poses a major challenge to ovarian cancer treatment. Understanding mechanisms of drug resistance is important for finding new therapeutic targets. In the present work, a cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780-DR was established with a resistance index of 6.64. The cellular accumulation of cisplatin was significantly reduced in A2780-DR cells as compared with A2780 cells consistent with the general character of drug resistance. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified 340 differentially expressed proteins between A2780 and A2780-DR cells, which involve in diverse cellular processes, including metabolic process, cellular component biogenesis, cellular processes, and stress responses. Expression levels of Ras-related proteins Rab 5C and Rab 11B in A2780-DR cells were lower than those in A2780 cells as confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting. The short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab 5C in A2780 cells resulted in markedly increased resistance to cisplatin whereas overexpression of Rab 5C in A2780-DR cells increases sensitivity to cisplatin, demonstrating that Rab 5C-dependent endocytosis plays an important role in cisplatin resistance. Our results also showed that expressions of glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, fructosebisphosphate aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 were down-regulated in drug resistant cells, indicating drug resistance in ovarian cancer is directly associated with a decrease in glycolysis. Furthermore, it was found that glutathione reductase were up-regulated in A2780-DR, whereas vimentin, HSP90, and Annexin A1 and A2 were down-regulated. Taken together, our results suggest that drug resistance in ovarian cancer cell line A2780 is caused by multifactorial traits, including the down-regulation of Rab 5C-dependent endocytosis of cisplatin, glycolytic enzymes, and vimentin, and up-regulation of antioxidant proteins, suggesting Rab 5C is a potential target for treatment of drug-resistant ovarian cancer. This constitutes a further step toward a comprehensive understanding of drug resistance in ovarian cancer.
