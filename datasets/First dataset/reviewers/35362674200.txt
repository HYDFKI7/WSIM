14344261018	Mesoporous materials derived from synthetic organo-clays composites	Mesoporous synthetic clays (MSCs) are obtained when modified organo-clays gels are hydrothermally crystallized, where small stacks of polymer-intercalated clay layers are themselves randomly oriented in a polymeric matrix, then the organic polymer template molecules are removed from synthetic polymer-clay complexes via calcinations. The distribution of mesopores is narrow, and mesoporous radius has relations with the polymer molecule weight and the wt% loading of polymer in the gel. The mesoporous materials can be used as hydrodesulfurization catalyst supports, the selective adsorption of molecules and the field of polymer-nanocomposites, etc. In this paper, the synthesis methods and application of MSCs were reviewed.

20444406496	Advances in the biodegradable polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites	The research on the preparation, characterization, materials properties, biodegradability, and application of biodegradable polymer/organically modified layered silicate (OMLS) nanocomposites was reviewed. The mechanical properties, thermal stability, heat distortion temperature, gas barrier property and biodegradability of neat biodegradable polymer is significantly enhanced after nanocomposites preparation with layered silicate. The melt rheology of biodegradable nanocomposites was also studied. These nanocomposites display the rheology of shear-thinning, increased moduli, and solidlike etc. In the preparation of nanocomposites, organoclay plays an important role in dispersing the clay into less polar polymer matrixes. The compatibilizer in nanocomposites was also investigated in the aspect of morphological analysis. A new idea for obtaining porous ceramic material from these biodegradable nanocomposites by burning is unveiled using various clays. In this paper, the advances of biodegradable polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites were reviewed.

20444481774	Mechanical properties of a single electrospun fiber and its structures	A method to measure the Young's modulus of a single electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber is reported. The Young's modulus can be calculated from the force-displacement curves obtained by the bending of a single fiber attached to an atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever. It is suggested that the high modulus of electrospun fibers is caused by the orientation of molecular chains, which is confirmed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements. The communication will provide a basic understanding of the relationship between mechanical properties and structures of electrospun fibers. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

24044472027	The bone formation in vitro and mandibular defect repair using PLGA porous scaffolds	Highly porous scaffolds of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) were prepared by solution-casting/salt-leaching method. The in vitro degradation behavior of PLGA scaffold was investigated by measuring the change of normalized weight, water absorption, pH, and molecular weight during degradation period. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded and cultured in three-dimensional PLGA scaffolds to fabricate in vitro tissue engineering bone, which was investigated by cell morphology, cell number and deposition of mineralized matrix. The proliferation of seeded MSCs and their differentiated function were demonstrated by experimental results. To compare the reconstructive functions of different groups, mandibular defect repair of rabbit was made with PLGA/MSCs tissue engineering bone, control PLGA scaffold, and blank group without scaffold. Histopathologic methods were used to estimate the reconstructive functions. The result suggests that it is feasible to regenerate bone tissue in vitro using PLGA foams with pore size ranging from 100-250 μm scaffolding for the transplantation of MSCs, and the PLGA/MSCs tissue engineering bone can greatly promote cell growth and have better healing functions for mandibular defect repair. The defect can be completely recuperated after 3 months with PLGA/MSCs tissue engineering bone, and the contrastive experiments show that the defects could not be repaired with blank PLGA scaffold. PLGA/MSCs tissue engineering bone has great potential as appropriate replacement for successful repair of bone defect. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

24344444874	Process optimization and empirical modeling for electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber precursor of carbon nanofibers	Ultrafine fibers were spun from polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) solution as a precursor of carbon nanofibers using a homemade electrospinning set-up. Fibers with diameter ranging from 200 nm to 1200 nm were obtained. Morphology of fibers and distribution of fiber diameter were investigated varying concentration and applied voltage by scanning electric microscopy (SEM). Average fiber diameter and distribution were determined from 100 measurements of the random fibers with an image analyzer (SemAfore 5.0, JEOL). A more systematic understanding of process parameters was obtained and a quantitative relationship between electrospinning parameters and average fiber diameter was established by response surface methodology (RSM). It was concluded that concentration of solution played an important role to the diameter of fibers and standard deviation of fiber diameter. Applied voltage had no significant impact on fiber diameter and standard deviation of fiber diameter. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Morphologies and structures of PAN precursors were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), infrared spectrometer (IR) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Distribution of diameters of PAN precursor showed log normal distribution. Molecular chains were oriented within the electrospun fibers during the electrospinning process. The cyclization exothermic peak shifted to lower temperature for electrospun nanofibers, which suggested that cyclization was more easily initiated at lower temperature for electrospun nanofibers. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Fibers with diameter ranging from 350 to 1 900 nm were obtained. Morphologies of fibers and distribution of fiber diameters were investigated varying concentration and applied voltage by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Average fiber diameter and distribution were determined from about 100 measurements of the random fibers with an image analyzer (SemAfore 5.0; JEOL). A more systematic understanding of process parameters of the electrospinning was obtained and a quantitative relationship between electrospinning parameters and average fiber diameter was established by response surface methodology (RSM). It was concluded that the concentration of polymer solution played an important role in the diameter of fibers and standard deviation of fiber diameter. Lower concentration tended to facilitate the formation of bead-on-string structures. Fiber diameter tended to increase with polymer concentration and decrease with applied voltage. Fibers with lower variation in diameter can be obtained at lower concentration regardless of applied voltage. Fibers with uniform diameter and lower variation in diameter can be obtained at higher concentration and higher applied voltage. Process conditions for electrospinning of PDLA could be chosen according to the model in this study. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

PVC/compatibilizer ((vinyl acetate) copolymer (VAc))/OMMT nanocomposites were also prepared by melt intercalation by a masterbatch process. The effect of OMMT content on the nanostructures and properties of nanocomposites was studied. The nanostructures were studied by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The linear viscoelastic properties and dynamic mechanical properties of PVC/OMMT nanocomposites were also investigated by an advanced rheometric expansion system (ARES) rheometer. The results showed that partially exfoliated and partially intercalated structures coexisted in the PVC/OMMT and PVC/VAc/OMMT nanocomposites. The mechanical properties test results indicated that the notched Charpy impact strengths of nanocomposites were improved compared to that of pristine PVC and had a maximum value at 1 phr OMMT loadings. The compatibilizer could further improve the impact strengths. But the existence of OMMT decreased the thermal stability of PVC/OMMT and PVC/VAc/OMMT nanocomposites. The linear viscoelastic properties test results indicated the dependence of G′ and G″ on ω shows nonterminal behaviors, and they had better processibility compared with pristine PVC. However, the glass transition temperatures of PVC/OMMT nanocomposites almost had little change compared to that of pristine PVC. © 2005 Society of Plastics Engineers.

34347355202	Repair of mandibular defects using MSCs-seeded biodegradable polyester porous scaffolds	PLLA, PLA-PEG and PLGA porous scaffolds with pore size ranging from 100 to 250 μm and porosity over 85% were fabricated by a solution-casting/ salt-leaching method. The porous structure and porosity of the scaffold were mainly dependent on volume fraction and size of the porogens of NaCl particles. The effects of the polymeric materials on the cell culture behavior and bone formation in vitro in their scaffolds were studied. In vitro cell culture in the scaffolds of the three polymers demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) had a good adhesion and spread. The composite matrixes cultured for several days possessed preliminary functions of tissue-engineering bone, with signs of the calcium knur formation and the expression of osteocalcin and collagen I in mRNA, especially that of PLA-PEG and PLGA. These cell-loaded porous scaffolds showed effective repair of mandibular defect of rabbits in vivo. Contrastive experiments demonstrated that the MSCs/PLGA scaffold owned better ability facilitating for the MSCs proliferation, differentiation and defect repair. These composite scaffolds can be a potential effective tool for treating mandibular and other bone defects. © VSP 2007.

By nanoprecipitation method, the PLA-PEG can be made into microspheres containing fenofibrate, which is a kind of important cholesterol-lowering drugs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the copolymer composition on the size, the entrapment and the release behavior of the fenofibrate loaded microspheres. The microspheres can be achieved with small size below 100 nm, better encapsulation efficiencies of more than 55.3% and slower release rates. The release of fenofibrate from microsphere would reach the balance first, when the microsphere prepared by high proportion of hydrophilic PEG block. And the release property of fenofibrate/PLA-PEG microsphere was better than Lipanthyl® (a commercial capsule of fenofibrate). It was observed that the composition of PLA-PEG copolymer played a major role in encapsulation efficiency of microspheres and release rates. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

36649020329	Melt rheology of polylactide/montmorillonite nanocomposites	In this article, the linear and nonlinear shear rheological behaviors of polylactide (PLA)/clay (organophilic-montmorillonite) nanocomposites (PLACNs) were investigated by an Advanced Rheology Expanded System rheometer. The nanocomposites were prepared by master batch method using a twin-screw extruder with poly(ecaprolactone) (PCL) as a compatibilizer. The presence of org-MMT leads to obvious pseudo-solid-like behaviors of nanocomposite melts. The behaviors caused by the formation of a "percolating network" derived from the reciprocity among the strong related sheet particles. Therefore, the storage moduli, loss moduli, and dynamic viscosities of PLACNs show a monotonic increase with MMT content. Nonterminal behaviors exists in PLACNs nanocomposites. Besides the PLACNs melts show a greater shear thinning tendency than pure PLA melt because of the preferential orientation of the MMT layers. Therefore, PLACNs have higher moduli but better processibility compared with pure PLA. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

39749088901	Preparation and properties of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)/ Nano-Hydroxyapatite (NHA) scaffolds by thermally induced phase separation and rabbit MSCs culture on scaffolds	Biodegradable polymer/bioceramic composites scaffold can overcome the limitation of conventional ceramic bone substitutes such as brittleness and difficulty in shaping. To better mimic the mineral component and the microstructure of natural bone, novel nano-hydroxyapatite (NHA)/polymer composite scaffolds with high porosity and well-controlled pore architectures as well as high exposure of the bioactive ceramics to the scaffold surface is developed for efficient bone tissue engineering. In this article, regular and highly interconnected porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)/NHA scaffolds are fabricated by thermally induced phase separation technique. The effects of solvent composition, polymer concentration, coarsening temperature, and coarsening time as well as NHA content on the micro-morphology, mechanical properties of the PLGA/NHA scaffolds are investigated. The results show that pore size of the PLGA/NHA scaffolds decrease with the increase of PLGA concentration and NHA content. The introduction of NHA greatly increase the mechanical properties and water absorption ability which greatly increase with the increase of NHA content. Mesenchymal stem cells are seeded and cultured in three-dimensional (3D) PLGA/NHA scaffolds to fabricate in vitro tissue engineering bone, which is investigated by adhesion rate, cell morphology, cell numbers, and alkaline phosphatase assay. The results display that the PLGA/NHA scaffolds exhibit significantly higher cell growth, alkaline phosphatase activity than PLGA scaffolds, especially the PLGA/NHA scaffolds with 10 wt.% NHA. The results suggest that the newly developed PLGA/NHA composite scaffolds may serve as an excellent 3D substrate for cell attachment and migration in bone tissue engineering. © SAGE Publications, Inc. 2008.

The physical properties, phase morphology, thermal properties, and melt rheological behavior of the blends were investigated by tensile tests, Charpy impact tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and advanced rheology expended system (ARES). With 2 or 5 wt% GMA, the tensile toughness of the PLA/PBAT blend was greatly increased without severe loss in tensile strength. The impact strength of the blend was also significantly improved at 1 wt% of GMA addition but ultimately trended to be saturated with increasing GMA. SEM micrographs revealed that better miscibility and more shear yielding mechanism were involved in the toughening of the blend. DSC results indicated that the blend is still a two-phase system in the presence of reaction agent and the addition of GMA was found to enhance the interfacial adhesion between PLA and PBAT. Rheological results revealed that the addition of T-GMA increased the storage moduli (G′), loss moduli (G″) and complex viscosity of the blends at nearly all frequencies. The decreased shear-thinning tendency of the blends in the presence of T-GMA also implied improved melt stability during processing. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Organic ECM is also a template for apatite mineralization in bone tissue. This study was aimed at designing a multilayer film containing an ECM-like molecule on biomaterial surfaces to direct apatite mineralization and to develop biomimetic biomaterials for bone tissue engineering. A multilayer film consisting of gelatin and poly(ethylenimine) molecules was formed on a poly(L-lactic acid) substrate via electrostatic self-assembly technique. Bone-like apatite coating was formed on the multilayer film modified poly(L-lactic acid) substrate in simulated body fluids (SBFs). The amount of forming apatite could be controlled by the Ca2+ and HPO4 2-concentrations in SBF and also through the mineralization time. Gelatin terminated multilayer film can induce the apatite formation with a weak orientation in the (002) plane and the apatite is similar in composition to the natural bone. The gelatin multilayer film/apatite composite coating may serve as a promising microenvironment for bone tissue formation and growth.

79952253494	Fabrication of porous scaffolds with a controllable microstructure and mechanical properties by porogen fusion technique	Macroporous scaffolds with controllable pore structure and mechanical properties were fabricated by a porogen fusion technique. Biodegradable material poly (D, L-lactide) (PDLLA) was used as the scaffold matrix. The effects of porogen size, PDLLA concentration and hydroxyapatite (HA) content on the scaffold morphology, porosity and mechanical properties were investigated. High porosity (90% and above) and highly interconnected structures were easily obtained and the pore size could be adjusted by varying the porogen size. With the increasing porogen size and PDLLA concentration, the porosity of scaffolds decreases, while its mechanical properties increase. The introduction of HA greatly increases the impact on pore structure, mechanical properties and water absorption ability of scaffolds, while it has comparatively little influence on its porosity under low HA contents. These results show that by adjusting processing parameters, scaffolds could afford a controllable pore size, exhibit suitable pore structure and high porosity, as well as good mechanical properties, and may serve as an excellent substrate for bone tissue engineering. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The H-shaped amphiphilic terpolymers can self-assemble into spherical nano-micelles in water. Because of the dually responsive (temperature and pH) properties of PDMAEMA segments, the hydrodynamic radius of the micelles of the H-shaped terpolymer solution can be adjusted by altering the environmental temperature or pH values. The thermal properties investigation and the crystalline morphology analysis indicate that the branched structure of the H-shaped terpolymers and the presence of amorphous PDMAEMA segments together led to the obvious decrease of PCL segments and the complete destruction of crystallinity of the PLLA segments in the H-shaped terpolymers. In addition, the H-shaped terpolymer film has better hydrophilicity than linear PCL or triblock polymer of PLLA-b-(N

The phase morphology of PLA/PBAT blends was observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The linear and non-linear shear rheological behaviors of PLA/PBAT melts were investigated by an advanced rheology expended system (ARES). The results show that PLA/PBAT blend is a kind of immiscible, two-phase system where PBAT disperses evenly in PLA matrix. Linear viscoelastic limits of PLA/PBAT melts are smaller than that of neat PLA melt. At lower frequencies, storage moduli (G′) of PLA/PBAT melts increase with PBAT content. PBAT content has no significant effect on loss moduli (G′′) of PLA/PBAT melts, but the relaxation moduli of the melts increase with the introduction of PBAT. At the same time, the incorporation of PBAT results in a gradual increase of the melt viscosity and a decrease of flow activation energy. Besides PBAT causes a decrease of flow index n, which is in conformity with the more serious shear-thinning tendency of PLA/PBAT melts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

FTIR and 1H NMR results indicate that grafting percentage of graft copolymers increases with the molar feeding ratio of L-lactide to chitosan. The measurement of XRD and TG shows that graft copolymer exhibits low crystallinity and thermal degradation temperature. Static water contact angle testing suggests that graft copolymer has superior hydrophilicity compared with PLLA, which can be very useful for biomedical applications. 5-Fluorouracil loaded copolymer microspheres were prepared by phase separation method.

49549100905	Preparation and characterization of electrospun, biodegradable membranes	Nonwoven, biodegradable membranes fabricated by electrospinning have recently attracted a great deal of attention for biomedical applications. In this study, microporous, nonwoven membranes of poly(L-lactide) and its copolymers and blends were fabricated through electrospinning. The structures and morphologies of the electrospun membranes were investigated with scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. Different polymer membranes, incorporated with carmofur, were fabricated, and their drug release profiles were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the fiber diameters were down to the nanometer range. The diameters and morphologies of the nanofibers depended on processing parameters such as the solution properties (concentration and polymer molecular weight), applied electric voltage, solution feeding rate, and needle diameter. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the crystallinity of the electrospun membranes was lower than that of the cast film. For all the membranes incorporated with the drug, there was a burst release in the first 10 h of incubation in phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C. Poly(glycolide-co- lactide) membranes showed faster and more complete drug release than poly(L-lactide), and this could be attributed to its faster degradation. The incorporation of polylactide-poly(ethylene glycol) could shorten the drug release time. A combination of suitable degradable biomaterials with an appropriate electrospinning process could be useful in the fabrication of a new kind of membrane suitable for different biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and drug delivery. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

52749093531	Effect of pre-aging on properties of 2000 series aluminum alloy for automotive body sheets	The effects of pre-aging treatment on the tensile properties, formability and microstructures of 2036 aluminum alloy for automobile body sheets were investigated using the tensile tests, DSC analysis and TEM observation. The results show that the alloy is softened, which is pre-aged at 180°C within 20 min and then natural aging, namely T4P. However, the yield strength decreases first and then rises. The yield strength of the alloy after T4P (10 min) reaches the minimal value 202.3 MPa, but the elongation and strain hardening exponent arrive at the maximum, 25.5% and 0.26 respectively, which can improve its formability effectively. In the early stage of T4P, GP zones dissolve, and generate some θ″ nuclei, so the strengthening effect is restrained during the natural aging following the pre-aging, which causes the decrease of the strength. With the increment of pre-aging time, the θ″ phases are formed. The number of the θ″ phases grows, and the strength increases sharply during the paint-bake treatment. In contrast with the 6000 series aluminum alloy for automobile body sheets, the paint-bake strengthening ability of the 2036 alloy is low and its yield strength before the paint bake is accordingly high, which will add to the difficulty of forming the sheets.

55349122572	Studies on morphologies and thermal properties of poly(lactic acid)/polycaprolactone/organic-modified montmorillonite nanocomposites	Poly(lactic acid)/organic montmorillonite (PLA/OMMT) nanocomposites were prepared via twin-screw extrusion. Montmorillonite (MMT) was firstly organically modified to improve the compatibility between polyester and MMT. The effects of ratio between PLA and OMMT and the addition of polycaprolactone (PCL), as a compatilizer, on the properties of PLA/OMMT nanocomposites were studied. The morphology and the properties of the nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, DSC, and TEM. Using OMMT, the intercalated structure was formed during the extrusion process and the OMMT interlayers space was enlarged. More OMMT content was apt to form thicker structure with more stacked individual silicate layers, which led to lower degree of crystallinity of PLA. It showed that 1 phr OMMT could result in the largest interlayers space and the best crystallization state. PCL can effectively increase the binding force between two phases and improve the order of the nanocomposites. In addition, the annealing after treatment can form regular structure and enhance the thermal properties of nanocomposites. © 2008 Society of Plastics Engineers.

By using scanning electron microscope(SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray(EDX), The surface of rubbing pairs and appearance of the self-repair coatings and their chemical composition are tested. The experimental results indicate that the wear time has a great influence on the formation of self-repair coating on the worn surface. When the time of friction and wear is 24 h, the sample weightlessness is zero, the self-repair coatings of the sample's worn surface are formed, which makes the surface smooth and the metal wear reduced effectively.

57449091171	Functional polymeric gene vectors	Safe and efficient gene delivery system is one of the most critical points for gene therapy. Polymeric nonviral gene carriers with good properties of safety, easy to design and inexpensive cost, have been utilized to deliver therapeutic genes in vivo. However, traditional polymers as gene vectors only have a few functions which can not meet gene therapy requirements, so it is necessary to decorate traditional polymer gene vectors and get an ideal gene delivery system with multifunction. This review focuses on the development and means of the modification of polymeric gene vectors making them have multifunction, i. e. the ability to maintain stability outside of cell, the ability of cell entrance, endosome escape, and the ability of nuclear membrane traversing. The main challenges remain and the future direction of polymeric vectors research are discussed.

A constitutive equation using up-dated Fields-Backofen equation was established to describe the flow behavior of 5182 aluminum alloy during warm tensile. The results show that at the same strain rate the flow stress reduces with increasing temperature. When the deforming temperatures are high (448, 523 and 573 K) and strain rate is low (0.001/s), the flow stress decreases after a peak value with increasing strain, showing continuous dynamic recrystallization. And with increasing strain rate, the steady state flow characteristics appear, showing dynamic recovery.

67349242726	Preparation, characterization and properties of binary and ternary blends with thermoplastic starch, poly(lactic acid) and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)	Binary and ternary blends of thermoplastic starch (TPS), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) were prepared using a one-step extrusion process. The concentration of TPS in both binary and ternary blends was fixed at 50 wt%, with the rest being PLA and PBAT. A compatibilizer with anhydride functional groups was used to improve the interfacial affinity between TPS and the synthetic polyesters. The addition of a small amount of compatibilizer greatly increased the mechanical properties of the blends. Mechanical properties of the blends exhibited a dramatic improvement in elongation at break with increasing PBAT content. Compared to the non-compatibilized blends, the morphology analysis of the blends showed that most of the TPS particles were melting and were well dispersed in the polyester matrix for the compatibilized blends. The water absorption data of the non-compatibilized blends increased more significantly than the compatibilized blends when PBAT content increased. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, the foaming rate of PLA is low due to its low viscosity and elasticity. To overcome these shortcomings, a biodegradable polyester, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) was blended with PLA to improve melt properties of PLA. Additionally, maleic anhydride (MAH) and 2,5- dimethyl-2,5-di-(tert-butylperoxy)hexane (L101) were added to improve the compatibility of PLA with PBAT. The blends were extruded into foams using a twin- screw extruder. The properties of extrudates were characterized by FTIR, DSC, ARES Rheometer, and SEM. The results show that complex viscosity of PLA/ PBAT blend increases by nearly 100% compared with pure PLA. Meanwhile, cell structure of foamed PLA/ PBAT blend is much larger and the distribution of cells is more homogenous. The foaming rate of PLA/ PBAT blend foams is raised by nearly 50% than that of pure PLA foams. © 2009 Society of Plastics Engineers.

The effects of Tween-80 on the size and distribution, entrapment efficiency and release behavior of AmB/PLA-b-PEG nanoparticles were investigated. Furthermore, the brain targeting and curative effect of coated nanoparticles were also investigated. The entrapment efficiency was significantly enhanced when nanoparticles were coated with Tween-80. The prepared nanoparticles were spherical with homogeneous distribution. Drug concentration in mice brain was greatly enhanced, which indicated that the coated nanoparticles could get across the BBB.

Ramie was treated by alkali and silane (3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane and γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane). Effect of surface treatment on the properties of the composites was studied. The tensile, flexural and impact strength of the composites have a significant improvement. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) results show that the storage moduli of the composites with treated ramie increase with respect to the plain PLA and the composites with untreated fiber whereas tangent delta decreases. The Vicat softening temperature of the composites with treated fiber is greatly higher than that of the composites with untreated fiber. The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) show that fiber treatment can improve the degradation temperature of the composites. Moreover, the morphology of fracture surface evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicates that surface treatment can get better adhesion between the fiber and the matrix. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The flame-retardant PLA was prepared using a twin-screw extruder and a two roll mill. Then, the influence of IFR and MMT on flame retardancy and melt stability was thoroughly investigated by means of limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electronic microscopy, melt flow index (MFI), and parallel plate rheological experiments. The experimental results show that the IFR system in combination with MMT has excellent fire retardancy, i.e. the sample could achieve a UL94 V-0 rating and LOI value increases from 20.1 for pristine PLA to 27.5 for the flame-retarded PLA.

We used press molding process to prepare the ramie fiber/PLLA composites, with short ramie fiber and ramie plain weave fabric as the reinforcement. The dispersivity of flame retardant ammonium polyphosphate (APP) was indirectly tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The result of sound absorption property measurement shows that the composites with short ramie fiber have better sound absorption property than the ramie fabric reinforced PLLA composites. And the addition of APP and plasticizer poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) improves the sound absorption property of ramie fabric/PLLA composites. Moreover, morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrate the micro-phase separation in the PBAT/PLLA composites and the porosity of the single ramie fiber bundle. The results suggest that these special structures are the main reason for the better sound absorption property. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The melting and crystallization behaviors and crystalline morphology of CS-g-PCL/PEO copolymers can be adjusted by the alteration of the feed ratio of PCL and PEO segments. CS-g-PCL/PEO copolymers revealed crystalline morphology different from that of linear alkynyl PCL and alkynyl PEO due to the influence of brush structure of copolymers and the mutual influence of PCL and PEO segments. The hydrophilicity of the CS copolymers can be improved and adjusted by the alteration of the composition of PCL and PEO segments. Moreover, the CS copolymers can self-assemble Into spherical micelles in aqueous solution. Investigation shows that the size of the CS copolymer micelles increased with the increase of the content of hydrophobic PCL segments in copolymers, which indicated that the micellar behavior of the copolymers can be controlled by the adjustment of the ratio of PCL and PEO segments in copolymer. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) results show that sulfur displays only on the modified surface. The RGD-modified PLGA/NHA materials also have much lower static water contact angle and much higher water-absorption ability, which shows that after chemical treatment, the modified materials show better hydrophilic properties. Atomic force microscope (AFM) shows that after surface modification, the surface morphology of PLGA is greatly changed. All these results indicate that RGD peptide has successfully grafted on the surface of PLGA. Rabbit bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were seeded in the 2D membranes and 3D scaffolds materials.

79951671078	Influence of fiber surface-treatment on interfacial property of poly(l-lactic acid)/ramie fabric biocomposites under UV-irradiation hydrothermal aging	The present study is devoted to the effect of fiber surface-treatment on the interfacial property of biocomposites based on poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) and ramie fabric. Ramie fiber is used as reinforced material because it's lowest water absorption among sisal, jute, kenaf and ramie fiber. Fiber surface-treatment can increase the water absorption of natural fibers. SEM images show that PLLA biocomposites with treated ramie fabric exhibit better interfacial adhesion character. DMA results show that the storage modulus of PLLA biocomposites with treated ramie increase compared to neat PLLA and PLLA biocomposites with untreated ramie. Unexpectedly, fiber surface-treatment can cause an accelerated decline in mechanical properties of PLLA biocomposites after UV-irradiation hydrothermal aging. Finally, GPC results show that there is no obvious decline in the molecular weight of PLLA. The main reason for this decline is the interfacial destructive effect induced by the water absorption of ramie fiber. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They can provide many advantages, such as total biodegradability and their abundant renewable sources. In the work reported, biocomposites based on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), ramie fabric (FAB) and microencapsulated ammonium polyphosphate (MCAPP) were synthesized via hot press molding using the powder-stacking procedure. The effects of transference behavior of the flame retardant on sustaining flame retardancy of the biocomposites were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the improved flame retardancy is due to an increased char residue at high temperature. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images and wide-angle X-ray diffraction data were used to investigate the hydrolysis reaction and transference behavior of ammonium polyphosphate in the biocomposites. UL-94 testing and limiting oxygen index measurements show that the PLLA/FAB/MCAPP biocomposites retain their flame retardancy even after 21 days in UV-irradiation hydrothermal aging tests. The good sustained flame retardancy of the PLLA/FAB/MCAPP biocomposites is attributed to the docking interactions and good distribution of MCAPP in the biocomposites.

The microstructure and linear viscoelastic properties wereinvestigated using rheological and morphological measurements. The results show that the purified CNTs disperse uniformly in the PP matrix. At low frequencies, frequency dependence of modulus weakens clearly with the addition of the CNTs, indicating that the long-range motion of the polymer chains is restrained by the presence of the CNTs. Percolation networks form when the loading levels achieve up to 3 and 1.5 wt% for the composites with the pristine CNTs (PPCNTs) and the purified CNTs (PPcCNTs), respectively. The linear relaxation modulus increases with increasing loading level. And for composites with loading levels above percolation concentration, the modulus appears to reach a plateau at long time scales due to the formation of percolation network. Tensile strength and impact strength are simultaneously improved with the addition of the CNTs. The better the dispersion of the CNTs, the greater the improvement of the tensile strength and the impact strength. Copyright © 2012 Society of Plastics Engineers.

For this purpose, short ramie fiber (FIB), ramie fabric (FAB), PLLA film (FPLLA), and PLLA powder (PPLLA) were used to investigate the structure-property relationship of PLLA biocomposites with 30wt% ramie fiber prepared by hot compression molding. It is revealed that mechanical properties of biocomposites are strongly dependent on the morphology of PLLA and FAB. DMA test shows that the improved storage modulus was due to the better dispersion of FIB. DSC and POM tests show that PLLA/FIB biocomposites have the highest spherulite growth rate. TGA test shows that char residue at high temperature is affected by the dispersion of PLLA and ramie fiber. SEM images exhibit the different interfacial adhesion character of FIB and FAB in the PLLA matrix after the ramie fiber treated with alkali and silane. PLLA/FAB biocomposites have not only better anti-dripping properties when burning but also better aging resistance in UV-irradiation hydrothermal aging, and which can be attributed to fiber bundle and laminated PLLA biocomposites structure. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The effect of star architecture, e.g. varying arm length, on the properties of the cured products was examined. Based on differential scanning calorimetry, the non-isothermal and isothermal curing behaviors of these M4sPLAs were investigated. Various curing kinetic parameters were obtained and elucidated using autocatalytic reaction models. Experimental results indicate that the oligomers can be crosslinked into a rigid network within a curing time varying from several minutes to more than an hour upon thermal initiation. The curing processes of M4sPLAs with varying arm length are different and complex, as indicated by the change of various kinetic parameters, reaction orders and evolutions of activation energy under the test reaction conditions. High crosslinking density is especially effective for improving the thermal stability of polylactide, but also leads to slower degradation rate and deterioration of its impact properties. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

84870867021	Interaction of human fibroblasts with electrospun composites gelatin/PLLA, chitosan/PLLA and PLLA fibrous scaffolds	Highly porous ultrafine electrospun scaffolds, gelatin/poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and chitosan/PLLA were prepared by blending gelatin and PLLA, chitosan and PLLA respectively. The biocompatibilities of these scaffolds were assessed by attachment, proliferation and viability of cells on them. The results indicated that over 30% WI-38 cells could attach to the gelatin/PLLA and chitosan/PLLA scaffolds at 2 h after seeding, while the attachment of the cells was only 15% on PLLA scaffolds. Both gelatin/PLLA and chitosan/PLLA scaffolds also exhibited a very good ability for proliferation of WI-38 cells. Cell growth on the gelatin/PLLA and chitosan/ PLLA scaffolds showed dramatic improvement, indicating a much better biocompatibility in the blends contributed by gelatin and chitosan. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay also demonstrated gelatin/PLLA showed better ability to enhance the growth and functions of the cells. These assays suggest that the electrospun gelatin/PLLA and chitosan/PLLA scaffolds are promising biomaterials with great biocompatibility for the development of skin tissue engineering. © Shanghai Jiaotong University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84874021891	Preparation and Properties of Biodegradable Poly(lactic acid)/Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) Blend with Epoxy-Functional Styrene Acrylic Copolymer as Reactive Agent	Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) are biodegradable polyesters and can be blended by twin-screw extrusion. Epoxy-functional styrene acrylic copolymer (ESA) was used as reactive agent for PLA/PBAT blends and the mechanical properties, phase morphology, thermal properties, melt properties, and melt rheological behaviors of the blends were investigated. During thermal extrusion, ESA was mainly a chain extender for the PLA matrix but had no evident reaction with PBAT. The great improvement in the toughness of PLA based blends was achieved by the addition of PBAT of no less than 15 wt% and that of ESA of no more than 0. 5 wt%. Although SEM micrographs and the reduced deviation of the terminal slope of G′ and G″ indicated better compatibility and adhesion between the two phases, the blend with ESA was still a two-phase system as indicated in DSC curves. Rheological results reveal that the addition of ESA increased the storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″) and complex viscosity of the blend at nearly all frequencies. The melt strength and melt elasticity of the blend are improved by addition of ESA. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84874826706	Bio-based furan polymers with self-healing ability	We report the preparation of a furan polymer, poly(2,5-furandimethylene succinate) by means of a condensation reaction between bio-based monomers. A reversible Diels-Alder reaction between furan and maleimide groups allowed the formation of network polymers cross-linked by a bismaleimide. By controlling the amount of the bismaleimide, mechanical properties were varied widely. These network polymers healed well when their broken surfaces were activated by bismaleimide solutions or solvent. The polymers also displayed excellent self-healing ability without external stimulus. This polymer class offers a wide range of possibilities to produce materials from biomass that have both practical mechanical properties and healing ability. These materials have the potential to bring great benefits to our daily lives by enhancing the safety, performance, and lifetime of products. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84875037295	Creation of Lung-Targeted Dexamethasone Immunoliposome and Its Therapeutic Effect on Bleomycin-Induced Lung Injury in Rats	Objective: Acute lung injury (ALI), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, which is routinely treated with the administration of systemic glucocorticoids. The current study investigated the distribution and therapeutic effect of a dexamethasone(DXM)-loaded immunoliposome (NLP) functionalized with pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) antibody (SPA-DXM-NLP) in an animal model. Methods: DXM-NLP was prepared using film dispersion combined with extrusion techniques. SP-A antibody was used as the lung targeting agent. Tissue distribution of SPA-DXM-NLP was investigated in liver, spleen, kidney and lung tissue. The efficacy of SPA-DXM-NLP against lung injury was assessed in a rat model of bleomycin-induced acute lung injury. Results: The SPA-DXM-NLP complex was successfully synthesized and the particles were stable at 4°C. Pulmonary dexamethasone levels were 40 times higher with SPA-DXM-NLP than conventional dexamethasone injection. Administration of SPA-DXM-NLP significantly attenuated lung injury and inflammation, decreased incidence of infection, and increased survival in animal models. Conclusions: The administration of SPA-DXM-NLP to animal models resulted in increased levels of DXM in the lungs, indicating active targeting. The efficacy against ALI of the immunoliposomes was shown to be superior to conventional dexamethasone administration. These results demonstrate the potential of actively targeted glucocorticoid therapy in the treatment of lung disease in clinical practice. © 2013 Chen et al.

84879817923	Surface modification of graphene oxide with thermoresponsive polymers via atom transfer radical polymerization: Transition from LCST to UCST	Graphene oxide-poly(2-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (GO-PDMAEMA) nanocomposite was synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and PDMAEMA chains were grafted on the surface of GO. After quaternization, quaternized GO-PDMAEMA nanocomposite was achieved. GO-PDMAEMA shows a lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type thermoresponsivity, and the dispersion-aggregation behavior was controlled by changing the temperature of the solution. The hydrophilicity of GO-PDMAEMA decreased with increasing temperature. Conversely, the dispersion and hydrophilicity of quaternized GO-PDMAEMA increased with increasing temperature due to the upper critical solution temperature (UCST)-type thermoresponsivity. So the LCST-UCST transition can be accomplished by the transition of PDMAEMA to quaternized PDMAEMA on the surface of GO. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84879219515	Thermo-sensitive drug delivery and relevant applications on thermo-chemotherapy	Due to the effectiveness of hyperthermia on significant enhancement of drug cytotoxicity, thermo-chemotherapy has become an extraordinarily encouraging approach to optimize cancer therapy by combing hyperthermia and chemotherapy. Moreover, a great number of in vitro/vivo researches and random clinic trials have confirmed its effectiveness, which is affected greatly by thermal dose. Meanwhile, hyperthermia is also a critical factor on triggering drug release of thermal-sensitive drug delivery. Accordingly, it is an optimal design that thermal-sensitive drug carriers integrate with local hyperthermia to realize the targeted thermo-chemotherapy. Therefore, the thermal-sensitive drug carriers displayed a unique potential and applied prospection on targeted thermo-chemotherapy, which contributed to increasing drug concentration, enhancing drug cytotoxicity, lowering effective dose and alleviating side effects further. In this review, the research situation of thermal-sensitive drug carriers on chemotherapy and its advantage on thermo-chemotherapy were summarized briefly as the applied background. In addition, the biological rationales and research situation of thermo-chemotherapy were expounded. Based on aforementioned researches, the review focused on the research situation of the thermal-sensitive drug delivery on thermo-chemotherapy. Furthermore, the review highlighted the composite thermal-sensitive carriers containing functional photothermal/magnetocaloric nanoparticles, because their self-heating and self-imaging can be untilized for precise targeting and monitoring. Finally, the review analyzed and stressed the relationship between properties of thermal-sensitive nanocarriers and optimal TER temperature, and pointed out development tendency of composite thermal-sensitive carriers on thermal-chemotherapy.

84883203355	Self-healing bio-based furan polymers cross-linked with various bis-maleimides	A series of bio-based self-healing polymers was prepared by cross-linking a furan polymer, poly(2,5-furandimethylene succinate), with bis-maleimide compounds by means of Diels-Alder reactions. In addition to the amount of the bis-maleimide linker, the molecular structure of the bis-maleimide played a key role in determining the extent of the Diels-Alder reaction and the mechanical and healing properties of the polymers. Bis-maleimides with phenylene rings markedly enhanced the tensile strength of the network polymers but hindered healing. In contrast, bis-maleimides with a flexible molecular structure tended to improve the polymer elongation, affording polymers with excellent healing ability. The efficiencies of self-healing (=healing without any external stimulus) and healing with an assistance of solvent (CHCl

84892612994	Amphiphilic star-shaped poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(l -lysine) copolymers with porphyrin core: Synthesis, self-assembly, and cell viability assay	Star-shaped copolymers poly(ε-caprolactone)-bolck-poly(ε- benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine) (SPPCL-b-PZLLs) with porphyrin core were synthesized by a sequential ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of CL and Nε-Benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine N-Carboxyanhydride. After the deprotection of benzyloxycarbonyl groups in polylysine blocks, the star-shaped amphiphilic copolymers SPPCL-b-PLLs were obtained. These amphiphilic copolymers can self-assemble into micelles or aggregates in aqueous solution. Investigation shows that the morphology of micelles/aggregates varied according to the change of pH values of media, indicating the pH-responsive property of SPPCL-b-PLL copolymers. Furthermore, associated with conjugated porphyrin cores, the SPPCL-b-PLL copolymers micelles showed a certain degree of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) effects on tumor cells, suggesting its potential application as carrier for hydrophobic drug with additional therapeutic ability of inherent porphyrin segments. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84898942948	Preparation and properties of ramie fabric-reinforced thermoset poly lactic acid composites	Ramie fabric-reinforced thermoset poly lactic acid composites were produced from ramie fabrics and methacrylated four-armed star-shaped poly lactic acid resin by hot press molding. The resin was brushed uniformly on the surface of ramie fabrics. The properties of the composites were investigated by mechanics performance test, water absorption test, dynamic mechanical analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The result shows that ramie content should be properly controlled at as much as 48%. The composite with 8% alkali treatment obtained higher tensile strength and flexural strength, as well as decreased impact strength caused by surface treatment. The composite with treated ramie fabrics had slightly better water resistance and thermal stability than those without surface treatment because of enhanced interfacial adhesion between fabrics and matrix. The DMA results and morphologies of the composites confirmed the improvement of ramie-matrix interface bonding. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

84899835565	Preparation and in vitro pH-responsive drug release of amphiphilic dendritic star-block copolymer complex micelles	Amphiphilic dendritic star-block copolymer PCL-b-PDMAEMA composed of poly(ε-caprolactone) and poly(2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) was synthesized successfully. In an aqueous solution, the copolymer could simultaneously self-assemble into unimolecular micelles and multimolecular mielles with mean diameters of about 28 nm and 190 nm, respectively. Dynamic light scattering measurements of these copolymer micelles showed bimodal size distribution. in vitro drug release behavior of the complex micelles loading camptothecin indicated that the rate of drug release could be effectively controlled by altering the pH values of the environment. The cytotoxicity assay confirmed the low cytotoxicity of the complex micelles and the significant drug efficacy. The confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that the drug-loaded micelles could penetrate the cell membrane and be internalized into cytoplasm and cell nucleus of HeLa cells. Thus, the pH-responsive dendritic PCL-b-PDMAEMA micelles could be promising drug delivery vehicles for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84902269346	Preparation and optimization of biodegradable star-block copolymer micelles for temperature-triggered drug release	Biodegradable and thermoresponsive star-block copolymer micelles were prepared and optimized for temperature-triggered drug release. The star-block poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl methacrylate-co-oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 42.8 °C was chosen to self-assemble into micelles for doxorubicin (DOX) loading. For comparison, the non-thermoresponsive star-block poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) micelles with similar composition and diameter were also used to load DOX. The thermoresponsive micelles exhibit an excellent temperature-triggered drug release behavior and pulsed response to the temperature switching between 25 °C (below the LCST) and 45 °C (above the LCST). The cytotoxicity assay confirmed the effective growth inhibition for HepG2 cells induced by DOX-loaded thermoresponsive micelles, while the blank micelles had low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. The confocal laser scanning microscopy suggested that the DOX-loaded micelles could internalize into cytoplasm and cell nucleus of HepG2 cells. The thermoresponsive star-block copolymer micelles can potentially be used in the controlled drug delivery applications. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84905500069	Influence of poly(butylenes adipate-co-terephthalate) on the properties of biodegradable composites	Natural fiber(NF) reinforced poly(lactic acid)(PLA) composites have received a lot of research attention because of their excellent biodegradablity. However with the addition of the flame retardancy, the properties of the composites such as the mechanical properties are greatly decreased. Poly(butylenes adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is an aliphatic-aromatic copolyester, which is fully biodegradable. In the view of its high toughness and biodegradability, PBAT is considered as a good candidate for the toughening of PLA matrix. In the present study, jute /poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylenes adipate-co-terephthalate) (jute/PLA/PBAT) composites were prepared by twin-screw extruder and two-roll mill. Ammonium polyphosphate was used as flame retardancy. The effect of PBAT on the properties such as tensile, flexural and impact strength of the composites were studied. Flammability and melt stability of the composites were thoroughly evaluated by means of limiting oxygen index(LOI) measurement, 60 second vertical burn test, and thermogravimetric(TG) analysis. The results showed that with the addition of PBAT, the composites can get comparatively better mechanical properties and flammability properties.

0942279246	Rheology of poly(propylene)/clay nanocomposites	The linear and nonlinear shear rheological behaviors of poly(propylene) (PP)/clay (organophilic-mont-morillonite) nanocomposites (PP/org-MMT) were investigated by an ARES rheometer. The materials were prepared by melt intercalation with maleic anhydride functionalized PP as a compatibilizer. The storage moduli (G′), loss moduli (G″), and dynamic viscosities of polymer/clay nanocomposites (PPCNs) increase monotonically with org-MMT content. The presence of org-MMT leads to pseudo-solid-like behaviors and slower relaxation behaviors of PPCN melts. For all samples, the dependence of G′ and G″ on ω shows nonterminal behaviors. At lower frequency, the steady shear viscosities of PPCNs increase with org-MMT content. However, the PPCN melts show a greater shear thinning tendency than pure PP melt because of the preferential orientation of the MMT layers. Therefore, PPCNs have higher moduli but better processibility compared with pure PP.

13844281476	Preparation, characterization and properties of poly (vinyl chloride)/compatibilizer/organophilic-montmorillonite nanocomposites by melt intercalation	Poly (vinyl chloride)/compatibilizer/organophilic-montmorillonite (OMMT) nanocomposites have been prepared by melt intercalation by the masterbatch process. PVC/OMMT nanocomposites have also been prepared by directly blending PVC with OMMT for comparison. All the composites were characterized by Wide-angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The results of WAXD and TEM indicate that PVC/VAc/OMMT nanocomposites with exfoliated structure have been successfully prepared, whilst partially intercalated and partially exfoliated PVC/OMMT nanocomposites have also been produced. Notched Charpy impact strengths of all the composites are dramatically enhanced compared with that of pristine PVC material. PVC/VAc/OMMT nanocomposites show higher values of tensile strength, elongation at break and impact strength than PVC/OMMT nanocomposites, and nanocomposites containing more compatibilizer also display better mechanical properties. Impact strengths also display some peculiar dependence on OMMT content and give a maximum value at certain OMMT loadings, in this paper, 1phr. The OMMT content should be kept below 5phr in order to obtain good mechanical properties. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
