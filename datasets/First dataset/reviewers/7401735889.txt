58149357363	Biopharmaceutics and therapeutic potential of engineered nanomaterials	Engineered nanomaterials are at the leading edge of the rapidly developing nanosciences and are founding an important class of new materials with specific physicochemical properties different from bulk materials with the same compositions. The potential for nanomaterials is rapidly expanding with novel applications constantly being explored in different areas. The unique size-dependent properties of nanomaterials make them very attractive for pharmaceutical applications. Investigations of physical, chemical and biological properties of engineered nanomaterials have yielded valuable information. Cytotoxic effects of certain engineered nanomaterials towards malignant cells form the basis for one aspect of nanomedicine. It is inferred that size, three dimensional shape, hydrophobicity and electronic configurations make them an appealing subject in medicinal chemistry. Their unique structure coupled with immense scope for derivatization forms a base for exciting developments in therapeutics. This review article addresses the fate of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of engineered nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. It updates the distinctive methodology used for studying the biopharmaceutics of nanoparticles. This review addresses the future potential and safety concerns and genotoxicity of nanoparticle formulations in general. It particularly emphasizes the effects of nanoparticles on metabolic enzymes as well as the parenteral or inhalation administration routes of nanoparticle formulations. This paper illustrates the potential of nanomedicine by discussing biopharmaceutics of fullerene derivatives and their suitability for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Future direction is discussed as well. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

84867018850	Biomedical nanomaterials for imaging-guided cancer therapy	To date, even though various kinds of nanomaterials have been evaluated over the years in order to develop effective cancer therapy, there is still significant challenges in the improvement of the capabilities of nano-carriers. Developing a new theranostic nanomedicine platform for imaging-guided, visualized cancer therapy is currently a promising way to enhance therapeutic efficiency and reduce side effects. Firstly, conventional imaging technologies are reviewed with their advantages and disadvantages, respectively. Then, advanced biomedical materials for multimodal imaging are illustrated in detail, including representative examples for various dual-modalities and triple-modalities. Besides conventional cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy), current biomaterials are also summarized for novel cancer therapy based on hyperthermia, photothermal, photodynamic effects, and clinical imaging-guided surgery. In conclusion, biomedical materials for imaging-guided therapy are becoming one of the mainstream treatments for cancer in the future. It is hoped that this review might provide new impetus to understand nanotechnology and nanomaterials employed for imaging-guided cancer therapy. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84887476051	Preparation and characterization of doxorubicin functionalized tiopronin-capped gold nanorods for cancer therapy	Gold nanomaterials are immerging candidates in medical diagnosis and treatment. Among them, gold nanorods (Au NRs) are widely used for cancer treatment. Tiopronin as a novel thiol drug was used to stabilize Au NRs in this work. Doxorubicin (DOX), a chemotherapeutic drug which works by interacting with DNA to arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis, was linked to Au NRs through electrostatic reaction with tiopronin, to obtain Au-TIOP-DOX NRs. Au NRs are also regarded as hyperthermia agents for photothermal cancer treatment. This delivery system (Au-TIOP-DOX NRs) was designed for passively targeting tumor cells in cancer therapy. More importantly, the carboxyl groups of tiopronin can be modified with some biological molecules (DNA/RNA, peptides, or drugs) to make Au NRs as a novel drug-delivery system for cancer treatment. © 2013 The Author(s).

84897942468	pH-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles employed in controlled drug delivery systems for cancer treatment	In the fight against cancer, controlled drug delivery systems have emerged to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and safety of anti-cancer drugs. Among these systems, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with a functional surface possess obvious advantages and were thus rapidly developed for cancer treatment. Many stimuli-responsive materials, such as nanoparticles, polymers, and inorganic materials, have been applied as caps and gatekeepers to control drug release from MSNs. This review presents an overview of the recent progress in the production of pH-responsive MSNs based on the pH gradient between normal tissues and the tumor microenvironment. Four main categories of gatekeepers can respond to acidic conditions. These categories will be described in detail. Copyright © 2014 by Cancer Biology & Medicine.

84907999772	Multifunctional metal rattle-type nanocarriers for MRI-guided photothermal cancer therapy	In the past decade, numerous species of nanomaterials have been developed for biomedical application, especially cancer therapy. Realizing visualized therapy is highly promising now because of the potential of accurate, localized treatment. In this work, we first synthesized metal nanorattles (MNRs), which utilized porous gold shells to carry multiple MR imaging contrast agents, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), inside. A fragile wormpore-like silica layer was manipulated to encapsulate 8 nm oleylamine SPIONs and mediate the in situ growth of porous gold shell, and it was finally etched by alkaline solution to obtain the rattle-type nanostructure. As shown in the results, this nanostructure with unique morphology could absorb near-infrared light, convert to heat to kill cells, and inhibit tumor growth. As a carrier for multiple SPIONs, it also revealed good function for T<inf>2</inf>-weighted MR imaging in tumor site. Moreover, the rest of the inner space of the gold shell could also introduce potential ability as nanocarriers for other cargos such as chemotherapeutic drugs, which is still under investigation. This metal rattle-type nanocarrier may pave the way for novel platforms for cancer therapy in the future.

48549104728	Nitrosoureas inhibit the stathmin-mediated migration and invasion of malignant glioma cells	Malignant gliomas are the most common primary intrinsic brain tumors and are highly lethal. The widespread migration and invasion of neoplastic cells from the initial site of tumor formation into the surrounding brain render these lesions refractory to definitive surgical treatment. Stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein that mediates cell cycle progression, can also regulate directed cell movement. Nitrosoureas, traditionally viewed as DNA alkylating agents, can also covalently modify proteins such as stathmin. We therefore sought to establish a role for stathmin in malignant glioma cell motility, migration, and invasion and determine the effects of nitrosoureas on these cell movement-related processes. Scratch wound-healing recovery, Boyden chamber migration, Matrigel invasion, and organotypic slice invasion assays were performed before and after the down-regulation of cellular stathmin levels and in the absence and presence of sublethal nitrosourea ([1-(2-chloroethyl)-3- cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea]; CCNU) concentrations. We show that decreases in stathmin expression lead to significant decreases in malignant glioma cell motility, migration, and invasion. CCNU, at a concentration of 10 μmol/L, causes similar significant decreases, even in the absence of any effects on cell viability. The direct inhibition of stathmin by CCNU is likely a contributing factor. These findings suggest that the inhibition of stathmin expression and function may be useful in limiting the spread of malignant gliomas within the brain, and that nitrosoureas may have therapeutic benefits in addition to their antiproliferative effects. ©2008 American Association for Cancer Research.

51849151349	Disruption of microfilaments by cytochalasin B decreases accumulation of cisplatin in human epidermal carcinoma and liver carcinoma cell lines	Background: Although cisplatin is a frequently used cancer chemotherapeutic drug, its effectiveness is hindered by the development of resistance in cancer cells. In order to understand the reason(s) for this resistance, the mechanism of uptake of cisplatin into cells must be characterized. While several previous studies showed structural differences between cisplatin-sensitive and resistant cells, the influence of microfilaments, known to affect transport of molecules into cells, and the influence of certain biophysical characteristics of the plasma membrane needed clarification. Results: We show that resistant human epidermal carcinoma (KB-CP20) and liver carcinoma (BEL-7404-CP20) cells become relatively more resistant if their already weak microfilaments are degraded by cytochalasin B treatment (.5-2 μM). The sensitive counterparts of these cells with intact microfilaments are not significantly affected by this treatment. We also show that the "fluidity" of the plasma membrane and the membrane potential of the sensitive and resistant cells studied do not appear to influence the uptake of cisplatin into the cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the status of the microfilament system influences the mechanism of uptake of cisplatin into cells. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

53349091778	SIRT1 contributes in part to cisplatin resistance in cancer cells by altering mitochondrial metabolism	Tumors frequently develop resistance to cisplatin, a platinum drug used as a cornerstone of present-day chemotherapy regimens, significantly decreasing its usefulness in the clinic. Although it is known that cisplatin-resistant (CP-r) cancer cells commonly grow more slowly and exhibit reduced uptake of various compounds, including nutrients,the effect of tumor metabolism on cisplatin resistance is unclear. It was found that in CP-r cells, uptake of 2-deoxyglucose was reduced due to dysfunction and altered morphology of mitochondria compared with cisplatin-sensitive parental cancer cells. The CP-r cells overexpressed SIRT1, a histone deacetylase that plays a central role in DNA damage response and transcriptional silencing. Incubation of drug-sensitive cells in low glucose medium induced the expression of SIRT1 and increased cellular resistance to cisplatin. Reduced SIRT1 expression by a SIRT1 SMART small interfering RNA duplex sensitized the >20-fold resistant CP-r cells to cisplatin treatment 1.5- to 2-fold, and SIRT1 overexpression by SIRT1 cDNA transfection increased cisplatin resistance in cisplatin-sensitive cells by 2- to 3-fold. Our findings therefore suggest that reduced glucose use and altered mitochondrial metabolism mediated by SIRT1 is one of several alterations that contribute to cellular resistance to cisplatin.

54949099957	The growth of complex nanostructures: Synergism of dipolar force and stacking-defects in anisotropic self-assembly	A study has presented the development of a plasmon excitation-assisted wet-chemical method for the preparation of complex inorganic dendrimers with multiple generations of branches. The presence of stacking defects has been found to be dominating the branching points in these complex nanostructures. The synergistic effects of the dipolar force and stacking defects in the anisotropic self-assembly process are essential for producing complex nanostructures with multiple generations of branches. The inorganic Au dendrimers may have significant applications in diverse areas including as potent catalysts without a supporting scaffold, templates for the synthesis of other nanomaterials, and potential carriers for specific molecules. The method is also applicable to the fabrication of other noble-metal dendrimers via the stacking-defect-modulated anisotropic self-assembly of nanoparticles.

70349408655	Current evaluation of the millennium phytomedicine - Ginseng (II): Collected chemical entities, modern pharmacology, and clinical applications emanated from traditional chinese medicine	This review, a sequel to part 1 in the series, collects about 107 chemical entities separated from the roots, leaves and flower buds of Panax ginseng, quinquefolius and notoginseng, and categorizes these entities into about 18 groups based on their structural similarity. The bioactivities of these chemical entities are described. The 'Yin and Yang' theory and the fundamentals of the 'five elements' applied to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are concisely introduced to help readers understand how ginseng balances the dynamic equilibrium of human physiological processes from the TCM perspectives. This paper concerns the observation and experimental investigation of biological activities of ginseng used in the TCM of past and present cultures. The current biological findings of ginseng and its medical applications are narrated and critically discussed, including 1) its antihyperglycemic effect that may benefit type II diabetics; in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated protection of ginseng on beta-cells and obese diabetic mouse models. The related clinical trial results are stated. 2) its aphrodisiac effect and cardiovascular effect that partially attribute to ginseng's bioactivity on nitric oxide (NO); 3) its cognitive effect and neuropharmacological effect that are intensively tested in various rat models using purified ginsenosides and show a hope to treat Parkinson's disease (PD); 4) its uses as an adjuvant or immunotherapeutic agent to enhance immune activity, appetite and life quality of cancer patients during their chemotherapy and radiation. Although the apoptotic effect of ginsenosides, especially Rh2, Rg3 and Compound K, on various tumor cells has been shown via different pathways, their clinical effectiveness remains to be tested. This paper also updates the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and immune-stimulatory activities of ginseng, its ingredients and commercial products, as well as common side effects of ginseng mainly due to its overdose, and its pharmacokinetics. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

77951175149	Multidrug resistance mediated by half ABC transporter ABCG2	Cancers are often intrinsically resistant or become resistant to treatment with conventional chemotherapy. This broad-spectrum resistance results in large part, but not solely, from overexpression of a variety of members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport proteins. ABCG2 (ABCP/MXR/BCRP), as a half ABC transporter, is a novel member of the ABC membrane transporters, which can actively transport a wide spectrum of drugs with varying chemical structures or cellular targets. ABCG2 is overexpressed in the intestine, liver, placenta, and the blood-brain barrier, where it plays a role in protecting the organs from potentially harmful ingested toxins. Moreover, ABCG2 is also highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, it seems that ABCG2 has a key function in stem cell regulation or protection from a variety of xenobiotics. Multiple of SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ABCG2 may affect absorption and distribution, altering the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs in patients. Like other members of the ABC transporter superfamily, such as MDRl and MRPl, ABCG2 is expressed in a variety of malignancies. Overexpression of ABCG2 in tumor cells confers cancer multidrug resistance to a variety of newly developed anticancer drugs including mitoxantrone, topotecan, epirubicin, anthracyclines and camptothecins. Furthermore, ABCG2 are advocated for use as potentially selectable markers in stem cell based gene therapy. Given the profound impact of ABCG2 on multidrug resistance in tumor cells and on in vivo pharmacology and toxicology, a complete understanding of the mechanism and biological function of ABCG2 will be important for understanding its normal physiology as well as potentially for the development of novel chemotherapeutic treatment strategies. The discovery, the biochemistry, the normal physiology and the current insight of human ABCG2 were introduced.

77957302255	Enhanced gene delivery and siRNA silencing by gold nanoparticles coated with charge-reversal polyelectrolyte	Charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles first prepared by layer-by-layer technique were employed to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) and plasmid DNA into cancer cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis measurements of siRNA confirmed the occurrence of the charge-reversal property of functional gold nanoparticles. The expression efficiency of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was improved by adjuvant transfection with charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, which also had much lower toxicity to cell proliferation. Lamin A/C, an important nuclear envelope protein, was effectively silenced by lamin A/C-siRNA delivered by charge-reversal functional gold nanoparticles, whose knockdown efficiency was better than that of commercial Lipofectamine 2000. Confocal laser scanning microscopic images indicated that there was more cy5-siRNA distributed throughout the cytoplasm for cyanine 5-siRNA/polyethyleneimine/cis-aconitic anhydride-functionalized poly(allylamine)/ polyethyleneimine/11- mercaptoundecanoic acid-gold nanoparticle (cy5-siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/PEI/MUA-AuNP) complexes.

78049427594	Nanomaterials Optimized to improve delivery efficiency for gene therapy	Polycationic nanoparticles are potential as polycationic nonviral vectors (polyplexes) to overcome the defects of traditional viral vectors. The low transfection efficiency in vivo was attributed to poor circulation of polyplexes with high residual positive charges on the surface, which cause them susceptible to agglomerate with negatively charged serum components and to be scavenged by macrophages, whereas, the positive charges are likewise beneficial polyplexes to interact with negative-charged plasma membranes of targeted cells and specifically increase intracellular transfection efficiency of polyplexes. Numerous studies focused on revealing the relationship between the structure of polycationic vectors and the transfection efficiency in vivo. The designed polyplexes in our group to extend nanoparticles circulation is possible to overcome other barriers including endosome escape, cytoplasmic transport and nuclear entry for ultimately successful gene transfection in vivo. Polyplexes circulation was prolonged by modifying with polycations such as PEIs, PDMAEMA, chitosan et al. It was found that PEGylation of polyplexes could improve the stability of polyplexes in vivo but dramatically decrease therapeutic efficiency due to reduced transfection. In addition, the strong hydrophilicity of the PEG segments could dissociate PEGylated polyplexes under the physiological environment and attenuate polycation carrying with target genes. polycationic nonviral gene delivery vectors in order to improve the circulation time and transfection efficiency in vivo for efficient gene therapyin order to improve the circulation time.

In vivo, the probe significantly enhanced the MRI signal. The image contrast between the peripheral region of the tumor and the non-involved muscle was nearly 50% higher two hours after administration of the nanocomplex. The liposomal nanocomplex increased the amount of Gd accumulated in tumors by factor 2.8 compared to that accumulated by using Magnevist alone.

In this paper, ternary complexes by coating polyglutamic acid-graft-poly(ethylene glycol)(PGA-g-mPEG) onto binary complexes of polycaprolactone-graft-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PCL-g-PDMAEMA) nanoparticles (NPs)/DNA were firstly developed for effective and targeted gene delivery. The coating of PGA-g-mPEG was able to decrease the zeta potential of the nano-sized DNA complexes nearly to electroneutrality without interferring with DNA condensation ability. As a result, the stability, the escape ability from endosomes and the transfection efficiency of the complexes were enhanced. The ternary complexes of PCL-g-PDMAEMA NPs/DNA/PGA-g-mPEG demonstrated lower cytotoxicity in CCK-8 measurements and higher gene transfection efficiency than the binary complexes in vitro. In addition, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed to quantify the membrane-damaging effects of the complexes, which is consistent with the conclusion of CCK-8 measurement for cytotoxicity assay. The in vivo imaging measurement and histochemical analysis of tumor sessions confirmed that the intravenous administration of the ternary complexes with red fluorescent protein (RFP) as payload led to protein expression in tumor, which was further enhanced by the targeted coating of PGA-g-PEG-folate. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79958005722	Controlling assembly of paired gold clusters within apoferritin nanoreactor for in vivo kidney targeting and biomedical imaging	Functional nanostructures with high biocompatibility and stability, low toxicity, and specificity of targeting to desired organs or cells are of great interest in nanobiology and medicine. However, the challenge is to integrate all of these desired features into a single nanobiostructure, which can be applied to biomedical applications and eventually in clinical settings. In this context, we designed a strategy to assemble two gold nanoclusters at the ferroxidase active sites of ferritin heavy chain. Our studies showed that the resulting nanostructures (Au-Ft) retain not only the intrinsic fluorescence properties of noble metal, but gain enhanced intensity, show a red-shift, and exhibit tunable emissions due to the coupling interaction between the paired Au clusters. Furthermore, Au-Ft possessed the well-defined nanostructure of native ferritin, showed organ-specific targeting ability, high biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity. The current study demonstrates that an integrated multimodal assembly strategy is able to generate stable and effective biomolecule-noble metal complexes of controllable size and with desirable fluorescence emission characteristics. Such agents are ideal for targeted in vitro and in vivo imaging. These results thus open new opportunities for biomolecule-guided nanostructure assembly with great potential for biomedical applications. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80054769453	Theranostic nanoparticles engineered for clinic and pharmaceutics	Nanomedicine is the manipulation of human biological systems at the molecular level using nanoscale or nanostructured materials. Because nanoscale materials interact effectively with biological systems, the use of nanodiagnostics and nanotherapeutics may overcome many intractable health challenges. A variety of nanoparticles have been designed with modifiable functional surfaces and bioactive cores. The engineering of nanoparticles can result in several advantageous therapeutic and diagnostic properties including enhanced permeation and retention in the circulatory system, specific delivery of drugs to target sites, highly-efficient gene transfection, and enhanced medical imaging.These nanoscale materials offer the opportunity to detect chronic diseases early and to monitor the therapeutic effects of nanoformulated drugs used in the clinic. Many of these novel nanoparticles contain both drug(s) and imaging agent(s) within an individual nanoparticle for simultaneous disease diagnosis and therapy. Further integration of therapeutic compounds with diagnostic agents into theranostic nanoparticles would be highly beneficial.However, the unique physiochemical properties that make nanomaterials attractive for therapy and diagnosis may be also associated with potential health hazards. Our research has demonstrated that the biological response to nanomaterials is related to many factors including exposure levels, systemic accumulation and excretion profiles, tissue and organ distribution, and the age of the test subject. Therefore, when engineering new nanomaterials for clinical use, researchers need to consider these factors to minimize toxicity of nanoparticles in these applications. We have fabricated and evaluated nanomaterials such as cationic amphiphilic polymers and metallofullerenes that demonstrate both high efficiency and low toxicity in gene therapy and/or chemotherapy. In this Account, we describe the development of theranostic nanomaterials with low toxicity and illustrate their potential use as novel nanomedicines in translational research. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

Researchers mostly employed AuNPs larger than 10 nm for different biological and medicinal applications in previous studies. Herein, we synthesized a novel small (2 nm) AuNPs, which were functionalized with the therapeutic peptide, PMI (p12), and a targeted peptide, CRGDK for selective binding to neuropilin-1(Nrp-1) receptors which overexpressed on the cancer cells and regulated the process of membrane receptor-mediated internalization. It was found that CRGDK peptides increased intracellular uptake of AuNPs compared to other surface conjugations quantified by ICP-MS. Interestingly, CRGDK functionalized AuNPs resulted in maximal binding interaction between the CRGDK peptide and targeted Nrp-1 receptor overexpressed on MDA-MB-321 cell surface, which improved the delivery of therapeutic P12 peptide inside targeted cells. Au@p12 + CRGDK nanoparticles indicated with highly effective cancer treatment by increasing p53 expression upregulated with intracellular enhanced p12 therapeutic peptide. These results have implications to design and functionalize different molecules onto AuNPs surfaces to make hybrid model system for selective target binding as well as therapeutic effects for cancer treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

81855171999	Gold nanoparticles induce autophagosome accumulation through size-dependent nanoparticle uptake and lysosome impairment	Development of nanotechnology calls for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of nanomaterials on biological systems. Autophagy is a lysosome-based degradative pathway which plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that nanoparticles from various sources can induce autophagosome accumulation in treated cells. However, the underlying mechanism is still not clear. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are one of the most widely used nanomaterials and have been reported to induce autophagosome accumulation. In this study, we found that AuNPs can be taken into cells through endocytosis in a size-dependent manner. The internalized AuNPs eventually accumulate in lysosomes and cause impairment of lysosome degradation capacity through alkalinization of lysosomal pH. Consistent with previous studies, we found that AuNP treatment can induce autophagosome accumulation and processing of LC3, an autophagosome marker protein. However, degradation of the autophagy substrate p62 is blocked in AuNP-treated cells, which indicates that autophagosome accumulation results from blockade of autophagy flux, rather than induction of autophagy. Our data clarify the mechanism by which AuNPs induce autophagosome accumulation and reveal the effect of AuNPs on lysosomes. This work is significant to nanoparticle research because it illustrates how nanoparticles can potentially interrupt the autophagic pathway and has important implications for biomedical applications of nanoparticles. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

We demonstrated that f-NPs inhibited the production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes and further interfered with the invasiveness of cancer cells in tissue culture condition. In the tissue invasion animal model, the invasive primary tumor treated with f-NPs showed significantly less metastasis to the ectopic site along with the decreased MMP expression. In the same animal model, we observed the formation of a fibrous cage that may serve as a physical barrier capable of cancer tissue encapsulation that cuts the communication between cancer- and tumor-associated macrophages, which produce MMP enzymes. In another animal model, the blood transfer model, f-NPs potently suppressed the establishment of tumor foci in lung. Based on these data, we conclude that f-NPs have antimetastasis effects and speculate that utilization of f-NPs may provide a new strategy for the treatment of tumor metastasis. From the Clinical Editor: In this study utilizing metallofullerenol nanoparticles, the authors demonstrate antimetastasis effects and speculate that utilization of these nanoparticles may provide a new strategy in metastatic tumor therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862586673	Enhanced dispersibility and cellular transmembrane capability of single-wall carbon nanotubes by polycyclic organic compounds as chaperon	The common aggregation of single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in solution is the critical obstacle to elucidate their unique physico-chemical characteristics and biological properties. Therefore, it is very important to overcome this barrier through manipulation of the weak interaction of small molecules with nanotube surface limited interface. A highly dispersed SWCNT system was achieved by binding with polycyclic organic compounds (POCs) including rhodamine 123, ethidium bromide, fluorescein isothiocyanate and 1-pyrene butyric acid as chaperons, in cooperation with sodium dodecyl sulfate. POCs were believed to penetrate through the interstices of aggregated SWCNTs and bind with individual SWCNTs to form highly dispersed and stable SWCNT-POC-surfactant conjugates in both water and phosphate buffer-serum solution, confirmed by gel electrophoresis, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The possible binding interaction includes π-π stacking with side-wall, electrostatic interactions with defect sites and coating surfactants. Compared to pristine SWCNTs, individual SWCNT-POC conjugates had improved transmembrane passage ability through both endocytosis and diffusion pathways, validated by laser scanning confocal microscopy and micro-Raman mapping techniques. For the applications of SWCNTs in drug delivery, in vitro imaging and other research fields, this novel strategy could provide highly dispersed SWCNTs with better efficiency of drug loading and stability. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84862316936	Construction of paclitaxel-loaded poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-g-poly (lactide)- 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine copolymer nanoparticle delivery system and evaluation of its anticancer activity	Background: There is an urgent need to develop drug-loaded biocompatible nanoscale packages with improved therapeutic efficacy for effective clinical treatment. To address this need, a novel poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-poly (lactide)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine [PHEMA-g-(PLA-DPPE)] copolymer was designed and synthesized to enable these nanoparticles to be pH responsive under pathological conditions. Methods: The structural properties and thermal stability of the copolymer was measured and confirmed by Fourier transform infrare d spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and thermogravimetric analysis. In order to evaluate its feasibility as a drug carrier, paclitaxel-loaded PHEMA-g-(PLA-DPPE) nanoparticles were prepared using the emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Results: The PHEMA-g-(PLA-DPPE) nanoparticles could be efficiently loaded with paclitaxel and controlled to release the drug gradually and effectively. In vitro release experiments demonstrated that drug release was faster at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4. The anticancer activity of the PHEMA-g-(PLA-DPPE) nanoparticles was measured in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vivo and in vitro. In comparison with the free drug, the paclitaxel-loaded PHEMA-g-(PLA-DPPE) nanoparticles could induce more significant tumor regression. Conclusion: This study indicates that PHEMA-g-(PLA-DPPE) nanoparticles are promising carriers for hydrophobic drugs. This system can passively target cancer tissue and release drugs in a controllable manner, as determined by the pH value of the area in which the drug accumulates. © 2012 Ma et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84863011004	Gold nanoparticles with asymmetric polymerase chain reaction for colorimetric detection of DNA sequence	We developed a novel strategy for rapid colorimetric analysis of a specific DNA sequence by combining gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with an asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (As-PCR). In the presence of the correct DNA template, the bound oligonucleotides on the surface of AuNPs selectively hybridized to form complementary sequences of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) target generated from As-PCR. DNA hybridization resulted in self-assembly and aggregation of AuNPs, and a concomitant color change from ruby red to blue-purple occurred. This approach is simpler than previous methods, as it requires a simple mixture of the asymmetric PCR product with gold colloid conjugates. Thus, it is a convenient colorimetric method for specific nucleic acid sequence analysis with high specificity and sensitivity. Most importantly, the marked color change occurs at a picogram detection level after standing for several minutes at room temperature. Linear amplification minimizes the potential risk of PCR product cross-contamination. The efficiency to detect Bacillus anthracis in clinical samples clearly indicates the practical applicability of this approach. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84863588510	Size-dependent radiosensitization of PEG-coated gold nanoparticles for cancer radiation therapy	Gold nanoparticles have been conceived as a radiosensitizer in cancer radiation therapy, but one of the important questions for primary drug screening is what size of gold nanoparticles can optimally enhance radiation effects. Herein, we perform in vitro and in vivo radiosensitization studies of 4.8, 12.1, 27.3, and 46.6 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles. In vitro results show that all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can cause a significant decrease in cancer cell survival after gamma radiation. 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have dispersive distributions in the cells and stronger sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles by both cell apoptosis and necrosis. Further, in vivo results also show all sizes of the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles can significantly decrease tumor volume and weight after 5 Gy radiations, and 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have greater sensitization effects than 4.8 and 46.6 nm particles, which can lead to almost complete disappearance of the tumor. In vivo biodistribution confirms that 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles are accumulated in the tumor with high concentrations. The pathology, immune response, and blood biochemistry indicate that the PEG-coated gold nanoparticles have not caused spleen and kidney damages, but give rise to liver damage and gold accumulation. It can be concluded that 12.1 and 27.3 nm PEG-coated gold nanoparticles show high radiosensitivity, and these results have an important indication for possible radiotherapy and drug delivery. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84864670257	Size-dependent localization and penetration of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in cancer cells, multicellular spheroids, and tumors in vivo	This work demonstrated that ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) smaller than 10 nm display unique advantages over nanoparticles larger than 10 nm in terms of localization to, and penetration of, breast cancer cells,multicellular tumor spheroids, and tumors inmice. Au@tiopronin nanoparticles that have tunable sizes from 2 to 15 nm with identical surface coatings of tiopronin and charge were successfully prepared. For monolayer cells, the smaller the Au@tiopronin NPs, the more AuNPs found in each cell. In addition, the accumulation of Au NPs in the ex vivo tumor model was size-dependent: smaller AuNPs were able to penetrate deeply into tumor spheroids, whereas 15 nm nanoparticles were not. Owing to their ultrasmall nanostructure, 2 and 6 nm nanoparticles showed high levels of accumulation in tumor tissue in mice after a single intravenous injection. Surprisingly, both 2 and 6 nm Au@tiopronin nanoparticles were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas 15 nm Au@tiopronin nanoparticles were found only in the cytoplasm, where they formed aggregates. The ex vivo multicellular spheroid proved to be a good model to simulate in vivo tumor tissue and evaluate nanoparticle penetration behavior. This work gives important insights into the design and functionalization of nanoparticles to achieve high levels of accumulation in tumors. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84865121664	DNA origami as a carrier for circumvention of drug resistance	Although a multitude of promising anti-cancer drugs have been developed over the past 50 years, effective delivery of the drugs to diseased cells remains a challenge. Recently, nanoparticles have been used as drug delivery vehicles due to their high delivery efficiencies and the possibility to circumvent cellular drug resistance. However, the lack of biocompatibility and inability to engineer spatially addressable surfaces for multi-functional activity remains an obstacle to their widespread use. Here we present a novel drug carrier system based on self-assembled, spatially addressable DNA origami nanostructures that confronts these limitations. Doxorubicin, a well-known anti-cancer drug, was non-covalently attached to DNA origami nanostructures through intercalation. A high level of drug loading efficiency was achieved, and the complex exhibited prominent cytotoxicity not only to regular human breast adenocarcinoma cancer cells (MCF 7), but more importantly to doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells, inducing a remarkable reversal of phenotype resistance. With the DNA origami drug delivery vehicles, the cellular internalization of doxorubicin was increased, which contributed to the significant enhancement of cell-killing activity to doxorubicin-resistant MCF 7 cells. Presumably, the activity of doxorubicin-loaded DNA origami inhibits lysosomal acidification, resulting in cellular redistribution of the drug to action sites. Our results suggest that DNA origami has immense potential as an efficient, biocompatible drug carrier and delivery vehicle in the treatment of cancer. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84865593611	Enhanced siRNA delivery and silencing gold-chitosan nanosystem with surface charge-reversal polymer assembly and good biocompatibility	A simple nanocarrier coated with chitosan and the pH-responsive charge-reversible polymer, PAH-Cit, was constructed using layer-by-layer assembly to deliver siRNA. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were di-rectly reduced and stabilized by chitosan (CS), forming a positively charged AuNP-CS core. Charge-reversible PAH-Cit and polyethylenimine (PEI) were sequentially deposited onto the surface of AuNP-CS through electrostatic interaction, forming a PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS shell/core structure. After loading siRNA, the cytotoxicity of siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS against HeLa and MCF-7R cells was negligible. This vehicle completely protected siRNA against enzymatic degradation at vector/RNA mass ratios of 2.5:1 and above. An in vitro release profile demonstrated an efficient siRNA release (79%) from siRNA/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS at pH 5.5, suggesting a pH-induced charge-reversing action of PAH-Cit. This mechanism also worked in vivo and facilitated the escape of siRNA from endosomes. Using this carrier, the uptake of cy5-siRNA by HeLa cells was significantly increased compared to PEI, an efficient polycationic transfection reagent. In drug-resistant MCF-7 cells, specific gene silencing effectively reduced expression of MDR1, the gene encoding the drug exporter P-gp, and consequently promoted the uptake of doxorubicin. This simple charge-reversal polymer assembly nanosystem has three essential benefits (protection, efficient uptake, and facilitated escape) and provides a safe strategy with good biocompatibility for enhanced siRNA delivery and silencing. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84866182280	Inhibitory effects of trolox-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles on tert-butylhydroperoxide induced RAW264.7 apoptosis	A nanocarrier, namely, hydroxylethyl-chitosan nanoparticles was developed in this research for delivering antioxidants with 6-hydroxy-2, 5, 7, 8-tetra-methylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (trolox) as a model antioxidant. The trolox-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (trolox-CS NPs) were prepared by modifying chitosan with epoxyethane, which self-assembled into NPs and entrapped trolox, and then characterized by their size, size distribution, morphology and in vitro trolox release profile. Intracellular trafficking of CS NPs was observed. The anti-oxidant effect and potential mechanism of trolox-CS NPs were subsequently investigated in RAW264.7 cells. The effects of trolox-CS NPs on RAW264.7 cells damaged by tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) were determined by MTT assay for cell viability, MDA assay for membrane lipid peroxidation, JC-1 probe and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining for mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) and RAW264.7 apoptosis, respectively. The trolox-CS NPs significantly improved cell viability and reduced MDA content compared with those of cells treated with free trolox. The trolox-CS NPs treatment inhibited MMP collapse and RAW264.7 apoptosis more obviously than free trolox. Molecular basis of apoptosis studied by western blotting revealed that trolox-CS NPs may block mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway through up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of Bax and inhibiting the activation of pro-caspase 3, PARP and Bid. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869187892	Effects of gestational age and surface modification on materno-fetal transfer of nanoparticles in murine pregnancy	Nanoparticle exposure in pregnancy may result in placental damage and fetotoxicity; however, the factors that determine fetal nanoparticle exposure are unclear. Here we have assessed the effect of gestational age and nanoparticle composition on fetal accumulation of maternally-administered nanomaterials in mice. We determined the placental and fetal uptake of 13...nm gold nanoparticles with different surface modifications (ferritin, PEG and citrate) following intravenous administration at E5.5-15.5. We showed that prior to E11.5, all tested nanoparticles could be visualized and detected in fetal tissues in significant amounts; however, fetal gold levels declined dramatically post-E11.5. In contrast, Au-nanoparticle accumulation in the extraembryonic tissues (EET) increased 6-15 fold with gestational age. Fetal and EET accumulation of ferritin-and PEG-modified nanoparticles was considerably greater than citrate-capped nanoparticles. No signs of toxicity were observed. Fetal exposure to nanoparticles in murine pregnancy is, therefore, influenced by both stage of embryonic/placental maturation and nanoparticle surface composition.

84870354768	A novel lipid-based nanomicelle of docetaxel: Evaluation of antitumor activity and biodistribution	Purpose: A lipid-based, nanomicelle-loaded docetaxel (M-DOC) was designed and characterized. Optical imaging was employed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy of docetaxel in vivo. Materials and methods: The M-DOC was prepared using the emulsion-diffusion method. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering were used to assess the morphology and particle size of the M-DOC. Critical micelle concentrations, their stability under physiological conditions, and their encapsulation efficiency - as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography - were assessed. Pharmacological features were evaluated in two different animal models by comparing M-DOC treatments with docetaxel injections (I-DOC). Bioluminescence imaging was used to assess antitumor activity and docetaxel distribution in vivo, using nude mice injected with luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells. In addition, animals injected with B16 melanoma cells were used to measure survival time and docetaxel distribution. Results: The M-DOC was prepared as round, uniform spheres with an effective diameter of 20.8 nm. The critical micelle concentration of the original emulsion was 0.06%. Satisfactory encapsulation efficiency (87.6% ± 3.0%) and 12-hour stability were achieved. Xenograft results demonstrated that the M-DOC was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth, without significantly changing body weight. Survival was prolonged by 12.6% in the M-DOC group. Tumor growth inhibitory rates in the M-DOC and I-DOC groups were 91.2% and 57.8% in volume and 71.8% and 44.9% in weight, respectively. Optical bioluminescence imaging of tumor growths yielded similar results. Area under the curve

84871596842	Single-walled carbon nanotubes alter cytochrome c electron transfer and modulate mitochondrial function	Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are broadly used for various biomedical applications such as drug delivery, in vivo imaging, and cancer photothermal therapy due to their unique physiochemical properties. However, once they enter the cells, the effects of SWCNTs on the intracellular organelles and macromolecules are not comprehensively understood. Cytochrome c (Cyt c), as a key component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, plays an essential role in cellular energy consumption, growth, and differentiation. In this study, we found the mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial oxygen uptake were greatly decreased in human epithelial KB cells treated with SWCNTs, which accompanies the reduction of Cyt c. SWCNTs deoxidized Cyt c in a pH-dependent manner, as evidenced by the appearance of a 550 nm characteristic absorption peak, the intensity of which increased as the pH increased. Circular dichroism measurement confirmed the pH-dependent conformational change, which facilitated closer association of SWCNTs with the heme pocket of Cyt c and thus expedited the reduction of Cyt c. The electron transfer of Cyt c is also disturbed by SWCNTs, as measured with electron spin resonance spectroscopy. In conclusion, the redox activity of Cyt c was affected by SWCNTs treatment due to attenuated electron transfer and conformational change of Cyt c, which consequently changed mitochondrial respiration of SWCNTs-treated cells. This work is significant to SWCNTs research because it provides a novel understanding of SWCNTs' disruption of mitochondria function and has important implications for biomedical applications of SWCNTs. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84871981690	Superior penetration and retention behavior of 50 nm gold nanoparticles in tumors	Nanoparticles offer potential as drug delivery systems for chemotherapeutics based on certain advantages of molecular drugs. In this study, we report that particle size exerts great influence on the penetration and retention behavior of nanoparticles entering tumors. On comparing gold-coated Au@tiopronin nanoparticles that were prepared with identical coating and surface properties, we found that 50 nanoparticles were more effective in all in vitro , ex vivo, and in vivo assays conducted using MCF-7 breast cells as a model system. Beyond superior penetration in cultured cell monolayers, 50 nm Au@tiopronin nanoparticles also penetrated more deeply into tumor spheroids ex vivo and accumulated more effectively in tumor xenografts in vivo after a single intravenous dose. In contrast, larger gold-coated nanoparticles were primarily localized in the periphery of the tumor spheroid and around blood vessels, hindering deep penetration into tumors. We found multicellular spheroids to offer a simple ex vivo tumor model to simulate tumor tissue for screening the nanoparticle penetration behavior. Taken together, our findings define an optimal smaller size for nanoparticles that maximizes their effective accumulation in tumor tissue. ©2012 AACR.

84873478178	The effect of guanidinylation of PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) on the systemic delivery of siRNA	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has a huge potential for the treatment or prevention of various diseases. However, to realize the therapeutic potential of siRNA drugs, efficient, tissue-specific and safe delivery technologies must be developed. Here we synthesized two kinds of polymers (PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) labeled as PEG-b-PAEM or PEA, and guanidinylated PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) marked as PEG-b-PAEM-co-PGEM or PEAG) using atom transfer radical polymerization and evaluated their capability of mediating siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo. Both polymers presented excellent siRNA encapsulation ability, formed regular nanostructures with siRNA, robustly mediated cellular internalization and cytoplasmic localization of siRNA, and resulted in targeted gene knockdown efficiently. However, PEAG showed much more outstanding abilities referring to above evaluating indicators compared with PEA. Both PEA/siRNA and PEAG/siRNA polyplexes displayed strong liver, lung and spleen accumulation in mice for a long time after intravenous administration. PEAG/siApoB polyplexes (single dose at 1 mg/kg) further repressed ApoB expression in liver and resulted in block of lipid transportation. In addition, both polymers delivered high amounts of siRNA into tumor tissue in the Hela-Luc xenograft murine model. More siRNA accumulated in tumor with the increase of N/. P ratio and PEAG/siRNA polyplexes showed higher siRNA accumulation than PEA/siRNA polyplexes at the same N/. P ratio. These findings set the stage for further studies of structural-functional mechanisms and developments of siRNA therapeutics. © 2013 .

We generated HeLa cell-derived spheroids using the liquid overlay method. To properly characterize HeLa spheroids, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and multiphoton microscopy were used to obtain high-resolution 3D images of HeLa spheroids. Next, pairing high-resolution optical characterization techniques with flow cytometry, we quantitatively compared the penetration of doxorubicin, quantum dots, and synthetic micelles into 3D HeLa spheroid versus HeLa cells grown in a traditional two-dimensional culturing system. Our data revealed that 3D cultured HeLa cells acquired several clinically relevant morphologic and cellular characteristics (such as resistance to chemotherapeutics) often found in human solid tumors. These characteristic, however, could not be captured using conventional two-dimensional cell culture techniques. This study demonstrated the remarkable versatility of HeLa spheroid 3D imaging. In addition, our results revealed the capability of HeLa spheroids to function as a screening tool for nanoparticles or synthetic micelles that, due to their inherent size, charge, and hydrophobicity, can penetrate into solid tumors and act as delivery vehicles for chemotherapeutics. The development of this image-based, reproducible, and quantifiable in vitro HeLa spheroid screening tool will greatly aid future exploration of chemotherapeutics and nanoparticle delivery into solid tumors. © 2012 Decker Publishing.

84874430382	The challenge to relate the physicochemical properties of colloidal nanoparticles to their cytotoxicity	Nanomaterials offer opportunities to construct novel compounds for many different fields. Applications include devices for energy, including solar cells, batteries, and fuel cells, and for health, including contrast agents and mediators for photodynamic therapy and hyperthermia. Despite these promising applications, any new class of materials also bears a potential risk for human health and the environment. The advantages and innovations of these materials must be thoroughly compared against risks to evaluate each new nanomaterial. Although nanomaterials are often used intentionally, they can also be released unintentionally either inside the human body, through wearing of a prosthesis or the inhalation of fumes, or into the environment, through mechanical wear or chemical powder waste. This possibility adds to the importance of understanding potential risks from these materials.Because of fundamental differences in nanomaterials, sound risk assessment currently requires that researchers perform toxicology studies on each new nanomaterial. However, if toxicity could be correlated to the basic physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, those relationships could allow researchers to predict potential risks and design nanomaterials with minimum toxicity.In this Account we describe the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) and how they can be determined and discuss their general importance for cytotoxicity. For simplicity, we focus primarily on in vitro toxicology that examines the interaction of living cells with engineered colloidal NPs with an inorganic core. Serious risk assessment of NPs will require additional in vivo studies. Basic physicochemical properties of nanoparticulate materials include colloidal stability, purity, inertness, size, shape, charge, and their ability to adsorb environmental compounds such as proteins. Unfortunately, the correlation of these properties with toxicity is not straightforward. First, for NPs released either unintentionally or intentionally, it can be difficult to pinpoint these properties in the materials. Therefore, researchers typically use NP models with better defined properties, which don't include the full complexity of most industrially relevant materials. In addition, many of these properties are strongly mutually connected. Therefore, it can be difficult to vary individual properties in NP models while keeping the others constant. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84874531575	Solid-state and biological nanopore for real-time sensing of single chemical and sequencing of DNA	Sensitivity and specificity are two most important factors to take into account for molecule sensing, chemical detection and disease diagnosis. A perfect sensitivity is to reach the level where a single molecule can be detected. An ideal specificity is to reach the level where the substance can be detected in the presence of many contaminants. The rapidly progressing nanopore technology is approaching this threshold. A wide assortment of biomotors and cellular pores in living organisms perform diverse biological functions. The elegant design of these transportation machineries has inspired the development of single molecule detection based on modulations of the individual current blockage events. The dynamic growth of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology has stimulated rapid advances in the study of nanopore based instrumentation over the last decade, and inspired great interest in sensing of single molecules including ions, nucleotides, enantiomers, drugs, and polymers such as PEG, RNA, DNA, and polypeptides. This sensing technology has been extended to medical diagnostics and third generation high throughput DNA sequencing. This review covers current nanopore detection platforms including both biological pores and solid state counterparts. Several biological nanopores have been studied over the years, but this review will focus on the three best characterized systems including α-hemolysin and MspA, both containing a smaller channel for the detection of single stranded DNA, as well as bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor connector that contains a larger channel for the passing of double stranded DNA.

Here, a temperature and pH dual responsive PNiPAM/AA@SiO<inf>2</inf> core-shell particles with internal controlled release were designed and fabricated for efficient cancer treatment, which could recognize the intrinsic pH differences between cancers and normal tissues. Upon lowering the temperature, doxorubicin was loaded into the PNiPAM/AA@SiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles, whereas by increasing the acidity, previously loaded doxorubicin was quickly released. Comparing with common mesoporous silica particles (MSNs), these core-shell particles have a more uniform size and better dispersity. In addition, dried PNiPAM/AA@SiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles could be easily redispersed in distilled water. The in vitro cell culture experiments showed that not only were PNiPAM/AA@SiO<inf>2</inf> particles more biocompatible and less cytotoxic than MSN, but also DOX@PNiPAM/AA@SiO<inf>2</inf> had a higher drug release efficiency in the lysosomes and a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth than DOX@MSN.

Of course, interfacing any novel material with biological systems has to be critically analyzed as many undesirable adverse effects can be triggered (e.g. toxicity, allergy, genotoxicity, etc.) and/or the performance of the nanomaterial can be compromised due to the unexpected phenomena in physiological environments (e.g. corrosion, aggregation, unspecific absorption of biomolecules, etc.). Despite the need for standard protocols for assessing the toxicity and bio-performance of each new functional nanomaterial, these are still scarce or currently under development. Nonetheless, nanotoxicology and relating adverse effects to the physico-chemical properties of nanomaterials are emerging areas of the utmost importance which have to be continuously revisited as any new material emerges. This review highlights recent progress concerning the interaction of nanomaterials with biological systems and following adverse effects. The biological fate of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in physiological media is discussed. The four color-labeled scenarios illustrate (green) potential adverse effects following protein adsorption, (orange) functionalization of NPs with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and antibodies (active targeting), (yellow) the possibility of 'passivating' NPs with suitable coatings, (blue) and adverse effects such as 'NP dissolution' and reactive oxygen species generation.

84879418742	Gold nanoparticles: Emerging paradigm for targeted drug delivery system	The application of nanotechnology in medicine, known as nanomedicine, has introduced a plethora of nanoparticles of variable chemistry and design considerations for cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the most important field is the design and development of pharmaceutical drugs, based on targeted drug delivery system (TDDS). Being inspired by physio-chemical properties of nanoparticles, TDDS are designed to safely reach their targets and specifically release their cargo at the site of disease for enhanced therapeutic effects, thereby increasing the drug tissue bioavailability. Nanoparticles have the advantage of targeting cancer by simply being accumulated and entrapped in cancer cells. However, even after rapid growth of nanotechnology in nanomedicine, designing an effective targeted drug delivery system is still a challenging task. In this review, we reveal the recent advances in drug delivery approach with a particular focus on gold nanoparticles. We seek to expound on how these nanomaterials communicate in the complex environment to reach the target site, and how to design the effective TDDS for complex environments and simultaneously monitor the toxicity on the basis of designing such delivery complexes. Hence, this review will shed light on the research, opportunities and challenges for engineering nanomaterials with cancer biology and medicine to develop effective TDDS for treatment of cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84879108730	Gene transfection efficacy and biocompatibility of polycation/DNA complexes coated with enzyme degradable PEGylated hyaluronic acid	Coating the polycation/DNA binary complexes with PEGylated polyanions can improve long-circulation and biocompatibility invivo. However, it has been certificated PEG dilemma can reduces gene transfection efficiency because of inhibition in cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Herein, two PEGylated anionic polymers, PEGylated hyaluronic acid (HgP) and PEGylated polyglutamic acid (PGgP) were synthesized to coat the binary complexes of core-shell cationic polycaprolactone-graft-poly (N, N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) nanoparticles/DNA (NP-D). The effects of polyanion structure were evaluated in terms of particle size, zeta potential, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and transfect efficiency invitro and invivo. Invitro study illustrated that HgP coated complexes showed better efficiencies in both cell uptake and transfection than PGgP coated complexes. The coating of HgP on NP-D improved the biocompatibility without reduction in cell uptake and transfection efficacy, and resulted in higher accumulation and gene expression in tumor after IV injection. The success of HgP coating in overcoming PEG dilemma is attributed to the hyaluronic acid (HA)-receptor-mediated endocytosis and outer shell-detachment through the hyaluronidases catalyzed degradation of HA. These results demonstrated that HgP was a promising anionic polymer for coating the polycation/DNA complexes and ternary complexes (HgP coated NP-D) hold promising potential for cancer therapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880122465	Spatially gradated segregation and recovery of circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood of cancer patients	For cancer patients, the enumeration of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood is a strong prognostic indicator of the severity of the cancer; for the general population, the capture of CTCs is needed for use as a clinical tool for cancer screening, early detection, and treatment assessment. Here, we present a fast, high-purity (~90%) and high-efficiency (>90%) method for the segregation and undamaged recovery of CTCs using a spatially gradated microfluidic chip. Further, by lysing the red blood cells we achieved not only a significant reduction in the overall processing time but also mitigated the blood clogging problem commonly encountered in microfluidic-based CTC isolation systems. To clinically validate the chip, we employed it to detect and capture CTCs from 10 liver cancer patients. Positive CTC enumeration was observed in all the blood samples, and the readings ranged from a low of 1-2 CTCs (1 patient) to a high of >20 CTCs (2 patients) with the balance having 3-20 CTCs per 3-ml blood sample. The work here indicates that our system can be developed for use in cancer screening, metastatic assessment, and chemotherapeutic response and for pharmacological and genetic evaluation of single CTCs. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84880151523	Biocompatible composite nanoparticles with large longitudinal relaxivity for targeted imaging and early diagnosis of cancer	Early diagnosis of cancer greatly increases the chances of successful treatment by radical resection. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for detecting early stage tumors can be increased with the assistance of a positive MRI contrast agent. However, the traditional positive MRI contrast agents, such as Gd-chelates and Gd-based inorganic nanoparticles, are often limited by their cytotoxicity and low specificity. Here, we propose a new design of MRI contrast agent based on gadolinium oxide nanocrystals (GON) for targeted imaging and cancer early diagnosis with good biocompatibility. The GON were prepared using a polyol method and then encapsulated into albumin nanoparticles (AN), which were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and found to exhibit bright and stable autofluorescence without conjugation to any fluorescent agent. After that, a target molecule, folic acid (FA), was conjugated onto the surface of the GON-loaded AN (GON-AN) to construct a GON-AN-FA composite. The as-prepared nanoparticles are biocompatible and stable in serum. The results of MRI relaxation studies show that the longitudinal relaxivities (r

84883141848	Innovative pharmaceutical development based on unique properties of nanoscale delivery formulation	The advent of nanotechnology has reignited interest in the field of pharmaceutical science for the development of nanomedicine. Nanomedicinal formulations are nanometer-sized carrier materials designed for increasing the drug tissue bioavailability, thereby improving the treatment of systemically applied chemotherapeutic drugs. Nanomedicine is a new approach to deliver the pharmaceuticals through different routes of administration with safer and more effective therapies compared to conventional methods. To date, various kinds of nanomaterials have been developed over the years to make delivery systems more effective for the treatment of various diseases. Even though nanomaterials have significant advantages due to their unique nanoscale properties, there are still significant challenges in the improvement and development of nanoformulations with composites and other materials. Here in this review, we highlight the nanomedicinal formulations aiming to improve the balance between the efficacy and the toxicity of therapeutic interventions through different routes of administration and how to design nanomedicine for safer and more effective ways to improve the treatment quality.

84891353977	Nanoscale drug delivery platforms overcome platinum-based resistance in cancer cells due to abnormal membrane protein trafficking	The development of cellular resistance to platinum-based chemotherapies is often associated with reduced intracellular platinum concentrations. In some models, this reduction is due to abnormal membrane protein trafficking, resulting in reduced uptake by transporters at the cell surface. Given the central role of platinum drugs in the clinic, it is critical to overcome cisplatin resistance by bypassing the plasma membrane barrier to significantly increase the intracellular cisplatin concentration enough to inhibit the proliferation of cisplatin-resistant cells. Therefore, rational design of appropriate nanoscale drug delivery platforms (nDDPs) loaded with cisplatin or other platinum analogues as payloads is a possible strategy to solve this problem. This review will focus on the known mechanism of membrane trafficking in cisplatin-resistant cells and the development and employment of nDDPs to improve cell uptake of cisplatin. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

In this study, a nanocomplex comprising albumin and dye is assembled without crosslinker use. The nanocomplex shows intense luminescence with a photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 0.39 and a large Stokes shift of >130 nm. The nanocomplex also exhibits higher stability against hydrolysis than indocyanine green during the 14 days test.

After testing different parameters, we found that only in the presence of salt rather than temperature, pH, and solvent, did the monodisperse hydrogelators self-assemble into a hydrogel network with bright emission turned on. The induced luminescence was a dynamic change and enabled real time monitoring of hydrogel formation.

84894345351	Nanomedicine design based on abnormal structure in tumor	In tumors, the blood supply is anisotropic spatially and temporally, meanwhile the vascular permeability is high and the ability of fluid flowing from lymphangion is poor. These factors work together to create tumor microenvironment and block therapeutic agents from uniformly delivering into tumors. Compared to conventional medicine, nanomedicine has the potential to enable the preferential delivery of drugs to tumor, deliver more than one therapeutic agent, and bind drugs to target cancer cells specially. But the specific physiological barriers presented in tumor hinder efficient and uniform delivery of nanoparticles into tumors. This may be account for moderate survival benefit obtained from FDA-approved nanomedicines. Here, we summarize these barriers existing in cancer therapy and researches aiming at conquering these barriers. Finally, we discuss factors in nanoparticles design to improve delivering efficiency for tumor.

84894947689	A universal gene carrier platform for treatment of human prostatic carcinoma by p53 transfection	Our previous work showed that a charge-reversal layer-by-layer nanosystem, PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS, effectively facilitates cellular uptake of siRNA and enhances the silencing efficacy of MDR1 siRNA. Here, the plasmid loading capacity of this vehicle was examined using EGFP-N1, and the plasmid release profile was determined in response to pH changes. The cytotoxicity of the EGFP-N1/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS complex against HeLa and 293T cells was almost negligible. PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS efficaciously delivered the plasmids EGFP-N1 (encoding green fluorescent protein) and pGL3.0 (encoding luciferase) into 293T and HeLa cells, thus verifying the universality of PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS as a gene carrier. The results of an inverted fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM) and western blotting methods demonstrated that PC-3 prostate cancer cells treated with EGFP. p53/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS expressed higher levels of GFP than cells treated with EGFP. p53/PEI. Furthermore, PC-3 cells treated with EGFP. p53/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS showed reduced cellular viability and increased nuclear fragmentation, consistent with elevated p53 expression. Propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometric assays were conducted to demonstrate that EGFP. p53/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS elevated the level of apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Western blotting and caspase activation studies revealed that EGFP. p53/PEI/PAH-Cit/AuNP-CS complexes may induce PC-3 apoptosis via the mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway by up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We seek to develop traceable nanoformulations in order to closely monitor delivery. Herein, we developed a new drug delivery system (DDS) using tetraphenylethene (TPE) to fabricate a self-assembly micelle with aggregation-induced emission (AIE micelle). AIE makes the nanocarriers visible for high-quality imaging, and the switching on and off of the AIE is intrinsically controlled by the assembly and disassembly of the micelles. This DDS was tested for doxorubicin (DOX) delivery and intracellular imaging. For the DOX-loaded micelles (TPED), the DOX content reached as much as 15.3% by weight, and the anticancer efficiency was higher than for free DOX. Meanwhile, high-quality imaging was obtained to trace the intracellular delivery of the TPED. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84901390115	SiRNA-phospholipid conjugates for gene and drug delivery in cancer treatment	Due to low charge density and stiff backbone structure, small interfering RNA (siRNA) has inherently poor binding ability to cationic polymers and lipid carriers, which results in low siRNA loading efficiency and limits siRNA success in clinical application. Here, siRNA-phospholipids conjugates are developed, which integrate the characteristics of the two phospholipids to self-assemble via hydrophilic siRNA and hydrophobic phospholipid tails to overcome the siRNA's stiff backbone structures and enhance the siRNA loading efficiency. In this study, the thiol-modified sense and antisense siRNA are chemically conjugated with phospholipids to form sense and antisense siRNA-phospholipid, and then these sense or antisense siRNA-phospholipids with equal amounts are annealed to generate siRNA-phospholipids. The siRNA-phospholipids can serve dual functions as agents that can silence gene expression and as a component of nanoparticles to embed hydrophobic anticancer drugs to cure tumor. siRNA-phospholipids together with cationic lipids and DSPE-PEG2000 fuse around PLGA to form siRNA-phospholipids enveloped nanoparticles (siRNA-PCNPs), which can deliver siRNAs and hydrophobic anticancer drugs into tumor. In animal models, intravenously injected siRNA-PCNPs embedded DOX (siPlk1-PCNPs/DOX) is highly effective in inhibiting tumor growth. The results indicate that the siRNA-PCNPs can be potentially applied as a safe and efficient gene and anticancer drug delivery carrier. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84901684201	Neuropilin-1-targeted gold nanoparticles enhance therapeutic efficacy of platinum(IV) drug for prostate cancer treatment	Platinum-based anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin are some of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents but have limited applications due to severe dose-limiting side effects and a tendency for cancer cells to rapidly develop resistance. The therapeutic index can be improved through use of nanocarrier systems to target cancer cells efficiently. We developed a unique strategy to deliver a platinum(IV) drug to prostate cancer cells by constructing glutathione-stabilized (Au@GSH) gold nanoparticles. Glutathione (GSH) has well-known antioxidant properties, which lead to cancer regression. Here, we exploit the advantages of both the antioxidant properties and high surface-Area-to-volume ratio of Au@GSH NPs to demonstrate their potential for delivery of a platinum(IV) drug by targeting the neuropilin-1 receptor (Nrp-1). A lethal dose of a platinum(IV) drug functionalized with the Nrp-1-targeting peptide (CRGDK) was delivered specifically to prostate cancer cells in vitro. Targeted peptide ensures specific binding to the Nrp-1 receptor, leading to enhanced cellular uptake level and cell toxicity. The nanocarriers were themselves nontoxic, but exhibited high cytotoxicity and increased efficacy when functionalized with the targeting peptide and drug. The uptake of drug-loaded nanocarriers is dependent on the interaction with Nrp-1 in cell lines expressing high (PC-3) and low (DU-145) levels of Nrp-1, as confirmed through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy. The nanocarriers have effective anticancer activity, through upregulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) protein (p50 and p65) expression and activation of NF-κB-DNA-binding activity. Our preliminary investigations with platinum(IV)-functionalized gold nanoparticles along with a targeting peptide hold significant promise for future cancer treatment. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Compared to traditional drug delivery systems, nano-based drug delivery system have greater potential in a variety of areas, such as multiple targeting functionalization, in vivo imaging, combined drug delivery, extended circulation time, and systemic control release. Nano-systems incorporating stimulus-responsive materials have remarkable properties which allow them to bypass biological barriers and achieve targeted intracellular drug delivery. As a result of the active metabolism of tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly acidic compared to normal tissues. pH-Sensitive nano-systems have now been developed in which drug release is specifically triggered by the acidic tumor environment. Studies have demonstrated that novel pH-sensitive drug delivery systems are capable of improving the efficiency of cancer treatment. A number of these have been translated from bench to clinical application and have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of various cancerous diseases. Herein, this review mainly focuses on pH-sensitive nano-systems, including advances in drug delivery, mechanisms of drug release, and possible improvements in drug absorption, with the emphasis on recent research in this field.

However, the toxicity of conventional fluorescent labels and difficulty of functionalization limit their widespread use. Recently, a number of amino-rich polymers have demonstrated high luminescent fluorescence but rarely showed potential for in vivo imaging due to their blue fluorescence. Here, a general route has been found to construct polymer-based multifunctional nanoparticles for combined imaging and drug delivering. The weak fluorescent polyethyleneimine (PEI) has been conjugated with hydrophobic polylactide as the amphiphilic PEI for construction of nanoparticles which showed bright and multicolor fluorescence with high drug loading capacity.

We synthesized gold nanoparticles with diameters of 2, 6, 10, and 16 nm and compared their intracellular distribution in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm (2 and 6 nm) could enter the nucleus, whereas larger ones (10 and 16 nm) were found only in the cytoplasm. We then investigated the possibility of using ultrasmall 2 nm nanoparticles as carriers for nuclear delivery of a triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) that binds to the c-myc promoter. Compared to free TFO, the nanoparticle-conjugated TFO was more effective at reducing c-myc RNA and c-myc protein, which resulted in reduced cell viability. Our result demonstrated that the entry of gold nanoparticles into the cell nucleus is critically dependent on the size of the nanoparticles. We developed a strategy for regulating gene expression, by directly delivering TFOs into the nucleus using ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. More importantly, guidelines were provided to choose appropriate nanocarriers for different biomedical purposes. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Exposure to a well-characterized subpopulation of specific nanomaterials is therefore desired to reveal more detailed mechanisms. This study develops scalable density gradient ultracentrifugation sorting of highly dispersed single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) into four distinct bands based on diameter, aggregation, and structural integrity, with greatly improved efficiency, yield, and reproducibility. With guarantee of high yield and stability of four SWNT fractions, it is possible for the first time, to investigate the structure-dependent bioeffects of four SWNT fractions. it is possible Among these, singly-dispersed integral SWNTs show no significant effects on the mitochondrial functions and hypoxia. The aggregated integral SWNTs show more significant effects on the mitochondrial dysfunction and hypoxia compared to the aggregated SWNTs with poor structure integrity. Then, it is found that the aggregated integral SWNTs induced the irregular mitochondria respiratory and pro-apoptotic proteins activation, while aggregated SWNTs with poor structure integrity greatly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This work supports the view that control of the distinct structure characteristics of SWNTs helps establish clearer structure-bioeffect correlation and health risk assessment. It is also hoped that these results can help in the design of nanomaterials with higher efficiency and accuracy in subcellular translocation. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84906092434	Nanostructural systems developed with positive charge generation to drug delivery	The surface charge of a nanostructure plays a critical role in modulating blood circulation time, nanostructure-cell interaction, and intracellular events. It is unfavorable to have positive charges on the nanostructure surface before arriving at the disease site because positively charged nanostructures interact strongly with blood components, resulting in rapid clearance from the blood, and suboptimal targeted accumulation at the tumor site. Once at the tumor site, however, the positive charge on the nanostructure surface accelerates uptake by tumor cells and promotes the release of payloads from the lysosomes to the cytosol or nucleus inside cells. Thus, the ideal nanocarrier systems for drug delivery would maintain a neutral or negatively charged surface during blood circulation but would then generate a positive surface charge after accumulation at the tumor site or inside the cancer cells. This Progress Report focuses on the design and application of various neutral or negatively charged nanostructures that can generate a positive charge in response to the tumor microenvironment or an external stimulus. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Biocompatible polymers have great potential for constructing smart multifunctional drug-delivery systems through grafting with other functional ligands. More importantly, novel biocompatible polymers with intrinsic fluorescence emission can work as theranostic nanomedicines for real-time imaging and drug delivery.

Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of the assembled hydrolase was evaluated with human cells, and the novel artificial biological enzyme showed excellent biocompatibility. (Figure Presented).

In this work, we have prepared a novel nanoparticle consisted of amphiphilic poly(γ-glutamic acid-maleimide-co-l-lactide)-1,2-dipalmitoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (γ-PGA-MAL-PLA-DPPE) copolymer decorated with transferrin (Tf), which can specifically deliver anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to the tumor cells for targeting chemotherapy. These nanoparticles (NPs) have preferable particle size, high encapsulation efficiency and a pH-dependent release profile. As expected, The Tf modification mediate specific targeting to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (C666-1) cells and human cervical carcinoma (Hela) cells with the transferrin receptor (TfR) overexpressed and enhance cellular uptake of the NPs, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy assays. In vitro cytotoxicity studies reveal that the NPs have excellent biocompatibility, and the presence of Tf enhance the activity of PTX to the targeted cells. All these results prove that Tf modified γ-PGA-MAL-PLA-DPPE NPs could facilitate the tumor-specific therapy. Therefore, such a targeting drug delivery system provides significant advances toward cancer therapy.
