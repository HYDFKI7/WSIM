84940240882	Adsorption mechanism of acetylene hydrogenation on the Pd (111) surface	First-principles calculations are carried out to examine the adsorption of acetylene over the Pd (111) surface. A hydrogen adsorption system is initially investigated to confirm the reliability of the selected calculation method. Adsorption energies, Mulliken-populations, overlap populations, charge density, and projected density of states (PDOS) are then calculated in the optimised acetylene adsorption system. Results show that C<inf>2</inf>H<inf>2</inf> molecule tends to adsorb through the threefold parallel-bridge configuration that is computed to be the most stable. In this structure, the distance of the C-H bond is calculated to be 1.09 Å, and the C-C-H bond angle is 128°. The distance of the C-C bond in acetylene is 1.36 Å, increasing from 1.21 Å in the gas phase. Moreover, the C-C bond overlap population decreases from 1.98 to 1.38, revealing that the carbon configuration in C <inf>2</inf>H<inf>2</inf> rehybridises from sp to sp<sup>2</sup> and beyond. The obtained results are compared with available experimental studies on acetylene hydrogenation on single-metal surfaces. The PDOS study indicates that a carbonaceous layer may generate on the metal surface during acetylene adsorption. The carbonaceous layer can affect the adsorption and reaction of acetylene, thereby inactivating the metal surface. Our experiments also show that Pd exhibits high catalytic activity.

84942368864	Laser beam homogenizing system design for photoluminescence	Based on waveguide coupling technology, we set a kaleidoscope homogenizer to get an intensity redistributed uniform multimode laser beam and then shape the uniform beam into a large area square beam with an imaging system. The simulation results of overall light intensity uniformity are both greater than 89% under the irradiation areas of 3.5 cm × 3 cm and 10 cm × 10 cm. In the practical application, it is also greater than 85%. After that, we apply this technology to the photoluminescence imaging detection of semiconductor devices, proving that this technology can be widely used in a variety of research requiring large areas of uniform laser illuminating spots.

15344351523	Luminescence properties of multi-layer InGaN quantum dots grown on C- and R-plane sapphire substrates	In this study, we report comparative luminescence properties of multi-layer InGaN quantum dots grown on C- and R-plane sapphire substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). High-density InGaN quantum dots (QDs) are formed on GaN templates by decreasing the growth temperature and increasing the adatom hopping-barrier through surface passivation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been employed to estimate the size and height of these dots. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra recorded from (112̄0) InGaN QDs/(11̄02) sapphire show much stronger emission intensity compared to spectra recorded from (0 0 0 1) InGaN QDs/(0 0 0 1) sapphire. Due to the absence of strong spontaneous polarization and piezoelectric field, such (112̄0) InGaN QDs in the active layers would lead to high efficiency light emitting devices. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

21844480082	Study on onion-like fullerenes prepared by vacuum heat treatment	The synthesis of onion-like fullerenes (OLFs) by two-step vacuum heat-treatment of pure graphite powders was investigated using Al as catalyst. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were used to characterize the morphologies and micro-structures of the products. Results indicate that lots of graphite pieces, amorphous spherical carbon and metal particles exist in sample after vacuum heat-treatment at 800°C. After vacuum heat-treatment at 1800°C, OLFs in sample are perfectly structured and highly graphitized, with external diameter between 15 nm and 35 nm. Moreover, the growth mechanism of OLFs and metal-encapsulating OLFs are also discussed.

The optical quality of the GaN films was characterized by room-temperature photoluminescence measurements, which shows a full width at half maximum of 46 meV. The structural quality of the films was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. There are submicron-size grains free from threading dislocations and stacking faults. More importantly, a cubic-phase GaN blue light-emitting diode has been fabricated.

0031247879	Study of growth interruption of self-assembled InAs/GaAs islands	The results of the growth interruption in self-assembled InAs/GaAs islands were reported. The introduction of growth interruption between the InAs deposition and subsequent growth of the upper GaAs layer induced a blue shift of the photoluminescence (PL) peak energy, broadening of the PL linewidth and the decrease of the intensity. Transmission electronic microscopy shows that some misfit dislocations, where the strain has been relaxed partly, break out in the structure as the traps of InAs matter transfer. The PL spectra variance is in agreement with the decrease of island density and reduction of the island size due to the growth interruption.

The ribbons, go through the layer as threading dislocations near the [112](111) or [112](111) directions. Each of these (with a 40 nm width) has two narrow parts enclosed by three partial dislocations (with a 20 nm spacing). By contrast analysis and contrast simulation, the ribbons have been shown to be composed of two partially overlapping stacking faults. Their origin is attributed to a forced reaction between two crossing perfect misfit dislocations. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

0032475013	Effects of growth interruption on self-assembled InAs/GaAs islands	The effect of growth interruption on the InAs deposition and its subsequent growth as self-assembled island structures, in particular the material transport process of the InAs layers has been investigated by photoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy measurements. InAs material in structures with only coherent islands transfers from the wetting layer to the formed islands and the growth interruption causes a red shift of PL peak energy. On the other hand, the PL peak shifts to higher energy in structures containing simultaneously coherent and noncoherent islands with dislocations. In this case, the noncoherent islands capture InAs material from the surrounding wetting layer as well as coherent islands, which casues a reduction in the size of these islands. The variations in the PL intensity and line width are also discussed. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

2442607713	Structural and optical properties of 3D growth multilayer InGaN/GaN quantum dots by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition	Multilayer InGaN/GaN quantum dots (QDs) were grown on sapphire substrates through a three-dimensional growth mode, which was initiated by a special passivation processing introduced into the normal growth procedure. Surface morphology and photoluminescence properties of QDs with different stacking periods (from one to four) were investigated. The temperature dependences of the PL peak energies were found to show a great difference between two-layer and three-layer QDs. The fast redshift and the reversed sigmoidal temperature dependences of the PL energies for the former were attributed to the thermally activated carrier transfer from small to large dots. However, the increase of both the dot size and the spatial space among dots with the growing stacking periods reduced the carrier escape and retrapping. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The radiation loss was obtained from the imaginary part of the complex propagation constant and the transition loss was calculated by two-dimension overlap integral method. In comparison with the experimental results by Deri, the calculation result is rather accurate. The relationship between bending loss and the structural parameters of SOI rib waveguide was analyzed by the method presented, and the offset at the junction of bent and straight rib waveguides was optimized as well.

Two cases have been discussed that the wave vectors are in the periodic plane and off the periodic plane. By compare, we find that the changes of the shapes and orientations of rods will make the photonic-crystals which have no complete band gap present a complete band gap or turn low complete band gap in low frequency range to a higher frequency range. We also find that wave vector in and off periodic plane will influence the lattices composed of elliptic rods much larger than that composed of square rods.

There are strong spontaneous and piezoelectric electric fields (SPF) along the growth orientation of the (0 0 0 1) AlGaN/GaN heterostructures.

33746809034	Influences of wave vector direction on energy bands and applications of two-dimensional photonic crystals	The influences of the wave vectors off the periodic plane on the distribution of energy bands of triangular, honeycomb and square lattices are analyzed by plane wave method. The rods and background of these lattices are all composed of two mediums with dielectric constants equal to 13 and 1. With the increase of wave vectors off periodic plane, many changes will take place in the dispersion relation of these lattices: the band gaps of wave vectors in the periodic plane will decrease gradually and even disappear; a region, which does not exist modes, will appear in the low frequency range and it will be broaden with the increase of wave vectors off periodic plane; new degenerated energy levels appear and primarily degenerated levels will disappear; the energy bands tend to become flat; the absolute band gaps can easily form among the lowest energy bands. By the analyses of the band gaps of three lattices, some conclusions can be obtained: the width of absolute band gaps in triangular and honeycomb lattices are larger than those of square lattices, which make triangular and honeycomb lattices lower the rate of spontaneous radiation more effectively than square lattices; the width of band gaps of triangular lattices in the leaky region is larger than that of honeycomb lattices, which made triangular lattices be more appropriate to be used as reflect mirror than honeycomb lattices.

The interleaver is formed by two parallel and identical photonic crystal slab waveguides which are separated by three rows of air holes. The coupling region is designed below the light line to avoid vertical radiation. The simulated results show that the coupling coefficient is increased and the final length of the interleaver is decreased by enlarging the radius of the middle row of air holes.

33846390893	Numerical method to calculate and analyze of defect modes in two-dimensional photonic crystal	A numerical method based on the modified finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for calculating and analyzing defect modes in a two-dimensional photonic crystal is presented. An ideal plane wave incident at different angles is realized by using the auxiliary one-dimensional FDTD method and linear interpolation at the total field-scattered field interface. Perfect matched layer technique is employed to absorb the out going wave efficiently. Numerical simulations show that all defect modes can be excited by an incident plane wave along a non-symmetric direction of the photonic crystal. The values of electric field are recorded by choosing a suitable detector position, and all resonant frequencies can be obtained by fast Fourier transform. The relationship between the resonant frequency in a two-dimensional square photonic crystal consisting of dielectric rods and the radius and dielectric constant of the rods is also investigated. The numerical results show that the value of the resonant modes of the photonic crystal can be modulated by changing the radius and dielectric constant.

The electron properties of system after introducing CN are analyzed, which includes geometry structure, system energy, electron distribution, frontier molecular orbital, band structure and density of states (DOS). The results indicate that CN attached to 5-position of 8-hydroxyquinoline ligand, takes part in the whole π-conjugated system well, and that 5-CN{single bond}Liq is the most stable. The substitution group CN weakens the conjugation effect of C(5){single bond}C(10) and C(5){single bond}C(6), the contravalency effect of Li and N, and electrostatic effect of Li and O. There is strong interaction between frontier molecular orbital and CN, and therefore the electronic properties of (5-CN{single bond}8-hydroxyquinoline)lithium(5-CN{single bond}Liq) are changed compared with Liq. The LUMO energy level decreases and the energy gap enlarge. The electron cloud density of phenol ring and pyridine ring reduces. The degeneracy of molecular orbital energy level is changed and the energy band is broadened. In result, the electronic spectra blue-shift and electron can easily inject and transmit for 5-CN{single bond}Liq. It can be concluded that 5-CN{single bond}Liq is better blue emitting material than Liq for organic electroluminescent devices (OLEDs) in theory. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The process parameters of plasma Nb alloying and plasma carburization were modified. This paper investigates diffusion of C atoms on TiAl(010) surface with and without Nb which is transition metal element by using first-principles pseudo potential plane-wave method. By analyzing final energy and forming enthalpy, it is found that the duplex treatment of niobizing and carburization makes the final energy of the surface cell of TiAl(010) enhanced, but it makes forming enthalpy descended, as a result stability of cell improved. After analyzing electron structure it shows that niobizing can weaken the effect of bond of Ti(3d)-Al(3p), which can improve the brittleness. Niobizing also can make the number of electron bonding which locate at thereinafter Fermi level increased, improve the stability of alloy. So this can explain the action of Nb promoting carburization from the view of electron aspectnt. © 2010 IEEE.

The two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method was used to study the spectral properties of the hybrid structure and the effects of structure parameters on extraction enhancement. The results demonstrate that the plasmonic Ag nanostructure can couple the evanescent wave to a propagation wave around the GaN/ITO interface, and then the photons are scattered out of the LED chips by the ITO grating with high extraction efficiency. Under the optimal parameters, the light extraction efficiency can reach approximately three times the original value at a relatively longer wavelength. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

The hot deformation behavior of 2205 DSS was investigated through hot tensile and hot compression testing on a Gleeble-1500 thermal-mechanical simulator within the temperature range of 1023-1623 K, in order to determine their reduction of area, resistance to deformation, deformability, and microstructure. The experimental results show that the hot deformation curves of the test steel has a high temperature brittlement region at temperatures higher than 1523 K, and the optimum hot ductility region is in the temperature range of 1423-1523 K. The microstructure of the steel obtained after hot deformation is much finer compared with the as-cast microstructure of the steel. It was found that dynamic recovery only occurs within the γ-phase during hot deformation, but the δ phase undergoes dynamic recrystallization. Small secondary γ′ phase islands are precipitated on the δ matrix, as demonstrated by TEM analysis, which can markedly promote hot ductility behavior. Crown Copyright © 2009.

For three relevant crystallographic planes - (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (1 0 0) - we develop a theoretical approach for calculating surface energies which cannot be determined experimentally. The surface energies show that the solvent not only has a strong effect on copper morphology, but also affects the Mulliken charges of Cu(h k l) surfaces. We also study CO molecules adsorbing on Cu(h k l) surfaces. It is found that both the structural parameters and the relative energies of CO are very sensitive to the COSMO solvent model. Thus the solvent effects can improve the stability of CO adsorption on Cu(h k l) surface and the ability of CO activation. This analysis gives us some new insights into the understanding of solvent effects. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimized results showed that the vacancy resulted in local lattice distortion and the relaxation of neighboring atoms. Then vacancy effects on electronic structure (energy-band structure and electron-state density) of CdS were analyzed. The results revealed that S vacancy made the band gap narrower and Cd vacancy made it wider, but CdS with S and Cd vacancy were direct band gap semiconductor. The optical properties of CdS with vacancies were investigated. The results indicated that changes on optical properties mainly focused on low-energy region because of the change of electronic structure of atom neighbor vacancy.

The results show that the main difference of iron oxide scale microstructure of rust and rustless samples is content of Cr oxide; there are more Cr oxide on the rustless samples surface to make oxide layer more compact, but there are a little Cr oxide on the rust samples surface to affect its anti-corrosion; rust and rustless samples can be divided into 5 layers from the outer surface to the base plate, i.e., the iron oxide layer, the iron chromium oxide layer, the chromium oxide layer, the silicon oxide layer and base plate.

The surface appearance of this layer formed was uniform, compact and fine TiN cellular structure, a diffusion transitional region existing between the deposition layer and substrate. The surface texture was TiN deposition layer + TiN + Ti solid solution diffusion layer. From surface to inner Ti and N elements appeared graded distribution. This paper also mainly investigated the electrochemical corrosion behaviors of this multilayer. The polarization curves of specimens in 10% H2SO4 corrosive media were measured. The eroded surface morphologies were also surveyed by SEM. The results indicated that the erosion resistance of multi-permeation layer was increased many times than PVDTiN and a mild steel substrate, and almost equaled to that of compound process TiN layers. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.

The effects of dielectric refractive index and crystal structures on the absolute photonic band gap are investigated. The results show that the maximum absolute photonic band gap emerges when the square air columns are rotated for 30° and the filling ratio f of the medium is 0.3276. It is also noticed that absolute photonic band gaps appear when the refractive index of the medium (n) is 2.61. When n=3.70, the width of the absolute photonic bandgaps reaches the maximum. © 2010 Tianjin University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

This method based on the principle of increasing the energy barrier of adatom hopping by surface passivation and low-temperature growth, is quite different from present methods. The InGaN quantum dots in the first layer of about 40-nm-wide and 15-nm-high grown by this method were revealed by atomic force microscopy. The InGaN QDs in upper layer grew bigger. To our knowledge, the current-voltage characteristics of multi-sheet InGaN/GaN QDs were measured for the fist time. Two kinds of resonance-tunneling-current features were observed which were attributed to the low-dimensional localization effect. Some current peaks only appeared in positive voltage for sample due to the non-uniformity of the QDs in the structure. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

0036467299	A new method to fabricate InGaN quantum dots by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition	A new method to form nanoscale InGaN quantum dots using MOCVD is reported. This method is much different from a method, which uses surfactant or the Stranski-Krastannow growth mode. The dots were formed by increasing the energy barrier for adatoms, which are hopping by surface passivation, and by decreasing the growth temperature. Thus, the new method can be called as a passivation-low-temperature method. Regular high-temperature GaN films were grown first and were passivated. A low-temperature thin layer of GaN dot was then deposited on the surface that acted as the adjusting layer. At last the high-density InGaN dots could be fabricated on the adjusting layer. Atomic force microscopy measurement revealed that InGaN dots were small enough to expect zero-dimensional quantum effects: The islands were typically 80 nm wide and 5 nm high.

The excitation-intensity-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of these samples was measured, and no peak shift was observed. This phenomenon was attributed to the absence of piezoelectric field (PEF) along the growth orientation of the (1 1 2̄ 0) face MQWs. Our experimental results showed that PEF was the main reason causing peak blueshift in excitation-intensity-dependent PL spectrum of (0 0 0 1) InGaN/GaN MQWs. It was expected that fabricating (1 1 2̄ 0) face nitride device should be a method to avoid PEF and get low-threshold, high-quantum-efficiency and stable-emission-wavelength light-emission devices. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

79958176479	First principle study of cysteine molecule on intrinsic and Au-doped graphene surface as a chemosensor device	To search for a high sensitivity sensor for cysteine, we investigated the adsorption of cysteine on intrinsic and Au-doped graphene sheets using density functional theory calculations. Binding energy is primarily determined by the type of atom which is closer to the adsorbed sheet. Compared with intrinsic graphene, Au-doped graphene system has higher binding energy value and shorter connecting distance, in which strong Au-S, Au-N and Au-O chemical bond interaction play the key role for stability. Furthermore, the density of states results show orbital hybridization between cysteine and Au-doped graphene sheet, but slight hybridization between the cysteine molecule and intrinsic graphene sheet. Large charge transfers exist in Au-doped graphene-cysteine system. The results of DOS and charge transfer calculations suppose that the electronic properties of graphene can be tuned by the adsorption site of cysteine. Therefore, graphene and Au-doped graphene system both possess sensing ability, except that Au-doped graphene is a better sensor for cysteine than intrinsic graphene. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

The dependence of these SFE and DTE on solid-solution Mg content and its accupation were specifically analyzed. Two major approximations were made in the process of calculation, which were local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91), respectively. The calculated SFE values by using GGA-PW91 exhibit an excellent agreement with corresponding experimental measurements. For pure Al metal, the calculated SFE values are greater than those of DTE. Moreover, it is found that under the same deformation conditions, the DTE in pure Al and Al-Mg alloys increase monotonically with the increase of deformation twin thickness. In addition, the calculated results shows that 6-layer twin possesses the lowest DTE, which is probably due to its mirror symmetry structure. Also noteworthy, our calculations reveal a noticeable decreased tendency of SFE and DTE with Mg content increasing, while Mg occupying on stacking fault and twin boundary most likely increases SFE and DTE. There are no considerably detected effects of Mg atomic occupancy variation in Al-Mg alloy on its cohesive energy and formation energy. © Copyright.

82155168593	Development in fundamental research on TWIP steel used in automobile industry	This paper tracks the progress in research regarding the use of twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steel in the automobile industry. The chemical composition of TWIP steel ensures that it has stable austenite and proper stacking fault energy at room temperature, allowing the main deformation mechanism (twinning) to work. The effects of alloying elements on the microstructure and deformation mechanism of TWIP steel are explained in detail, and their properties deformed under static and dynamic conditions are examined. The TWIP steel deformed at a low strain rate shows higher total elongation and strength. When the TWIP steel deforms under dynamic strain conditions, the stress, microhardness and the work hardening rate, all increase along with the increase in strain and the strain rate. The twin characteristics of TWIP steels deformed at various strain rates vary also and the twins generated under a high strain rate exhibit thinner widths and smaller interspaces compared with those formed under a low strain rate. It has also been observed that multisystem twins are able to generate and develop together. The mechanisms of toughening and strengthening in TWIP steels are noted. Finally, some potential application fields have been found for the promising material. © 2011 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

84860334124	Theoretical study on the alloying effect of Cr, V in Ti-Al alloys	The electronic structures of Ti-Al alloys with Cr, V addition were studied using the first-principle pseudopotential plane-wave method. The total energy, cohesive energy, mechanical property, the charge density and density of states of the alloys were calculated, and the reason that the mechanical property was improved after Cr, V infiltration in Ti-Al alloys in terms of theory was explained. The results show that with the alloying elements Cr (0-25at%), V (0-25at%) content increasing, the absolute value of cohesive energy of the alloys becomes larger and the structure is more stable; the values of shear modulus G and Young's modulus E increase, but the increment gradually decrease. The main reason is that the addition of Cr in the alloys enhances reciprocal hybridization of Cr 3d, Al 3p and Ti 3d, while V in the alloys enhances reciprocal hybridization of V 3d, Ti 3d and Al 3p, and the alloys' binding capacity is increased.

The calculated indirect band gaps of BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI crystals are 2.50, 2.10 and 1.59 eV, respectively. The analysis of densities of states and atomic charge populations for BiOX crystals indicates that, (a) the valance band maximum is mainly contributed to O 2p and X np states and the Bi 6p states dominate the conduction band minimum; (b) the contribution of X ns states obviously increases with the increase of X atomic numbers, and the dispersive energy level becomes more and more significant and (c) the sequence of covalent bonding strength between atoms is Bi-O >Bi-I>Bi-Br>Bi-Cl. In addition, the calculated absorption edges of the absorption coefficients I(ω) for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI crystals are 355, 448 and 645 nm, respectively, which agree well with our experimental measurements of 376, 442 and 628 nm and the previous reported results of 370, 440 and 670 nm. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By increasing some design parameters, our method, which can be easily used to design the spectrum shapes of 1DPCs and other types of multilayer structures, can offer designers more choices in selecting the structure forms of 1DPCs. We use our method to design two types of narrow-band reflecting filters based on the high-order band gaps of 1DPCs. These filters, with their peak wavelengths near 1555nm and filter bandwidths about several nanometers, include a single- and a two-channel filter by adjusting structure parameters. In order to prove our design method effective, we fabricate these filters by lithography and measure their insertion loss spectrums.

The preparation process was optimized by investigating the effects of processing temperature and discharge pressure on the formation of surface alloy. The calculation using the first-principle method showed that the addition of Cr into the TiAl lattice would increase the stability of the system, and improve mechanical properties of the alloy. The processing temperature was selected at 1100°C, slightly below the eutectic temperature of the Ti-Al system, ensuring diffusion efficiency and also avoiding the degradation of substrate microstructure. The optimum discharge pressure was 25 Pa within the range of 12-55 Pa.

The influences of the external electric field on the MWCNTs dispersion and the microstructure of host matrix were evaluated by means of optical microscopy, scanning electric microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. The microscopy measurements showed that the distribution of the MWCNTs depended strongly on the properties of the applied electric field. Applying AC electric field to the liquid MWCNTs/thermoset systems during curing stage could redistribute the MWCNTs, which arranged them in chain-like structures and oriented fibrous inclusions parallel to the applied electric field. However, the similar phenomenon was not observed in DC electric field. From the observations of AFM measurement, it was found that the utilization of the external electric field resulted in the nano-structured two-phase structures in the resulting MWCNTs/thermoset nanocomposites. These novel electric-field-induced morphology transformations were mainly attributed to the curing process under the applied electric fields. The relationships between the microstructures and various physical properties of nanocomposites were also presented in this paper. The resulting nanocomposites displayed the interesting dielectric properties and the thermal stability properties, which significantly depended on their special microstructures of inclusions and the host matrix. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The suitable theoretical models were built up and their relaxed structural parameters agree well with the experiment values. It is found that both substitutional and interstitial Mn doping BiOCl not only are energetically favorable but also modify band structures to achieve remarkable optical red-shift of BiOCl, and the substitutional Mn-doped BiOCl show better feasible Mn doping behavior due to the beneficial p-type doping characteristic and p-d hybridization between substitutional Mn and adjacent Bi (or O) atoms in the CB (or VBM).

Profiles of boron and residual damage were theoretically simulated by technology computer aided design based on boron diffusion kinetics mechanism of transient enhanced diffusion. Compared with the rapid thermally annealed samples, the furnace annealed one showed the lowest remnant damage spectra obtained by channeling Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Furthermore, the electrical properties of boron implanted samples were characterized by Hall and QSSPC technique, revealing a trend that increasing annealing thermal budget would result in higher active carrier density and lower emitter saturation current density. Finally, passivated emitter solar cells were fabricated to verify the influence of annealing conditions on the performances at device level. The champion cell with efficiency of 18.85% received FA for 20 min, whereas those with lower thermal budgets exhibited significantly lower performance. From diode parameters obtained by fitting dark I-V curves and short wavelength responses of internal quantum efficiency spectrum, it was found that B-implanted samples required an annealing temperature of at least 1000 °C together with a sufficiently long time.

Atom interactions of surface layers appear weak ionic. Changes of distances between layers and surface effect are mainly concentrated in the several surface layers. Analysis of the optical properties of the films showed that their refractive index is significantly increased and their extinction coefficient is slightly increased compared with the bulk at visible and infrared wavelengths. With increasing thin film thickness, the refractive index decreased, while the extinction coefficient and absorption increased.

84896912606	Effect of Cr, Mo, and Nb additions on intergranular cohesion of ferritic stainless steel: First-principles determination	Effects of Cr, Mo, and Nb on the ferritic stainless steel Σ(210) grain boundary and intragranularity are investigated using the first-principles principle. Different positions of solute atoms are considered. Structural stability is lowered by Cr doping and enhanced by Mo and Nb doping. A ranking on the effect of solute atoms enhancing the cohesive strength of the grain boundary, from the strongest to the weakest is Cr, Mo, and Nb. Cr clearly prefers to locate in the intragranular region of Fe rather than in the grain boundary, while Mo and Nb tend to segregate to the grain boundary. Solute Mo and Nb atoms possess a strong driving force for segregation to the grain boundary from the intragranular region, which increases the grain boundary embrittlement. For Mo- and Nb-doped systems, a remarkable quantity of electrons accumulate in the region close to Mo (Nb). Therefore, the bond strength may increase. With Cr, Mo, and Nb additions, an anti-parallel island is formed around the center of the grain boundary. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84898078635	Design of three-channel filters with broad nontransmission bandgap by the use of dual-periodic heterostructures	The bandgap characteristics of 1D dual-periodic photonic crystal (PC) heterostructures composed of two different 1D PCs containing TiO2?MgF2 multilayer films were theoretically studied through a transfer matrix method. With broad nontransmission bandgap and high-transmission peaks for electromagnetic and magnetic electric modes, the optimization design provides a promising method to fabricate the dual-periodic PC three-channel filter with a wide nontransmission range in the visible range. At the incident angle of less than 28°, the nontransmission range of the dual-periodic PC three-channel filters can be substantially enlarged over the entire visible range, and the phenomenon of three-channel filters in blue, green, and red light can be realized by adjusting the repeat cycle counts of two 1D PCs. Thus the proposed approach can be utilized for display applications. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84899852931	Stress effects on stability and diffusion behavior of sulfur impurity in nickel: A first-principles study	A systematic investigation regarding the effect of stress on the stability and diffusion behavior of S impurity in Ni was carried out via first-principles methods. A comparison of the formation energy of S in Ni indicated that S more easily forms as a solution atom with increasing S concentration in Ni supercells, but the binding energy showed that as the concentration of S that dissolved into Ni increased, the structure became less stable. The diffusion barrier via the octahedral-tetrahedral-octahedral site path was always lower than that via the octahedral-octahedral site path. The diffusion barrier of single S decreased with increase in tensile stress. S diffusion accelerated under applied tensile stress, which was disadvantageous in suppressing S retention in Ni. These results implied that even at a low concentration, dissolved S still had a tendency of precipitating from the Ni matrix, to further increase the stability of the system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84902172264	Light-extraction enhancement and directional emission control of GaN-based LED with transmission grating	We theoretically analyze the improvement in light extraction efficiency (LEE) of GaN-based LEDs with transmission grating. Light propagation and extraction was simulated using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for conical, cylindrical, and hemispherical grating. The simulations show that the use of transmission grating leads to increase in the LEE of GaN-based LEDs. The enhancement in LEE is attributed to the decrease in the Fresnel reflection and the effective increase in the photon escape cone. The maximum LEE enhancement of 2.3 times was achieved by employing hemispherical grating. The directional emission pattern converged by employing conical grating. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

84902598441	First-principles study on electronic structure and optical absorption of BiOCl(110) surface	The electronic structure and optical absorption of two different terminations ((110)-BiCl and (110)-O) for BiOCl(110) surfaces were calculated by the first-principles based on density functional theory. The results indicate that there is no obvious reconstruction for BiOCl(110) surfaces. For (110)-BiCl surface, surface states are located at the bottom of conduction band, reducing the band gap, and both the conduction and valence band of (110)-BiCl surface shift towards the lower energy. However, there exist surface states at the top of valence band of (110)-O surface, and the band gap of (110)-O surface is slightly wider than that of the bulk. Furthermore, the surface energies of (110)-BiCl and (110)-O are 1.570 J·m

84905705244	Theoretical insights into the adsorption of monatomic Ag on the (2 × 2) BiOCl (0 0 1) surfaces	The adsorption energies, geometric structures, electronic properties, work functions and surface dipole moments of monatomic Ag adsorption on the (2 × 2) BiOCl (0 0 1) surfaces, including the 1Cl-, BiO- and 2Cl-terminated BiOCl (0 0 1) surfaces, have been investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The most energetically favorable adsorption configuration of single Ag atom is at the fourfold hollow site, with the minimum adsorption energies of -0.465, -2.954 and -8.080 eV for the 1Cl-, BiO- and 2Cl-terminated BiOCl (0 0 1) surfaces, respectively. The analysis results of electronic properties indicate that there are new intermediate energy states mainly contributed to Ag 4d and Cl 3p states for 2Cl-terminated (0 0 1) surface, and Ag 5s states for 1Cl- and BiO-terminations. In addition, Ag adsorption can induce the formation of surface dipole moment and change in work function by the interfacial charge transfer. Combined with the previously reported experiments, the charge transport mechanism and effective separation processes of photo-induced electron-hole pairs of Ag/BiOCl photocatalytic system are built up and discussed. More importantly, our calculated findings could afford the theoretical basic knowledge for further understanding the microscopic structures, electronic properties, and photocatalytic reaction mechanism of Ag/BiOCl photocatalyst, providing a new analysis calculation for potential application in the investigation on the Ag/BiOBr and Ag/BiOI as well as other noble metals/BiOCl catalytic systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84906828898	First principle study on alloying effect of Al and Zn doping on Mg-Li phase interface	According to the first principle ultrasoft pseudopotential plane wave method based on the density functional theory (DFT), the effect of Al and Zn doping on the rupture strength of Mg-Li phase interface was investigated. The cohesive energy calculation shows that the structure of Mg-Li alloy with Al and Zn solid solution is more stable. The calculation of density of states, charge density and work of rupture suggests that Al is more easily dissolved into α-Mg phase, and its enhancement to the rupture strength is superior to that of α-Mg/β-Li phase interface. Zn can improve rupture strength dissolving in grain and phase interface. Al and Zn addition can further improve the stability of the system and rupture strength. The calculation of environment-sensitive embedding energy shows that Zn segregates to the phase interface more easily than Al. The Al and Zn alloying effect on the structure stability and rupture strength in mainly contributed by 3p and 3s states of Al, the new peak of 3d states of Zn and the hybridization between Mg-2p and Li-2s at the Fermi level.

84907821799	First principles investigation into effects of Cr on segregation of S or Cl at α-Fe SΣ5(210) grain boundary	In this paper, the effects of Cr on segregation of S or Cl atoms at the α-Fe SΣ5(210) grain boundary (GB) are studied using a first principles method, CASTEP. In the absence of Cr, S can be trapped at the interstitial site of the Fe GB. Cl is not apt to be segregated at the GB. The presence of Cr acts as an enhancer, and can alleviate the detrimental effect of Cl and S. Furthermore, increasing the Cr content has a more effective impact on Cl. Based on the segregation energy analysis, it is also found that Cr can effectively prohibit S from segregating to the GB and therefore eliminate the embrittlement of the GB induced by S; however, it has little effect on Cl. Cr prevents the expansion of interfacial bonds Fe-Fe or Fe-S/Cl for S, and Cl segregating in Fe GB even exhibited shorter bond lengths with increasing Cr content. Therefore, Cr alleviates embrittlement or corrosion effect of S and Cl in Fe GB. Analysis of densities of states further indicates that Cr should alleviate the detrimental effect of S and Cl, enhancing the cohesion of α-Fe GB.

84911422540	First-principles study of the effects of selected interstitial atoms on the generalized stacking fault energies, strength, and ductility of Ni	We analyze the influences of interstitial atoms on the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE), strength, and ductility of Ni by first-principles calculations. Surface energies and GSFE curves are calculated for the 〈112〉 (111) and 〈101〉 (111) systems. Because of the anisotropy of the single crystal, the addition of interstitials tends to promote the strength of Ni by slipping along the 〈101〉 direction while facilitating plastic deformation by slipping along the 〈112〉 direction. There is a different impact on the mechanical behavior of Ni when the interstitials are located in the slip plane. The evaluation of the Rice criterion reveals that the addition of the interstitials H and O increases the brittleness in Ni and promotes the probability of cleavage fracture, while the addition of S and N tends to increase the ductility. Besides, P, H, and S have a negligible effect on the deformation tendency in Ni, while the tendency of partial dislocation is more prominent with the addition of N and O. The addition of interstitial atoms tends to increase the high-energy barrier γmax, thereby the second partial resulting from the dislocation tends to reside and move on to the next layer.

84918776253	Improving efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cell by optimizing emitter using process and device simulation	The process simulation module of the TCAD software was used to simulate the diffusion process and oxidization process of the crystalline silicon solar cells, and the results were consistent with the SIMS profiles. Based on the process simulation, the device simulation module of the TCAD software was used to calculate the conversion efficiency and internal quantum efficiency of the solar cells. It was found that the dopant concentration near the surface of the emitter was decreased by decreasing the diffusion temperature and adding the oxidization process after diffusion, and the oxidization process decreased the emitter sheet resistance. If the contact resistance increased a little, the efficiency of the cells could be increased by above processes. The veracity of simulation was verified by testing the quantum efficiency curve of the real cells.

13444271675	Effects of different modified underlayer surfaces on growth and optical properties of InGaN quantum dots	InGaN/GaN quantum dots were grown on the sapphire (0 0 0 1) substrate in a metalorganic chemical vapor deposition system. The morphologies of QDs deposited on different modified underlayer (GaN) surfaces, including naturally as grown, Ga-mediated, In-mediated, and air-passivated ones, were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Photoluminescence (PL) method is used to evaluate optical properties. It is shown that InGaN QDs can form directly on the natural GaN layer. However, both the size and distribution show obvious inhomogeneities. Such a heavy fluctuation in size leads to double peaks for QDs with short growth time, and broad peaks for QDs with long growth time in their low-temperature PL spectra. QDs grown on the Ga-mediated GaN underlayer tends to coalesce. Distinct transform takes place from 3D to 2D growth on the In-mediated ones, and thus the formation of QDs is prohibited. Those results clarify Ga and In's surfactant behavior. When the GaN underlayer is passivated in the air, and together with an additional low-temperature-grown seeding layer, however, the island growth mode is enhanced. Subsequently, grown InGaN QDs are characterized by a relatively high density and an improved Gaussian-like distribution in size. Short surface diffusion length at low growth temperature accounts for that result. It is concluded that reduced temperature favors QD's 3D growth and surface passivation can provide another promising way to obtain high-density QDs that especially suits MOCVD system. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
