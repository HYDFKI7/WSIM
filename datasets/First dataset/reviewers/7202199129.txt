84929406775	Assessment of wind power capacity in power systems to meet the adequacy indexes	Aiming at the statistical characteristics of wind power, this paper proposes a method to access the wind power accommodation by considering adequacy indexes. On the basis of the statics of historical operating data, four adequacy indexes, namely Peak-Load Regulation Not Enough Probability (PRNEP), Peak-Load Regulation Not Enough Expectation (PRNEE), Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) and Loss of Energy Expectation (LOEE), are simulated, according to the computing results of adequacy indexes, the wind power accommodation is chosen to meet the preset adequacy level. Besides, a practical method for calculating requirement of comprehensive net load and peak-load regulation for windenergy storage system (ESS) is presented. Based on the bilinear interpolation theory, the relationship function of adequacy level, wind power accommodation and ESS capacity is obtained, which offers valuable reference for wind power and ESS capacity planning and scheduling. Finally, taking a practical system for example, the wind power accommodations without ESS and with different capacity of ESS are compared and analyzed, and the proposed method is illustrated.

84929516651	Optimization of sample cooling temperature for redox cryo-imaging	Cryo-imaging techniques have been widely used to measure the metabolic state of tissues by capturing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) autofluorescence. However, NADH and FAD fluorescence is sensitive to changes in temperature, which may result in unreliable redox ratio calculations. Here, the relationship between the measured redox ratio and sample surface temperature was analyzed using a standard phantom solution and biological tissues. The results indicated that a temperature -100°C was a suitable cryo-imaging temperature window in which redox ratio measuring was immune to temperature fluctuations. These results may serve as a reference for designing and optimizing redox cryo-imaging experiments for quantitatively mapping the metabolic state of biological samples. © The Authors.

84934438190	Quality evaluation method for rat brain cryofixation on the Basis of NADH fluorescence	The goal of biological samples' cryofixation is to trap a metabolic state as it exists in vivo by rapidly stopping internal reactions. However, obtaining perfect quality of cryofixation for large and high hypermetabolism organ/tissue (such as brain, heart) remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to develop and display a comprehensive and direct method to evaluate cryofixation's process and quality. Here, we adopt a delicate combination of homemade cryo-imaging system with a rat cardiac arrest model that can control cryofixation time optionally. we successfully evaluate the cryofixation time-related nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence pattern of several coronal sections in rat's brain that suffered from directional funnel cryofixation procedure. Through quantitative analysis of the distribution map of NADH fluorescence, we could obtain a relationship between cryofixation time and well cryofixation volume and then could deduce the cryofixation rates and quality at different time points. Our results also demonstrated that dissection of the temporal muscle of rat could significantly optimize the classical direct funnel cryofixation protocol. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

9144236980	Hyperosmotic chemical agent's effect on in vivo cerebral blood flow revealed by laser speckle	We investigated the influence of a hyperosmotic agent (glycerol) on the normal physiological function of tissue by applying the glycerol in vitro and in vivo to rabbit dura mater to assess the changes in the tissue's optical properties. We used a laser speckle imaging technique to study the effect of epidurally applied glycerol on resting cerebral blood flow (CBF). Our results showed that resting CBF decreased as the transparency of the dura mater increased. The challenges for the design of an optical clearing technique were not only the clearing effects and the duration of the action of the chemical agents but also the influence of the glycerol on the tissue's normal physiological function. © 2004 Optical Society of America.

1842476180	An Evaluation of Data Analysis Methods for Optical Intrinsic Signal Imaging	The optical intrinsic signal imaging is an indirect mapping of neuronal activity. The change in light intensity due to neuronal activity are often very small, no more than 0.1-6% of the total intensity of the reflected light in optimal cases, and the noise, which arise from either the biological noise associated with the respiration, circulation and irrelevant physiological activity or the instrumentation noise such as digitization noise, illumination noise, movement artifacts, etc. are usually large. In previous studies, a couple of analysis methods such as Standard Difference, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Truncated Differences were used to suppress these large background noises and extract the small signal of interest from the noisy raw data. The performance of these methods for improving the determination of spatial pattern and time course of the response signal were examined and compared in this paper. The evaluations were employed to both simulated data and experimental optical intrinsic signal imaging data from rat somatosensory cortex during the electrical stimulation at contralateral sciatic nerve.

1842476252	Optical intrinsic signals in rat primary somatosensory cortex during non-noxious and noxious electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve	Optical imaging method was applied into observing the temporal-spatial characteristic of rat primary somatosensory cortex during graded electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve (5hz.duration of 2s,0.5ms puls,1×, 10× and 20× muscle twitch threshold). We found that the temporal and spatial properties of hindlimb somatosensory cortex were modulated by graded intensity electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. The magnitude and time course were larger and longer with the intensity raising. And the spatial extent was wider at 20× stimulus than the other two kinds of stimulus. Therefore, our optical imaging was based on 570nm, which only reflect the changes of blood volume. Then our future study will reveal more information of pain modulation in primary somatosensory cortex.

1842477093	Simultaneous imaging intrinsic optical signals and cerebral vessel responses during cortical spreading depression in rats	Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an important disease model for migraine and cerebral ischemia. We investigated the spatio-temporal characteristics of the intrinsic optical signals (IOS) at 570 nm and the cerebral blood vessel responses during CSD simultaneously by optical reflectance imaging in vivo. The CSD were induced by pinprick in 10 α-chloralose/ urethane anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. A four-phasic IOS response was observed at pial arteries and parenchymal sites in all experimental animals and an initial slight pial arteries dilation (21.5%±13.6%) and constriction (-4.2%±3.5%) precedes the dramatic dilation (69.2%±26.1%) of pial arterioles was recorded. Our experimental results show a high correlation (r = 0.89±0.025) between the IOS response and the diameter changes of the cerebral blood vessels during CSD in rats.

1842529168	In vivo optical imaging of cortical spreading depression in rat	Intrinsic optical signals imaging (IOSI) and laser speckle imaging (LSI) are both novel techniques for functional neuroimaging in vivo. Combining them to study cortical spreading depression (CSD) which is an important disease model for migraine and other neurological disorders. CSD were induced by pinprick in Sprague-Dawley rats. Intrinsic optical signals (IOS) at 540 nm showed CSD evolution happened in one hemisphere cortex at speeds of 3.7±0.4 mm/min, and the vasodilation closely correlated a four-phasic response. By LSI, we observed a transient and significant increase cerebral blood flow (CBF). In this paper, optical imaging would be showed as a powerful tool for describing the hemodynamic character during CSD in rat.

1842529214	Spatial Independent Component Analysis of Functional Brain Optical Imaging	This paper introduces the algorithm and the basic theory of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and discusses how to choose the proper ICA model of the data by the characteristics of the underlying signals to be estimated. The Spatial ICA (SICA) is applied to model and analysis of the data in the experiment when the signals and noises are spatially dependent. The data acquired from the intrinsic optical signals which are caused by electricity stimulation to sciatic nerve of rat are analyzed by SICA. In the result, the active-related component of the signals and its time course can be separate, and the signals of heartbeat and respiration also can be separated.

3142645619	Limitation in detecting internal blood vessels using digital X-ray imaging technique	The thickness of the surrounding tissue is a crucial factor in distinguishing the internal blood vessels in digital X-ray images, because enough contrast between vessels and tissues must be generated. We investigated the X-ray attenuations of fat, liver, and muscle tissues, using a digital X-ray imaging system specially designed for small animal studies and the contrast between these tissues and blood vessels. The fat, muscle and the liver tissues were collected from the abdomen, the back and the liver of an adult crossbred swine, respectively. The blood vessels were from mesentery of a Wistar rat. The attenuation coefficients of different tissues and blood vessels of different sizes were measured under different X-ray exposures. Also quantified was the contrast between the tissues and the blood vessels when the diameter of the blood vessel and the thickness of the tissues were the same. The limiting thickness of various tissues at different X-ray exposures was obtained for detecting internal blood vessels of a given size, using the CCD detecting limit, the contrast resolution of the imaging system and the tissue-vessel configuration. The results provided herein could be used for optimization of the parameters of digital X-ray imaging in detecting internal blood vessels.

33646196211	Frame self-division applied in analysis of intrinsic signal optical imaging data	In intrinsic signal optical imaging data, the response signal related cortical activity is very small compared to the background signal intensity and accompanied with unwanted noise from several different sources. Although there are some sophisticated data analysis techniques developed to achieve this critical demand, experience proved that no method perfect enough to be optimal for all experimental situations. Here we introduced a simple and practicable pre-processing method to attenuate the global noise source, such as the fluctuation of the illuminating light, changes of the animal's blood pressure and vasomotor oscillations. Before image processing to characterize the spatiotemporal response from cortical activity, each frame of image data was divided by the average or median of the current frame data. We applied the method to both simulated data and experimental optical imaging data to evaluate the validity and limitation.

It is therefore of practical interest to research smart antenna technology applied to wireless communication. In this study, we focus on FASTICA (Fast Independent Component Analysis) algorithms with smart antenna at the wireless communication. It can reduce interference and suppress multi-path effect in the up (reverse) link. At first, we introduce a general overview of smart antennas. Second, we narrate the FASTICA algorithms. At last, we utilize FASTICA to separate the demodulated mixed signals.

33745739880	Origin sites of spontaneous cortical spreading depression migrated during focal cerebral ischemia in rats	Spontaneous cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been found to occur in the penumbral zone of the brain in rats with focal cerebral ischemia, and has been shown to promote expansion of infarction. Electrophysiological recording of CSD has been used for monitoring the penumbral zone, but with an inherently low spatial resolution; consequently, optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) was applied to characterize the spontaneous CSD waves following permanent left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats under α-chloralose/urethane anesthesia. Besides the previous report about the regional variation of optical reflectance during spontaneous CSD following MCAO, the origin site of CSD was easily determined using OISI with the benefit of high resolution in the present study. Those origin points (n = 82) were dynamically located in the ipsilateral hemisphere cortex: sometimes outside of the 6 mm × 8 mm observation area in the parietal cortex (n = 19, 23%), and sometimes inside (n = 63, 77%). The data showed a general trend towards the medial cortex (0.40 ± 0.15 mm per CSD). Because the lateral cortex of the rat brain proved to be infarcted with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining after 4 h occlusion, the migration of the origin sites implied a growth of the infarcted area. Hence, the determination of origins of spontaneous CSD using OISI would contribute to the continued study of stroke. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

33846316304	Differentiating hemodynamic responses in rat primary somatosensory cortex during non-noxious and noxious electrical stimulation by optical imaging	Nociception in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex remains in need of further elucidation. The spatiotemporal comparison on changes of the cerebral blood volume evoked by graded peripheral electrical stimulation was performed in rat contralateral somatosensory cortex with optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI, optical reflectance at 550 nm). Non-noxious electrical stimulus was applied with 5 Hz pulses (0.5 ms peak duration) for 2 s at the threshold current for muscle twitch, while noxious stimulus was delivered at currents of 10× and 20× amplitude of the predetermined threshold. Although the dimensions of peak response defined in the spatial domain (cerebral blood volume increase) in the S1 cortex presented no significant difference under non-/noxious stimuli, its early response component (about 1 s after stimulation onset) revealed by OISI technique was suggested to differentiate the loci of activated cortical region due to different stimulation in this study. The magnitude and duration of the optical intrinsic signal (OIS) response was found increasing with the varying stimulus intensity. Regions activated by the delivery of a noxious stimulus were surrounded by a ring of inverted optical intrinsic signal, the amplitude of that was inversely proportional to the strength of the optical signal attributable to activation. Intense stimuli significantly augmented the inverted optical signal in magnitude and spatial extent. These results indicated that noxious stimulation evoked different response patterns in the contralateral S1 cortex. The magnitude-dependent inverted optical signal might contribute to the differentiation of nociceptive input in the S1 cortex. © 2006.

33846908508	Surrounding inhibition in rat somatosensory cortex during noxious electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve	Surrounding inhibition is a physiologic mechanism to focus neuronal activity. Here we applied optical imaging of intrinsic signal to observing the temporal-spatial characteristic of rat primary somatosensory cortex during graded electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve (5 Hz, duration of 2 s, 0.5 ms pulse, 1× and 10× muscle twitching threshold). We found that the magnitude and change duration (time course) of the optical signal were larger and longer with the intensity raising. The spatial extent was also wider under noxious electrical stimulus. Meanwhile, we found the inverted optical signal changes in the regions surround the activated primary somatosensory cortex. This phenomenon was similar to the inhibition surrounding focal itcal events observed by optical imaging of intrinsic signal. It suggests the surrounding inhibition under noxious electrical stimulus was probably induced by the excess discharge of excited neurons or it may provide finer discrimination during the noxious stimulus and support the view that the role of somatosensory cortex in pain localization is to finely discriminate the stimulus site. © 2005 IEEE.

33846910467	Using running subtraction to detect the wavefront of cortical spreading depression	The purpose of this paper was to present a simple method for analyzing the optical images from cortical spreading depression (CSD). The experimental data was acquired by optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) in Sprague-Dawley rats. In order to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of CSD, especially the wavefront, running subtraction and background subtraction were both applied to process the series of images. By comparing the output results of the two different methods, running subtraction was more sensitive to the first transient and small phase of CSD (i.e. wavefront), and the extracted spatial pattern of CSD showed less vascular artifacts. For these advantages, running subtraction proved to be an appropriate approach to detect the wavefront of CSD. © 2005 IEEE.

34347252685	Extract signals of power line communication by a novel method based on EMD and ICA	In this paper, a novel method to gain communication signals from the power line which based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and independent component analysis (ICA) is presented. Gain a set of the intrinsic mode function (IMF) by using EMD to decompose the voltage signals which had been acquired from the power line. Secondly, seek those IMFs whose have the minimum correlative coefficient. Deal with those IMFs and the voltage signals using ICA, and can obtain a lot of independent component. So the communication signals are pick-up. The method integrates the virtue of EMD and ICA and overcome the lack of ICA which cannot decompose single signal. Simulation results reveal that the proposed the method of EMD and ICA can effectively decompose mixed signals, can precisely extract communication signals of the power line communication.

34548018581	Peri-infarct temporal changes in intrinsic optical signal during spreading depression in focal ischemic rat cortex	The changes of intrinsic optical signals (IOS) are one of the important parameters of spreading depression (SD). The relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and IOS can provide useful information for understanding the role of SD in neurological disorders. Here, we combined laser speckle imaging (LSI), intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOSI), and electrophysiological recording techniques to study the effect of CBF before the occurrence of SD on the spatiotemporal characteristics of IOS related to SD in a ministroke model. Four kinds of temporal pattern of changes in IOS were observed at cortical locations with different level of the CBF before the occurrence of SD. The results indicate that in the surrounding of micro-infarcts, SD-associated IOS vary as a function of blood flow rate, suggesting that the characteristics of IOS during SD might reflect blood flow rates. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

35648987555	Dynamic imaging of cerebral blood flow in rat reperfused mini-stroke model using laser speckle temporal contrast analysis	Laser speckle temporal contrast analysis (LSTCA) was used to image the cerebral blood flow (CBF) of ischemic area in reperfused mini-stroke model in rats. Focal cortical ischemia in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=20) was induced by deliberate ligation of multiple branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) together with a nylon ring and the dura. LSTCA was used to monitor the spatio-temporal characteristics of cerebral blood flow dynamics in the rat somatosensory cortex in the ischemic and reperfused stages. The infarction volume was measured by 2, 3, 5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining 24 hours after reperfusion. The distribution of changes in cerebral blood flow which outlined by the laser speckle imaging represented the relative CBF gradient (21.98±1.96%, 67.2±1.67 %, 107.24±4.71 % of the baseline) from ischemic core, penumbra zone to normal tissue immediately after cortical ischemia, in which a central ischemic core had little or no perfusion surrounded by a penumbral region with reduced perfusion, in addition, we had shown the existence of a surrounding region of hyperemic tissue; !'hereafter a postrecanalization hypoperfusion occurred in the same infarct core since 24 hours after reperftision (242.62±18.52 % of the baseline). Histology of the ischemic regions at 24 hours after reperfusion revealed small focal infarcts that were typically 3~4 mm in diameter, approximately equal to the nylon ring in size and position and essentially accordant with the spatial distribution of the ischemic cortex with below 30% residual CBF of the pre-ischemic baseline. It was demonstrated that this technique of LSTCA was easy to implement and availably used to image the spatial and temporal evolution of CBF changes with high resolution in rat reperfused mini-stroke model.

84877317824	Odor representation in the olfactory bulb under different brain states revealed by intrinsic optical signals imaging	The olfactory system responds to the same stimulus with great variability according to the current state of the brain. At the levels of multi-unit activity and local field potentials, the response of the olfactory bulb (OB) to a given olfactory stimulus during a state of lower background activity is stronger than the response that occurs during higher background activity, but the distribution pattern of activity remains similar. However, these results have only been established at the individual neuron and neuron cluster scales in previous studies. It remains unclear whether these results are consistent at a larger scale (e.g., OB regions); therefore, intrinsic optical signals imaging was employed in the present study to clarify this issue. The basal brain states of rats were manipulated by using different levels of anesthesia. Under a state of low basal brain activity, the intensity of the activity pattern elicited in the dorsal OB by a given odorant was significantly higher than that under high basal brain activity, but the topography was highly similar across different brain states. These results were consistent across the levels of individual neurons, neuron clusters, glomeruli, and the OB regions, which suggest that the OB contains as yet unknown neural mechanisms that ensure the high-fidelity representation of the same olfactory stimulation under different brain states. © 2013 IBRO.

84877890399	Dynamic change of collateral flow varying with distribution of regional blood flow in acute ischemic rat cortex	Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is critical for the maintenance of cerebral function by guaranteed constant oxygen and glucose supply to brain. Collateral channels (CCs) are recruited to provide alternatives to CBF to ischemic regions once the primary vessel is occluded during ischemic stroke. However, the knowledge of the relationship between dynamic evolution of collateral flow and the distribution of regional blood flow remains limited. In this study, laser speckle imaging was used to assess dynamic changes of CCs and regional blood flow in a rat cortex with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). We found that CCs immediately provided blood flow to ischemic territories after MCAo. More importantly, there were three kinds of dynamic changes of CCs during acute stroke: persistent CC, impermanent CC, and transient CC, respectively, related to different distributions of regional blood flow. Although there was the possible occurrence of peri-infarct depolarization (PID) during ischemia, there was no obvious significance about the onset time and duration of CCs between rats with and without PID. These results suggest that the initial arising of CCs does not ensure their persistence, and that collateral flow could be varied with distribution of regional blood flow in acute ischemic stroke, which may facilitate the understanding of collateral recruitment and promote the development of collateral therapeutics in the future. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84887272216	Theoretical modeling of the occurrence of equatorial and low-latitude ionospheric irregularity and scintillation	In this paper, the three-dimensional linear growth rate of Rayleigh-Taylor(R-T) instability depending on the local time is investigated based on the analysis of the generalized three dimensional R-T instability. The maximum of the growth rate in a day is taken as the signature of that day. The characteristics of three-dimensional linear growth rate varying with the seasons, solar activities, geographic longitudes and day-to-day variations are studied and modelled. The variations of growth rate significantly rely on the local times, seasons, solar activities, longitudes and also day-to-day. Comparing the characteristics of the growth rate with the characteristics of the irregularities and scintillations in equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere, it is found that three-dimensional linear growth rates of the R-T instability display similar characteristics with that of the irregularities and scintillations, the growth rate can be used in modeling the theoretical characteristic of the occurrence of the ionospheric irregularity and scintillation.

42549111635	A modified mini-stroke model with region-directed reperfusion in rat cortex	Mini-ischemia localized into a specific brain area has promoted understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain recovery in stroke. However, the conventional mini-stroke model adopted permanent arterial ligations but lacked controllable reperfusion, which is crucial for the outcome of delayed functional recovery. In this study, we devised a new rat mini-stroke model in which the vascular ligations can be easily reversed to induce targeted reperfusion. Specifically, a flexible ring was incorporated into the conventional small arterial ligations to tighten the ligating loops and facilitate cutting the ligatures for sufficient reperfusion afterwards. The distribution of cerebral blood flow was explored directly through a cranial window using laser speckle contrast imaging. A distinct ischemic core, which well fits the profile of the ligated ring, was bordered by a penumbral zone and then together surrounded by nonischemic tissue immediately after the arterial ligations involving the ring. After cutting the ligatures, post-recanalization hyperperfusion occurred in the previous ischemic core and to a greater extent at 24 h after reperfusion. In contrast, recirculation of common carotid artery in the conventional mini-stroke model hardly altered hypoperfusion status within the ischemic core. Evidence from two kinds of control groups indicated that the ring might produce a compression effect on the underlying cortex and then contribute to the more highly localized infarct that was identified by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Our data suggest that this model provides opportunities for investigating the neurovascular dynamics in acute stroke and rehabilitation, especially with emerging optical imaging techniques. © 2008 ISCBFM All rights reserved.

In this study TEC and its variation rate ROT as well as the ROT's standard deviation ROTI were considered as characteristic parameters distinguishing ionospheric disturbances and irregularities. Results showed that the ionosphere was relatively quiet and there was no remarkable disturbance in the global at the SSC of the storm and its initial phase. The ionospheric irregularities and disturbances mainly occurred around the main phase of the storm and during several hours after local sunset and lasted up to the midnight. Around the maximum of the first main phase of the storm, the ionospheric irregularities and disturbances mainly distributed in the region of mid-low latitudes at the American sector where the local time is at night. And around the maximum of the third main phase of the storm, the ionospheric irregularities and disturbances mainly distributed in the region of mid-low latitudes at the Asian-Pacific sector where the local time is at night.

61749095048	Detection of bursts in neuronal spike trains by the mean inter-spike interval method	Bursts are electrical spikes firing with a high frequency, which are the most important property in synaptic plasticity and information processing in the central nervous system. However, bursts are difficult to identify because bursting activities or patterns vary with physiological conditions or external stimuli. In this paper, a simple method automatically to detect bursts in spike trains is described. This method auto-adaptively sets a parameter (mean inter-spike interval) according to intrinsic properties of the detected burst spike trains, without any arbitrary choices or any operator judgment. When the mean value of several successive inter-spike intervals is not larger than the parameter, a burst is identified. By this method, bursts can be automatically extracted from different bursting patterns of cultured neurons on multi-electrode arrays, as accurately as by visual inspection. Furthermore, significant changes of burst variables caused by electrical stimulus have been found in spontaneous activity of neuronal network. These suggest that the mean inter-spike interval method is robust for detecting changes in burst patterns and characteristics induced by environmental alterations. © 2008 National Natural Science Foundation of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

62449093939	Acute hyperglycemia compromises cerebral blood flow following cortical spreading depression in rats monitored by laser speckle imaging	Hyperglycemia and cortical spreading depression (CSD) are possible factors that worsen the outcome of ischemic stroke, and it is probable that there is a longterm cooperative effect of hyperglycemia and CSD on cerebral blood flow (CBF). Long-lasting and full-field observation of changes in CBF following CSD in vivo during acute hyperglycemia in rats might show whether this is the case. Here, we utilized laser speckle imaging to study influences of acute hyperglycemia on CBF at the level of individual vascular compartments for 3h in normal rats and those with CSD. It is shown that there are extensive increases of CBF at the arteriole and parenchyma over the normal rat cortex during acute hyperglycemia, whereas there is no significant change in CBF at the venule. We also find that, at all vascular compartments, after the glucose administration there is a stepwise reduction of CBF following CSD, but after saline injection CBF following CSD is close to the baseline. Our results indicate that acute hyperglycemia could aggravate the severity of decrease in CBF following CSD, suggesting possible mechanisms by which hyperglycemia exacerbates cerebral damage after ischemic stroke. © 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

67349084192	Characterizing the complexity of spontaneous electrical signals in cultured neuronal networks using approximate entropy	In this paper, neurons were cultured on a substrate above a multielectrode array, so the changes of electrophysiological activity patterns during development of the neuronal network or in response to environmental perturbations were monitored. But the complexity of these spontaneous activity patterns is not well understood. In order to solve the problem, a comprehensive method (approximate entropy (ApEn) in combination with a "sliding window" over the data) is introduced to quantify the complexity of four spontaneous activity patterns (sporadic spikes, tonic spikes, pseudobursts, and typical bursts) in cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. The results show that the dynamic curves of ApEn illustrate vivid differences between the four patterns and the values of ApEn fall into different ranges. Among these patterns, the complexity of tonic spikes is the highest while that of pseudobursts is the lowest. This suggests that the proposed method is a valid procedure for tracking the dynamic variation in neuronal signals and can distinguish the different firing patterns of neuronal networks in terms of their complexity. © 2009 IEEE.

70149088136	Analysis of controlling factors leading to the development of R-T instability in equatorial ionosphere	In this paper the effect of the spatial gradients of the electric field and the neutral wind on the linear growth of the plasma R-T instability and its growth rate are analyzed, based on the quality and the charge conservation equation. The results reveal that, both electric field spatial gradients and neutral wind spatial gradients can promote or restrain the growth of R-T instability remarkably, which depends on the orientation of the electric field and the neutral wind as well as the polarity of their gradients; and the degree of the influence depends on the magnitude of their spatial gradients and the ratio of the parallel to Pedersen conductance and the ratio of the parallel to transverse wave number for the transverse gradients of the electric field and the neutral wind. Numerical results show that, for the typical ionospheric background condition, the electric field gradients and neutral wind gradients can make the growth rate of R-T instability increase or decrease 10% to 120% for different scale lengths.

It is getting increasing use in monitoring dynamic fluctuation of blood flow in tissues in physiological and pathological situations. In practice, various factors such as averaged image speckle size have impact on speckle contrast, making the accuracy of this technique affected in reflecting blood flow changes. This study investigates the impact of averaged image speckle size on statistical characteristics of image speckle pattern by simulating image speckle pattern. The quantitative relation between imaging parameters and averaged image speckle size is analyzed. The results are finally validated by phantom experiment. These results confirm the reasonable formula for calculating averaged image speckle size and the phenomenon that speckle contrast increases with increasing averaged image speckle size, providing a basis for determining reasonable imaging parameters.

Through numerical simulation and animal experiments, this study investigates the changes in the mean speckle contrast values and the relative noise of the speckle contrast images computed by these methods with various numbers of frames and spatial windows. The simulation results show that the maximum relative error of the mean speckle contrast computed by the spatiotemporal laser speckle contrast analysis (STLASCA) method, in which the speckle contrast images are computed by analyzing the 3-D spatiotemporal speckle image cube, is approximately 5%, while it is higher than 13% for other methods. Changes in the mean speckle contrast values and the relative noise computed by these methods for animal experiment data are consistent with the simulation results. Our results demonstrate that STLASCA achieves more accurate speckle contrast, and suggest that STLASCA most effectively utilizes the number of pixels, thus achieving maximized speckle contrast, and thereby maximizing the variation of the laser speckle contrast image. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

78349236709	Accurately determining propagation velocity of cortical spreading depression in rats by optical intrinsic signal imaging	Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that propagates across the cortex at a rate of 25 mm/min accompanied by reversible electroencephalogram (EEG) suppression, a negative shift of direct current (DC) potential, and change of optical intrinsic signals (OIS). Propagation velocity of CSD is an important parameter used to study this phenomenon. It is commonly determined in an electrophysiological way that measures the time required for a CSD wave to pass along two electrodes. Since the electrophysiology technique fails to reveal the spreading pattern of CSD, velocity calculated in this manner might be inaccurate. In this study, we combined the electrophysiological recording and OIS imaging (OISI) for detecting changes in DC potential and OIS during CSD simultaneously. An optical method based on OISI to determine the CSD velocity, which is measured by generating a series of regions of interest (ROI) perpendicular to the advancing wavefront along propagation direction of CSD at different time points and then dividing by the distance between ROIs over time, is presented. Comparison of the accuracy of the two approaches in determining the CSD velocity is made as well. The average rate of 33 CSDs is 3.52 ± 0.87 mm/min by use of the optical method and 4.36 ± 1.65 mm/min by use of the electrophysiological method. Because of the information about spreading pattern of CSD provided optically, the velocity determined by OISI is of smaller deviation and higher accuracy. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

78349256645	Investigating the effects of dimethylsulfoxide on hemodynamics during cortical spreading depression by combining laser speckle imaging with optical intrinsic signal imaging	Background and Objectives: Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an important pathological model to study cerebral ischemia and migraine. In pharmacological studies of CSD, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is an efficient solvent for water-insoluble drugs. Previous studies indicated that DMSO could prevent pial arteriolar dilation induced by oxidants. Therefore, it was very important to study the effect of DMSO on hemodynamics during CSD so that optimization of dose of DMSO as solvent can be made. Study Design/Materials and Methods: DMSO was topically applied on the exposed rat cortex. Single CSD was elicited by controlled injection of KCl. Pial arteriolar diameter, cerebral blood flow, and direct current potential during CSD were monitored by optical intrinsic signal imaging, laser speckle imaging, and electrophysiology method, respectively. Results: Topical application of DMSO (0.1%, 0.4%, 2%, and 4%, v/v) increased arteriolar resting diameter and resting blood velocity at all vascular compartments. In addition, both vasodilation and hyperemic response to CSD were attenuated by DMSO in a dose-dependent manner at doses from 0.1% to 4%. In contrast, the maximum value of blood velocity during CSD was not significantly affected by DMSO. Conclusion: The attenuation in hemodynamic response during CSD could possibly be caused by increased baseline value of vessel tone and blood velocity. Our findings suggest that when investigators use DMSO to dissolve water-insoluble, topically applied drugs in the hemodynamic study of CSD, dose of DMSO should be kept below 0.1% in order to avoid false results.

78649658700	Effects of flux tube integrated conductivity and its zonal gradient on the generalized R-T instability	With the technology of integrating along flux tube, the description of linear growth rate of R-T instability are presented considering the background conductivities and their spatial gradients based on the quality and the charge conservation equations. Effects of the E-region Pedersen conductivity and its spatial gradients on R-T instability linear evolvement are analyzed and estimated. The results show that, the ratio of F-region integrated Pedersen conductivity and the sum of E- and F-region integrated Pedersen conductivity has a significant correlation with the linear growth rate; finite E-region Pedersen conductivity could significantly restrain the generation and development of F-region irregularities. The zonal gradient of flux tube integrated Pedersen conductivity could make the linear growth rate decrease about 35% or more, implying that it is an important factor to control the generation and development of the ionospheric irregularities. © 2010 by Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Radio Science.

We found that with the absence of electric field, the density disturbance can evolve into plasma bubbles only in equatorial region which rise beyond the height of maximal electron density in F layer, while eastward electric field is necessary for bubble evolution at low and mid-latitudes. The fact that the necessary eastward electric field tends to become larger for the higher latitudes indicts that, the predominant plasma instabilities mechanisms are different between the equatorial and the low and mid-latitudinal ionosphere. © 2010 by Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Radio Science.

80052072014	Two-dimensional visualization of the propagation speed of cortical spreading depression in rat cortex	Cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is a significant pathological phenomenon that correlates with migraines and cerebral ischemia, has been characterized by a wave of depolarization among neuronal cells and propagates across the cortex at a rate of 25 mm/min. Although the propagation pattern of CSD was well-investigated using high-resolution optical imaging technique, the variation of propagation speed of CSD across different regions of cortex was not well-concerned, partially because of the lack of ideal approach to visualize two-dimensional distribution of propagation speed of CSD over the whole imaged cortex. Here, we have presented a method to compute automatically the propagation speed of CSD throughout every spots in the imaged cortex. In this method, temporal clustering analysis (TCA) and least square estimation (LSE) were first used to detect origin site where CSD was induced. Taking the origin site of CSD as the origin of coordinates, the data matrix of each image was transformed into the corresponding points based on the polar-coordinate representation. Then, two fixed-distance regions of interest (ROIs) are sliding along with the radial coordinate at each polar angle within the image for calculating the time lag with correlating algorithm. Finally, we could draw a two-dimensional image, in which the value of each pixel represented the velocity of CSD when it spread through the corresponding area of the imaged cortex. The results demonstrated that the method can reveal the heterogeneity of propagation speed of CSD in the imaged cortex with high fidelity and intuition. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

80052086623	Effects of NAAG and MPEP on rat cortical spreading depression	Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a pathophysiological phenomenon. There are sufficient evidences to prove that CSD plays an important role in some neurological disorders. However, exact mechanisms of its initiation and propagation are still unclear. Previous studies showed that glutamate receptors could be concerned with CSD, but those studies were mostly performed oriented to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). There is relatively little report about effects of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on CSD. Here, we applied optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) combined with direct current (DC) potential recording to examine influences of some mGluRs antagonist (or agonist) on CSD propagation in rat's brain, to indirectly validate actions of some mGluRs on CSD. We found that N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate (NAAG, an agonist at mGluR3) inhibited the propagation of CSD, and the inhibition was gradually developed with time. However, 6-methyl-2-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP, an antagonist of mGluR5) did not produce any significant alterations with the CSD propagation. Our findings suggest that mGluR3 could play an important role in the CSD propagation, but the activity of mGluR5 was comparatively weak. These findings can help to understand the propagation mechanism of CSD, and consider the therapy of some neurological diseases involved with CSD. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

80051707858	Simultaneous automatic arteries-veins separation and cerebral blood flow imaging with single-wavelength laser speckle imaging	Automatic separation of arteries and veins in optical cerebral cortex images is important in clinical practice and preclinical study. In this paper, a simple but effective automatic artery-vein separation method which utilizes single-wavelength coherent illumination is presented. This method is based on the relative temporal minimum reflectance analysis of laser speckle images. The validation is demonstrated with both theoretic simulations and experimental results applied to the rat cortex. Moreover, this method can be combined with laser speckle contrast analysis so that the artery-vein separation and blood flow imaging can be simultaneously obtained using the same raw laser speckle images data to enable more accurate analysis of changes of cerebral blood flow within different tissue compartments during functional activation, disease dynamic, and neurosurgery, which may broaden the applications of laser speckle imaging in biology and medicine. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

80051767041	Tracing collateral circulation after ischemia in rat cortex by laser speckle imaging	The collateral circulation is crucial for the pathophysiology and outcome of acute cortical ischemia. Current understanding of collateral circulation still remains sparse, largely due to prior limitations of spatial or/and temporal resolution in methods to evaluate these diminutive redistributive routes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) especially in leptomeningeal anastomoses that connected cortical arteries. In the study, based on a mini-stroke model, laser speckle imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution was used to assess the dynamic evolution of the collateral circulation around a mini-ischemia in the rat cortex. We found that the blood flow and diameter in the intra-arterial anastomoses were enhanced immediately after the ligation of one branch of middle cerebral artery and recovered to baseline level as arterial recirculation was performed. Whereas the communicative flow-through of the posterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery anastomoses was not significant enough to be determined. This is the evidence that intra-arterial anastomoses were the primary routes to restore blood flow into the ischemic territory during the acute phase of ischemia, and laser speckle imaging method was proven as a powerful tool to be potential for subserving further investigation of the collateral circulation. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84855440034	Correcting the detrimental effects of nonuniform intensity distribution on fiber-transmitting laser speckle imaging of blood flow	Laser speckle spatial contrast analysis (LSSCA) is superior to laser speckle temporal contrast analysis (LSTCA) in monitoring the fast change in blood flow due to its advantage of high temporal resolution. However, the application of LSSCA which is based on spatial statistics may be limited when there is nonuniform intensity distribution such as fiber-transmitting laser speckle imaging. In this study, we present a normalized laser speckle spatial contrast analysis (nLSSCA) to correct the detrimental effects of nonuniform intensity distribution on the spatial statistics. Through numerical simulation and phantom experiments, it is found that just ten frames of dynamic laser speckle images are sufficient for nLSSCA to achieve effective correction. Furthermore, nLSSCA has higher temporal resolution than LSTCA to respond the change in velocity. LSSCA, LSTCA and nLSSCA are all applied in the fiber-transmitting laser speckle imaging system to analyze the change of cortical blood flow (CBF) during cortical spreading depression (CSD) in rat cortex respectively, and the results suggest that nLSSCA can examine the change of CBF more accurately. For these advantages, nLSSCA could be a potential tool for fiber-transmitting/endoscopic laser speckle imaging. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

There have been reports regarding the design of power system considering the wind power forecast, though, very few paper could be found on the operation of power system when wind power forecast are incorporated. In this paper, the performance of the power system incorporating short-term wind power forecast is studied using the field measured data. Energy storage is used to improve the frequency regulation of the system. Due to the power limit of energy storage, variable-structure anti-windup control is applied to ameliorate the performance degradation.

84868555169	A discrete point estimate method for probabilistic load flow based on the measured data of wind power	Probabilistic load flow (PLF) calculation is the first step to evaluate the impact of the integrated wind power to the power system. The wind power is featured with stochastic and variable property and it's hard to fit its distribution characteristics to any common probability distribution function (PDF). However, the traditional methods including Monte Carlo for PLF are all based on the input variable's PDF. In the paper a discrete point estimate (DPE) method for PLF is proposed which is solely based on the measured data of the wind power. The expectation, variance and high-order moments of output stochastic variables can be estimated with the DPE method by 2n+1 times of load flow calculation where n is the number of input stochastic variables. The digital simulation results show that the DPE provides high precision with small computation. The method can also be used to solve other problems considering uncertainty factors with the distribution unknown in the power system. © 2012 IEEE.

84873104636	Transient stability probability evaluation of power system incorporating with wind farm and SMES	Large scale renewable power generation brings great challenges to the power system operation and stabilization. Energy storage is one of the most important technologies to face the challenges. This paper proposes a method for transient stability probability evaluation of power system with wind farm and SMES. Firstly, a modified 11-bus test system with both wind farm and SMES has been implemented. The wind farm is represented as a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). Then a stochastic-based approach to evaluate the probabilistic transient stability index of the power system is presented. Uncertain factors include both sequence of disturbance in power grid and stochastic generation of the wind farm. The spectrums of disturbance in the grid as the fault type, the fault location, the fault clearing time and the automatic reclosing process with their probabilities of occurrence are used to calculate the probability indices. With the proposed method based on Monte-Carlo simulation and bisection method, system stability is "measured". Quantitative relationship of penetration level, SMES coil size and system stability is established. Considering the stability versus coil size to be the production curve, together with the cost function, the coil size is optimized economically.

The reference output power of the battery is determined according to the principle of moving average. The main part of wind power fluctuation is smoothed by the battery, while the remaining component with high frequency is smoothed by the supercapacitor. By assessing the charging and discharging status of the battery, a performance evaluation method with intrinsic operation life measurement and calculation for the HESS control strategy is developed. Based on the actual operation data of a wind farm, the effect of the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter and the time scale of moving average on the operation life of the battery in HESS is analyzed by simulation. Besides, reference values of relevant control parameters are given to prolong the operation life of the battery. Research results provide a theoretical reference to the application of HESS. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

84876326308	Simultaneous detection of hemodynamics, mitochondrial metabolism and light scattering changes during cortical spreading depression in rats based on multi-spectral optical imaging	Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a self-propagating wave of cellular depolarization that plays an important role in the development of cerebral pathology following ischemia or trauma. Optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging has been widely used to investigate CSD. Sources of OIS are complex and related to the changes in brain tissue absorption and scattering. The absorbing chromophores may include oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, cytochromes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Considering only one or part of these elements in studies involving OIS may cause inaccurate results. Thus, we simultaneously calculated changes in HbO, HbR, FAD, cytochrome c, cytochrome aa3 and light scattering during CSD by applying multi-spectral OIS imaging at 450, 470, 500, 530, 550, 570, 600, 630, and 650. nm in the rat brain. We also showed that the hemodynamic changes during CSD may not be correctly estimated if the scattering and other chromophores such as FAD, cytochrome c and cytochrome aa3, are not included in the fitting model of multi-wavelength data analysis. As shown in our results, if considering the changes in scattering and other chromophores in data fitting model, deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) showed a triphasic change while only a monophasic decrease in HbR will be resolved without considering changes in scattering and other chromophores as reported in previous studies. Moreover, our results showed that changes in cytochrome c was tightly related to OIS at 550. nm, cytochrome aa3 was closely related to OIS at 450, 600 and 650. nm, and FAD was closely related to OIS at 450 and 470. nm during CSD. It indicates that if the contribution by these related chromophores is not considered, using OIS at these wavelengths to determine the hemoglobin changes during CSD may lead to inaccurate results. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to develop and display a comprehensive and direct method to evaluate cryofixation's process and quality. Here, we adopt a delicate combination of homemade cryo-imaging system with a rat cardiac arrest model that can control cryofixation time optionally. we successfully evaluate the cryofixation time-related nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence pattern of several coronal sections in rat's brain that suffered from directional funnel cryofixation procedure. Through quantitative analysis of the distribution map of NADH fluorescence, we could obtain a relationship between cryofixation time and well cryofixation volume and then could deduce the cryofixation rates and quality at different time points.

Activation of cortex was carried out by electrical stimulation of the contralateral sciatic nerve with 5Hz, 0.3V pulses (0.5ms) for duration of 2s. The stimulation evoked by a monophasic optical reflectance decrease at cortical parenchyma and arteries sites rapidly after the onset of stimulation, whereas no similar response was observed at vein compartments. The optical signal changes reached 10% of the peak response 0.70±0.32s after stimulation onset and no significant time lag in this 10% start latency time was observed between the response at cortical parenchyma and arteries compartments. The evoked optical reflectance decrease reached the peak (0.25%±0.047%) 2.66±0.61s after the stimulus onset at parenchyma site, 0.40±0.20s earlier (P<0.05) than that at arteries site (0.50%±0.068% 3.06±0.70s). Variable location within the cortical parenchyma and arteries compartment themselves didn't affect the temporal characteristics of the evoked signal significantly. These results suggest that the sciatic nerve stimulation evokes a local blood volume increase at both capillaries (cortical parenchyma) and arterioles rapidly after the stimulus onset but the evoked blood volume increase in capillaries could not be entirely accounted for by the dilation of arterioles.

84892466457	Monitoring Hemodynamic and Metabolic Alterations during Severe Hemorrhagic Shock in Rat Brains	Rationale and Objectives: Our long-term goals are to identify imaging biomarkers for hemorrhagic shock and to understand how the preservation of cerebral microcirculation works. We also seek to understand how the damage occurs to the cerebral hemodynamics and the mitochondrial metabolism during severe hemorrhagic shock. Materials and Methods: We used a multimodal cerebral cortex optical imaging system to obtain 4-hour observations of cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic alterations in exposed rat cortexes during severe hemorrhagic shock. We monitored the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cerebral blood flow (CBF), functional vascular density (FVD), vascular perfusion and diameter, blood oxygenation, and mitochondrial reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) signals. Results: During the rapid bleeding and compensatory stage, cerebral parenchymal circulation was protected by inhibiting the perfusion of dural vessels. During the compensatory stage, although the brain parenchymal CBF and FVD decreased rapidly, the NADH signal did not show a significant increase. During the decompensatory stage, FVD and CBF maintained the same low level and the NADH signal remained unchanged. However, the NADH signal showed a significant increase after the rapid blood infusion. FVD and CBF rebounded to the baseline after the resuscitation and then declined again. Conclusions: We present for the first time simultaneous imaging of cerebral hemodynamics and NADH signals in vivo during the process of hemorrhagic shock. This novel multimodal method demonstrated clearly that severe hemorrhagic shock imparts irreversible tissue damage that is not compensated by the autoregulatory mechanism. Hemodynamic and metabolic signatures including CBF, FVD, and NADH may be further developed to provide sensitive biomarkers for stage transitions in hemorrhagic shock. © 2014 AUR.

84896403847	A preliminary evaluation of the performance of multiple ionospheric models in low- and mid-latitude regions of China in 2010-2011	Ionospheric delay is a dominant error source in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Single-frequency GNSS applications require ionospheric correction of signal delay caused by the charged particles in the earth's ionosphere. The Chinese Beidou system is developing its own ionospheric model for single-frequency users. The number of single-frequency GNSS users and applications is expected to grow fast in the next years in China. Thus, developing an appropriate ionospheric model is crucially important for the Chinese Beidou system and worldwide single-frequency Beidou users. We study the performance of five globally accessible ionospheric models Global Ionospheric Map (GIM), International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), Parameterized Ionospheric Model (PIM), Klobuchar and NeQuick in low- and mid-latitude regions of China under mid-solar activity condition. Generally, all ionospheric models can reproduce the trend of diurnal ionosphere variations. It is found that all the models have better performances in mid-latitude than in low-latitude regions. When all the models are compared to the observed total electron content (TEC) data derived from GIM model, the IRI model (2012 version) has the best agreement with GIM model and the NeQuick has the poorest agreement. The RMS errors of the IRI model using the GIM TEC as reference truth are about 3.0-10.0 TECU in low-latitude regions and 3.0-8.0 TECU in mid-latitude regions, as observed during a period of 1 year with medium level of solar activity. When all the ionospheric models are ingested into single-frequency precise point positioning (PPP) to correct the ionospheric delays in GPS observations, the PIM model performs the best in both low and mid-latitudes in China. In mid-latitude, the daily single-frequency PPP accuracy using PIM model is ~10 cm in horizontal and ~20 cm in up direction. At low-latitude regions, the PPP error using PIM model is 10-20 cm in north, 30-40 cm in east and ~60 cm in up component. The single-frequency PPP solutions indicate that NeQuick model has the lowest accuracy among all the models in both low- and mid-latitude regions of China. This study suggests that the PIM model may be considered for single-frequency GNSS users in China to achieve a good positioning accuracy in both low- and mid-latitude regions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The load shedding losses and the wind curtailment losses were estimated by using the probability density function. And they are taken as two operation risk costs integrated into the generation cost objective function. While fully meeting the unit ramp rate constraints and the network security constraints, the day-ahead generation schedule of conventional units and the up/down spinning reserve capacities were solved simultaneously. The priority list method and the minimum marginal cost based economic dispatch algorithm are used to solve the proposed model. Numerical results of modified IEEE reliability test system show that the proposed model and method are effective. © 2013 IEEE.

84900420499	Indian-ink perfusion based method for reconstructing continuous vascular networks in whole mouse brain	The topology of the cerebral vasculature, which is the energy transport corridor of the brain, can be used to study cerebral circulatory pathways. Limited by the restrictions of the vascular markers and imaging methods, studies on cerebral vascular structure now mainly focus on either observation of the macro vessels in a whole brain or imaging of the micro vessels in a small region. Simultaneous vascular studies of arteries, veins and capillaries have not been achieved in the whole brain of mammals. Here, we have combined the improved gelatin-Indian ink vessel perfusion process with Micro-Optical Sectioning Tomography for imaging the vessel network of an entire mouse brain. With 17 days of work, an integral dataset for the entire cerebral vessels was acquired. The voxel resolution is 0.35×0.4×2.0 μm

84901372813	Day-ahead generation scheduling and spinning reserve decision-making model for power grid containing wind power	A day-ahead generation scheduling and spinning reserve decision-making model is proposed for power system with large-scale wind power. The power outage loss and wind curtailment loss of system are estimated with the probability density functions of random wind power and power loads, which, as the risk cost, are integrated into the objective function of generation cost. The day-ahead generation schedule of each conventional unit and the up/down spinning reserve capacity are calculated with the constraints of unit ramp rate and system security. The priority list method and the economic dispatch algorithm based on the minimum marginal cost are adopted to solve the model. Results of case analysis show that, the proposed model and method are effective.

84901708072	A probabilistic optimal power flow calculation method with latin hypercube sampling	Among the solving methods of probabilistic optimal power flow (P-OPF), Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) combined with random sampling (RS) is widely used due to its high accuracy. In order to further improve that, this paper proposes a way of using Monte Carlo Simulation with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to calculate the consumption of generating cost under many random variables. Numerical results of IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show that the Latin hypercube sampling method provides more accurate performance in dealing with POPF under the condition of a smaller sample size, comparing with random sampling method. Thus the Latin hypercube sampling method can replace the MCS with random sampling as the benchmark method of other algorithms. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84902332712	Risk-constrained coordinative dispatching for large-scale wind-storage system	This paper presents a risk-constrained coordinative dispatch method for energy storage systems in the large-scale wind-storage systems based on stochastic programming and the risk decision theory.The purpose is to figure out the best application mode and optimal dispatch method for large-scale energy storage systems in power systems with high penetration of wind power. The stochastic unit commitment model is re-formulated as a bi-level optimization model, with a deterministic unit commitment model and a reserve risk decision model as its external level and internal level, respectively. Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is adopted to calculate the risk reserves and coordinate the bi-level models. A novel dispatch method used for coordination between wind power, energy storage and conventional thermal units is also proposed. An IEEE 30-bus system with two actual wind farms is used for verification purposes.

84902827085	A two-dimensional optimal technology for constructing wind power time series scenarios	Generating a set of scenarios that represent the stochastic characteristics of the time series of wind farm output is very important for power system planning and running. However, the existing methods for producing wind power time series scenarios are difficulty in selecting effective representing scenarios from hugeness space and the accuracy of the scenarios are not satisfied. In light of this, this paper proposed a two-dimension optimization method to generate daily wind power time series scenarios through vertical and horizontal direction. Representative scenarios of every time period were obtained by reducing the historical daily wind power series in the longitudinal direction. Tabu search algorithm was used to choose a scenario for each time period to form a representative wind power time series scenario. The proposed method can obtain the representative wind power time series scenarios automatically through two-dimension optimization without knowing the probability distribution function of wind power, which is hard to obtain. Based on the wind farm data of Ireland, the reduced scenarios in each time period were proved to have similar statistical characteristics with the history data when comparing the indexes of mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis. The stability and accuracy of the proposed method is verified by a number of cases solved using multi-stage optimal power flow. © 2014 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84903957119	Risk-constrained coordinative dispatching for battery energy storage systems of wind farms	The large amount of wind power integrated will have great impact on the operation and control of the existing power system because of the variability and unpredictability of wind energy. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are expected to mitigate such negative effects as they have great potential for providing energy buffer and additional power regulation capabilities to meet the operation requirements of the system involving high penetration of wind resources. This paper presents a risk-constrained coordinative dispatching method for BESSs of wind farms, in which the energy storage of the wind farm will be utilized for multiple applications at the same time, including day-ahead forecast error compensation and short-term volatility control, as well as systematic thermal efficiency enhancement and congestion management. Proportion of the BESS utilized for different applications will be optimized with a risk-constrained stochastic optimization method. Also, in order to make full advantage of finite energy storage of wind farm, a coordination dispatch method is added to the optimization method. Simulation is carried out based on historical operation data of a real wind farm in Liaoning Province of Northeast China. The Computer simulation results have proven the validity of the system and the approaches designed in the paper. © 2013 IEEE.

84903977399	Analysis and control of stochastic power fluctuations on the tie-line of interconnected power systems	On the tie-line of interconnected power systems, there inevitably exist power fluctuations. Overlarge undulations on tie-lines threaten the stability and security of the system. It is remarkable that when the control areas are larger, the situation becomes more austere. In this paper, based on the practical data of two large interconnected power systems, the stochastic power fluctuations of the tie-line, the only 1000kV AC transmission line in China, are analyzed by frequency-domain methods. It is found that the component with a specific period is prominent in the fluctuations. The cause of this special phenomenon is then explained by analysis of ACE (Area Control Error) real-time adjustments, an important function of AGC (Automatic Generation Control) system. Finally, on the basis of the results above, the paper proposes methods to improve the control effect of tie-lines. © 2013 IEEE.

84905919944	Cerebral hemodynamic change and metabolic alteration in severe hemorrhagic shock	Understanding the biological mechanism and identifying biomarkers of hemorrhagic shock is important for diagnosis and treatment. We aim to use optical imaging to study how the cerebral blood circulation and metabolism change during the progression of severe hemorrhagic shock, especially the decompensatory stage. We used a multi-parameter (blood pressure (BP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), functional vascular density (FVD), blood oxygenation and mitochondrial NADH signal) cerebral cortex optical imaging system to observe brain hemodynamic change and metabolic alteration of rats in vivo for 4 h. Cerebral circulation and mitochondrial metabolism could be well preserved in the compensatory stage but impaired during the decompensatory stage. The changes of brain hemodynamics and metabolism may provide sensitive indicators for various shock stages including the transition from compensatory stage to decompensatory stage. Our novel imaging observations of hemodynamic and metabolic signals in vivo indicated that the rat brains under hemorrhagic shock suffered irreversible damage which could not be compensated by the autoregulation mechanism, probably due to injured mitochondria.

84907096628	Wide-area coordinated optimization control of cluster wind-ESS integrated systems	Energy storage technology has great potential in improving the integration friendliness of intermittent renewable sources by enhancing their controllability and reliability. However, the disordered charge-discharge of independent and decentralized control energy storage systems (ESS) may bring more uncertain problems, which have negative impacts on economic operation of power system. A wide-area coordinated control framework, containing local wind-ESS plants, cluster control center and grid center, was designed for cluster wind-ESS integrated system. Based on ultra-short wind power prediction, the optimal control strategy for local wind-ESS and the wide-area coordinated control method for cluster wind-ESS were proposed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy can make full use of the spatial and time difference of wind-ESS integrated systems, and greatly improve the ESS efficiency and the overall controllability of the system.

84908074920	Multi-objective coordinative dispatch for wind-storage combined systems considering day-ahead generation schedules	This paper proposed a multi-timescale coordinative scheduling method and a coordinative rolling scheduling plan model for large-scale wind-storage combined generation power systems. A two-stage model was adopted to formulate the multi-objective optimization model and carried out the hierarchical coordination of power systems with large-scale wind power integration. The first stage optimization minimized the wind power curtailment and load curtailment with the coordinative scheduling of energy storage systems and conventional thermal units. The second stage optimization was allocation of power generation schedules of different wind farms as well as thermal units. IEEE 30-bus system with three actual wind farms was used for verification purpose. It is shown that the wind curtailment and operation costs are both reduced by adopting the proposed intra-day rolling coordinative scheduling dispatch with ultra-short-term wind forecasts updated more frequently.

84912091090	Generation of wind power time series to fit time-domain characteristics	The generation of wind power time series is important for electric power system planning and decision making. A method to generate a synthetic series of wind power outputs is proposed, considering the state transition, the duration time and the variation features of wind power. The simulation results using the proposed method for 25 wind farms at six different locations in different countries show that the wind power time series generated by the proposed method are able to reflect more comprehensive wind power characteristics than that generated by the conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.

0347593545	Spatiotemporal characteristics of cerebral blood volume changes in rat somatosensory cortex evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation and obtained by optical imaging	The spatiotemporal characteristics of changes in cerebral blood volume associated with neuronal activity were investigated in the hindlimb somatosensory cortex of α-chloralose-urethane anesthetized rats (n = 10) with optical imaging at 570 nm through a thinned skull. Activation of the cortex was carried out by electrical stimulation of the contralateral sciatic nerve with 5-Hz, 0.3-V pulses (0.5 ms) for 2 s. The stimulation evoked a monophasic decrease in optical reflectance at the cortical parenchyma and arterial sites soon after the onset of stimulation, whereas no similar response was observed at vein compartments. The optical signal changes reached 10% of the peak response 0.70±0.32 s after the start of stimulation, and no significant time lag in this 10% start latency time was observed between the response at the cortical parenchyma and artery compartments. The decrease in optical reflectance reached a peak (0.25±0.047%) 2.66±0.61 s after stimulus onset at parenchymal sites, which is 0.40±0.20 s earlier (P<0.05) than that at arterial sites (0.50±0.068% 3.06±0.70 s). Varying the locations within the cortical parenchyma and arterial compartments did not significantly affect the temporal characteristics of the evoked signal. These results suggest that stimulation of the sciatic nerve evokes an increase in local blood volume in both capillaries (cortical parenchyma) and arterioles soon after the onset of a stimulus, but the blood volume increase evoked in capillaries could not be entirely accounted for by the dilation of arterioles. © 2003 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

1342310658	Spatio-temporal characteristics of cerebral blood volume changes in different microvascular compartment evoked by sciatic nerve stimulation in rat somatosensory cortex	The spatio-temporal characteristics of changes in cerebral blood volume associated with neural activity were investigated in the hindlimb somatosensory cortex of α-chloralose/urethan anesthetized rats (n=10) with optical imaging at 570nm through a thinned skull. Activation of cortex was carried out by electrical stimulation of the contralateral sciatic nerve with 5Hz, 0.3V pulses (0.5ms) for duration of 2s. The stimulation evoked a monophasic optical reflectance decrease at cortical parenchyma and arteries sites rapidly after the onset of stimulation, whereas no similar response was observed at vein compartments. The optical signal changes reached 10% of the peak response 0.70 ± 0.32s after stimulation onset and no significant time lag in this 10% start latency time was observed between the response at cortical parenchyma and arteries compartments. The evoked optical reflectance decrease reached the peak (0.25% ± 0.047%) 2.66 ± 0.61s after the stimulus onset at parenchyma site, 0.40 ± 0.20s earlier (P<0.05) than that at arteries site (0.50% ± 0.068% 3.06 ± 0.70s). Variable location within the cortical parenchyma and arteries compartment themselves didn't affect the temporal characteristics of the evoked signal significantly. These results suggest that the sciatic nerve stimulation evokes a local blood volume incrrease at both capillaries (cortical parenchyma) and arterioles rapidly after the stimulus onset but the evoked blood volume increase in capillaries could not be entirely accounted for by the dilation of arterioles.

84925281414	Reactive power optimization considering dynamic reactive power reserves	Traditional reactive power optimization may result in conflicts between power system economic operation and voltage stability. The amount of dynamic reactive power reserves is used as a measure of voltage stability of power system. The effective generator reactive power reserves are calculated to obtain the dynamic reactive power reserves of each voltage control area and the maximum variations in generation under contingency are taken as the required minimal reactive power reserves of each area in this paper. The dynamic reactive power reserves are introduced into the reactive power optimization model as one of multiple objective functions and constraints in order to enhance voltage stability of power system and reduce active power losses while maintaining voltage stability of each area. Numerical tests with IEEE 118-bus system and Liaoning power grid show that the proposed model and method are effective.
