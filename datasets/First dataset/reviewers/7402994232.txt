1542602386	Effect of Bak Foong Pills on enhancing dopamine release from the amygdala of female rats	To investigate whether Bak Foong Pills (BFP), a well-known gynaecological tonic, has a direct effect on the central nervous system, we employed the in vivo electrochemical detection technique, fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), to measure the dopamine release from the mesolimbic structure-amygdala of both male and female rats. The results showed that intracerebroventricular BFP (0.75, 1.5 μg) treatment promoted dopamine release from the amygdala in both female and ovariectomized female rats. The BFP-induced response appeared within 5 min after addition of BFP and lasted for at least 40 min. However, no effect of BFP was observed in male rats for an observed period of up to 60 min. The results suggest that BFP may have gender-specific beneficial effect on dopaminergic functions of the amygdala. © 2003 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

1542650720	Relationship between dopamine and iron contents in the brain of Parkinsonian rats	Using fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), atomic absorption/flame emission spectrophotometry and high performance liquid chromatography for electrochemical detection, we studied the change in iron content in the substantia nigra (SN) of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned Parkinsonian (PD) rats and the toxic effect of intranigral injection of iron on DA neurons. The neuroprotective effect of desferrioxamine mesylate was also observed. The results are as follows. (1) The iron content in SN on the lesioned side of 6-OHDA-lesioned PD rats was about three times as high as that in unstandard PD rats. (2) The iron content in caudate putamen (CPu) on the lesioned side of PD rats was not different from that on the unlesioned side. (3) DA release as well as the content of DA and its metabolites were significantly decreased on the lesioned side of PD rats. (4) In the rats pretreated with intracerebroventricular desferrioxamine mesylate before 6-OHDA injection, the release and content of DA on the lesioned side were not significantly different from those on the unlesioned side.

16644385563	Neuroprotective effects of Bak Foong Pill in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahyrdropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease model mice	Neuroprotective effects of estrogen and estrogen-like chemicals on neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease, have been well established. In the present study, we compared the effects of Bak Foong Pill (BFP), a well-known gynaecological tonic in China, and 17β-estradiol, on dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression patterns in ovariectomized, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahyrdropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model mice, using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MPTP, a specific dopaminergic neurotoxin, significantly decreased DAT and TH mRNA levels in the striatum, midbrain and cerebellum, but not the cortex, of C57BL/6 mice. However, MPTP-challenge with BFP pretreatment demonstrated reduced neurotoxicity, with DAT and TH mRNA levels either not affected by MPTP or affected to a significantly lesser extent in the midbrain and striatum as compared to the MPTP treated controls. 17β-estradiol treatment prevented MPTP-induced reduction of DAT expression in striatum and midbrain, but failed to alter TH expression. These results suggest that BFP is able to protect dopaminergic neurons against MPTP-induced neuronal damage in a mechanism that is different from the protective effect of estrogen. © 2004 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

1842832409	Differential role of estrogen in dopamine metabolism in the amygdala and striatum of female rats	To study the effects of estrogen on the contents of dopamine ( DA) and its metabolites in the amygdala (Amy) and striatum (Str) of rats, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to measure the contents of DA and its metabolites in untreated ovariectomized (OVX) rats and OVX rats treated with estrogen. The contents of DA and its metabolites in Amy but not Str were significantly higher when the OVX rats were treated with a high dose of estradiol benzoate (EB). The turnover rate of DA in Amy of the OVX rats was lower than that of normal and EB-treated OVX rats. The turnover rate of DA in Amy was about twice as high as in the Str, while the content of DA in Amy was only one-sixth of that in the Str. The results obtained imply that serum concentration of estrogen is one of the important factors which affect the DA metabolism and content in the Amy of female rats, while the Str is not influenced by estrogen.

19444371487	C31 enhances voltage-gated calcium channel currents in undifferentiated PC12 cells	C31, consisting of 31 amino acid residues, is generated from the carboxyl terminal fragments (CTFs) of amyloid precursor protein (APP). It has been shown that C31 causes apoptosis in neurons and is present in brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, we investigated effects of C31 on voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) currents and the protective effects of β-estradiol on PC12 cells. The results demonstrated that C31 induced a significant increase of the VGCC currents in PC12 cells, which was blocked by β-estradiol. These results suggest that modulation of intracellular calcium levels by VGCC may in part be involved in C31 induced neuronal death associated with AD. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

0030788257	Sex differences in amygdaloid dopamine release following electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area: An in vivo voltammetric study	Using fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), the DA release (or efflux) from the central amygdaloid nucleus (CAN) evoked by electric stimulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) was studied in the male and female rats in order to find the possible existence of sex differences. DA release was significantly dependent upon the stimulating intensity, number of pulses and frequency. DA release reached a maximum at frequencies between 60 and 80 Hz and decreased thereafter. Maximum release in the CAN of female rats (2.60±0.98 μmol/L) was significantly higher than that in the male (0.464±0.06 μmol/L) rats (P<0.05). The differences between the sexes suggest that DA release in the CAN may be influenced by the female hormone, estrogen.

0032437016	Pharmacological characterisation of dopamine overflow in the striatum of the normal and MPTP-treated common marmoset, studied in vivo using fast cyclic voltammetry, nomifensine and sulpiride	The in vivo measurement of electrically-evoked dopamine overflow was measured for the first time in the striatum of control and 1-methyl-4- phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated common marmosets using fast cyclic voltammetry at untreated carbonfibre microelectrodes, (7 μm, o.d.). The identity of dopamine was confirmed using electrochemical, pharmacological and histological criteria and complied with rat data from earlier studies. Dopamine overflow depended on the intensity, number of pulses, and frequency of the applied stimuli. Maximum dopamine overflow occurred using 1.0-2.0 mA, 200 μs pulse width, 150-200 pulses at 80-120 Hz stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. Evoked dopamine overflow in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine-treated marmosets showed a similar electrochemical and pharmacological profile compared to healthy controls, albeit the concentration detected was significantly reduced. The catecholamine uptake blocker, nomifensine, significantly increased the dopamine signal in control marmosets. However, in contrast, nomifensine had no significant effect on evoked dopamine overflow in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- treated marmosets. Apart from demonstrating that fast cyclic voltammetry with electrical stimulation can be reliably used to monitor dopamine overflow within the primate brain, our results describe for the first time the technical prerequisites for the fast cyclic voltammetric technique in the non-human primate brain.

24644480905	Treatment with nerve growth factor decreases expression of divalent metal transporter 1 and transferrin receptor in PC12 cells	Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and transferrin receptor (TfR) might play a key role in non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) and transferrin-bound iron (Tf-Fe) uptake by neuronal cells. Recent studies demonstrated that nerve growth factor (NGF)-treated PC12 cells (the neuronal phenotype) have higher NTBI as well as Tf-Fe uptake compared with untreated cells (the undifferentiated cells). We speculated the increased NTBI and Tf-Fe uptake induced by NGF treatment might be associated with the increased expression of DMT1 and TfR. In this study, we investigated the effect of NGF treatment on DMT1 and TfR expression in PC12 cells. Contrary to our expectation, treatment with NGF induced a significant decrease rather than increase in DMT1+IRE, DMT1-IRE and TfR expression in the cells. The data demonstrate that the increase in iron uptake is not associated with the DMT1 and TfR in NGF-treated PC12 cells. The RT-PCR findings of no change in DMT1 mRNA plus our data suggest that regulation of DMT1 expression by NGF might be at the post-transcriptional level. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33749506725	Neuroprotective effects of iron chelator Desferal on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of rats with iron-overload	The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the iron chelator Desferal prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) induced by iron-overload in rats. Using fast cyclic voltammetry, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' iron staining, and high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection, we measured the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the SN of rats overloaded with iron dextran and assessed the effects of treatment with Desferal. The results showed that iron dextran overload increased the iron content in the SN, decreased dopamine release and content, and reduced the numbers of TH-immunoreactive neurons. Treatment with Desferal prevented the increased iron content in the SN. As a result, dopamine release and content remained at almost normal levels, while the numbers of TH-immunoreactive neurons remained at control values. This study suggests that the iron chelator Desferal is neuroprotective against iron-overload, so iron chelators that can cross the blood-brain barrier may have the potential to treat cases where abnormal iron accumulation in the brain is associated with the degenerative processes, as in Parkinson's disease. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

34247275313	Electrophysiological and behavioral effects of neurotensin in rat globus pallidus: An in vivo study	The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation. Morphological study has indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum. The present study investigated the effects of activating neurotensin receptor in globus pallidus. In vivo single unit electrophysiological recordings showed that micro-pressure ejection of neurotensin into the globus pallidus increased spontaneous firing of pallidal neurons. The excitatory effect of neurotensin could be mimicked by the C-terminal fragment, neurotensin (8-13), but not by the N-terminal fragment, neurotensin (1-8). Local administration of both the non-selective neurotensin receptor antagonist, SR142948A, and the selective neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist, SR48692, blocked the excitatory effect induced by neurotensin. In the behaving rats, we observed the postural effects of neurotensin in the globus pallidus. Unilateral microinjection of neurotensin into the globus pallidus induced a SR48692-sensitive contralateral dystonic posturing in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration, which could be accounted for by the electrophysiological effect of neurotensin in increasing the firing rate of pallidal neurons. Our in vivo electrophysiological and behavioral findings suggest that pallidal neurotensin receptor plays a role in the basal ganglia motor circuit by mediating an excitation of spontaneous activity in the globus pallidus. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

34249695397	Triptolide upregulates NGF synthesis in rat astrocyte cultures	Triptolide (T10), an extract from the traditional Chinese herb, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF), has been shown to attenuate the rotational behavior induced by d-amphetamine and prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in rat models of Parkinson's disease. To examine if the neuroprotective effect is mediated by its stimulation of production of neurotrophic factors from astrocytes, we investigated the effect of T10 on synthesis and release of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in rat astrocyte cultures. T10 did not affect the synthesis and release of either BDNF or GDNF. However, it significantly increased NGF mRNA expression. It also increased both intracellular NGF and NGF level in culture medium. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of T10 might be mediated, at least in part, via a stimulation of the production and release of NGF in astrocytes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

34250888826	Myricetin reduces 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopamine neuron degeneration in rats	The effects of myricetin on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra-striatum system were investigated. By high-performance liquid chromatography electrochemical detection, we showed that the dopamine content in the striatum decreased after 6-OHDA treatment, which could be restored by myricetin. The immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR studies showed that myricetin could prevent the 6-OHDA-induced decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons and the tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression in the substantia nigra. Perls' iron staining study further demonstrated that myricetin prevented the 6-OHDA-induced increase of iron-staining cells in the substantia nigra. These results suggested that the protective effects of myricetin on the toxicity of 6-OHDA could be attributed to the myricetin-suppressed iron toxicity. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34347251501	Peripheral iron dextran induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nigra	Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra (SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' iron staining, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the SN of iron dextran overloaded animals. The findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in the SN. As a result, dopamine release and content, as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen. Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group. These results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the SN, where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The chronic iron overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute iron overload. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

35848961208	Divalent metal transporter 1 up-regulation is involved in the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced ferrous iron influx	The reasons underlying the high iron content found in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease (PD) are largely unknown. We suppose, based on our previous studies, that the newly discovered iron transporter divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) might be involved in this SN iron accumulation process. To investigate this, we first observed the cellular expression of DMT1 in rat SN, both with the iron response element (+IRE) and without the IRE (-IRE) forms. The results showed that both forms of DMT1 were expressed on neurons, astrocytes, and microglia but not on oligodendrocytes. We further observed the relationship between the increased iron influx and DMT1 expression in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated C6 cells. 6-OHDA (10 μmol/liter) caused a significant increase in ferrous iron influx, with the increased expression of DMT1+IRE, both in protein and in mRNA levels, whereas no change was observed for DMT1-IRE. To clarify further that the increased expression of DMT1 was not due to the increased intracellular iron content, C6 cells were overloaded with ferric ammonium citrate (100 μg/ml). Decreased expression of both forms of DMT1 was observed. Our data suggest that DMT1 is highly expressed in rat SN in a cell-specific manner. Increased DMT1+IRE expression is the mechanism behind ferrous iron influx induced by 6-OHDA treatment in C6 cells. This may give some evidence for the involvement of DMT1 in the iron accumulation in PD. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

38649088871	Neuroprotective effects of genistein on dopaminergic neurons in the mice model of Parkinson's disease	Emerging evidence suggests beneficial effects of estrogen and estrogen-like chemicals on neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease (PD). Genistein, an isoflavone naturally found in soy products, displays estrogenic properties. The present study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of genistein on dopaminergic neurons in ovariectomized (OVX), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice. MPTP significantly decreased the levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum, which could be restored by genistein or estrogen pretreatment. MPTP-challenge with genistein or estrogen pretreatment demonstrated reduced neurotoxicity, with tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) affected to a significantly lesser extent as compared to the MPTP treated control. The reverse transcription-PCR results also confirmed that the MPTP-induced downregulation of TH, dopamine transporter (DAT) and Bcl-2 mRNA expression in the midbrain could be restored by genistein or estrogen pretreatment. These findings provide the first evidence that genistein has neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in the MPTP-induced PD mice and this effect may be attributed to enhancing Bcl-2 gene expression. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

39049145972	Bak Foong protects dopaminergic neurons against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity by its anti-apoptotic activity	Bak Foong pill (BFP) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used for treatment of various gynaecological disorders. In addition, it exerts beneficial effects on other functional systems including the central nervous system. In the present study, we have investigated the possible neuroprotective action of BFP upon the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system by examining its effect on the expression patterns of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahyrdropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model. MPTP significantly decreased TH and DAT mRNA levels in the striatum and midbrain of both female and male C57BL/6 mice. However, with BFP pre-treatment mice showed a reduced neurotoxicity, with TH and DAT mRNA levels either not affected by MPTP or affected to a lesser extent in the midbrain and striatum when compared to vehicle treated animals. Possible anti-apoptotic activity of BFP was further studied in a dopamine-secreting neuroendocrine cell line, PC12. In this assay, MPTP elevated the expression of a pro-apoptotic gene, Bax, while this expression was reduced by BFP pre-treatment. Flow cytometry results also revealed that the effect of MPTP-induced apoptosis in PC12 cell lines was significantly reduced by BFP. The present results suggest that BFP is able to protect dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxin-induced neuronal injury with anti-apoptotic activity being one of the possible mechanisms. © 2007 International Federation for Cell Biology.

3342982890	Increased dopamine release in vivo by estradiol benzoate from the central amygdaloid nucleus of Parkinson's disease model rats	In addition to the dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system, the properties of dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic system, such as the amygdala, are also of interest and importance because of their specific neuromodulatory effects in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Using the fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV) technique, we present evidence to indicate that electrically-evoked dopamine (DA) release from the amygdala, especially the central amygdaloid nucleus (CAN), of ovariectomized (OVX) female rats was significantly enhanced with increasing doses of estradiol benzoate (EB; 30, 50 and 100 μg/kg). Impaired DA release from the amygdala of an OVX rat PD model can also be increased by EB treatment (50 μg/kg) to a level similar to that of controls. The well established neuroprotective effects of estrogen may be beneficial for reducing the dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in mesolimbic structures of rat PD models and PD patients.

34250014148	Ferroportin1 and hephaestin are involved in the nigral iron accumulation of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats	Elevated iron levels in the substantia nigra (SN) participate in neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD). While the mechanisms underlying the increased iron are still unknown, some iron transport proteins may be involved. The nigral iron accumulation could be a result of either increased import or decreased export. The mechanisms of iron import have received considerable attention, but little is known about iron export mechanisms. Ferroportin1 (FP1) and hephaestin (HP), two newly discovered iron export proteins, cooperate in the iron export in the gut. Here, we investigated their expression in the SN of rats lesioned by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Using immunofluorescence, we showed that FP1 and HP were both expressed on astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and neurons in the SN. By immunohistochemistry, we showed that 1 day after 6-OHDA lesion, the expression of the two proteins decreased compared with the control. When rats began showing rotation behaviour induced by apomorphine, usually 6 weeks after 6-OHDA lesion, they are considered PD models. In these PD models, a further decrease in the two proteins was observed. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that the mRNA levels of FP1 and HP decreased 1 day after 6-OHDA lesion compared with the control, and further decrease was also observed in the PD model rats. These results show for the first time that FP1 and HP co-localize in the rat brain, and suggest that decreased expression of these transporters in the SN can account for the increased iron levels. © The Authors (2007).

40949165342	Over-expressed human divalent metal transporter 1 is involved in iron accumulation in MES23.5 cells	Elevated iron accumulation has been reported in brain regions in some neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism for this is largely unknown. Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is an important divalent cation transporter. The aim of the present study is to construct recombinant adenovirus encoding human DMT1 with iron responsive element (DMT1 + IRE) and infect MES23.5 dopaminergic cells in order to investigate the relationship between increased DMT1 + IRE expression and iron accumulation. The human DMT1 gene was obtained by RT-PCR from tissues of human duodenum. AdDMT1 + IRE was successfully constructed and identified by PCR, restriction endonuclease analyses and DNA sequencing, respectively. It was able to efficiently infect MES23.5 cells, which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blots. When incubated with 100 μM ferrous iron for 6 h, the intracellular iron levels dramatically increased in AdDMT1 + IRE infected MES23.5 cells compared to the solely adenovirus infected cells. Meanwhile, the levels of hydroxyl free radicals and malondialdehyde (MDA) in these cells increased. This led to the activation of caspase-3. The apoptosis in AdDMT1 + IRE infected cells was shown with hypercondensed nuclei using Hoechst staining. Analysis of DNA extracted from these cells showed the typical "ladder pattern", indicating the formation of mono- and oligonucleosomes. These results suggested that increased DMT1 + IRE expression in MES23.5 cells caused the increased intracellular iron accumulation. This resulted in the increased oxidative stress leading to ultimate cell apoptosis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

59049094805	Rg1 reduces nigral iron levels of MPTP-treated C57BL6 mice by regulating certain iron transport proteins	Elevated iron levels in the substantia nigra (SN) participate in neuronal death in Parkinson's disease, in which the misregulation of iron transporters such as divalent metal transporter (DMT1) and ferroportin1 (FP1) are involved. Our previous work observed that nigral iron levels were increased in MPTP-treated mice and Ginsenoside Rg1 which is one of the main components of ginseng, had neuroprotective effects against MPTP toxicity. Whether Rg1 could reduce nigral iron levels to protect the dopaminergic neurons? And whether its neuroprotective effect is achieved by regulating certain iron transporters? The present studies showed that Rg1 pre-treatment increased the dopamine and its metabolites contents in the striatum, as well as increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the SN. Further experiments observed that Rg1 pre-treatment substantially attenuated MPTP-elevated iron levels, decreased DMT1 expression and increased FP1 expression in the SN. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of Rg1 on dopaminergic neurons against MPTP is due to the ability to reduce nigral iron levels, which is achieved by regulating the expressions of DMT1 and FP1. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

79951950516	Oxidative stress partially contributes to iron-induced alpha-synuclein aggregation in SK-N-SH cells	Intracellular Lewy body formation is one of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). As its main component, aggregated alpha-synuclein is presented in the substantia nigra, the same region iron accumulation occurs. In this study, the relationship between iron and alpha-synuclein aggregation was investigated. In the remaining cells, 1 mmol/l ferric and ferrous iron could induce cell loss in SK-N-SH cells and alpha-synulein aggregation. Pretreatment with 5 μmol/l vitamin E, a potent intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger could totally abolish ROS formation and cell viability reduction induced by ferric and ferrous iron treatment. However, the intracellular alpha-synuclein aggregation could only be partially alleviated. Due to the predicted iron responsive element (IRE) in the 5'-untranslated region of the human alpha-synuclein mRNA contains, we observed that alpha-synuclein mRNA level was up-regulated in SK-N-SH cells with iron regulatory protein (IRP) knockdown and more alpha-synuclein aggregations were observed in cells. The results suggest that iron-induced intracellular aggregated alpha-synuclein is partially dependent on oxidative stress and iron might also regulate alpha-synuclein aggregation through the IRE/IRP system. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In the present study, effects of L-type Cav1.2 calcium channel on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity were investigated. By the semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies, we showed that the expression of L-type Cav1.2 calcium channel α1 subunit mRNA increased in the substantia nigra (SN) of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Treatment with nifedipine could improve the apomorphine- induced rotation behavior in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Using high-performance liquid chromatography electrochemical detection, we also observed that nifedipine partly restored 6-OHDA-induced dopamine depletion in the striatum of rats. These results suggest that the L-type Cav1.2 calcium channel is associated with the development and progression of dopaminergic neuron degeneration. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

84877077909	Transplantation of mouse CGR8 embryonic stem cells producing GDNF and TH protects against 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity in the rat	Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)-based therapies have been increasingly recognized as a potential tool to replace or support cells and their function damaged by the neurodegenerative process that underlies Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we implanted engineered mouse embryonic stem (ES) CGR8 cells, which stably co-express glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), into striatum (Str) or both Str and substantia nigra (SN) of parkinsonian rats lesioned by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). We found that cell transplantation into Str or both Str and SN rescued behavioral abnormalities and striatal DA depletion associated with 6-OHDA lesion. Our findings suggested that the profound functional impairment in nigrostriatal circuitry could be at least partially restored by ESCs-based expression of TH and GDNF, which may be developed into a useful tool for PD therapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84897536764	Unexpected improvements of spatial learning and memory abilities in chronic rotenone intoxicated mice	The liposoluble insecticide rotenone is commonly used as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor to replicate Parkinson's disease (PD) pathological features. However, there was no assessment of the spatial learning and memory abilities in chronic rotenone-induced PD models. In the present study, by rotarod test and Thioflavine T staining, we first noted the impairment of motor coordination in rotenone-treated group for 3 months, as well as alpha-synuclein inclusions in the nigral dopaminergic neurons in C57BL/6 mice with intragastrical delivery of rotenone (5 mg/Kg) for 3 months rather than 1 month. We then evaluated spatial learning and memory abilities by Morris water maze task in this model. The results showed escape latency reduced in rotenone-intoxicated mice for 3 months, indicating an improvement of learning ability. However, it was delayed slightly but not significantly in rotenone-intoxicated mice for 1 month. Similarly, we demonstrated that spatial memory ability was enhanced in 3-month-treatment group, but impaired in 1-month-treatment group. There were no proliferating cell nuclear antigen and doublecortin positive cells in the hippocampus by double immunofluorescent staining, indicating the absence of hippocampal neurogenesis in rotenone-intoxicated mice. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory abilities are disturbed in chronic rotenone-intoxicated PD model. © 2014 Jia et al.

44349168830	Mitochondria dysfunction was involved in copper-induced toxicity in MES23.5 cells	Objective: To investigate the toxicity of copper on MES23.5 dopaminergic cells and the probable mechanisms involved in this process. Methods: MES23.5 dopaminergic cells were selected as our experimental model. [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay was used to detect the influence of copper on the cell viability. The semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and the high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) have been used to detect the tyrosine hydroxlase (TH) mRNA and protein expression and the dopamine content in MES23.5 cells. The flow cytometry have been used to detect the changes of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Results: 100 and 200 μmol/L copper had no effect on the MES23.5 cell viability, whereas 400 and 800 μmol/L of copper could decrease the cell viability (P < 0.01). Treating cells with 200 μmol/L copper for 24 h decreased the TH mRNA expression, the TH expression and the dopamine content compared with the control (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). Besides, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential also decreased with the treatment of 200 μmol/L copper for 24 h (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Copper could exert the toxic effects on MES23.5 dopaminergic cells and decrease the cell function. The dysfunction of mitochondria may be the mechanism of this toxicity effect. © 2008 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

47349087292	Ghrelin antagonizes MPTP-induced neurotoxicity to the dopaminergic neurons in mouse substantia nigra	Ghrelin, a stomach-derived hormone which induces growth hormone release and promotes positive energy balance, has been reported to inhibit cell apoptosis in endotheliocytes, osteoblasts and cardiocytes. Recent evidence has shown that ghrelin can also inhibit neuronal apoptosis of the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. However, little is known about the effects of ghrelin on the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) neurons in which ghrelin's receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a, is highly expressed. In the present study, we investigated whether ghrelin could protect nigral dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in mice. We observed that ghrelin, acting through GHS-R 1a, inhibited MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss in the SNpc as well as dopamine depletion in the striatum. Ghrelin could also reverse the down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, up-regulated the expression of Bax, and caspase-3 activation caused by MPTP. This study demonstrated that ghrelin might be a potential protector of dopaminergic neurons in a therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

56649095794	Triptolide inhibits amyloid-β1-42-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production in cultured rat microglia	Microglia plays an important role in mediating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intervention in microglia activation may exert a neuroprotective effect. In the present study, we reported that oligomeric Aβ1-42 dramatically increased the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β compared to monomeric and fibrillar Aβ1-42 in rat microglial cultures. Pretreatment of the cultures with triptolide, an anti-inflammatory reagent, alleviated the elevation of TNF-α and IL-1β level induced by oligomeric Aβ1-42. Our results showed that oligomeric Aβ played an important role in mediating neuroinflammation and triptolide was able to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia. © 2008.

63349093768	Expression and function of DMT1 without IRE in C6 cells mediated by recombinant adenovirus	Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a ferrous iron import protein. The improper expression of DMT1 is involved in neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing the gene of DMT1 without the iron response element (DMT1-IRE) and investigated its expression and function in the C6 glioma cell line. The DMT1-IRE gene, obtained by RT-PCR, was cloned into the shuttle plasmiding pAdTrack-CMV containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. Linearized plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-DMT1-IRE was subsequently co-transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) BJ5183 cells along with an adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1 after digestion with Pme I. PacI-digested pAdEasy1-DMT1-IRE was then transfected into E1-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cells), in which recombinant adenoviruses were generated within 7 to 10 days. The results demonstrated that we obtained the DMT1-IRE gene. pAdEasy1-DMT1-IRE yielded a large fragment, plus a smaller fragment of 4.5 kb after digestion with Pac I. PCR confirmed pAdEasy1-DMT1-IRE contained gene DMT1-IRE, indicating the successful construction of recombinant adenovirus plasmid containing DMT1-IRE. GFP fluorescence further confirmed the generation of recombinant AdDMT1-IRE adenovirus. AdDMT1-IRE could efficiently infect C6 glioma cells. And cell viability decreased in AdDMT1-IRE infected cells after iron overload compared to the control. These results suggest that the over expressed DMT1-IRE can aggravate the iron induced cell death due to its iron influx function. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.

62849084862	Potassium channels are involved in zinc-induced apoptosis in MES23.5 cells	There is evidence that zinc may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease by an apoptotic pathway. However, the mechanisms underlying zinc-induced apoptosis are unknown. Previous studies showed that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-enhanced potassium channels are involved in apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons. Our study was designed to test whether zinc-induced apoptosis was mediated by potassium channels. First we demonstrated cell apoptosis with zinc treatment by Hoechst staining assay. The results showed that 13.38% ± 0.6% of MES23.5 cells were apoptotic after 24 hr of incubation with 60 μM zinc sulfate. Then we observed that the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein expression and the dopamine content decreased, as detected by Western blots and high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). We further elucidated the mechanism of cell apoptosis by using whole-cell patch clamp recording. The data demonstrated that MES23.5 cells exhibited a tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive outward K

65549127731	Ginsenoside Rg1 protects against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells via IGF-I receptor and estrogen receptor pathways	Our previous studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg1 is a novel class of potent phytoestrogen and can mimic the action of estradiol in stimulation of MCF-7 cell growth by the crosstalk between insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)-dependent pathway and estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathway. The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and the possible mechanisms. Pre-treatment with ginsenoside Rg1 resulted in an enhancement of survival, and significant rescue occurred at the concentration of 0.01 μM on cell viability against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. These effects could be completely blocked by IGF-IR antagonist JB-1 or ER antagonist ICI 182780. 6-OHDA arrested the cells at G

65649105139	Curcumin attenuates 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cytotoxicity by anti-oxidation and nuclear factor-kappaB modulation in MES23.5 cells	Oxidative stress has been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients, and several anti-oxidants have been shown to be effective on the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Curcumin has been previously reported to possess radical scavenger, iron chelating, anti-inflammatory properties in different tissues. The aim of present study is to explore the cytoprotection of curcumin against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neuronal death, as well as the underlying mechanisms in MES23.5 cells. Our results showed that 6-OHDA significantly reduced the cell viability of MES23.5 cells. Curcumin protected MES23.5 cells against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity by partially restoring the mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing the level of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and suppressing an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, curcumin pretreatment significantly inhibited 6-OHDA induced nuclear factor-kappaB translocation. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of curcumin are attributed to the antioxidative properties and the modulation of nuclear factor-kappaB translocation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

0035083853	Effect of cholecystokinin-8 microinjection into ventral tegmental area on dopamine release in nucleus accumbens of rats: An in vivo voltammetric study	1. Effects of microinjection of cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) into the rat ventral tegmental area were studied on dopamine (DA) release from nucleus accumbens (Acb), using fast cyclic voltammetry and carbon fibre microelectrode. 2. DA release was evoked by electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). DA release from Acb was increased with increasing intensity or frequency of electrical stimulation in a dose-dependent manner and was inhibited by microinjection of CCK-8 (0.5 μg/kg) into the ventral tegmental area. 3. The release of DA was clearly reduced at all the intensities (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0mA) tested following CCK injection into the VTA, which was statistically significant (P<0.05). But the reduced percentage of DA release did not show significant changes between the data obtained with stimuli of different intensities (P>0.05). 4. While no change could be found with the stimuli of 10Hz, the DA release was significantly suppressed by injection of CCK-8 at the other three frequencies tested (50Hz, 100Hz and 250Hz). Furthermore, although the differences in the reduced amounts of DA release obtained at 50 Hz, 100 Hz and 250 Hz were statistically significant, the reduced percentage seemed to be not closely related to the frequency applied (P>0.05). 5. These results indicate that CCK-8 is involved in the regulation of midbrain DA neurotransmission, and thereby implicated in disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, that involve malfunctions of the basal ganglion DA neuronal systems.

72149127646	Ginsenoside Rg1 protects against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in MES23.5 cells via Akt and ERK signaling pathways	Aim of the study: The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rg1 against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced toxicity in MES23.5 cells and their possible mechanisms. Materials and methods: MES23.5 cells were treated with or without Rg1 for 24 h before exposure to 6-OHDA. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay. The gene and protein expressions of Bcl-2 were detected by real time RT-PCR and western blotting. Phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 were examined by western blotting. Results: Pretreatment with ginsenoside Rg1 had obvious neuroprotective effects on cell viability against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. 6-OHDA decreased the gene and protein expressions of Bcl-2. These effects could be reversed by Rg1 pretreatment. Potential cell signaling candidates involved in this neuroprotective effect were examined. 6-OHDA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MES23.5 cells. Pretreatment with ginsenoside Rg1 could increase the Akt phosphorylation and inhibit the ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by 6-OHDA. Further study revealed that LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), attenuated the neuroprotective effect of Rg1 on cell viability against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. Conclusions: Taken together, our results strongly suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 has neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in MES23.5 cells. Its mechanism includes the up-regulation of Bcl-2 gene expression, the activation of Akt phoshphorylation as well as the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by 6-OHDA. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

72649090521	Ferroportin 1 but not hephaestin contributes to iron accumulation in a cell model of Parkinson's disease	Iron-induced oxidative stress is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Based on our previous in vivo experiments showing that down-regulation of the iron transporters ferroportin 1 (FP1) and hephaestin (HP) might account for the nigral iron accumulation in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned animal models, in this study we investigated whether FP1 and HP were involved in cellular iron accumulation and the underlying mechanisms in a cell model of PD. The findings showed that 6-OHDA induced FP1 and HP down-regulation, followed by decreased iron efflux and iron accumulation in primary ventral mesencephalic neurons and MES23.5 dopaminergic cells. Silencing of FP1 but not HP led to increased iron levels and aggravated reactive oxygen species generation in MES23.5 cells. Under iron-overloaded conditions, FP1 showed dose-dependent up-regulation, whereas HP showed no response, indicating their down-regulation was not due to the increased intracellular iron content. In 6-OHDA-treated cells, both iron-regulatory protein (IRP) 1 and IRP2 were up-regulated, and silencing of IRPs in MES23.5 cells dramatically blocked 6-OHDA-induced FP1 down-regulation and reversed HP down-regulation. These results suggest that FP1 but not HP contributes to 6-OHDA-induced intracellular iron accumulation, and down-regulation of FP1 and HP by 6-OHDA is IRPs-dependent. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

74149086090	Rosmarinic acid inhibits 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity by anti-oxidation in MES23.5 cells	Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound. It is found in several herbs in the Lamiaceae family, such as Perilla frutescens. RA has been reported to exert anti-oxidative effects on rat erythrocyte, liver, and kidney cells. However, little is known about the effects of RA on dopaminergic cells. In the present study, we investigated whether RA could protect MES23.5 dopaminergic cells from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity. The results showed that RA pretreatment significantly prevented 6-OHDA-induced cell viability reduction. Further experiments demonstrated that 6-OHDA induced intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and decreased the mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm). These effects could be partially reversed by RA pretreatment. However, RA had no direct chemical reaction with 6-OHDA extracellularly in a cell-free system. Taken together, these results suggest that RA could exert its protective effects against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity through its anti-oxidation properties. Thus, we propose that RA should be viewed as a potential chemotherapeutic in Parkinson's disease patients. © Humana Press 2009.

77949261597	Up-regulation of divalent metal transporter 1 in 6-hydroxydopamine intoxication is IRE/IRP dependent	Iron plays a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Increased iron content of the substantia nigra (SN) has been found in PD patients, and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) has been shown to be up-regulated in the SN of both MPTP-induced PD models and PD patients. However, the mechanisms underlying DMT1 up-regulation are largely unknown. In the present study, we observed that in the SN of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats, DMT1 with the iron responsive element (IRE, DMT1+IRE), but not DMT1 without IRE (DMT1IRE), was up-regulated, suggesting that increased DMT1+IRE expression might account for nigral iron accumulation in PD rats. This possibility was further assessed in an in vitro study using 6-OHDA-treated and DMT1+IRE-over-expressing MES23.5 cells. In 6-OHDA-treated MES23.5 cells, increased iron regulatory protein (IRP) 1 and IRP2 expression was observed, while silencing of IRPs dramatically diminished 6-OHDA-induced DMT1+IRE up-regulation. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine fully suppressed IRPs up-regulation by inhibition of 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress. Increased DMT1+IRE expression resulted in increased iron influx by MES23.5 cells. Our data provide direct evidence that DMT1+IRE up-regulation can account for IRE/IRP-dependent 6-OHDA-induced iron accumulation initiated by 6-OHDA-induced intracellular oxidative stress and that increased levels of intracellular iron result in aggravated oxidative stress. The results of this study provide novel evidence supporting the use of anti-oxidants in the treatment of PD, with the goal of inhibiting iron accumulation by regulation of DMT1 expression. © 2010 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

77954998621	Ferroportin1 and hephaestin overexpression attenuate iron-induced oxidative stress in MES23.5 dopaminergic cells	Elevated iron was found in the substantia nigra (SN) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Our previous in vivo experiments suggested that decreased ferroportin1 (FPN1) and hephaestin (HP) expression might account for the cellular iron accumulation and resulting dopaminergic neurons loss in the SN of PD animal models. In the present study, we investigated whether increased FPN1 and/or HP expression could attenuate iron-induced oxidative stress in the dopaminergic MES23.5 cell line. We generated MES23.5 cells with stable overexpression of FPN1 and/or HP. Our study showed that overexpression of FPN1 and/or HP increased iron efflux, lowered cellular iron level, suppressed reactive oxygen species production, and restored mitochondrial transmembrane potential, similar to the effects seen for the iron chelator deferoxamine. These results suggest that FPN1 and/or HP might directly contribute to iron efflux process from neurons in conditions of overexpression, thus prevent cellular iron accumulation and eventually protect cells from iron-induced oxidative stress. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods: The full-length human GHS-R1a gene was obtained by PCR amplification and then cloned into the shuttle plasmid pAdTrack-CMV. The linearized plasmid pAdTrack-CMV-GHS-R1a was co-transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) BJ5183 cells along with an adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy1. The HEK293 cells were then infected with adenoviruses. The expression of GHS-R1a was indicated by green fluorescent protein (GFP), and confirmed by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Results: Enzymatic digestion of pAdGHS-R1a yielded a large fragment (approximately 30 kb) and a small fragment (4.5 kb), indicating the successful construction of recombinant adenovirus expression vector. Expression of GFP was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy at 24 h after infection. RT-PCR and Western blot further confirmed that GHS-R1a was efficiently expressed in 293 cells. Conclusion: Recombinant adenovirus (AdGHS-R1a) is successfully constructed, and the target gene can be expressed efficiently in 293 cells, which provide a valuable tool for further studying the function of GHS-R1a. © 2010 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77955978437	Dose- and time-dependent α-synuclein aggregation induced by ferric iron in SK-N-SH cells	Objective: Intracellular formation of Lewy body (LB) is one of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. The main component of LB is aggregated α-synuclein, present in the substantia nigra where iron accumulation also occurs. The present study was aimed to study the relationship between iron and α-synuclein aggregation. Methods: SK-N-SH cells were treated with different concentrations of ferric iron for 24 h or 48 h. MTT assay was conducted to determine the cell viability. Thioflavine S staining was used to detect α-synuclein aggregation. Results: With the increase of iron concentration, the cell viability decreased significantly. At the concentrations of 5 mmol/L and 10 mmol/L, iron induced α-synuclein aggregation more severely than at the concentration of 1 mmol/L. Besides, 48-h treatment-induced aggregation was more severe than that induced by 24-h treatment, at the corresponding iron concentrations. Conclusion: Ferric iron can induce α-synuclein aggregation, which is toxic to the cells, in a dose- and time-dependent way. © 2010 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

78649782421	Rg1 protects iron-induced neurotoxicity through antioxidant and iron regulatory proteins in 6-OHDA-treated MES23.5 cells	Ginsenoside-Rg1 is one of the pharmacologically active components isolated from ginseng. It was reported that Rg1 protected dopamine (DA) neurons in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) models in vivo and in vitro. Our previous study also demonstrated that iron accumulation was involved in the toxicity of 6-OHDA. However, whether Rg1 could protect DA neurons against 6-OHDA toxicity by modulating iron accumulation and iron-induced oxidative stress is not clear. Therefore, the present study was carried out to elucidate this effect in 6-OHDA-treated MES23.5 cells and the possible mechanisms were also conducted. Findings showed Rg1 restored iron-induced decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential in MES23.5 cells, and increased ferrous iron influx was found in 6-OHDA-treated cells. Rg1 pretreatment could decrease this iron influx by inhibiting 6-OHDA-induced up-regulation of an iron importer protein divalent metal transporter 1 with iron responsive element (DMT1 + IRE). Furthermore, findings also showed that the effect of Rg1 on DMT1 + IRE expression was due to its inhibition of iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) by its antioxidant effect. These results suggested that the neuroprotective effect of Rg1 against iron toxicity in 6-OHDA-treated cells was to decrease the cellular iron accumulation and attenuate the improper up-regulation of DMT1 + IRE via IRE/IRP system. This provides new insight to understand the pharmacological effects of Rg1 on iron-induced degeneration of DA neurons. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0035955480	Effects of isatin on rotational behavior and DA levels in caudate putamen in Parkinsonian rats	Isatin was a potent endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor that is more active against MAO-B than MAO-A. The acute effects of isatin on apomorphine (APO)-induced rotations were evaluated in Parkinsonian rats induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion. Furthermore, the effects of isatin on DA release in caudate putamen (CPu) of model and normal rats were monitored using fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV). The contents of monoamine transmitters and their metabolites in CPu of model and normal rats were also analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection after administration of isatin. Here we show that isatin (100 mg/kg, i.p.) apparently inhibited APO-induced rotations of Parkinsonian rats to 39.1±3.7% of the control (n=12), while it had no apparent effects on electrical stimuli-induced DA release either in normal rats or in model rats. In addition, the content of 5-hydroxytryptamine but not DA was increased in both normal rats and model rats after isatin (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered (P<0.01, n=6). The content of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid was not changed. These results suggest that isatin cannot increase DA levels in rat CPu. Therefore, the effects of isatin on APO-induced rotations of our Parkinsonian rats could not attribute to its inhibition of DA catabolism as a MAO inhibitor. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

79961207947	DMT1 polymorphism and risk of Parkinson's disease	Growing evidence suggests that iron accumulation in the substantia nigra (SN) is involved in the pathology of Parkinson's diseases (PD). Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is an endogenous transporter for ferrous iron, the levels of which are significantly increased in the SN in postmortem PD brains. To study the possible association of DMT1 gene with PD occurrence, one mutation (1303C/A) and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (1254T/C and IVS4 + 44C/A) in DMT1 gene were investigated in 192 PD patients in a Han Chinese population and 193 healthy controls by method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Direct sequencing was performed in 10% of the samples to validate the genotyping results. Our results failed to find any significant association between the tested genotypes, alleles or mutation and PD, however, a haplotype (C alleles of 1254T and IVS4 + 44C/A polymorphisms) occurred at greater frequencies in PD subjects compared with that of control (18.2% versus 11.4%, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.15-2.59, P = 0.01). These results suggest that CC haplotype in DMT1 gene is a possible risk factor for PD in this Han Chinese population. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84859753314	Neurorescue effect of rosmarinic acid on 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned nigral dopamine neurons in rat model of Parkinson's disease	Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound. It has been reported that RA possessed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our previous study showed that RA could protect MES23.5 dopaminergic cells against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. The purpose of this study was to explore the neuroreparative (neurorescue) effect of RA on 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo. In this study, the rats were given RA orally after intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesion. Results showed that the dopamine content in the striatum decreased and the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons reduced after 6-OHDA treatment. RA treatment after 6-OHDA administration could restore these changes. Further studies demonstrated that 6-OHDA treatment increased the iron-staining positive cells, which were markedly decreased by RA treatment. Moreover, RA suppressed the increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 at gene level induced by 6-OHDA. This indicates that the neurorescue effects of RA against 6-ODHA-induced degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system were achieved by decreasing nigral iron levels and regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax gene expression. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84863008910	High hepcidin level accounts for the nigral iron accumulation in acute peripheral iron intoxication rats	Hepcidin is considered to be a circulatory hormone and a major mechanism regulating iron homeostasis. Our previous publication revealed that acute iron intoxication induced iron deposit and dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra (SN) of a rat model. However, whether and how hepcidin functions in this nigral iron accumulation has not been elucidated. In the present study, we observed a decreased of FPN1 protein level in the SN triggered by peripheral iron overload within 4. h, which correlated with a high hepcidin level. To further investigate the role of intracellular hepcidin under iron overload circumstances, we assessed the expression of hepcidin mRNA and FPN1 protein in vitro. We observed that hepcidin mRNA level was up-regulated and FPN1 protein level was down-regulated in MES23.5 dopaminergic cells in a period of 4. h incubation with iron. Both in pCMV-XL4-hepcidin transfected and hepcidin-treated cells, decreased FPN1 protein levels were observed. Our data provide direct evidence that the role for intracellular hepcidin generated in the SN is particularly relevant to restrict iron release by down-regulation FPN1 expression in this region, thus an important contributor to the abnormal iron deposit occurred at an early stage in conditions of peripheral iron intoxication. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84864658369	Curcumin protects nigral dopaminergic neurons by iron-chelation in the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease	Objective Curcumin is a plant polyphenolic compound and a major component of spice turmeric (Curcuma longa). It has been reported to possess free radical-scavenging, iron-chelating, and anti-inflammatory properties in different tissues. Our previous study showed that curcumin protects MES23.5 dopaminergic cells from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. The present study aimed to explore this neuroprotective effect in the 6-OHDAlesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease in vivo. Methods: Rats were given intragastric curcumin for 24 days. 6-OHDA lesioning was conducted on day 4 of curcumin treatment. Dopamine content was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons by immunohistochemistry, and iron-containing cells by Perls' iron staining. Results: The dopamine content in the striatum and the number of THimmunoreactive neurons decreased after 6-OHDA treatment. Curcumin pretreatment reversed these changes. Further studies demonstrated that 6-OHDA treatment increased the number of iron-staining cells, which was dramatically decreased by curcumin pretreatment. Conclusion: The protective effects of curcumin against 6-OHDA may be attributable to the ironchelating activity of curcumin to suppress the iron-induced degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons. © Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84864944640	6-Hydroxydopamine upregulates iron regulatory protein 1 by activating certain protein kinase C isoforms in the dopaminergic MES23.5 cell line	Iron-induced oxidative stress is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our previous studies demonstrated that decreased expression of ferroportin 1 contributes to 6-hydroxydopamine induced intracellular iron accumulation and that decreased ferroportin 1 expression is caused by increased expression of iron regulatory protein 1. Iron regulatory protein 1 is a central regulator of iron homeostasis and is a likely target of extracellular agents to program changes in cellular iron metabolism. Therefore, the mechanism of iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine has become a significant focus of research. Iron regulatory protein 1 is regulated by protein kinase C, although this regulation is tissue specific. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to determine whether alteration of protein kinase C activity modified iron regulatory protein 1 expression in the dopaminergic MES23.5 cell line, Furthermore, we investigated whether 6-hydroxydopamine induced iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation is mediated by protein kinase C, thus achieving regulation of cellular iron levels. The results showed that iron regulatory protein 1 was upregulated by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, the PKC activator in dopaminergic MES23.5 cells, and ferroportin 1 expression and iron efflux were decreased as a result of iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation. The protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I hydrochloride abolished the effect of phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate. Protein kinase C-δ and protein kinase C-ζ, but not protein kinase C-ε were activated by 6-hydroxydopamine. The protein kinase C-δ inhibitor rottlerin inhibited protein kinase C-δ phosphorylation and abolished iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. The protein kinase C-ζ pseudo-substrate inhibitor inhibited protein kinase C-ζ phosphorylation and abolished iron regulatory protein 1 upregulation induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. These data indicate that iron regulatory protein 1 is regulated by protein kinase C in dopaminergic MES23.5 cells and that protein kinase C activated by 6-hydroxydopamine regulates iron regulatory protein 1 expression, thus achieving regulation of cellular iron levels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0037843227	Expression patterns of inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits in rat retina	The expression patterns of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel subunits (Kir 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, and 4.2) were studied in rat retina by immunohistochemistry, with special emphasis on neuronal expression. Except for Kir4.1, the subunits tested were all expressed on neurons in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. While Kir2.1 was densely present in the cytoplasm, the staining for all other subunits was predominantly expressed on the cell membrane. Most subunits, but not Kir 2.1 and 2.3, were present in the outer and inner plexiform layers to different extents. Kir4.1-immunoreactivity was found in astrocytes wrapping retinal blood vessels, in addition to the Müller cell endfoot. The differential expression of the Kir subunits suggests the diversity of physiological roles these channels may play. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84870289577	Nifedipine prevents iron accumulation and reverses iron-overload-induced dopamine neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra of rats	Abstract The mechanisms of iron accumulation in substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's diseases remain unclear.The objective of this study was to investigate effects of nifedipine on iron-overload-induced iron accumulation and neurodegeneration in SN of rats. By high performance liquid chromatography- electrochemical detection, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, and iron content array, we first quantified iron content and the number of dopamine neurons in SN of experimental rats treated with iron dextran. We further assessed effects of treatment with nifedipine. Our results showed that nifedipine treatment prevents iron dextran- induced dopamine depletion in the striatum. Consistently, we found that nifedipine restores the number of TH-positive neurons reduced by iron dextran overload and prevents increase of iron content in the SN. These results suggested that nifedipine may suppress iron toxicity in dopamine neurons and prevent neurodegeneration. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84873680782	Decreased iron levels in the temporal cortex in postmortem human brains with Parkinson disease	Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate alterations in the levels of iron, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) with the iron-responsive element (IRE), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), ferroportin 1 (FPN1), and iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) in the temporal cortex of human brains with Parkinson disease (PD). Methods: Iron content was measured using an ICP-MS 7500CE detector. IRP1, DMT11IRE, TfR1, and FPN1 expressions were determined by Western blotting. Results: Iron content was significantly lower in the temporal cortex of patients with PD when compared with age-matched healthy controls. Unexpectedly, the levels of DMT1+IRE, TfR1, FPN1, and IRP1 were decreased in the temporal cortex in PD brains. No changes were observed in the temporal cortex of postmortem Alzheimer disease brains. Conclusions: Iron deprivation and iron-related protein dysregulation suggest that a different iron regulatory mechanism may exist, and that iron redistribution may occur between the temporal cortex and the substantia nigra of patients with PD. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.

84874436258	Pro-inflammatory cytokines modulate iron regulatory protein 1 expression and iron transportation through reactive oxygen/nitrogen species production in ventral mesencephalic neurons	Both inflammatory processes associated with microglia activation and abnormal iron deposit in dopaminergic neurons are involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the relationship between neuroinflammation and iron accumulation was not fully elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) released by microglia, could affect cellular iron transportation in primary cultured ventral mesencephalic (VM) neurons. The results showed that IL-1β or TNF-α treatment led to increased ferrous iron influx and decreased iron efflux in these cells, due to the upregulation of divalent metal transporter 1 with the iron response element (DMT1+IRE) and downregulation of ferroportin1 (FPN1). Increased levels of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and hepcidin were also observed in IL-1β or TNF-α treated VM neurons. IRP1 upregulation could be fully abolished by co-administration of radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine and inducible NO synthetase inhibitor N

84874620965	Peptide hormone ghrelin enhances neuronal excitability by inhibition of Kv7/KCNQ channels	The gut-derived orexigenic peptide hormone ghrelin enhances neuronal firing in the substantia nigra pars compacta, where dopaminergic neurons modulate the function of the nigrostriatal system for motor coordination. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which ghrelin enhances firing of nigral dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting voltage-gated potassium Kv7/KCNQ/M-channels through its receptor GHS-R1a and activation of the PLC-PKC pathway. Brain slice recordings of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons reveal that ghrelin inhibits native Kv7/KCNQ/M-currents. This effect is abolished by selective inhibitors of GHS-R1a, PLC and PKC. Transgenic suppression of native Kv7/KCNQ/M-channels in mice or channel blockade with XE991 abolishes ghrelin-induced hyperexcitability. In vivo, intracerebroventricular ghrelin administration causes increased dopamine release and turnover in the striatum. Microinjection of ghrelin or XE991 into substantia nigra pars compacta results in contralateral dystonic posturing, and attenuation of catalepsy elicited by systemic administration of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol. Our findings indicate that the ghrelin/KCNQ signalling is likely a common pathway utilized by the nervous system. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84875935759	Role of α-synuclein aggregation and the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 pathway in iron-induced neurotoxicity	Abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Iron is also believed to serve as a major contributor by inducing oxidative stress and α-syn aggregation. Here, we report that down-regulation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) may contribute to iron-induced α-syn aggregation. In this study, we show that ferrous iron down-regulates Nrf2 and HO-1 in a time-dependent manner in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Levels of both Nrf2 and HO-1 are decreased even more by ferrous iron in SK-N-SH cells that overexpress α-syn and results in greater cell toxicity. Consistent with these results, knockdown of α-syn expression prevents reduction of Nrf2 and HO-1 by ferrous iron, eliminates α-syn aggregates, and protects SK-N-SH cells against ferrous iron-induced cell damage. Furthermore, increased HO-1 expression exerts a protective role against ferrous iron. These results support a new hypothesis of synergistic α-syn/iron cytotoxicity, whereby ferrous iron induces α-syn aggregation and neurotoxicity by inhibiting Nrf2/HO-1. Inhibition of Nrf2/HO-1 leads to more α-syn aggregation and greater toxicity induced by iron, creating a vicious cycle of iron accumulation, α-syn aggregation and HO-1 disruption in PD. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84878356929	Akt/Nrf2 activated upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 involves in the role of Rg1 against ferrous iron-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells	Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Our previous studies have observed that Rg1, a major pharmacologically active ingredient from Ginseng, could protect dopaminergic neurons by reducing nigral iron levels through regulating the expression of iron transporters in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced PD mice. The aim of this study is to investigate other mechanism involved in the cytoprotection of Rg1 against iron-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Significant rescue of Rg1 on cell viability against 100 μM ferrous iron-induced neurotoxicity was observed. Upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) were observed in Rg1 pretreated group. Moreover, Rg1 pretreatment induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation, which is upstream of HO-1 expression, and activated PI3K/Akt pathway was also observed in Rg1 pretreated group. This could antagonize iron-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species and decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of Rg1 against iron toxicity are attributed to the anti-oxidative properties by activating Akt/Nrf2 pathway and increasing Nrf2-induced expression of HO-1 and Cu/Zn SOD. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84879504934	Elevated plasma levels of soluble TNFRs and TACE activity in Alzheimer's disease patients of Northern Han Chinese descent	Background: We recently reported elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) activity in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a Caucasian population. The TNF receptor-mediated signaling pathway contributes to the production of Aβ3 and the subsequent cytotoxicity that is observed in AD brains. However, whether the plasma levels of soluble TNF receptors (sTNFRs) are changed is still unclear in AD patients of Han descent. Methods: In the present study, we analyzed the plasma sTNFR levels using commercially available immunoassay kits in 76 AD patients and 40 age- and sex-matched control subjects of Northern Han Chinese descent. Furthermore, the TACE activity was measured using a solution-based assay containing a fluorescently labeled TACE substrate. Results: AD patients exhibited higher levels of both sTNFR and TACE activity in their plasma compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects. The levels of sTNFR1 strongly correlated with the levels of sTNFR2 (r

84885476383	6-Hydroxydopamine promotes iron traffic in primary cultured astrocytes	It is well known that disrupted brain iron homeostasis was involved in Parkinson's disease. We previously reported 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) could enhance iron influx and attenuate iron efflux process, thus promote iron accumulation in neurons. Astrocytes, the major glial cell type in the central nervous system, are largely responsible for iron distribution in the brain. However, how iron metabolism changes in astrocytes with 6-OHDA treatment are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we first observed that both iron influx and efflux were enhanced with 10 μM 6-OHDA treatment for 24 h in primary cultured astrocytes. In accordance with these iron traffic modulations, both mRNA and protein levels of iron importer divalent metal transporter 1 with iron responsive element (DMT1+IRE) and exporter ferroportin 1 (FPN1) were up-regulated in these cells. L-ferritin mRNA levels were increased. Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) showed a dynamic regulation with 6-OHDA treatment, as indicated by a moderate up-regulation at 12 h, however, down-regulation at 24 h. We further demonstrated that 6-OHDA treatment could induce activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p65. IκBα activation inhibitor BAY11-7082 fully blocked 6-OHDA induced NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and DMT1 + IRE up-regulation. These results suggest that 6-OHDA might promote iron transport rate in astrocytes by regulating iron transporters, IRP1 expression and NF-κB p65 activation, indicating a different response between neurons and astrocytes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84886092912	Fibroblast growth factor 20 polymorphism in sporadic Parkinson's disease in Northern Han Chinese	Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 20 is a neurotrophic factor that exerts strong neurotrophic properties in the brain and could significantly enhance the survival of rat midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The genetic association of the FGF20 gene with Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. We used the polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism assay to assess the association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs12720208 and rs1721100, within the FGF20 gene in 178 PD patients and 190 healthy controls from a Northern Han Chinese population. The results showed no significant differences in the presence of rs1721100 or rs12720208 in the FGF20 gene between PD patients and controls. This indicates the FGF20 gene might not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to PD in this population. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0042825341	Correlation between iron levels and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat nigrostriatal system during the early 6-OHDA lesions in medial forebrain bundle	In the present study, using fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), atomic absorption/flame emission spectrophotometry and immunohistochemistry, we investigated the correlation between iron levels and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat nigrostriatal system during the early 6-OHDA lesions in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The results showed that 1 d or 3 d after lesions in MFB, there was a 45% or 66% reduction, respectively, in the density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra (SN) of the lesioned side accompanied by an increase in iron staining intensity and iron concentration; while there was no change in dopamine (DA) release in the striatum (Str) of the lesioned side compared with the unlesioned side and the normal rats. There was no difference in the iron staining and concentration of SN and DA release of Str on the lesioned side between one-day group and three-days group. These results suggest that an iron level elevation in SN may be involved at the early stage of degeneration of DA neurons in SN. However, DA release in Str was unchanged due to the immense compensatory mechanism of DA system.

0242542720	Regulation of estrogen and phytoestrogen on the dopaminergic systems of amygdala in rats	In vivo fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV) was used to investigate dopamine (DA) release from amygdala (Amy) of female rats in different phases of estrus cycle, ovaricectomized (OVX) rats and male rats. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry was employed to measure the numbers of immunoreactive neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) of midbrain in the rats. We also observed the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of phytoestrogen-soy isoflavones on DA release from the Amy. The results are as follows: DA release from the Amy of proestrus female rats was apparently higher than that in estrus, metaestrus, diestrus female rats and OVX rats. Amy DA release and the numbers of the TH immunoreactive neurons in VTA showed a significant sex difference. DA release from Amy of female and OVX rats increased significantly within 5 min after i. c. v injection of soy isoflavones, which elicited no effects in male rats. The above-mentioned results suggest that endogenous estrogen may play an important role in regulating the activity of DA neurons in mid-limbic systems, and that soy isoflavones exert an estrogen-like effect on the dopaminergic systems in the Amy.

0242712032	Increased DMT1 expression and iron content in MPTP-treated C57BL/6 mice	Iron plays a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD). To illustrate the mechanism underlying the increase of iron in substantia nigra (SN) in PD, changes of the expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and iron content were examined in SN in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated mice using immunohistochemistry and histochemistry respectively. Following MPTP treatment for 3 d, elevated iron staining was found in SN. A further increase in iron content was observed after 7 d. In these lesioned animals, tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive DA neurons exhibited a decrease in number and morphological changes as well. There were two isoforms of DMT1 expressed in SN of mice. After MPTP treatment, the expression of DMT1 without IRE form increased in either group, whereas DMT1 with IRE form increased only after 7 d of MPTP treatment. These observations suggest that DMT1 is possibly involved in the process of iron accumulation in SN of MPTP-treated mice, which might be responsible for the subsequent death of DA neurons.

84889078678	Iron status and lipopolysaccharide regulate Ndfip1 by activation of nuclear factor-kappa B	Nedd4 family interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) is an adaptor protein for the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases that target proteins for degradation. Recent studies confirmed the role of Ndfip1 as a regulator of iron metabolism and pointed out that Ndfip1 was involved in iron homeostasis by regulating the degradation of iron importer divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). However, little is known about how Ndfip1 is regulated. The aim of this article was to investigate the regulation of Ndfip1 levels and the possible mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the effect of various stimuli, including iron status and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on Ndfip1 expression in MES23.5 dopaminergic cell lines. Results showed that Ndfip1 expression in these cells was enhanced by ferrous iron overload, but not ferric iron overload, and decreased after iron deprivation by deferoxamine. In addition, LPS could significantly increase the expression of Ndfip1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the regulation of Ndfip1 expression by these various stimuli was achieving by activation of nuclear factor-kappa B. We speculate that iron status and LPS may contribute to the changes of Ndfip1 expression by activation of nuclear factor-kappa B. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84894303156	Nesfatin-1 decreases excitability of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra	Nesfatin-1, a newly discovered satiety molecule which reduces feeding behavior, has been recognized as a unique regulatory neuropeptide with its multiple roles, both central and peripheral. However, whether it had neuronal modulation effect on dopaminergic neurons is largely unknown. In the present study, using whole-cell patch clamp under current-clamp mode, we investigate the effects of nesfatin-1 on the electrical activity of rat nigral dopaminergic neurons. Nesfatin-1 could produce a resting membrane potential hyperpolarization on the majority of dopaminergic neurons tested. The spike frequency decreased by 23.13 ± 5.93 and 43.20 ± 5.56 % in 5-nM and 10-nM nesfatin-1 groups, respectively. These effects persisted in the presence of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptor antagonists. Our study suggests that nesfatin-1 postsynaptically inhibits the electrical activity of nigral dopaminergic neurons. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84896727923	High frequency stimulation of subthalamic nucleus results in behavioral recovery by increasing striatal dopamine release in 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rat	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective medical therapy in alleviating motor symptoms in moderate to severe Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, there are still remaining questions regarding the mechanisms of this action. In this experiment, using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) PD rat model we investigated the effect of high frequency stimulation (HFS)-STN on improvement of the motor symptoms, DA release in the striatum and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that HFS-STN improved the motor symptoms of 6-OHDA lesioned rat model of PD via inducing a significant increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and directly evoked dopamine release in the striatum of normal and partially 6-OHDA lesioned rats. In addition, we found the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) did not increase after HFS-STN, while the expression of TH in the substantia nigra increased significantly compared to the 6-OHDA lesioned group. This suggested that STN-HFS could reverse motor deficits against 6-OHDA-induced lesion through increasing striatal dopamine release by modulating the expression of TH, without rescuing dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84899909900	Alcohol intake and risk of Parkinson's disease: A meta-analysis of observational studies	Background: The association of alcohol intake with risk of Parkinson's disease remains unclear. Methods: Pertinent studies were identified in PubMed and EMBASE. The fixed-effect or random-effect model was selected based on heterogeneity. The dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic splines. Results: We included 32 articles, involving 677,550 subjects (9994 cases). The smoking-adjusted risk of Parkinson's disease for the highest versus lowest level of alcohol intake was relative risk (RR) 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.92) overall, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-0.995) in prospective studies, and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.58-0.96) in matched case-control studies. A significant association was found with beer (0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.90) but not with wine and liquor, and for males (0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90) after a sensitivity analysis but not for females.

84905962535	The effect of lentivirus-mediated PSPN Genetic engineering bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on Parkinson's disease rat model	Persephin (PSPN) is one of the neurotrophic factors of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) which have been found to promote the survival of specific populations of neurons. The aim of this study was to assess the potential therapeutic function of gene-modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-Lv-PSPN-MSCs in 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) rats models. Here, we worked on the isolation, purification, identification and amplification of MSCs in vitro. The expression analysis revealed that several of the neural marker proteins like nestin, GFAP and S100 were expressed by rat MSCs. MES23.5 cells co-cultured with Lv-PSPN-MSCs showed less 6-OHDA induced cell death than control cells in vitro. When Lv-PSPN-MSCs were injected into the striatum of PD rats, we observed the survival rate, migration, differentiation and the behavior change of PD rats. We found that Lv-PSPN-MSCs showed higher survival rate in rat brain compared with Lv-null-MSCs. Rotational behavior showed that rats receiving Lv-PSPN-MSCs showed the most significant improvement compared with those in other groups. HPLC results showed the content of DA in striatum of rats which received Lv-PSPN-MSCs was highest compared with those in other groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that transplantation of Lv-PSPN-MSCs can lead to remarkable therapeutic effects in PD rats. © 2014 Yin et al.

84907141664	Positive relationship between mortality from Alzheimer's disease and soil metal concentration in mainland China	An imbalance of metal ions is implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the relationship between the annual mortality of AD and ionic concentration (iron, zinc, copper, and aluminum) in the soil in mainland China. The AD annual mortality data were from 26 provinces and 3 municipal districts within mainland China between the years 1991 and 2000 and provided by the National Death Cause Surveillance Database of China. The ionic concentration in soil was provided by the China State Environmental Protection Bureau, which was published in 1990. The results showed that the relative risk of mortality in the regions with the highest copper concentrations (60-80 mg/kg) reached 2.634 (95% CI: 2.626-2.642) compared with the regions that had the lowest copper concentrations. The relative risk was 1.292 (95% CI: 1.290-1.294) and 1.248 (95% CI: 1.245-1.251) when the soil iron concentrations exceeded 3 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively. When the soil zinc concentration was over 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, the relative risk was 1.870 (95% CI: 1.859-1.881) and 2.289 (95% CI: 2.276-2.304), respectively. However, the relative risk was 0.560 (95% CI: 0.559-0.561), 0.604 (95% CI: 0.603-0.605), and 0.267 (95% CI: 0.265-0.268) when the soil aluminum concentration was over 6 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg, and 8 mg/kg, respectively. This study suggests that high concentrations of iron and copper in the soil might be associated with the high AD annual mortality in this region in China, while aluminum had no association with AD mortality.

84907554716	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor inhibit ferrous iron influx via divalent metal transporter 1 and iron regulatory protein 1 regulation in ventral mesencephalic neurons	Iron accumulation is observed in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease. However, it is unknown whether neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) participate in the modulation of neuronal iron metabolism. Here, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of BDNF and GDNF on the iron influx process in primary cultured ventral mesencephalic neurons. 6-hydroxydopamine-induced enhanced ferrous iron influx via improper up-regulation of divalent metal transporter 1 with iron responsive element (DMT1. +. IRE) was consistently relieved by BDNF and GDNF. Both the mRNA and protein levels of DMT1. +. IRE were down-regulated by BDNF or GDNF treatment alone. We further demonstrated the involvement of iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) in BDNF- and GDNF-induced DMT1. +. IRE expression. Extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt were activated and participated in these processes. Inhibition of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation abolished the down-regulation of IRP1 and DMT1. +. IRE induced by BDNF and GDNF. Taken together, these results show that BDNF and GDNF ameliorate iron accumulation via the ERK/Akt pathway, followed by inhibition of IRP1 and DMT1. +. IRE expression, which may provide new targets for the neuroprotective effects of these neurotrophic factors.

11144304136	Time dependent effects of 6-OHDA lesions on iron level and neuronal loss in rat nigrostriatal system	The early changes in iron level and neuronal loss in rat nigrostriatal system were investigated using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally lesioned rats. The results showed that: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days of postlesion, there was a progressive reduction in the density of the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH-ir) cells in the lesioned substantia nigra (SN). Iron level increased in the lesioned SN from 1-14 days following 6-OHDA lesions, but there were no differences in iron level among them. Only on 14 days of postlesion, did the DA release decrease in striatum (Str) of the lesioned side, while there were no changes in other groups. These results implied that the increased iron level in SN occured when there was a moderate reduction of DA neurons. However, the DA release in Str was unchanged until TH-ir cells were highly reduced due to the immense compensatory mechanism of the DA system.
