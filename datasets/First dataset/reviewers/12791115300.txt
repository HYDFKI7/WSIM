21444458023	Numerical analysis of fluid flow through a cylinder array using a lattice Boltzmann model	In this paper we present a detailed computational study of an incompressible Newtonian fluid flow across a periodic array of two-dimensional cylinders which is a simplest non-trivial representation of a porous media. A two-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann Method is used to solve the governing Navier-Stokes equation taking into account of viscous dissipation effects and influence of nonlinear fluid drag. Both the flow fields and the Darcy-Forchheimer drag coefficient as a function of the solid volume fraction are calculated for a wide range of flow Reynolds numbers. The predictions were compared with the results from conventional numerical and empirical models for verification. Apart from confirming that inertial effects can cause a significant deviation from Darcy's law for large velocities the results also show that the characteristics of the vorticity field vary considerably as the Reynolds number increases, which will have major implications to the transport of passive particulate substances within the pores and their removal rate. © 2004 Chin.

24644436882	Two-dimensional approximation for tide-induced watertable fluctuations in a sloping sandy beach	The prediction of watertable fluctuations in a coastal aquifer is important for coastal management. However, most previous approaches have based on the one-dimensional Boussinesq equation, neglecting variations in the coastline and beach slope. In this paper, a closed-form analytical solution for a two-dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer bounded by a rhythmic coastline is derived. In the new model, the effect of beach slope is also included, a feature that has not been considered in previous two-dimensional approximations. Three small parameters, the shallow water parameter (ε), the amplitude parameter (α) and coastline parameter (β) are used in the perturbation approximation. The numerical results demonstrate the significant influence of both the coastline shape and beach slopes on tide-driven coastal groundwater fluctuations. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33749262447	Lattice Boltzmann schemes for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation	The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is applied to solve the time-dependent nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation. Through approximating the reaction term at different orders of accuracy, three diffusion-reaction LB schemes are constructed for the cubic NLS equation. A LB initial condition is proposed to include the first-order nonequilibrium distribution function. These LB schemes are used to solve the one-soliton propagation and the homoclinic orbit problems. Detailed simulation results confirm that the high-order reaction term and the LB initial condition are effective in reducing the truncation errors. Compared with the Crank-Nicolson finite difference scheme, the LB scheme is found to give at least comparable and generally more accurate approximation for the cubic NLS equation. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33947306080	An experiment study of erosion characteristics of sediment bed at the yellow river delta	The modern Yellow River Delta is formed by fine-grained sediments through fast transportation and accumulation. Its coast is characterized by partially consolidated bed structure, high water content and weak erosion resistance. Despite recent advances in numerical morphodynamic modeling techniques, the current ability to predict long-term coastal changes at the Yellow River Delta is hampered by the lack of reliable data on the erosion resistance of the sediments deep in the bed. This paper describes a laboratory-based erosion study using a 30 m sediment core collected from the tidal flat on the northern coast of the Yellow River Delta in April 2004. The influence of various sediment properties such as bed stratification, grain composition, wet bulk density and water content on the measured erosion resistance has been analyzed in detail. The results reveal that there exist a definite negative relationship between the critical erosion shear stress and water content or median diameter, and also a clear positive relationship between the critical erosion shear stress and clay content. For the sediments of the same type, there was a positive relationship between the critical erosion shear stress and wet bulk density. It was also found that the erosion resistance changes considerably through depth with the lowest being near the surface and the highest at a depth of 9.1-13.5 m. The relationship between erosion rate and shear stress for erosion was shown to be dependent in a complex way on the grain distribution, sedimentation structure, wet bulk density and water content of the sediments. A number of distinct erosion behavior have been identified and although in most cases the erosion rate (ε) can be related linearly to the net bed shear stress (τ -τ

34147213937	Equilibrium distribution boundary condition in lattice Boltzmann model and numerical simulation of Darcy-Forcheimer drag	This article presents a boundary condition for the equilibrium distribution suitable for a variety of non-slip flow lattice Boltzmann simulations. The boundary condition is based on the Bounce-back method and satisfies mass and momentum conservation principles. The computational results show that the new boundary condition for the equilibrium distribution overcame the erroneous slip velocities resulted from the conventional bounce-back method. The porous flow field around prism-shaped particles which is governed by Darcy-Forcheimer formula is calculated and compared with Lee and Yang's (1997) the predictions are found to be sufficiently reliable.

40149099005	Dissection of No. 13 lymph node in radical gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma	Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of No. 13 lymphadenectomy in radical gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. Methods: Medical records of the patients undergone No. 13 lymph node dissection during D2 gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma, were reviewed from March 2003 to May 2007. Results: One hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent No. 13 lymph node dissection for D2 gastric carcinoma, of them, 4 (2.53%) were found to have metastasis in No. 13 lymph node. Metastasis to No. 12 lymph node was detected in 6 patients and 4 of them had positive No. 13 lymph node. The operative morbidity except for wound infection was 15.19% (24/158), and hospital death rate was 1.27% (2/158). No obstructive jaundice caused by No. 13 lymph node metastasis after No. 13 lymph node dissection in radical gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma was detected during the follow-up study to end of January 2007. Conclusion: Dissection of No. 13 lymph node in D2 gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma is safe with a low morbidity and mortality rate. Further study is needed to explore its long-term effect. © 2008 WJG. All rights reserved.

80052882156	Echinoside A, A triterpene glycoside derived from sea cucumber, on anti-tumer metastasis via regulation of MMP-9 signal pathway	Echinoside A (EA), a triterpene glycoside, was obtained from the sea cucumber Pearsonothuria graejfei, which is rich with triterpene glycoside. The effects and mechanism of EA on tumor metastasis were conducted. MTT assay was used to determine the anti-proliferation ability of EA on HepG2 tumor cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Cell adhesion assay, wound migration assay and transwell assay were used to determine the effects of EA on tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion abilities. In vitro tube formation assay and chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay were used to determine the effects of EA on tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we found that EA inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and HUVEC cells, and suppressed HepG2 cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. EA also obviously reduced tube formation of HUVEC cells on matrigel in vitro and attenuated neovascularization in the CAM assay in vivo. Immunocytochemical analysis and western blotting analysis revealed that EA significantly decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). EA also increased the expression level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). Meanwhile, the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) was not affected by EA. These findings suggest that EA exhibits significant anti-metastatic activity through specific inhibition of MMP-9 signal pathway.

80052691575	Boussinesq modeling of undertow profiles	Though Boussinesq-type wave equations are widely used in the nearshore wave field, it is still a challenge for these kinds of equations to describe the velocity profiles along water column after wave breaking occur. For example undertow, plays a key role in generating sandbars, is quite difficult to be simulated by a Boussinesq-type model (usually used in a phase-resolving beach evolution model). The ad-hoc method developed by Lynett (wave breaking velocity effects in depthintegrated models. Coastal Engineering, 2006, 53(4):325-333.) seems greatly improve the performance of Boussinesq-type equations for undertow calculation. However this method is a post-processing modification skill, the accurate prediction of undertow profiles greatly depends on the accuracy of predicted wave elevation and depthaveraged velocities before modification. Hence Boussinesq-type equations with fully nonlinear characteristics instead of those with only weak nonlinearity should be used to simulate breaking waves, as proved by many researches that the former could give better results than the later in wave breaking zone. In the present paper, a new set of fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations and the above mentioned ad-hoc method are combined to form a wave breaking model, aiming to simulate the undertow profiles. The model is first validated by simulating regular waves breaking on a plane beach, then the undertow profiles are calculated, numerical results are compared against three available data sets and the performance of wave breaking model before and after modification is detailed discussed.

84861815153	Effects of matrine on proliferation and apoptosis in gallbladder carcinoma cells (GBC-SD)	Although matrine, a primary active component of dried Sophora flavescens root (ku shen), is known to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells in vitro, the molecular mechanism of such apoptosis remains elusive. This analysis of the cell cycle and apoptosis in matrine-treated human gallbladder carcinoma cells (GBC-SD) showed that matrine can indeed inhibit cell proliferation and induce G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. An additional western blot analysis of matrine-treated cells also showed caspase-3 and Bcl-2 activation, as well as cyclinE down-regulation. Overall, the results indicate that matrine perturbs gallbladder cancer cell progression during the G1 phase by down-regulating cyclinE and induces apoptosis by decreasing the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increasing expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax.

84877772650	Combined Portal Vein Resection for Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma: A Meta-analysis of Comparative Studies	Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) frequently invades into the adjacent portal vein, and portal vein resection (PVR) is the only way to manage this condition and achieve negative resection margins. However, the safety and effectiveness of PVR is controversial. Studies analyzing the effect of PVR on the surgical and pathological outcomes in the management of HCCA with gross portal vein involvement were considered eligible for this meta-analysis. The outcome variables analyzed included postoperative morbidity, mortality, survival rate, proportion of R0 resection, lymph node metastasis, microscopic vascular invasion, and perineural invasion. From 11 studies, 371 patients who received PVR and 1,029 who did not were identified and analyzed. Data from patients who received combined PVR correlated with higher postoperative death rates (OR = 2.31; 95 % CI, 1.21-4.43; P = 0.01) and more advanced tumor stage. No significant difference was detected in terms of morbidity, proportion of R0 resection, or 5-year survival rate. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that in centers with more experience or studies published after 2007, combined PVR did not cause significantly higher postoperative death. No strong evidence could suggest that combined PVR leads to more morbidity or mortality for patients with HCCA when the portal vein is grossly involved. In addition, combined PVR is oncologically valuable because R0 resection and 5-year survival did not differ significantly between two cohorts, despite the fact that the PVR cohort consisted of patients with more advanced HCCA. © 2013 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV304) cell had been cultured in vitro, and we established an model of endothelial cell oxidative damage induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). MTT assay was used to test the influence of polysaccharides, triterpene glycosides and collagen polypeptides from Apostichopus japonicus on proliferation activities of endothelial cells. The influence on contents of MDA was examined by TBA assay. Nitric acid deoxidize enzyme assay was used to observe the influence on the contents of NO and activities of NOS. Apoptosis of vascular endothellial cells was measured by DNA-ladder. Results: All concentrations of polysaccharides, collagen polypeptide and low concentration of triterpene glycosides could protect vascular endothellial cells from injury induced by ox-LDL. Cell proliferation activities, the contents of MDA were decreased remarkably (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and cell apoptosis induced by ox-LDL was inhibited observably (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, NO contents and NOS activities were stimulated significantly by polysaccharides and collagen polypeptide (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), Conclusion: Polysaccharides, triterpene glycosides and collagen polypeptides from Apostichopus japonicus have the protective effects on vascular endothelial cells oxidative damaged by ox-LDL.

46549084214	Temporal and spatial evolution of the coastal profiles along the Yellow River Delta over last three decades	The subaerial delta of the Yellow River has undergone a notable reshaping process with drastic changes in erosion and accretion patterns both temporally and spatially. These morphological changes not only have significant impact on the long-term evolution of delta but also pose severe threat to the existing infrastructures adjacent to the eroding delta lobe. This paper presents a data-based study of waves, currents, sediments and subaqueous bedforms including the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the measured coastal profiles in order to understand qualitative and quantitative processes that are responsible for the observed changes. The results demonstrated that the Yellow River Delta has recently been dominated by recession process due to the reduced sediment supply from the Yellow River in the recent decades. A critical threshold of river sediment discharge was formulated and used to explain the observed morphodynamic processes. It was found that the coast of the Yellow River Delta could be broadly divided into three geomorphic zones: the area near abandoned delta, the estuarine area, and Laizhou Bay. At the nearshore zone of the abandoned delta, waves are the main agent for bed erosion and sediments suspension. The tidal current is effective in transporting suspended sediments and exerts the main control on the depths of the erosion-accretion balance zone on the coastal profiles. The area near the present estuary has seen rapid deposition with the progradation rate being governed by the relative intensity of fluvial and marine processes while the coasts in Laizhou Bay are stable and the particular characteristics of the tidal current field prevent the sediments supplied by the Yellow River from reaching this area. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

58649093094	A conceptual nodel of somali jet based on the biot-savart law	We study the relationship between thermal conditions on the earth bottom boundary and the formation of Somali jet based on the Biot-Savart law and the data from National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). As the radiation from the Sun gradually moves from the southern meridian, the temperature on the surface of Somali Peninsular and Arabic Peninsular gradually increases. During the same period the surface temperature of the Northern Indian Ocean increases much slower. It is shown that this increase of the temperature difference between the land and sea is inductive to the formation and development of Rayleigh-Benard convection and leads to the increasing relative vorticity strength between positive and negative vertical vortices over the land and sea. According to the Biot-Savart law, increase of vorticity strength will correspondingly induce the horizontal velocity. A pair of positive and negative vorticity fields over the two Peninsulars and the sea surface is effective in forming and maintaining this current. This mechanism is referred to as the Somali suction pump. It draws air continually from the Southern hemisphere and releases it at the coastal area of Somali. © 2008 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

73249118312	Simultaneous determination of four 5-hydroxy polymethoxyflavones by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection	Accumulating evidence has suggested the potential health-promoting effects of 5-hydroxy polymethoxyflavones (5-OH-PMFs) naturally existing in citrus genus. However, research efforts are hampered by the lack of reliable and sensitive methods for their determination in plant materials and biological samples. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with electrochemical (EC) detection, we have developed a fast and highly sensitive method for quantification of four 5-OH-PMFs, namely 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-6,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone, and 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,4′-tetramethoxyflavone. The method was fully validated in terms of linearity, accuracy and precision. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined as being between 0.65 and 1.8 ng/mL (ppb), demonstrating an over 160 times higher sensitivity in comparison with the previously reported method using UV detection. The recovery rate of the method was between 96.17% and 110.82%, and the precision for the retention times and peak areas was all below 13%. The method was successfully used to quantify 5-OH-PMFs with a wide range of abundance in the citrus products and preparations, such as orange juice, citrus peel, and dried tangerine peel. The quantification method for 5-OH-PMFs developed herein could be useful for the nutritional and pharmacological studies of these compounds in future. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

74649086203	Bedform evolution around a submarine pipeline and its effects on wave-induced forces under regular waves	The paper presents an experimental investigation of seabed evolution behavior around a submarine pipeline and the hydrodynamic forces on the pipeline under regular waves. Unlike the previous flume tests that have largely used beds with median sands, this study focuses on fine sediments such as sandy silt and silt. The primary objective of the study was to investigate: (i) the scour process under different wave conditions and with different sediments and (ii) the influence of the bedform evolution on the hydrodynamic forces experienced by the pipeline. In terms of scour and ripple formation, four distinct regimes of the near-field bed evolution behavior are identified which are: (I) no scour, (II) scour without ripples, (III) scour with small ripples and (IV) scour with large ripples. The influence of bedform evolution on wave forces was found to vary significantly in different regimes. In regime I, the wave forces were quite stable; in regime II and III, the wave forces underwent a gradual reduction before reaching their equilibrium values at fairly early stages of the scour process; in regime IV, the wave forces were significantly affected by the migrating ripples and can be rather unsteady throughout the testing period. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77954032171	Reactive oxygen species-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to cirsimaritin-induced apoptosis in human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells	In this study, the anticancer effect of cirsimaritin, a natural flavonoid, against human gallbladder carcinoma cell line GBC-SD and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Cirsimaritin inhibited the growth of tumor cells and induced mitochondrial apoptosis in GBC-SD cells. In addition, cirsimaritin triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and down-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt, while knock-down of CHOP dramatically abrogated the inactivation of Akt and reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of cirsimaritin. Furthermore, cirsimaritin provoked the generation of reactive oxygen species in GBC-SD cells, while the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine almost completely blocked the activation of ER stress and apoptosis, suggesting cirsimaritin-induced reactive oxygen species is an early event that triggers ER stress mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in GBC-SD cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77956322360	A phase-resolving beach evolution model based on fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations	A phase-resolving beach profile model is developed to simulate beach profile changes under different wave conditions. The model consists of three modules, i.e., wave module, mean flow module and sediment transport module. The wave module is based on the fully nonlinear Boussinesq equations developed by Zou and Fang (alternative forms of the higher-order Boussinesq equations: derivations and validations. Coastal Engineering, 2009, 55(6):506-521). It is able to capture accurately the location of breaking point which plays a key role in generating sandbars. The mean flow module considers undertow and the shear stress just on the top of the bottom, the former is described by a simple ad-hoc method (by Lynett, wave breaking velocity effects in depth-integrated models. Coastal Engineering, 2006, 53(4):325-333.) while the latter is considered by numerically solving Wave Bottom Boundary Layer (WBBL) equation. Finally, the beach updating model based on Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme (by Long et al., a numerical scheme for morphological bed level calculations. Coastal Engineering, 2008,55:167-180.) is adopted due to its efficiency. Other processes such as the new total sand transport rate formula which could take wave asymmetric and skewness into account is also incorporated into the model. The numerical results from the model are presented and compared with those from the other similar models. © 2010 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

Icariin triggered the mitochondrial/caspase apoptotic pathway indicated by enhanced Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase cascade. Moreover, icariin induced a sustained activation of the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 and ERK1/2, and SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) almost reversed icariin-induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. In addition, icariin provoked the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SMMC-7721 cells, while the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine almost completely blocked icariin-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that icariin induces apoptosis through a ROS/JNK-dependent mitochondrial pathway. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77957303842	Temporal variation of sediment load in the Yellow River basin, China, and its impacts on the lower reaches and the river delta	Long-term changes to the Yellow River delta in China have received considerable attention not only because of the growing economic importance of the delta region but also because they provide a clear example of the dominant role played by anthropogenic effects upon a large dynamic river delta. This paper presents a detailed study on the morphological consequences of reduction in river sediment load and influence of human activities based on sediment load data at three gauging stations in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River basin from 1950 to 2007. The results indicate that sediment loads at all three gauging stations display a gradually decreasing trend over the past 58. years. The primary reason for this decrease is shown to be due to various human activities, including the construction of Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs in the upper reaches, water-soil conservation practices and the commissioning of Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi reservoirs in the middle reaches. It is estimated that water-soil conservation practices which are a major factor to the decrease of sediment load at Huayuankou gauging station account for 40% of the total amount of reduction, sediment trapping by Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi reservoirs account for 30% of the total amount of reduction and the 10% decrease is caused by human activities in the upper reaches. The remaining 20% decrease is attributed to precipitation decrease. The reduction of sediment load has directly impacted on the lower Yellow River and the delta region, causing alternate changes between siltation and scouring in the lower river channel along with an increased rate of erosion over the whole Yellow River delta. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78650889928	Inhibitory effects of 5-hydroxy polymethoxyflavones on colon cancer cells	Hydroxylated polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) are a class of novel flavonoid compounds mainly found in citrus plants. We studied the effects of three major 5-hydroxy PMFs, namely: 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxyflavone, and 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, on human colon cancer HCT116 and HT29 cells. Their effects were compared with those produced by their permethoxylated counterparts, namely: nobiletin, 3,5,6,7,8,3′,4′-heptamethoxylflavone, and tangeretin. 5-Hydroxy PMFs showed much stronger inhibitory effects on the growth of the colon cancer cells in comparison with their permethoxylated counterparts, suggesting the pivotal role of hydroxyl group at 5-position in the enhanced inhibitory activity by 5-hydroxy PMFs. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that three 5-hydroxy PMFs produced different effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis, which may suggest that three 5-hydroxy PMFs act through different mechanisms. For example, 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in HT29 cells, while 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3′,4′-hexamethoxyflavone led to significant G0/G1 phase arrest. In contrast, 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,4′-tetramethoxyflavone increased sub-G0/G1 cell population, which has been confirmed to be due to enhanced apoptosis. Our results further demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of 5-hydroxy PMFs were associated with their ability in modulating key signaling proteins related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, such as p21

79955421383	Three-dimensional numerical simulation of wave interaction with perforated quasi-ellipse caisson	The finite difference method and the volume of fluid (VOF) method were used to develop a three-dimensional numerical model to study wave interaction with a perforated caisson. The partial cell method was adopted to solve this type of problem for the first time. The validity of the present model, with and without the presence of caisson structures, was examined by comparing the model results with experimental data. Then, the numerical model was used to investigate the effects of various wave and structure parameters on the wave force and wave runup of the perforated quasi-ellipse caisson. Compared with the solid quasi-ellipse caisson, the wave force on the perforated quasi-ellipse caisson is significantly reduced with increasing porosity of the perforated quasi-ellipse caisson. Furthermore, the perforated quasi-ellipse caisson can also reduce the wave runup, and it tends to decrease with the increase of the porosity of the perforated quasi-ellipse caisson and the relative wave height.

79955506290	A flume test on erosion mechanism for an abandoned section of the Huanghe (Yellow) River Delta	The erosion mechanisms of abandoned coastal section are understood detailedly by flume experiment, which play an important role to the offshore engineering facilities. A movable-bed physical model has been used to investigate the coastal erosion of an abandoned section of the Huanghe (Yellow) River Delta. The theory of physical scale models is discussed and a method for constructing the representative seabed section is developed. The results indicate that during the period initially after the abandonment of the delta the entire bed experienced rapid erosion because the seabed was steep and prone to liquefaction that resulted from storm wave action. After this initial period, a balance of erosion and accretion was established, and the beach profile equilibrated with a point of balance present on the profile. The experimental results indicate that the volume of deposition was about half that of the erosion. Wave action may also induce significant stratal changes through its interaction with the soft seabed. The major morphological features developed in the model delta section were found to be qualitatively comparable with those observed in the prototype. A distorted modeling law that maintains the similarity of the modeled and prototype equilibrium beach profiles is proposed. Experimental results show that the distorted modeling is able to reproduce the beach-face slope in nature, and the model also successfully reproduced three historical evolutionary stages of erosion. © 2010 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0036439962	Experimental studies of surface wave reflection by longshore bars and a sloping seawall	Laboratory experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of a seawall on resonant reflection by a fixed periodic bar system on the seabed. The experiments were conducted in a wave flume. A series of five fixed bars was placed in front of a seawall with 1:1 slope. Regular waves with wave height 0.04 m and wave periods from 0.8 to 1.20 seconds were used. The tests were performed for the cases with and without the seawall. The wave surface elevations were measured at seven locations in front of the seaward and in either side the bar patch. Based on the preliminary analysis of measured wave time series, it was found that the presence of the seawall has considerable influence on the reflection characteristics of the waves in front of the bar field.

79960238213	Performance evaluation of a beach nourishment project at west beach in Beidaihe, China	This paper presents a detailed study of a beach nourishment project in Beidaihe, China. The study consists of a detailed assessment of a small-scale trial project that was carried out during May to June in 2008 to create two bathing sites on West Beach and a numerical evaluation of scheme options for the full project involving beach nourishment, groins, and submerged breakwaters. The monitoring data indicate that the nourished beach in the small-scale project was slowly eroding but in February of the following year the beach was still 20 m wider than it was before the project. The long-term shoreline evolution was then predicted using the generalized model for simulating shoreline change, which was calibrated to reproduce the posttrial project shoreline. The model indicates that without follow-up nourishment, the nourished beach created by the trial project will cease to be suitable for bathing in just 2-3 years. As to the full project the numerical evaluation of various scheme options indicates that the east groin plays a key role in protecting the beach in the long term and the removal of a rock jetty at east end of the beach in 2002 is identified as one of the major causes for the present severe erosion of West Beach. On the basis of the simulation results an optimum scheme for the project is proposed. © 2011, the Coastal Education & Research Foundation (CERF).

80053087982	Prognostic value of lymphangiogenesis in supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma	Background: Metastasis to regional lymph nodes via lymphatic microvessels plays a key role in cancer progression' and is an important prognostic factor in many cancers. Recent evidence suggests that tumour lymphangiogenesis promotes lymphatic metastasis.Aims: To investigate whether tumour lymphatic microvessel density correlates with clinicopathological factors and serves as a prognostic indicator of supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma progression.Methods: The lymphatics of 84 supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma cases were investigated by immunohistochemical staining for podoplanin (also termed D2-40). The relationships between (intra- and peritumoural) lymphatic microvessel density' clinicopathological parameters and clinical prognosis were analysed.Results: There was a significant relationship between high intratumoural lymphatic microvessel density and aggressive tumour node stage (p < 0.0001)' distant metastasis (p=0.037) and poor prognosis (p= 0.011)' and between high peritumoural lymphatic microvessel density and node stage (p=0.004) and poor prognosis (p=0.029). Patients with high lymphatic microvessel density also had significantly worse disease-free survival (p=0.003) and overall survival (p=0.005). Intratumoural lymphatic microvessel density was found to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (p=0.008) and disease-free survival (p= 0.005) (multivariate analysis).Conclusion: Lymphatic microvessel density (detected by podoplanin immunohistochemistry)' especially intratumoural density' may be an independent predictor of lymphatic tumour spread and survival in supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma patients' and may be useful to guide decisions regarding additional surgery. © JLO (1984) Limited 2011.

80054952939	Wogonin, an active ingredient of Chinese herb medicine Scutellaria baicalensis, inhibits the mobility and invasion of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells by inducing the expression of maspin	Ethnopharmacological relevance: A traditional Chinese medicine Scutellaria baicalensis is prescribed for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases and tumors in clinic in China. However, the detailed mechanism of anti-metastasis effect of wogonin, a main active ingredient of Scutellaria baicalensis, remains elusive. Aim of the study: The present study was designed to investigate the action and mechanism of wogonin on the mobility and invasion of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells. Materials and methods: Viability, apoptosis, mRNA and protein expression of tumor cells were analyzed by MTT, Annexin V staining, real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The migration and invasion assay was used to evaluate the anti-metastasis effect of wogonin. Knockdown of maspin was performed by specific small interference RNA. Results: Wogonin at the dose of 1-10 μM, which did not induce apoptosis, significantly inhibited the mobility and invasion activity of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells. In addition, the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) but not phosphorylated Akt were dramatically suppressed by wogonin in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the metastasis suppressor maspin was confirmed as the downstream target of wogonin. Both maspin mRNA and protein were upregulated by wogonin. Interestingly, the knockdown of maspin resulted in almost completely blocking of wogonin-induced inhibition of MMP-2, MMP-9 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 as well as the mobility and invasion activity of GBC-SD cells. Conclusions: These findings suggest that wogonin inhibits cell mobility and invasion by upregulating the metastasis suppressor maspin. Together, these data provide novel insights into the chemoprotective effect of wogonin, a main active ingredient of Chinese medicine Scutellaria baicalensis. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

80053912923	The inhibitory effects of 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone on human colon cancer cells	Scope: Previously, we reported that 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone (5HHMF), a polymethoxyflavone found in citrus peels, potently inhibited the growth of multiple human colon cancer cells. Herein, we further investigated the anti-cancer mechanisms of 5HHMF in human colon cancer cells. Methods and results: Colony formation assay revealed that 5HHMF dose dependently inhibited colony formation of multiple colon cancer cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated 5HHMF decreased nuclear β-catenin levels and increased the E-cadherin level in a dose-dependent manner. 5HHMF also modified plasma membrane-associated proteins, such as K-Ras, EGFR, and their downstream effectors, such as Akt. Moreover, treatments with 5HHMF inhibited nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which may contribute to its anti-cancer effects. Add-back study showed that the inhibitory effect of 5HHMF was not associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, 5HHMF treatment inhibited the capillary tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on matrigel, suggesting a potential anti-tumor angiogenesis effect. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that 5HHMF suppressed multiple oncogenic molecular events in colon cancer cells. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84855370357	Spatial and temporal variations in grain size of surface sediments in the littoral area of yellow river delta	The impacts of human activities on the sediment load of the Yellow River and the long-term evolution of the delta have been extensively investigated, but less is known of the variation in sediment grain size in the littoral zone. In this study, the data of surface sediment samples collected from the littoral area of the Yellow River Delta in 2000 and 2007 are used to investigate the spatial distribution and transport pathway of the sediment, as well as the grain size response to the drastic decrease in riverine sediment discharge. By applying the geostatistics analysis method to grain size parameters in determining the characteristic distance in the sediment trend analysis method, an effective way to understand the movement and gradation of surface sediments around the delta has been proposed. The results show that as a whole the sediment in the inshore erosion area is coarser than that in the offshore accretion area. The grain size trends obtained reveal two converging zones of sediment movement. We find a coarsening trend in sediment from 2000 to 2007. Possible mechanisms for this trend are discussed. © 2012, the Coastal Education & Research Foundation (CERF). © 2012 Coastal Education & Research Foundation.

84859739071	Synergistic anti-inflammatory effects of nobiletin and sulforaphane in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells	Inflammation plays important roles in the initiation and progress of many diseases including cancers in multiple organ sites. Herein, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of two dietary compounds, nobiletin (NBN) and sulforaphane (SFN), in combination. Noncytotoxic concentrations of NBN, SFN, and their combinations were studied in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The results showed that combined NBN and SFN treatments produced much stronger inhibitory effects on the production of nitric oxide (NO) than NBN or SFN alone at higher concentrations. These enhanced inhibitory effects were synergistic based on the isobologram analysis. Western blot analysis showed that combined NBN and SFN treatments synergistically decreased iNOS and COX-2 protein expression levels and induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expression. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that low doses of NBN and SFN in combination significantly suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of IL-1 mRNA levels and synergistically increased HO-1 mRNA levels. Overall, our results demonstrated that NBN and SFN in combination produced synergistic effects in inhibiting LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84862929921	Vimentin significantly promoted gallbladder carcinoma metastasis	Background The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) metastasis has not been fully elucidated. Methods In the present study, metastasis-associated proteins were identified by comparative proteomic analysis. The functional study of the candidate protein vimentin was further investigated. First, a pair of higher and lower metastatic sublines (termed GBC-SD/M3 and GBC-SD, respectively), originated from the same parental cell line, was screened by spontaneous tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo in animal study and further characterized by metastatic phenotypes analysis in vitro. Subsequently, a proteomic approach comprised two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis and mass spectroscopy was used to identify and compare the protein expression patterns between higher metastatic GBC-SD/M3 and lower metastatic GBC-SD cell lines. Then twenty-six proteins were identified. Results Among the 26 proteins identified, fourteen proteins were up-regulated and 12 proteins were down-regulated in GBC-SD/M3. Vimentin was identified and found to be overexpressed in GBC-SD/M3 as compared with GBC-SD. This result was further confirmed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis. Furthermore, the cell migration and invasion potency of GBC-SD/M3 in vitro was remarkably suppressed after small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of vimentin. Moreover, immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis on 12 human GBC specimens showed consistently increased vimentin expression in metastases compared with primary tumors. Conclusion Tumor vimentin level may reflect the pathological progression in some GBC and may be a useful marker for predicting tumor metastasis and a therapeutic target for the treatment of GBC patients with metastases.

84864572375	Experimental research on unstable movements of sandbars under wave actions	This study is motivated by recognition of complex sandbar evolution patterns under wave actions inside the surf zone. A series of physical model experiments were conducted in a wave flume to investigate sandbar migration under various wave conditions, including wave groups, regular waves, and random waves. It was observed that under certain wave conditions sandbars move alternately shoreward and seaward rather than continuously in the same direction. The measurements show that the unstable movement of sandbars is closely related to the amplitude modulation of waves. Smaller amplitude modulation tends to produce more intense unstable bar movements. Data analysis further shows that the sandbar migration does not seem to be a passive response of the sea bed to wave forcing, but is most likely caused by the feedback interaction between waves and bed topography.

84865118292	Primary closure versus T-tube drainage in laparoscopic common bile duct exploration: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials	Purpose: To compare the safety and effectiveness of primary closure with those of T-tube drainage in laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) for choledocholithiasis. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed in the PubMed, EmBase, and Cochrane Library databases. Only randomized controlled trials comparing primary closure with T-tube drainage in LCBDE were considered eligible for this meta-analysis. The analyzed outcome variables included postoperative mortality, overall morbidity, biliary complication rate, biliary leak rate, reoperation, operating time, postoperative hospital stay, time to abdominal drain removal, and retained stone. All calculations and statistical tests were performed using ReviewerManager 5.1.2 software. Results: A total of 295 patients (148 patients with primary closure and 147 patients with T-tube drainage) from three trials were identified and analyzed. No deaths occurred in any of the trials. Primary closure showed significantly better results in terms of morbidity (risk ratio (RR), 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.30 to 0.88), biliary complication without a combination of retained stone (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.97), reoperation (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.87), operating time (mean difference (MD), -20.72; 95% CI, -29.59 to -11.85), postoperative hospital stay (MD, -3.24; 95% CI, -3.96 to -2.52), and time to abdominal drainage removal (MD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.86 to -0.04). Statistically significant differences were not found between the two methods in terms of biliary leak, biliary complication, and retained stones. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis indicates that primary closure of the common bile duct is safer and more effective than T-tube drainage for LCBDE. Therefore, we do not recommend routine performance of T-tube drainage in LCBDE. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84868693127	Differential gene expression profiles of gastric cancer	Objective: To explore the different gene expressions of normal versus tumor tissues of gastric cancer at molecular levels. Methods: Gene chip technology was used to determine the differentially expressed genes between gastric cancer (n = 12) and normal tissues (n = 12) from December 2009 to June 2010 of Xinhua Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. And reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed to validate the results of gene chip analysis. Results: Sixty-nine up-regulated genes and 80 down-regulated genes were identified by significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). And these genes were correlated with cell adhesion, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis, et al. They were also closely correlated with the signaling pathways of Wnt (1/151, 0.66%) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (2/76, 2.63%). The differential expressions of ATP4A, CLDN10, OLFM4, SAA1 and PROK2 were confirmed by RT-PCR (0.94 ± 0.19 vs 4.33 ± 0.39, 1.00 ± 0.14 vs 3.04 ± 0.26, 5.37 ± 0.30 vs 1.02 ± 0.14, 4.37 ± 0.30 vs 0.95 ± 0.29, 2.62 ± 0.54 vs 1.35 ± 0.35, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: The classifier genes identified in this study may be closely correlated with the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.

84869850173	Spatial and temporal variability of water discharge in the Yellow River Basin over the past 60 years	Water discharge data of the Yellow River over the past 60 years was analyzed using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Mann-Kendall (MK) test methods to identify spatial and temporal variation patterns. Potential connections between water discharge in the Yellow River Basin and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were also examined by the cross wavelet and wavelet coherence methods. CWT results show that the periodic oscillations in water discharges had occurred at the temporal scales of 1-, 2- to 4-, 6- to 8- and 10- to 22-year. It was also found that at the annual timescale (1-year) the phase relations between water discharge and ENSO were indistinct probably due to the strong influence by human disturbances. However, over the longer time scales, the phase relation becomes much clearer with an anti-phase relation being found mainly at inter-annual scale (2- to 8-year) and in-phase relation at decadal scale (16- to 22-year). According to the MK test results water discharge at most stations except Tangnaihai have decreased significantly and the abrupt change occurred in the mid-1980s or the early 1990s. The changes in water discharge were found to be influenced by both climate changes and human activities. Before 1970 the change in water discharge was positively related to precipitation variations in the river basin, but after 1970 the decrease in water discharge has been largely caused by various human activities including constructions of reservoirs, water abstraction and water-soil conservation with water abstraction being the main cause. © 2012 Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84871692397	Characteristic gene expression profiles in the progression from normal gastric epithelial cells to moderate gastric epithelial dysplasia and to gastric cancer	Background Gastric cancer ranks high among the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. This study was designed to explore key genes involved in the progression of normal gastric epithelial cells to moderate gastric epithelial dysplasia (mGED) and to gastric cancer. Methods Twelve pairs of mGED tissues, gastric cancer tissues, and normal gastric tissues were collected by gastroscopy Total RNA was then extracted and purified. After the addition of fluorescent tags, hybridization was carried out on a Gene chip microarray slide. Significance analysis of microarrays was performed to determine significant differences in gene expression between the different tissue types. Results Microarray data analysis revealed totally 34 genes that were expressed differently: 18 highly expressed (fold change >2; P <0.01) and 16 down-regulated (fold change >2; P <0.01). Of the 34 genes, 24 belonged to several different functional categories such as structural molecule activity, extracellular regions, structural formation, cell death, biological adhesion, developmental processes, locomotion, and biological regulation that were associated with cancer. The remaining 10 genes were not involved in cancer research. Of these genes, the expression levels of Matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12), Caspase-associated recruitment domain 14 (CARD14), and Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) were confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. A two-way clustering algorithm divided the 36 samples into three categories and the overall correct classification efficiency was 80.6% (29/36). Almost all of these genes (31/34) showed constant changes in the process of normal gastric epithelial cells to mGED to gastric cancer. Conclusions The results of this study provided global gene expression profiles during the development and progression from normal gastric epithelial cells to mGED to gastric cancer. These data may provide new insights into the molecular pathology of gastric cancer which may be useful for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

84872776825	Overexpression of LSD1 in hepatocellular carcinoma: A latent target for the diagnosis and therapy of hepatoma	The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of LSD1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and HCC samples. In this study, we examined LSD1 expression in 60 paired liver cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues by Western blot. In addition, we analyzed LSD1 expression in 198 HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between LSD1 expression and clinicopathological features was investigated. The HCC cell line SMMC-7721 was transfected with LSD1 siRNA expressing plasmids. We subsequently examined in vitro cell growth using the MTT assay and anchorage-independent growth through a soft-agar colony-formation assay. In addition, the expression levels of Bcl-2 and c-Myc were also examined. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting consistently confirmed LSD1 overexpression in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-neoplastic tissues (P < 0.01). Additionally, immunostaining showed more LSD1-positive cells in the higher tumor stage (T3-4) and tumor grade (G3) than in the lower tumor stage (T1-2, P < 0.001) and tumor grade (G1-2, P < 0.001). Knockdown of LSD1 expression in HCC cells led to decreased cell proliferation. The expression of Bcl-2 and c-Myc were down-regulated after transfection of LSD1 siRNA into HCC cell line SMMC-7721. In conclusion, because LSD1 was overexpressed in HCC and has an important role in the development of HCC, LSD1 could be a latent target in the diagnosis and therapy of HCC. © 2012 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

84872893327	Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway inhibits growth of human hemangioma via downregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen	Protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of multiple tumors, and has been shown to be important therapeutic targets for cancer. The present study aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanisms of AKT/mTOR pathway in human hemangioma (HA). Twenty-five cases of human HA tissues were collected. The expression of AKT, mTOR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) proteins was evaluated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples in different phases of HA. AKT/mTOR pathway was blocked by recombinant small hairpin RNA adenovirus vector rAd5-AKT+mTOR (rAd5-Am), used for infecting proliferating phase HA-derived endothelial cells (HDEC). The expression of AKT, mTOR and PCNA was detected by Real-time PCR and Western blot assays. Cell proliferative activities were determined by MTT assay, and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. As a consequence, the expression of AKT, mTOR and PCNA was significantly increased in proliferative phase HA, while that was decreased in involutive phase. Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway by rAd5-Am diminished cell proliferative activities, and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest with the decreased expression of AKT, mTOR and PCNA in proliferative phase HDEC. In conclusion, the activity of AKT/mTOR pathway was increased in proliferative phase HA, while it was decreased in involutive phase. Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway might suppress cell proliferation via down-regulation of PCNA expression, and induce apoptosis and cycle arrest in proliferative phase HDEC, suggesting that AKT/mTOR pathway might represent the important therapeutic targets for human HA.

84872939937	Ethyl pyruvate administration suppresses growth and invasion of gallbladder cancer cells via downregulation of HMGB1-RAGE axis	High mobility group box B1 (HMGB1)-receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) axis has been previously known to be involved in carcinogenesis and development of multiple malignancies. Some studies have confirmed that Ethyl pyruvate (EP), a potent inhibitor of HMGB1, exerts the therapeutic effects on metastatic live tumor from gastric cancer. However, the effects and possible molecular mechanisms of EP on gallbladder cancer (GBC) need to be further explored. In the present study, human GBC cell lines (GBC-SD and SGC-996) were treated with different concentrations of EP. Then, the expression levels of HMGB1, RAGE and some transcription factors were identified by Real-time PCR and Western blot assays. Cell proliferative activities indicated by MTT assay, invasive potential by Transwell assay and cell apoptosis and cycle distribution were performed for functional analysis of GBC cell lines in vitro. As a result, EP decreased the expression of HMGB11, RAGE, PCNA and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), while it increased the expression of p53. Moreover, EP administration decreased GBC cell proliferation, inhibited the invasive potential, and induced apoptosis and cycle arrest in S phase in GBC cells. In conclusion, EP administration inhibits growth and invasion of gallbladder cancer cells possibly via down-regulation of the HMGB1-RAGE axis, suggesting that EP may play a critical role in the treatment of cancer in conjunction with other therapeutic agents.

84873919440	Overexpression of lysine specific demethylase 1 predicts worse prognosis in primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients	AIM: To investigate the clinicopathological features and prognostic value of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We examined LSD1 expression in 60 paired liver cancer tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. In addition, we analyzed LSD1 expression in 198 HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between LSD1 expression, clinicopathological features and patient survival was investigated. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR consistently confirmed LSD1 overexpression in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-neoplastic tissues (P < 0.01). Additionally, immunostaining showed more LSD1-positive cells in the higher tumor stage (T3-4) and tumor grade (G3) than in the lower tumor stage (T1-2, P < 0.001) and tumor grade (G1-2, P < 0.001), respectively. Moreover, HCC patients with high LSD1 expression had significantly lower 5-year overall survival rates (P < 0.001) and lower 5-year disease-free survival rates (P < 0.001), respectively. A Cox proportional hazards model further demonstrated that LSD1 over-expression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis for both 5-year disease-free survival [hazards ratio (HR) = 1.426, 95%CI: 0.672-2.146, P < 0.001] and 5-year overall survival (HR = 2.456, 95%CI: 1.234-3.932, P < 0.001) in HCC. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest for the first time that the overexpression of LSD1 protein in HCC tissues indicates tumor progression and predicts poor prognosis. © 2012 Baishideng.

84874064561	Diagnostic value of human epididymis protein 4 compared with mesothelin for ovarian cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Background and Purpose: Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers because of the lack of effective early detection methods. Accuracies of the human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and mesothelin in detecting ovarian cancer have never been systematically assessed. The current systematic review aimed to tackle this issue. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched (September 1995-November 2011) for studies on the diagnostic performances of HE4 and mesothelin in differentiating ovarian cancer from other benign gynecologic diseases. QUADAS items were used to evaluate the qualities of the studies. Meta-DiSc software was used to handle data from the included studies and to examine heterogeneity. All included studies for diagnostic performance were combined with sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, and areas under the SROC curves (AUC). Results: A total of 18 studies and 3,865 patients were eligible for the final analysis. The pooled sensitivity estimates for HE4 (74.4%) were significantly higher than those for mesothelin (49.3%). The pooled specificity estimates for mesothelin (94.5%) were higher than those for HE4 (85.8%). The pooled DOR estimates for HE4 (26.22) were higher than those for mesothelin (24.01). The SROC curve for HE4 showed better diagnostic accuracy than that for mesothelin. The PLR and NLR of HE4 were 6.33 (95% CI: 3.58 to 11.18) and 0.27 (95% CI: 0.21 to 0.34), respectively. The PLR and NLR for mesothelin were 11.0 (95% CI: 6.21 to 19.59) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42 to 0.62), respectively. The combination of the two tumor markers or their combination with CA-125 increased sensitivity and specificity to different extents. Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of HE4 in differentiating ovarian cancer from other benign gynecologic diseases is better than that of soluble mesothelin-related protein. Combinations of two or more tumor markers show more sensitivity and specificity.

84876309046	Long-term (1842-2006) morphological change and equilibrium state of the Changjiang (Yangtze) Estuary, China	The 165 year morphological evolution of the Changjiang (Yangtze) Estuary and its long-term equilibrium characteristics have been investigated using 16 selected maritime charts from 1842 to 2006. These charts were digitized and analyzed with a GIS to provide quantitative estimates of geomorphologic changes below selected bottom elevations. The results show that the Changjiang Estuary has experienced overall erosion over this 165 year period, having been affected by several large erosion and deposition episodes. It is found that the overall volume changes are less than 10% and aspect ratios of <5 have increased from 2% to ca. 30%. During this period, both coastlines and thalwegs have become straighter and more aligned with the propagation direction of offshore tidal current, indicating that the estuary is approaching dynamic equilibrium. Based on variations of aspect ratios and thalweg movements, five types of stable channels were identified. Significant topographical changes, including infilling after 1958 and erosion after 1980, are principally associated with engineering work around the estuary and a reduction in sediment supply. Although human influence only notably occurred at certain locations in the estuary, such as upstream node of an estuary, it had a significant impact on the overall geomorphologic evolution. In addition to these anthropogenic effects, freshwater flow, sediment discharges, tide propagation and Coriolis force are also found to play important roles in channel development within the estuary. By contrast, changes in other factors such as sea level changes and wave climate were considered to be of relatively minor importance in the morphological evolution process of the estuary. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84878703526	Expression of UbcH10 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its correlation with prognosis	The aim of this current study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features and prognostic significance of UbcH10 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was employed to examine UbcH10 expression in 20 pairs of PDA and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, UbcH10 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 94 clinicopathologically characterized PDA cases. The correlation of UbcH10 expression with patients' survival rate was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Our results showed that the expression levels of UbcH10 mRNA and protein in PDA tissues were both significantly higher than those in non-cancerous tissues. Simultaneously, high expression of UbcH10 was significantly correlated with the clinical stage (p < 0.001), degree of histological differentiation (p < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001). Moreover, high expression of UbcH10 was significantly associated with poor overall survival in PDA patients. In conclusion, UbcH10 might play a positive role in tumor development and could serve as an independent predictor of poor prognosis for PDA. © 2013 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

84879804128	Expansion of trinucleotide repetitive sequences and its mechanism	Simple repetitive sequences are widely present in genomes of most organisms. They are closely related to molecular evolution, genetic diversity, molecular marker and some hereditary diseases. In this article, all of the 18 bp trinucleotide repetitive double strand sequences were used, and their expansion by DNA polymerase was researched systematically. We discussed the factors including reaction temperature and sequence which influence the amplification efficiency and the length of product. The result showed that almost all of the repeats can be elongated, and the variance in sequence had great effect on the amplification efficiency. The repeats with more GC, especially those with G and C in one of the strands were much easier to grow. Duplexes with one strand containing only A and C were amplified a lot as well. The optimum reaction temperature and the GC content of the duplexes had a positive correlation. Agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the product has narrow size distribution of molecules, and the expansion has a linear dependence of the length of products on the reaction time. Differentiation of the products occurred more at higher reaction temperatures. At last, a slippage model demonstrating the mechanism of duplex expansion was discussed, and it is promising to be used for explanation of molecular evolution and unusual expansion of repetitive sequences during gene amplification and detection.

84879090965	Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus multi-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials	Background: Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is theoretically supposed to be associated with better cosmetic results and less surgical-site pain than multi-incision laparoscopic cholesystectomy (MILC). So far, several relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, but the results are conflicting. Materials and Methods: Meta-analysis was conducted with all the qualified RCTs comparing SILC with MILC. The databases include PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Library, and the censor data were collected up to November 2011. The analyzed outcome variables included postoperative pain score, analgesia requirements, morbidity, conversion rate, operative time, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative cosmetic score. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle, if possible. All the calculations and statistical tests were performed using ReviewerManager version 5.1.2 software. Results: Nine trials with a total of 755 patients (SILC in 400 patients, MILC in 355 patients) were identified and analyzed. SILC resulted in significantly longer operative time (P=.005) and higher postoperative cosmetic score on Day 30 after operation (P<.00001). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of postoperative pain score, analgesia requirements, morbidity, conversion rate, and postoperative hospital stay. Conclusions: Based on the current meta-analysis, SILC appears to be as safe and effective as MILC to remove the gallbladder and results in a longer operative time and higher cosmetic satisfaction on Day 30 after surgery. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

84880772850	Surgical management of patients with bowel obstructions secondary to gastric cancer	AIM: To assess whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the management of small bowel obstructions (SBOs) secondary to gastric cancer and its role in treatment strategies. METHODS: The medical records of all of the patients who were admitted for an intestinal obstruction after curative resection for gastric cancer were retrospectively reviewed. PET/CT was performed before a clinical treatment strategy was established for each patient. The patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with no evidence of a tumor recurrence and patients with evidence of a tumor recurrence. Tumor recurrences included a local recurrence, peritoneal carcinomatosis or distant metastases. The primary endpoint was the 1-year survival rate, and other variables included patient demographics, the length of hospital stay, complications, and mortality. RESULTS: The median time between a diagnosis of gastric cancer and the detection of a SBO was 1.4 years. Overall, 31 of 65 patients (47.7%) had evidence of a tumor recurrence on the PET/CT scan, which was the only factor that was associated with poor survival. Open and close surgery was the main type of surgical procedure reported for the patients with tumor recurrences. R0 resections were performed in 2 patients, including 1 who underwent combined adjacent organ resection. In the group with no evidence of a tumor recurrence on PET/CT, bowel resections were performed in 7 patients, adhesiolysis was performed in 7 patients, and a bypass was performed in 1 patient. The 1-year survival curves according to PET/CT evidence of a tumor recurrence vs no PET/CT evidence of a tumor recurrence were significantly different, and the 1-year survival rates were 8.8% vs 93.5%, respectively. There were no significant differences (P = 0.71) in the 1-year survival rates based on surgical vs nonsurgical management (0% with nonoperative treatment vs 20% after exploratory laparotomy). CONCLUSION:

84882735032	An efficient shock capturing algorithm to the extended Boussinesq wave equations	A hybrid finite-volume and finite-difference method is proposed for numerically solving the two-dimensional (2D) extended Boussinesq equations. The governing equations are written in such a way that the convective flux is approximated using finite volume (FV) method while the remaining terms are discretized using finite difference (FD) method. Multi-stage (MUSTA) scheme, instead of commonly used HLL or Roe schemes, is adopted to evaluate the convective flux as it has the simplicity of centred scheme and accuracy of upwind scheme. The third order Runge-Kutta method is used for time marching. Wave breaking and wet-dry interface are also treated in the model. In addition to model validation, the emphasis is given to compare the merits and limitations of using MUSTA scheme and HLL scheme in the model. The analytical and experimental data available in the literature have been used for the assessment. Numerical tests demonstrate that the developed model has the advantages of stability preserving, shock-capturing and numerical efficiency when applied in the complex nearshore region. Compared with that using HLL scheme, the proposed model has comparable numerical accuracy, but requires slightly less computation time and is much simpler to code. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84885019307	Application of a stochastic differential equation to the prediction of shoreline evolution	Shoreline evolution due to longshore sediment transport is one of the most important problems in coastal engineering and management. This paper describes a method to predict the probability distributions of long-term shoreline positions in which the evolution process is based on the standard one-line model recast into a stochastic differential equation. The time-dependent and spatially varying probability density function of the shoreline position leads to a Fokker-Planck equation model. The behaviour of the model is evaluated by applying it to two simple shoreline configurations: a single long jetty perpendicular to a straight shoreline and a rectangular beach nourishment case. The sensitivity of the model predictions to variations in the wave climate parameters is shown. The results indicate that the proposed model is robust and computationally efficient compared with the conventional Monte Carlo simulations. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84886789774	Identification of novel bioactive metabolites of 5-demethylnobiletin in mice	Scope: Biotransformation of dietary components is important for their in vivo biological activities after oral ingestion. Herein, we investigated biotransformation of 5-demethylnobiletin (a polymethoxyflavone found in citrus fruits) in mice, and its implication in the inhibition of human colon cancer cells. Methods and results: Urine samples were collected from mice fed with 5-demethylnobiletin (1) and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS and HPLC coupled with an electrochemical detector. Three major metabolites were identified as 5,3′-didemethylnobiletin (2), 5,4′-didemethylnobiletin (3), and 5,3′,4′-tridemethylnobiletin (4) by comparing their ESI-MS and HPLC profiles with those of authentic standards synthesized by a multistep route. Cell viability assay in human colon cancer cells demonstrated that all three metabolites of 5-demethylnobiletin, especially 5,3′-didemethylnobiletin (2), showed much stronger inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth than 5-demethylnobiletin. For example, metabolites (2-4) showed IC

84890550610	The role of prophylactic transpapillary pancreatic stenting in distal pancreatectomy: A meta-analysis	Pancreatic fistula (PF) is the most frequent complication after distal pancreatectomy (DP). Prophylactic transpapillary pancreatic stenting (PTPS) has been proposed recently for the prevention of PF after DP. In this meta-analysis, a comprehensive search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies analyzing the results of PTPS in DP were considered eligible for this meta-analysis. The analyzed outcome variables included PF rate, postoperative morbidity, non-PF-related complications, mortality, operation duration, and hospital stay. Four studies with 200 patients were included in this review. Only one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The results showed that PTPS was associated with less PF formation (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.94; P = 0.03) and shorter hospital stay (mean difference, - 6.31; 95% CI, - 6.99 to - 5.62; P < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in terms of the other variables. In conclusion, current evidence indicates that PTPS could reduce PF incidence and hospital stay after DP, without increasing other complications or operative time. However, the evidence is not solid, because the single RCT conflicted with the other three retrospective reports. Thus, considering the limitation, more well-designed RCTs on this topic are needed in the future. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84891915153	Knockdown of Livin inhibits growth and invasion of gastric cancer cells through blockade of the MAPK pathway in vitro and in vivo	Livin, a novel member of the human inhibitors of apoptosis protein family, has been shown to be critical for tumor progression and poor prognosis for several types of malignancies. However, limited reports exist regarding the biological functions of Livin in human gastric cancer (GC). The present study investigated the clinical significance of Livin and caspase-3 (CAS-3) in human GC using immunohistochemistry assay, and explore the potential using RNA interference to knockdown Livin expression, including the subsequent effects on tumor growth and invasion in GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that the rate of positive expression of Livin was significantly higher in GC tissues compared to that in adjacent non-cancer tissues (ANCT) (64.1 vs. 30.8%, P<0.001), while CAS-3 was lower in GC tissues than in ANCT (33.3 vs. 66.7%, P=0.001). Livin expression was positively correlated with tumor differentiation and lymph node metastases (P=0.009; P=0.007), while CAS-3 was negatively correlated with them (P=0.036; P=0.002) in patients with GC. Furthermore, knockdown of Livin inhibited cell proliferative activities and invasive potential, and induced cell in situ apoptosis in GC cells, accompanied with decreased expression of p38 MAPK, VEGF and MMP-2 and increased expression of CAS-3. In addition, the tumor volumes in the SGC7901 subcutaneous nude mouse model treated with Lv-shLivin was significantly smaller compared to those of the PBS group (P<0.01). Taken together, our findings indicate that the expression of Livin is increased in human GC and correlates with tumor differentiation and lymph node metastases, while knockdown of Livin inhibits cell growth and invasion through blockade of the MAPK pathway in GC cells, suggesting that Livin may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GC.

84893031006	Role of polymorphisms of the IGF2 and IGFBP3 genes and risk of gastric carcinoma in China	Background The insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway plays an important role in the modulation of cell growth and proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of polymorphisms of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) genes, which encode key proteins of this pathway, as risk factors for gastric carcinoma (GC). Methods A case-control study including 404 histologically confirmed GC patients and 424 healthy controls of the same ethnicity was conducted to retrospectively investigate the genetic polymorphisms of two genes, IGF2+820A>G (rs680) and IGFBP3 A-202C (rs2854744). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Logistic regression. Results The IGF2 genetic variants examined contributed to GC risk individually (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.46). The genotype frequencies of IGFBP3 A-202C were not significantly different between the cancer cases and controls (P >0.05). Compared to the IGF2 AA genotype, carriers of one variant combined genotype were more pronounced among young subjects (<60 years), male subjects, never smokers, and those with a family history of cancer (OR=1.36, 95% CI=1.09-1.72, P <0.05; OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.28-2.08, P <0.05; OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.11-1.98, P <0.05; OR=1.53, 95% CI=0.91-2.6, P <0.05; respectively). Moreover, when the combined effects of the risk genotypes were investigated, significant associations were detected between highrisk genotypes in IGF2 and IGFBP3 (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.75-3.49). Conclusions Our results suggest that polymorphic variants of the IGF2 genes modulate gastric carcinogenesis. Moreover, when the IGF2 and IGFBP3 variants are evaluated together, a greater effect on GC risk is observed.

84894127789	Effects of different processing methods on oyster DNA	Chemical state of nucleic acids in oyster affects its flavor and gene analysis. In this study, the effect of food processing on oyster DNA was studied. After processing fresh oysters by microwave, freeze-thaw, grinding, salting, high temperature, DNA, and free bases were extracted. DNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and free bases were determined by LC-MS. The results showed that oyster DNA was affected differently by the five processing methods. Microwave brought out the denatured DNA, high-temperature caused the rupture of genomic DNA, both freeze-thaw and grinding affected the molecular weight of oyster DNA slightly, while salting can increase the stability of DNA in oyster. Bases showed different sensitivity to the applied processing methods. Base pair G-C escaped from DNA strands together. High-temperature caused depurination. The results will be helpful for the development of typical flavor food, analysis of DNA from processing food, and studies on nucleic acids metabolism diseases. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84894199958	Detection of DNA target with highly enhanced specificity by self-circularization rolling circle amplification	DNA detection is widely used for gene analysis. However, false-positive results are difficult to be avoided due to the non-specific amplification. Here, we described a novel RCA approach to improve the specificity. With the help of TspR I (endonuclease), DNA was cleaved into smaller duplex fragments, including the target DNA fragment, with 9 nt sticky ends. A duplex adaptor with two sticky ends which were complementary to that of the target fragment was designed. After hybridization of the adaptor with the target fragments, T4 DNA ligase was used to ligate them to form a circular ds DNA with a gap. Then RCA was carried out from the free 3′-end of the open strand by Phi29 DNA polymerase with two primers which were complementary to the target sequence. Different from the traditional padlock-RCA, SC-RCA showed excellent specificity by amplifying the specific DNA target other than the added probe. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84894207309	Evaluation of a whole genome amplification method based on improved ligation-mediated PCR	DNA sequencing, genotyping, detection, and SNPs analysis usually require large amount of DNA. In the case that only tiny amount of DNA can be collected from samples, the whole genome amplification (WGA) technique is a good choice for its high efficiency. As a WGA method, ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) has the shortcoming that strict conditions are required to avoid biased DNA amplification. Here, we used TspR I endonuclease to digest the target DNA into fragments with 9-nt-long (NNCASTGNN) sticky ends in which 4-5 different bases from other fragments are present. After ligation of these fragments to a universal adaptor, all the fragments will have ends with the same sequence for PCR, and the outstanding WGA was obtained by using only a uniform primer. The efficiency and sensitivity of this technique were evaluated and its application for DNA detection was also discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84896271438	Numerical simulation of wave interaction with porous structures using an improved smoothed particle hydrodynamic method	A smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) model is developed to simulate wave interaction with porous structures. The mean flow outside the porous structures is obtained by solving Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the turbulence field is calculated by a large eddy simulation (LES) model. The porous flow is described by the spatially averaged Navier-Stokes type equations with the resistance effect of the porous media being represented by an empirical frictional source term. The interface boundaries between the porous flow and the outside flow are modeled by means of specifying a transition zone along the interface. The model is validated against other available numerical results and experimental data for wave damping over porous seabed with different levels of permeability. The validated model is then employed to investigate wave breaking over a submerged porous breakwater and good agreements between the SPH model results and the experimental data are obtained in terms of free surface displacement. In addition the predicted velocity, vorticity and pressure fields near the porous breakwater and in the breaking wave zone are also analyzed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84896836568	Evaluation of two inflammation-based prognostic scores in patients with resectable gallbladder carcinoma	Background: Survival after surgery for gallbladder cancer is generally poor. A number of inflammation-based prognostic scores have been established to help predict survival after surgery for several types of cancer. The objective of this study was to analyze and compare the utility of two inflammation-based prognostic scores, the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), for predicting survival in patients with gallbladder cancer after surgery with curative intent. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 85 patients with histologically confirmed, resectable gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), who were to receive curative surgery in our department. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between the variables to overall survival (OS). Results: A significant difference was detected in OS in patients with low and high GPS and NLR scores. Univariate analyses using clinicopathological characteristics revealed that tumor differentiation; tumor invasion; lymph node metastasis; tumor, node, metastasis classification system stage; positive margin status; combined common bile duct resection; serum levels of C-reactive protein, albumin, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA125; white blood cell count; and GPS and NLR were all associated with OS. Among these characteristics, multivariate analysis demonstrated that a high GPS was independently associated with poorer OS, together with tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and positive margin status. Conclusions: GPS is superior to NLR with respect to its prognostic value for patients with GBC after surgery with curative intent. GPS is not only associated with tumor progression but is also an independent marker of poor prognosis. © 2013 Society of Surgical Oncology.

84898622002	Knockdown of VEGFR2 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in hemangiomaderived endothelial cells	Angiogenesis is a process of development and growth of new capillary blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenic growth factors play important roles in the development and maintenance of some malignancies, of which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR2 interactions are involved in proliferation, migration, and survival of many cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of VEGFR2 in human hemangiomas (HAs). Using immunohistochemistry assay, we examined the expression levels of VEGF, VEGFR2, Ki-67, glucose transporter- 1 (Glut-1), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and p-ERK in different phases of human HAs. Positive expression of VEGF, VEGFR2, Ki-67, Glut-1, p-AKT and p-ERK was significantly increased in proliferating phase HAs, while decreased in involuting phase HAs (P=0.001; P=0.003). In contrast, cell apoptotic indexes were decreased in proliferating phase HAs, but increased in involuting phase HAs (P<0.01). Furthermore, we used small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated VEGFR2 knockdown in primary HA-derived endothelial cells (HemECs) to understand the role of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling. Knockdown of VEGFR2 by Lv-shVEGFR2 inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in primary HemECs companied with decreased expression of p- AKT, p-ERK, p-p38MAPK and Ki-67 and increased expression of caspase-3 (CAS-3); Overexpression of VEGFR2 promoted cell viability and blocked apoptosis in Lv-VEGFR2- transfected HemECs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that, increased expression of VEGFR2 is involved in the development of primary HemECs possibly through regulation of the AKT and ERK pathways, suggesting that VEGFR2 may be a potential therapeutic target for HAs. © J.M.

Using geostatistic analysis, it is founded that there exist notable spatial autocorrelation of the clay and sand fractions in these samples with the autocorrelation scale being 44 km and 39 km, respectively. In comparison, the spatial autocorrelation of silt fraction is moderate, with the autocorrelation scale of 27 km. Analysis also reveals that the anisotropy of the sediment components is clear at the scale <20 km and >60 km and the distribution of the depocenters of sand fraction (i.e. content up to 40%) is very heterogeneous. Boundaries between these sedimentary units and their substratum are very sharp.

84903521029	Aging causes exacerbated ischemic brain injury and failure of sevoflurane post-conditioning: Role of B-cell lymphoma-2	Aging is associated with exacerbated brain injury after ischemic stroke. Herein, we explored the possible mechanisms underlying the age-associated exacerbated brain injury after ischemic stroke and determined whether therapeutic intervention with anesthetic post-conditioning would provide neuroprotection in aged rats. Male Fisher 344 rats (young, 4. months; aged, 24. months) underwent 2. h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion, with or without sevoflurane post-conditioning for 15. min immediately at the onset of reperfusion. Compared with young rats, aged rats showed larger infarct size, worse neurological scores and more TUNEL-positive cells in the penumbral cerebral cortex at 24. h after MCAO. However, edema formation and motor coordination were similar in both groups. Sevoflurane reduced the infarct size, edema formation, and TUNEL-positive cells, and improved the neurological outcome in young rats but not in aged rats. Molecular studies revealed that basal expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in the brain was lower in aged rats compared with young rats before MCAO, while basal expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) showed similar levels in both groups. MCAO reduced Bcl-2 expression and increased Bax expression in both groups; however, Bax increase was more pronounced in aged rats. In young rats, sevoflurane reversed the above MCAO-induced changes. In contrast, sevoflurane failed to enhance Bcl-2 expression but decreased Bax expression in aged rats. These findings suggest that aging-associated reduction in basal Bcl-2 expression in the brain contributes to increased neuronal injury by enhancing cell apoptosis after ischemic stroke. Sevoflurane post-conditioning failed to provide neuroprotection in aged rats, probably due to its inability to increase Bcl-2 levels and prevent apoptosis in the brain. © 2014 IBRO.

84904396177	Knockdown of IGF2R suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in hemangioma cells in vitro and in vivo	Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II)/IGF2R signaling plays a pivotal role in cell growth, migration and differentiation in many malignancies. An individual with high IGF-II expression levels has a high risk of developing cancer, but IGF2R is often considered to be a tumor suppressor. To date, little has been reported about the role of IGF-II/IGF2R signaling in hemangiomas (HAs). Thus, uncovering the mechanisms of IGF-II/IGF2R signaling is very important to understanding the development of HAs. In the present study, the expression of IGF-II and IGF2R was investigated in 27 cases of HAs of different phases by immunohistochemistry. Through lentivirus-mediated IGF2R siRNA (Lv-siIGF2R) in HA-derived endothelial cells (HDECs), we observed the effects of IGF2R knockdown on the biological behavior of HA cells. We found that the expression of IGF-II and IGF2R was significantly increased in proliferating phase HAs, but decreased in involuting phase HAs. Furthermore, knockdown of IGF2R in vitro significantly diminished the proliferative activity and induced apoptosis and cycle arrest with decreased expression of PCNA, Ki-67, Bcl-2, Cyclin D1 and E and increased the expression of Bax in the proliferative phase HAs (HDEC and CRL-2586 EOMA cells). In addition, the tumor volumes in a subcutaneous HDEC nude mouse model treated with Lv-siIGF2R were significantly smaller than those of the control group. Taken together, our findings indicate that the expression of IGF-II and IGF2R is increased in proliferating phase HAs, and knockdown of IGF2R suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in HA cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that IGF2R may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human HAs.

In this paper, a numerical model based on higher-order Boussinesq equations was developed to reproduce the number of experiments involved in such an investigation, with emphasis on the effect of computational domain size on the numerical results. A set of Boussinesq equations with optimum linear properties and second-order full nonlinearity were solved using a higher-order finite difference scheme. Wave breaking, moving shoreline, bottom friction, and mixing were all treated empirically. The developed model was first run to simulate the rip current under full spatial and time-domain conditions. The computed mean quantities, including wave height, mean water level, and mean current, were compared with the experimental data and favorable agreements were found. The effects of computational domain size on the computation results were then investigated by conducting numerical experiments. The Willmott index was introduced to evaluate the agreements between the computed results and data. Inter-comparisons between the computation results and measurements demonstrated that the computational domain size significantly influenced the numerical results. Thus, running a Boussinesq wave model under full spatial and time-domain conditions is recommended to reproduce Haller's experiment.

84905721813	Whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing of gallbladder carcinoma identifies recurrent mutations in the ErbB pathway	Individuals with gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), the most aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract, have a poor prognosis. Here we report the identification of somatic mutations for GBC in 57 tumor-normal pairs through a combination of exome sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing of cancer-related genes. The mutation pattern is defined by a dominant prevalence of C>T mutations at TCN sites. Genes with a significant frequency (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) of non-silent mutations include TP53 (47.1%), KRAS (7.8%) and ERBB3 (11.8%). Moreover, ErbB signaling (including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4 and their downstream genes) is the most extensively mutated pathway, affecting 36.8% (21/57) of the GBC samples. Multivariate analyses further show that cases with ErbB pathway mutations have a worse outcome (P = 0.001). These findings provide insight into the somatic mutational landscape in GBC and highlight the key role of the ErbB signaling pathway in GBC pathogenesis. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

84906872023	Highly specific DNA detection from massive background nucleic acids based on rolling circle amplification of target dsDNA	An advanced rolling circle amplification (RCA) strategy based on the target-circularization of the targeted double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was established. Different from the traditional padlock-RCA, in which single-stranded probe DNA was circularized and amplified as signal amplification, our new approach could amplify a double-stranded DNA target. This special circularization of the target was realized by the ligation of target DNA with a biotin-labelled duplex adaptor containing 9 nt sticky ends by complementary base pairing. High specificity was obtained using two primers targeting the target sequence but not the probe itself in traditional padlock-RCA. With the help of streptavidin magnetic beads that immobilized the ligated dsDNA amplicon, the background nucleic acids contributing the most to non-specific amplification were eliminated. Under optimized conditions, less than 60 copies of the target sequence could be detected in the presence of massive background nucleic acids (>10

84919947782	Wave impact simulations by an improved ISPH model	This paper presents an improved incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) method for wave impact applications. In most conventional ISPH techniques the source term of the pressure Poisson equation (PPE) is usually treated by either a density invariant or a velocity divergence-free formulation. In this work, both the density invariant and velocity divergence free formulations are combined in a weighted average form to determine the source term. The model is then applied to two problems: (1) dam-breaking wave impact on a vertical wall and (2) solitary wave run-up and impact on a coastal structure. The computational results have indicated that the combined source term treatment can predict the wave impact pressure and force more accurately compared with using either formulation alone. It was further found that depending on the application case, the influence of the density invariant and divergence-free parts could be quite different. For the more violent wave impact case, the divergence-free part played a more prominent role in ensuring accurate force simulations, while in less violent wave impact cases, the density invariant part seems to be more significant. A systematic parametric study has shown that the weighting coefficient in the PPE source term is independent of particle spacing under various wave impact situations. Also, a close relationship has been found between the ratio of flow height to length scales H/L and weighting coefficient a in the mixed pressure source term. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.
