15944401708	Spectral analysis of tomato late blight infections for remote sensing of tomato disease stress in California	California growers produce more than 86% of tomatoes in the United States. Late blight is one of the diseases threatening tomato crop productivity due to the aggressive nature of the disease. Monitoring crop growth and disease infections can be economically viable and ecologically sound. This study explores spectral analysis to identify the spectral relationships of the disease infections on tomatoes. Preliminary results indicated that there is a strong relationship between disease infection stages and the spectra reflectance at specific wavelength intervals. These spectral intervals include wavelength intervals of 600-690, 750-930, 950-1030, 1040-1130, 1450-1850, and 2000-2400. The relationship of the disease and spectral reflectance was developed using field spectra data and validated using hyperspectral image data with known disease infection locations and stages. On the basis of spectral analysis, 6 healthy indices has been proposed in the study for approach development and 3 of them have great potential to be applied in image analysis to identify the infected plants using hyperspectral remote sensing images. The results indicated that the DI

20844436166	Detection of rice sheath blight for in-season disease management using multispectral remote sensing	Timely diagnosis of crop diseases in fields is critical for precision on-farm disease management. Remote sensing technology can be used as an effective and inexpensive method to identify diseased plants in a field scale. However, due to the diversity of crops and their associated diseases, application of the technology to agriculture is still in research stage, which needs to be elaborately investigated for algorithm development and standard image processing procedures. In this paper, we examined the applicability of broadband high spatial-resolution ADAR (Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration) remote sensing data to detect rice sheath blight and developed an approach to further explore the applicability. Based on the field symptom measurements, a comprehensive field disease index (DI) was constructed to measure infection severity of the disease and to relate to image sampled infections. In addition to direct band digital number (DN) values, band ratio indices and standard difference indices were used to examine possible correlations between field and image data. The results indicated that the broadband remote sensing imagery has the capability to detect the disease. Some image indices such as RI

34547931883	Assessing the impact of leather industries on the quality of water discharged into the East China Sea from Wenzhou Watersheds	Ammonium nitrogen and total germanium are among the main pollutants in the wastewater discharged from the leather industry. The intake of high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and/or total germanium harms human health and biological species, as is well documented in literature. This paper focuses on assessing the trends of ammonium nitrogen and total germanium concentrations through time in two watersheds (Aojiang and Oujiang) in the Wenzhou metropolitan area of Zhejiang Province and their relationships with the released wastewater using regression and correlation statistics. The paper also utilizes the integrated pollution index to evaluate water quality in the two watersheds. Preliminary results show that, from 1992 to 1998 in the Aojing watershed, the concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and total germanium increased 13 and 14 times, respectively, decreasing somewhat after 1998, while between 1992 and 1997 in the Oujiang watershed, the concentrations increased, then decreased after 1997. The concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and total germanium are positively related to the amount of released wastewater. The concentrations of ammonium nitrogen and total germanium exceeded water standards 12 and 3 times, respectively, in Pingyang county of the Aojiang watershed, 14 and 3.3 times in Lucheng District of the Oujiang watershed, and 14 and 3.8 times in the Ouhai Oujiang watershed, respectively. In Pingyang county of the Aojiang watershed, the water quality degraded from Type III in 1992 to over Type V in 2003, and in the Oujiang watershed, the water quality degraded from Type II to over Type IV in 1999, when they were compared with the water quality standards. The water quality slightly improved in 2003 for the Oujiang watershed. It appears that pollution did have a direct positive correlation with leather industry production in the Pingyang Aojing watershed, while there was a negative correlation between the two in the Oujiang watershed. In these two watersheds, the integrated pollution index did not appear to relate to population dynamics and agricultural production. This paper also discusses the current new methodologies and approaches adopted nationally and internationally to reduce the contaminants and purify the environment for maintaining a sustainable and healthier environment in Wenzhou. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

37249075432	Spatial variability of soil organic matter and nutrients in paddy fields at various scales in southeast China	The present study examines the spatial dependency of soil organic matter and nutrients in paddy fields at three different scales using geostatistics and geographic information system techniques (GIS). The spatial variability of soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (AP) has been characterized using a total of 460, 131 and 64 samples that were, respectively, collected from the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou (HJH) Plain (10 km), Pinghu county (1,000 m) and a test plot area (100 m) within the Pinghu county, Zhejiang province of the southeast China. Semivariograms showed that the SOM and TN had moderate spatial dependency on the large scale of HJH plain and moderate scale of Pinghu county with long spatial correlation distances. At the moderate scale of Pinghu county and the small scale of a test plot area, the AP data did not show any spatial correlation, but had moderate spatial dependency in HJH plain. Spherical and exponential variogram models were best fitted to all these soil properties. Maps of SOM and TN were generated through interpolation of measured values by ordinary kriging, and AP by lognormal kriging. This study suggests that precision management of SOM and TN is feasible at all scales, and precision management of AP is feasible at large scales. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

40349090020	Spectral prediction of Phytophthora infestans infection on tomatoes using artificial neural network (ANN)	Late blight (LB) is one of the most aggressive tomato diseases in California. Accurately detecting the disease will increase the efficiency of properly controlling the disease infestations to ensure the crop production. In this study, we developed a method to spectrally predict late blight infections on tomatoes based on artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN was designed as a back-propagation (BP) neural network that used gradient-descent learning algorithm. Through comparing different network structures, we selected a 3-25-9-1 network structure. Two experimental samples, from field experiments and remotely sensed image data sets, were used to train the ANN to predict healthy and diseased tomato canopies with various infection stages for any given spectral wavelength (μm) intervals. Results of discrete data indicated different levels of disease infestations. The correlation coefficients of prediction values and observed data were 0.99 and 0.82 for field data and remote sensing image data, respectively. In addition, we predicted the field data based on the remote sensing image data and predicted the remote sensing image data with field data using the same network structure, and the results showed that the coefficient of determination was 0.62 and 0.66, respectively. Our study suggested an ANN with back-propagation training could be used in spectral prediction in the study.

84866670658	New extending edge method of potential field data	In order to develop a new extending edge method of potential field with reasonable and practical, this paper develops a difference method of extending edge based on the mean value theorem and the maximum value and minimum value theorem. This paper, through designing theoretical model and calculating theoretical data, processes the actual data by difference method of extending edge, analyses the differences between the theoretical data and the results of extending edge, discusses the applied effect of this difference method of extending edge. The results show that the decay trend of the contour of the extending part based on this difference method of extending edge is similar to that of the original contour, especially when the potential field value of the original data block in the boundary is in a declining trend. The study reveals that the outward extending data based on difference method of extending edge are quite reasonable, and the boundary effect is not obvious, so this extending data are suitable for the further processing and inversion. The operation of this extending method is simple and the computing velocity of this method is fast, so this method is suitable for the potential field data with complex boundary, also for the terrain elevation data. © 2012 IEEE.

84877723001	Separation and determination of triclosan and bisphenol a in water, beverage, and urine samples by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction combined with capillary zone electrophoresis-UV detection	Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction combined with capillary zone electrophoresis-UV detection was developed for analyzing triclosan (TCS) and bisphenol A (BPA) in water, beverage, and urine samples. The factors influencing microextraction efficiencies, such as the kind and volume of extraction and dispersive solvent, the extraction time, and the salt effect, were optimized. A background electrolyte composed of 8 mM sodium tetraborate at pH 9.8 was used as the running buffer. Detection was performed at 214 nm. Under the optimum conditions (sample volume, 5.0 mL; extraction solvent, tetrachloroethane, 22.0 μL; dispersive solvent, tetrahydrofuran, 1.0 mL; extraction time, fewer than 5 s; and without salt addition), the enrichment factors were 110.2 and 82.0 for TCS and BPA, respectively. The linear range was 0.02-2 μg/mL with correlation coefficients of 0.9966-0.9969. LODs were in the range of 4.0-8.0 ng/mL. The environmental water, beverage, and urine samples (at spiking levels of 0.1 and 0.4 μg/mL) were successfully analyzed by the proposed method; the recoveries compared to previous methods were in the range of 81.2-103.3%. As a result, this method can be successfully applied for the rapid and convenient determination of TCS and BPA in water, beverage, and urine samples. © 2013 Publishing Technology.

51349131061	Spatial variability of soil available Zn and Cu in paddy rice fields of China	As a source of nutrient supplements, the deficiency or excess of micronutrients in soil is directly connected to the plant uptake and, thereby, status of micronutrients in the human population. Proper management of micronutrients requires an understanding of the variations of soil micronutrients across the fields. This study is to investigate the spatial patterns of soil available Zn and Cu in paddy rice fields. Four hundred and sixty three soil samples were taken in Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou (HJH) watershed in Zhejiang Province, China, and available Zn and Cu were analyzed using an atomic adsorption spectrometer. Geostatistical semivariograms analysis indicated that the available Zn and Cu were best fitted to a spherical model with a range of 40.5 and 210.4 km, respectively. There were moderate spatial dependences for Zn and Cu over a long distance and the dependence were attributed to soil types and anthropogenic activities. The overlay analysis of spatial patterns and soil types gave us greater understanding about how intrinsic factors affect the spatial variation of available micronutrients. Based on the above, macroscopically regionalized management of soil available micronutrients and the implications to potential risk were discussed. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

50549087399	Evaluation of water quality in an agricultural watershed as affected by almond pest management practices	In the last decade, the detection of organophosphate (OP) pesticides in the San Joaquin River watershed has raised concerns about water quality. This study examined the influences of almond pest management practices (PMPs) on water quality. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was employed to simulate pesticide concentration in water as affected by different PMPs. California Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) data were used to investigate PMP use trends. Stepwise regression analysis was performed to test the correlation between specific PMP use and pesticide concentrations in surface water and sediment. Our results showed an increasing use of reduced risk pesticides and pyrethroids on almonds. SWAT simulation over the period of 1992-2005 showed decreases in OP concentrations in surface water. High OP and pyrethroid use in dormant sprays was associated with high pesticide concentrations in water and sediment. Almond pesticide use was proved to have significant impacts on the pesticide load in the San Joaquin River watershed. The PMP which combines the use of reduced risk pesticides with no dormant spray was recommended for almond orchard use. This paper presented a novel method of studying the environmental impacts of different agricultural PMPs. By combining pesticide use surveys with watershed modeling, we provided a quantitative foundation for the selection of PMPs to reduce pesticide pollution in surface water. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

50849099799	Identification of hotspots for potential pyrethroid runoff: A GIS modeling study in San Joaquin River Watershed of California, USA	This paper attempts to identify the high-risk areas for potential runoff of pyrethroid pesticides in the San Joaquin River Watershed. Pyrethroid pesticides have been detected in water and fluvial sediments in this watershed, creating concerns about potential negative impacts on water quality. However, little documentation exists regarding the distributions or the extent of the adverse effects caused by the use of pyrethroids. This study developed a geographic information systems (GIS) model to identify areas with high potential for pyrethroid runoff during the rainy season. The model was then validated using field-monitoring data. Nine factors were identified for the runoff risk assessment: amount of active ingredient used, soil erodibility factor, hydrologic group, surface layer depth, seasonal rainfall, seasonal number of rainy days, seasonal number of storm events, stream density, and land cover. The results indicated that high pyrethroid runoff risks were associated with basins such as the Stanislaus River Sub-basin, Newman Gustine Sub-basin and South Merced Sub-basin. This study demonstrated that the GIS model is capable of predicting high-risk areas of pyrethroid runoff at sub-basin scale. The model can be used to prioritize sites for water quality monitoring and guide implementations of best management practices. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

51849139971	Major factors influencing the efficacy of vegetated buffers on sediment trapping: A review and analysis	Sediment is a major agricultural pollutant threatening water quality. Vegetated buffers, including vegetative filter strips, riparian buffers, and grassed waterways, are best management practices (BMPs) installed in many areas to filter sediments from tailwaters, and deter sediment transport to water bodies. Along with reducing sediment transport, the filters also help trap sediment bound nutrients and pesticides. The objectives of this study were: (i) to review vegetated buffer efficacy on sediment trapping, and (ii) to develop statistical models to investigate the major factors influencing sediment trapping. A range of sediment trapping efficacies was found in a review of over 80 representative BMP experiments. A synthesis of the literature regarding the effects of vegetated buffers on sediment trapping is needed. The meta-analysis results based on the limited data showed that buffer width and slope are two major factors influencing BMPs efficacy of vegetated buffers on sediment trapping. Regardless of the area ratio of buffer to agricultural field, a 10 m buffer and a 9% slope optimized the sediment trapping capability of vegetated buffers.

54049116702	Influence of bovine manure on dissipation of hexazinone in soil	The effects of bovine manure (BM) on the degradation of hexazinone and formation of three of its major metabolites were investigated in sandy loam soil. The degradation half-life of hexazinone was 29.6 days in unamended soil, while it decreased to 21.8 days in BM-amended soil. The major metabolites formed in unamended soil were [3-cyclohexyl-6-(methylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4(1, 3H)-dione] (metabolite A) and [3-cyclohexyl-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1, 3, 5H)-trione] (metabolite C), while metabolite B [3-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-6-(dimethylamino)-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4(1, 3H)-dione] was not detected over the entire experimental period. However, in BM-amended soil, metabolite B was detected at 20 and 40 days after incubation, suggesting that BM contributed to formation of this metabolite. N-demethylation, removal of the dimethylamino group with formation of a carbonyl group at the 6-position of the triazine ring appeared to be the principal mechanisms involved in hexazinone metabolism in unamended soil. However, hydroxylation at the 4-positon of the cyclohexyl group as well as the above two modes were the principal pathways in BM-amended soil. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

55649118473	Dynamic modeling of organophosphate pesticide load in surface water in the northern San Joaquin Valley watershed of California	The hydrology, sediment, and pesticide transport components of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were evaluated on the northern San Joaquin Valley watershed of California. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients for monthly stream flow and sediment load ranged from 0.49 to 0.99 over the watershed during the study period of 1992-2005. The calibrated SWAT model was applied to simulate fate and transport processes of two organophosphate pesticides of diazinon and chlorpyrifos at watershed scale. The model generated satisfactory predictions of dissolved pesticide loads relative to the monitoring data. The model also showed great success in capturing spatial patterns of dissolved diazinon and chlorpyrifos loads according to the soil properties and landscape morphology over the large agricultural watershed. This study indicated that curve number was the major factor influencing the hydrology while pesticide fate and transport were mainly affected by surface runoff and pesticide application and in the study area. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

63449116969	A geo-referenced modeling environment for ecosystem risk assessment: Organophosphate pesticides in an agriculturally dominated watershed	A geo-referenced modeling system was developed in this study to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of pesticide distributions and associated ecosystem risks. In the modeling system, pesticide fate and transport processes in soil-canopy system were simulated at field scale by the pesticide root zone model (PRZM). Edge-of-field mass fluxes were up-scaled with a spatially distributed flowrouting model to predict pesticide contaminations in surface water. The developed model was applied to the field conditions of the Orestimba Creek watershed, an agriculturally-dominated area in California's Central Valley during 1990 through 2006, with the organophosphate insecticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos as test agents. High concentrations of dissolved pesticides were predicted at the watershed outlet during the irrigation season of April through November, due to the intensive pesticide use and low stream flow. Concentration violations, according to the California aquatic life criteria, were observed for diazinon before 2001, and for chlorpyrifos during the entire simulation period. Predicted pesticide exposure levels showed potential adverse eff ects on certain genera of sensitive aquatic invertebrates in the ecosystem of the Orestimba Creek. Modeling assessments were conducted to identify the factors governing spatial patterns and seasonal trends on pesticide distribution and contamination potentials to the studied aquatic ecosystem. Areas with high pesticide yields to surface water were indicated for future research and additional studies focused on monitoring and mitigation efforts within the watershed. Improved irrigation techniques and management practices were also suggested to reduce the violations of pesticide concentrations during irrigation seasons.

64449086701	Multimedia transport and risk assessment of organophosphate pesticides and a case study in the northern San Joaquin Valley of California	This paper presents a framework for cumulative risk characterization of human exposure to pesticides through multiple exposure pathways. This framework is illustrated through a case study of selected organophosphate (OP) pesticides in the northern San Joaquin Valley of California. Chemical concentrations in environmental media were simulated using a multimedia environmental fate model, and converted to contamination levels in exposure media. The risk characterization in this study was based on a residential-scale exposure to residues of multiple pesticides through everyday activities. Doses from a mixture of OP pesticides that share a common mechanism of toxicity were estimated following US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for cumulative risk analysis. Uncertainty in the human exposure parameters was included in the Monte Carlo simulation in order to perform stochastic calculations for intakes and corresponding risks of OP pesticides. Risk of brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition was reported as margins of exposure (MOEs) of the 99.9th population percentile for two age groups living in the northern San Joaquin Valley during 1992-2005. Diet was identified as the dominant exposure pathway in cumulative exposure and risk, while the temporal trend and spatial variation in total MOE levels were associated with exposures to contaminated drinking water and ambient air. Uniformly higher risks were observed for children because of their greater inhalation and ingestion rates per body weight, relative to adults. The results indicated that exposures for children were about twice of those estimated for adults. Concerns over children's exposure to OP pesticide through food and water ingestion were suggested based on the spatiotemporal variations predicted for the subchronic MOEs at the 99.9th percentile of exposure in the study area. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67650526169	Prediction of Soybean Growth and Development Using Artificial Neural Network and Statistical Models	To develop predictive models using a simple and effective modeling technique, field experiments were conducted at the Delta Research and Extension Center in Stoneville, Mississippi (33°25′ N, 90°55′ W) under irrigated conditions. The models were constructed using 4 years of field data (1998 to 2001), and validated with a fifth year of data (2002). Potential factors affecting stages of soybean growth and development were considered for developing the models. Affecting factors, such as weeds, insects, diseases, and drought stresses, were controlled optimally to simplify the modeling procedures. In addition, stepwise regression (SR) analysis, artificial neural networks (ANN), and interpolation approaches were used to construct the models. The modelling of soybean growth and development processes was separated into 2 distinct periods: vegetative growth stage (V-stage) and reproductive growth stage (R-stage). The models included 10 V-stages (up to V8) and 8 R-stages. In the V-stage models, planting date (PD) and mean relative time-span from planting to a particular stage were the only significant parameters, whereas in R-stage models, PD and maturity group (MG) were significant. The models obtained accurate predictions when only using PD, MG, and mean relative time-span from planting to a particular stage. The ANN method provides the greatest accuracy in predicting phenological events, indicating that the ANN method can be effectively applied in crop modeling. © 2009 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

67650555894	Spatio-temporal variations of soil nutrients influenced by an altered land tenure system in China	Initiated during the late 1970s in China, the Household Responsibility System (HRS) has brought a profound change to the rural economy. The shift from a collective farming system to individually-owned family farms has changed land management practices, affecting both soil quality and agro-environmental sustainability. The purpose of this study was to investigate spatio-temporal variability of soil nutrients influenced by the altered land tenure system, and to evaluate the potential for site-specific management. Using geostatistics and GIS, we characterized the spatial variability of soil nutrients in paddy rice fields in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou watershed, China, following 20 years of altered land management policy. Soil samples, collected in 1982 and 2001, were analyzed for soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). The spatial variability of each of these soil properties decreased from 1982 to 2001, verifying that the extrinsic factors of the altered land management practices had a weakening effect on the intrinsic factors of soil formation properties. Spatial correlation ranges for SOM, TN, and AP in 2001 all decreased from 1982 with the exception of AK. Temporal geographic maps revealed significant changes in soil nutrient concentrations in the form of increases in SOM, TN, and AP and a sharp decline of AK during the period 1982-2001. This result gave an indication of the imbalance among N, P, and K fertilizers applied in the study area. The results of the comprehensive assessment for current soil nutrients could also, inversely, present challenges for future site-specific management policy on agriculture. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

ACN was used as extraction solvent for the extraction of target analytes from vegetables. When the previous extraction process was over, the ACN extract was transferred to the water-immiscible organic phase, tetrachloroethane, used as extraction solvent in HOLLE procedures. Under the optimum conditions, repeatability was carried out by spiking PAHs at concentration level of 12.5 μg/kg, the RSDs varied between 1.1 and 8.5% (n = 3). The LODs, based on S/N of 3, ranged from 0.025 to 0.25 μg/kg. Relative recoveries of PAHs from cucumber and long crooked squash samples were in the range of 72.4-104.9% and 65.5-119.3%, respectively. Compared with the conventional extraction method, the proposed method has the advantage of being quick, easy to operate, and having low consumption of organic solvent. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

69249172219	Chapter 3 Problems, Challenges, and Strategic Options of Grain Security in China	Given China's large population size, the attainment of grain security has become both a national and global issue. In the last decade, the concerted efforts of the Chinese government and its people to meet its grain demand have been highly successful. Despite the current global grain crisis, China's grain market has remained relatively stable, allowing it to contribute to world grain security. The purpose of this chapter was to give an overview of grain security in China, with an analysis of the present national and global grain security, as well as a historical accounting of the most important factors that have led to success. The Chinese grain production process was analyzed in detail, discussing in-depth achievements and experiences, which can then be used for reference in other countries. Although currently stable, grain security for China faces many long-term challenges, such as loss of cultivated land from degradation and urbanization, limited water resources, frequent natural disasters, impacts of climate change, vulnerable ecosystems, increased demand from population growth and improved standard of living, a small-scale agricultural economy, and outdated aging agricultural infrastructure, among others. The chapter then in details suggested countermeasures that should be taken to guarantee grain security, including the improvement of agricultural infrastructure, increased fiscal input, greater use of science and technology, protection of cultivated land and water resources, support for the farmers' livelihood, adaptation to climatic change, improvements in grassland agriculture, and controls on population growth, etc. The chapter concludes with two case studies serving to tie the chapter together with the idea that China's present successes and proactive long-term plans are working, thus presenting a highly favorable outlook for the future. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

74249114807	Management-oriented sensitivity analysis for pesticide transport in watershed-scale water quality modeling using SWAT	The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was calibrated for hydrology conditions in an agricultural watershed of Orestimba Creek, California, and applied to simulate fate and transport of two organophosphate pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon. The model showed capability in evaluating pesticide fate and transport processes in agricultural fields and instream network. Management-oriented sensitivity analysis was conducted by applied stochastic SWAT simulations for pesticide distribution. Results of sensitivity analysis identified the governing processes in pesticide outputs as surface runoff, soil erosion, and sedimentation in the study area. By incorporating sensitive parameters in pesticide transport simulation, effects of structural best management practices (BMPs) in improving surface water quality were demonstrated by SWAT modeling. This study also recommends conservation practices designed to reduce field yield and in-stream transport capacity of sediment, such as filter strip, grassed waterway, crop residue management, and tailwater pond to be implemented in the Orestimba Creek watershed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

75149115672	A review of vegetated buffers and a meta-analysis of their mitigation efficacy in reducing nonpoint source pollution	Vegetated buffers are a well-studied and widely used agricultural management practice for reducing nonpointsource pollution. A wealth of literature provides experimental data on their mitigation efficacy. Th is paper aggregated many of these results and performed a meta-analysis to quantify the relationships between pollutant removal efficacy and buffer width, buffer slope, soil type, and vegetation type. Th eoretical models for removal efficacy (Y) vs. buffer width (w) were derived and tested against data from the surveyed literature using statistical analyses. A model of the form Y = K x (1-e-bxw), (0 < K ≤ 100) successfully captured the relationship between buffer width and pollutant removal, where K reflects the maximum removal efficacy of the buffer and b reflects its probability to remove any single particle of pollutant in a unit distance. Buffer width alone explains 37, 60, 44, and 35% of the total variance in removal efficacy for sediment, pesticides, N, and P, respectively. Buffer slope was linearly associated with sediment removal efficacy either positively (when slope ≤ 10%) or negatively (when slope > 10%). Buffers composed of trees have higher N and P removal efficacy than buffers composed of grasses or mixtures of grasses and trees. Soil drainage type did not show a significant effect on pollutant removal efficacy. Based on our analysis, a 30-m buffer under favorable slope conditions (≈ 10%) removes more than 85% of all the studied pollutants. Th ese models predicting optimal buffer width/slope can be instrumental in the design, implementation, and modeling of vegetated buffers for treating agricultural runoff.

75149139328	Quantifying the spatial distribution of soil mass wasting processes after the 2008 earthquake in Wenchuan, China. A case study of the Longmenshan area	The beautiful Longmenshan area is one of the main tourist attractions in Sichuan Province, China. The epicenter of a catastrophic earthquake measured at 8.0 Ms (China Seismological Bureau), occurred within this area at Wenchuan (31°01′16″N, 103°22′01″E) at 14:28 May 12, 2008 (Beijing time). The earthquake triggered numerous types of landslide transport and hazards, including soil and debris avalanches, rockfalls, slumps, debris flows, creation of barrier lakes and slope flattenings. This paper examines the landslide hazards in the Longmenshan area caused by the earthquake using remotely sensed images, mainly Beijing-1 Microsatellite data before and after the earthquake, compared to digital elevation maps and slope gradient maps, land use and vegetation cover maps. Areas of erosion and loss of vegetation were compared from pre- and post-earthquake data, from which were calculated changes in vegetated areas, bare slopes, and mass movement during the earthquake. These events occurred over altitudes from 1000 to 4000 m and on slope angles between 25 and 55°. The results show that the total area of erosion and land movement due to the earthquake increased by 86.3 km

This constructed wetland (CW) was treating rural eutrophic water in China. The plants used in the CW were Typha angustifolia. This study showed that the metabolic activities of upper and front substrate microorganisms were greater than those of rear substrate microorganisms in the constructed wetland. The substrate microorganisms in the front and upper part of CW showed 58.9%, 11.8%, and 41.4% higher growth rates of integrated areas under average well color development (AWCD) curves than in the front and lower part, the rear and upper part, and the rear and lower part of the CW, respectively. By principal component analysis (PCA), it was shown that there existed significant differences in community structure and metabolic properties of carbon sources between substrate microorganisms from different sampling sites. Carbon source utilization of polymers, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and amino acids were greater in all sampling sites, but that of amines and phenolic compounds were very different. The richness, evenness and diversity of upper substrates in microbial communities were significantly higher than those of lower substrate. The lower front substrate microbial communities had lower evenness than the other sampling plots, and the lowest richness of substrate in microbial community was found in the lower back-end part of the constructed wetlands. © by PSP.

79151473285	Water quantity and quality optimization modeling of dams operation based on SWAT in Wenyu River Catchment, China	Water quantity and quality joint operation is a new mode in the present dams' operation research. It has become a hot topic in governmental efforts toward integrated basin improvement. This paper coupled a water quantity and quality joint operation model (QCmode) and genetic algorithm with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Together, these tools were used to explore a reasonable operation of dams and floodgates at the basin scale. Wenyu River Catchment, a key area in Beijing, was selected as the case study. Results showed that the coupled water quantity and quality model of Wenyu River Catchment more realistically simulates the process of water quantity and quality control by dams and floodgates. This integrated model provides the foundation for research of water quantity and quality optimization on dam operation in Wenyu River Catchment. The results of this modeling also suggest that current water quality of Wenyu River will improve following the implementation of the optimized operation of the main dams and floodgates. By pollution control and water quantity and quality joint operation of dams and floodgates, water quality of Wenyu river will change significantly, and the available water resources will increase by 134%, 32%, 17%, and 82% at the downstream sites of Sha River Reservoir, Lutong Floodgate, Xinpu Floodgate, and Weigou Floodgate, respectively. The water quantity and quality joint operation of dams will play an active role in improving water quality and water use efficiency in Wenyu River Basin. The research will provide the technical support for water pollution control and ecological restoration in Wenyu River Catchment and could be applied to other basins with large number of dams. Its application to the Wenyu River Catchment has a great significance for the sustainable economic development of Beijing City. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79954528317	An index method to evaluate growers' pesticide use for identifying on-farm innovations and effective alternative pest management strategies: A case study of winegrape in Madera County, California	Winegrape is an important perennial crop in California, USA. Each year California winegrape farming consumes about 20 million kilograms of pesticides that have been a pollutant source to the fresh water systems of the state. The variation of pesticide use among winegrape growers has been significant. It has been observed that some growers have developed effective ways to reduce pesticide use, yet control pests efficiently to ensure harvest. Identification of the growers with low and high pesticide use is very helpful to extension programs that aim on reducing pesticide environmental risk. In this study, an index approach is proposed to quantitatively measure pesticide use intensity at grower level. An integrated pesticide use index is developed by taking pesticide quantity and toxicity into account. An additive formula and a multiplying formula were used to calculate the pesticide use index, i.e., PUI and PUIM. It was found that both PUI and PUIM were capable of identifying the low and high pesticide users while PUI was slightly more conservative than PUIM. All pesticides used in California winegrape farming were taken into account for calculating the indices. Madera County, one of the largest winegrape producers in California, was taken as an example to test the proposed approach. In year 2000, among the total 208 winegrape growers, 28 with PUI≤10 and 34 with 10<PUI≤20 were identified as low pesticide users who were characterized with both low quantity and low toxicity of pesticide use. Most of the growers had small-sized vineyards, i.e., one field and small planted areas. Furthermore, they had very low pesticide use intensity, used only 1-2 types of pesticides (mainly fungicides), applied few pesticides (1-3 only), and emphasized the use of low toxicity compounds. Meanwhile, 19 growers with PUI>60, identified as high pesticide users, had large-sized vineyards, i.e., more fields and large planted areas. They used all types of pesticides and many compounds, which indicated that their pest controls heavily depended on pesticides rather than on-farm management. Through the case study, the proposed approach proved to be useful for analyzing the growers' pesticide use intensities and interpreting their pesticide use behaviors, which led to a new start point for further investigation of searching ways to reduce pesticide environmental risk. © 2011 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79959990122	Recent changes in pan-evaporation dynamics in China	Pan-evaporation (E<inf>pan</inf>) as the indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand has decreased worldwide with climate change in the last decades, which is called "Pan Evaporation Paradox". This study investigates the recent changes in E<inf>pan</inf> dynamics in China using the observed E<inf>pan</inf> records for the period 1960-2007. The records show that E<inf>pan</inf> decreased in China from 1960 to 1991 by-5.4 mm yr<sup>-2</sup>. The attribution results show that the significant decreases (P < 0.001) in wind speed and solar radiation offset the effect of increasing air temperature and led to the decrease in E<inf>pan</inf>. However, the observed E <inf>pan</inf> has increased since 1992 by 7.9 mm yr<sup>-2</sup>. From 1992 to 2007, the amplitude of increase in air temperature rose seriously, while the amplitude of decrease in wind speed declined and solar radiation even increased insignificantly (P > 0.1). The results show that increasing air temperature dominated the change in E<inf>pan</inf>, which offset the effect of wind speed and led to the increase in E<inf>pan</inf>.

80051578874	Spatial and temporal variations of precipitation in Haihe River Basin, China: Six decades of measurements	This study aims to determine temporal trends and spatial distribution of the annual and monthly precipitation in the Haihe River Basin, China, during 1951-2008. A significant decreasing trend was observed for the annual precipitation, mainly attributed to the abrupt decrease in the flood-season precipitation (June-September) around the year of 1979. No significant trend was revealed for precipitation within Period I of 1951-1979 and Period II of 1980-2008. Results of this study indicated that the relative contributions of the flood-season precipitation decreased temporally with time and spatially with elevation. This study also identified a potential movement of storm centers from east to west portions of the basin. In addition, analysis on the precipitation anomalies also suggested a redistribution of the non-flood season precipitation over the study area. Compared with the west portion of the basin, generally, the east received relatively more precipitation during the non-flood season, while similar trend of precipitation redistribution was not observed in the flood season. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

80053582806	Optimizing water quality monitoring networks using continuous longitudinal monitoring data: A case study of Wen-Rui Tang River, Wenzhou, China	Identification of representative sampling sites is a critical issue in establishing an effective water quality monitoring program. This is especially important at the urban-agriculture interface where water quality conditions can change rapidly over short distances. The objective of this research was to optimize the spatial allocation of discrete monitoring sites for synoptic water quality monitoring through analysis of continuous longitudinal monitoring data collected by attaching a water quality sonde and GPS to a boat. Sampling was conducted six times from March to October 2009 along a 6.5 km segment of the Wen-Rui Tang River in eastern China that represented an urban-agricultural interface.

80355132553	Influences of climate change on California and Nevada regions revealed by a high-resolution dynamical downscaling study	In this study, the influence of climate change to California and Nevada regions was investigated through high-resolution (4-km grid spacing) dynamical downscaling using the WRF (Weather Research & Forecasting) model. The dynamical downscaling was performed to both the GFS (Global forecast model) reanalysis (called GFS-WRF runs) from 2000-2006 and PCM (Parallel Climate Model) simulations (called PCM-WRF runs) from 1997-2006 and 2047-2056. The downscaling results were first validated by comparing current model outputs with the observational analysis PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) dataset. In general, the dominant features from GFS-WRF runs and PCM-WRF runs were consistent with each other, as well as with PRISM results. The influences of climate change on the California and Nevada regions can be inferred from the model future runs. The averaged temperature showed a positive trend in the future, as in other studies. The temperature increases by around 1-2°C under the assumption of business as usual over 50 years. This leads to an upward shifting of the freezing level (the contour line of 0°C temperature) and more rain instead of snow in winter (December, January, and February). More hot days (>32. 2°C or 90°F) and extreme hot days (>37. 8°C or 100°F) are predicted in the Sacramento Valley and the southern parts of California and Nevada during summer (June, July, and August). More precipitation is predicted in northern California but not in southern California. Rainfall frequency slightly increases in the coast regions, but not in the inland area. No obvious trend of the surface wind was indicated. The probability distribution functions (PDF) of daily temperature, wind and precipitation for California and Nevada showed no significant change in shape in either winter or summer. The spatial distributions of precipitation frequency from GFS-WRF and PCM-WRF were highly correlated (r = 0. 83). However, overall positive shifts were seen in the temperature field; increases of 2°C for California and 3°C for Nevada in summer and 2. 5°C for California and 1. 5°C for Nevada in winter. The PDFs predicted higher precipitation in winter and lower precipitation in the summer for both California and Nevada. © 2010 The Author(s).

84055176589	Analysis of the metabolic utilization of carbon sources and potential functional diversity of the bacterial community in lab-scale horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands	Microorganisms are an integral part of the biogeochemical processes in wetlands. To improve the performance of constructed wetlands, it is very important to know the metabolic properties and functional diversity of the microbial communities. The purpose of this study is to analyze the metabolic properties and functional diversity of the microbial community in a horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetland (CW) in a laboratory study through the sole-carbon-source utilization profiles using Biolog-ECO microplates. The technique has advantages over traditional cell culture techniques, such as molecular-level techniques- RNA amplification, which are time-consuming, expensive, and only applicable to the small number of species that may be cultured. This CW was designed to treat rural eutrophic water in China, using the plant Cyperus alternifolius L. This study showed that the metabolic activities of upper front substrate microorganisms (UF) were greater than those of the lower back substrate microorganisms (LB) in the CW. Integrated areas under average well color development (AWCD) curves of substrate microorganisms in the UF were 131.9, 4.8, and 99.3% higher than in the lower front part (LF), the upper back part (UB), and the LB part of the CW, respectively. Principal components analysis showed significant differences in both community structure and metabolic utilization of carbon sources between substrate microorganisms from different sampling sites. Carbon source utilization of polymers, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and amino acids was higher in UF than in LF, but that of amines and phenolic compounds was very similar in UF and LF. The richness, evenness, and diversity of upper substrate microbial communities were significantly higher than those of lower substrate. The LF substrate microbial communities had lower evenness than the other sampling plots, and the lowest richness of substrate microbial community was found in the LB part of the CW. © 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

84055217929	Nonpoint source pollution, environmental quality, and ecosystem health in china: Introduction to the special section	The rapid economic and industrial growth of China, exemplified by a 10-fold increase in its gross domestic product in the past 15 years, has lifted millions of its citizens out of poverty but has simultaneously led to severe environmental problems. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 2.4 million deaths in China per year could be attributed to degraded environmental quality. Much of China's soil, air, and water are polluted by xenobiotic contaminants, such as heavy metals and organic compounds. In addition, soil quality is degraded by erosion, desertification, and nutrient runoff. Air quality is further compromised by particulates, especially in heavily populated areas. Research shows that 80% of urban rivers in China are significantly polluted, and poor water quality is a key contributor to poverty in rural China. Economic and industrial growth has also greatly expanded the demand for water sources of appropriate quality; however, pollution has markedly diminished usable water resource quantity. Desertification and diminishing water resources threaten future food security. In recent years, China's government has increased efforts to reverse these trends and to improve ecosystem health. The Web of Science database showed that the percentage of articles on China devoting to environmental sciences increased dramatically in recent years. In addition, the top 25 institutes publishing the papers in environmental sciences were all in China. This special issue includes seven articles focusing on nonpoint source pollution, environmental quality, and ecosystem health in China. The major issues, and results of these studies, are discussed in this introduction. © 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

84856267719	Extraction and determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in water and urine samples using solidified floating organic drop microextraction along with high performance liquid chromatography	We have developed a method, termed solidification of floating organic drop microextraction (SFOME), for the extraction of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in water and urine samples, this followed by quantification via HPLC. This method requires very small quantities of organic solvent consumption. It is based on exposing a floating solidified drop of an organic solvent on the surface of aqueous solution in a sealed vial. The organic drop is easily collected with a spatula, molten (at ambient temperature), and then submitted to HPLC. Experimental parameters including extraction solvent and its volume, disperser solvent and its volume, extraction time, ionic strength, stirring speed and extraction temperature were optimized. The enrichment factors of analytes are in the range from 921 to 1,462, and acceptable extraction recoveries (92%-118%) are obtained. The dynamic linear range for five PBDE congeners is in the range of 0.5-75 μg.L

84859464523	Dramatic decrease in streamflow from the headwater source in the central route of China's water diversion project: Climatic variation or human influence?	The Danjiangkou Reservoir is the headwater source of the central route of China's South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). Average annual streamflow into the Reservoir was 40.97 km<sup>3</sup> from 1951 to 1989, while it was 31.64 km<sup>3</sup> from 1990 to 2006. Between the two periods, the average annual streamflow was reduced by 9.33 km<sup>3</sup>, accounting for 71.8% of the proposed amount of water diversion of the central route (13 km <sup>3</sup> per year). The sharply decreasing streamflow would inevitably have negative impacts on the implementation of the SNWDP. The reasons for the decrease in streamflow should be investigated before developing any adaption strategies. In this study, the impacts of climatic variation and human activities on streamflow were evaluated by a climate elasticity method. The results show that the impact of climatic variation (indicated by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) was responsible for 84.1-90.1% of the streamflow reduction, while human activities or other indentified uncertainties contributed 9.9-15.9% of the streamflow reduction. The observed 69.89 mm decrease in average annual precipitation contributed 81.6-87.3% of the decrease in streamflow. According to the observed data during the study period, the planned water diversion could lead to an ecological disaster of the downstream area of the Danjiangkou Reservoir in certain years. We suggest that the water diversion from the Danjiangkou Reservoir should be conducted in an adaptive manner to avoid such an adverse consequence, instead of the current plan of a fixed annual amount of water. © 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.

84862796015	Unusually dumbbell-shaped Guposhan-Huashan twin granite plutons in Nanling Range of south China: Discussion on their incremental emplacement and growth mechanism	The Guposhan-Huashan twin plutons crop out as an unusually dumbbell-shaped batholith within the Middle Mesozoic Central Nanling Range granitic belt in south China. The batholith was controlled by the east-west-striking Yishan-Quannan deep crustal fault zone, and spatially associated with two regional anticlinoria. Both plutons show concentric zonation patterns and are composed of two emplacement sequences separated by an approximately 9. m.y. magmatic lull, the 160-163-Ma Niumiao-Lisong-Wanggao sequence and the 148-151-Ma Xinlu-Huamei sequence, based on field mapping and observations, geochronology, and geochemistry. In a proposed incremental emplacement and growth model, the early magmas exploited physical discontinuities such as the contacts between rocks with contrasting competence and densities, as well as saddles of regional-scale anticlinoria. Assisted by dominant vertical heat flow and uplifting of the roofs, the Niumiao-Lisong-Wanggao-sequence magmas were subsequently emplaced in an over-accretion style as distinguishable increments during an approximately 3. m.y. span. Gravimetric data, observations of field relationships, as well as analysis of finite strain and country rock rheology confirm that the plutons became thickened considerably due to largely vertical assembling and growth, and most of their space was created by vertical displacement of their country rocks. Interestingly the coeval twin plutons show contrasting development and growth modes during their assembling and thickening process. The Guposhan pluton was built on an outward building mode with a " reverse-zoning" pattern while the Huashan pluton on an inward building mode with a " normal-zoning" pattern. We propose that the contrasting modes largely resulted from their divergent thermal evolution path. For example, the incremental inward building mode helps retain thermal energy and maintain a high temperature in older units, which facilitates injection of subsequent, younger increment units of the same sequence within the older host units. The independent, newer sequence of Xinlu-Huamei magmas, however, were controlled by shallow brittle faults developed in the older sequence units and emplaced as stocks and dykes by a dyke-propagation mechanism. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863974332	Impact of climate change on streamflow in the arid Shiyang River Basin of northwest China	Climate change may significantly affect the hydrological cycle and water resource management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. In this paper, output from the Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model were used in conjunction with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to analyse the effects of climate change on streamflow of the Xiying and Zamu rivers in the Shiyang River basin, an important arid region in northwest China. After SWAT model calibration and validation, streamflow in the Shiyang River Basin was simulated using the PRECIS climate model data for greenhouse gas emission scenarios A2 (high emission rate) and B2 (low emission rate) developed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Monthly streamflow and hydrological extremes were compared for present-dayyears (1961-1990), the 2020s (2011-2040), 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2100). The results show that mean monthly streamflow in Shiyang River Basin generally increased in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s between 0.7-6.1% at the Zamu gauging station and 0.1-4.8% at the Xiying gauging station. The monthly minimum streamflow increased persistently, but the maximum monthly streamflows increased in the 2020s and slightly decreased in the 2050s and 2080s. This study provides valuable information for guiding future water resource management in the Shiyang River Basin and other arid and semi-arid regions in China. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84864094159	Almond organophosphate and pyrethroid use in the San Joaquin Valley and their associated environmental risk	Purpose: The purpose of the present study are to analyze the temporal and spatial trends of the pesticide use on almond crops and assess their associated risk to soil, surface water, and air, and to investigate the impacts of pesticide risk on biodiversity. Materials and methods: California Pesticide Use Report database was used to determine the organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid use trends in the San Joaquin Valley for almonds from 1992 to 2005. Environmental potential risk indicator for pesticides model was employed to evaluate associated environmental relative risks in soil and in surface water. Emission potential of pesticide product was used to estimate the air relative risk. Geographical Information System was used to delineate the spatial distribution patterns of environmental risk evaluation in almonds and biodiversity. Results and discussion: OP pesticide use has been declined in any measurement in almonds. However, a converse result was found for pyrethroid pesticide. Pesticide use trends reflect the profound changes in pest management strategies in the California almond farm community. The model results in this study showed evidence that pyrethroid posed less environmental risks to soil, air, and water resources than OP. The physiochemical properties of pyrethroid reflect a strong tendency to adsorb to organic carbons, and therefore, potentially move off-site attached to sediment. Once in sediments, they can be bioavailable to the aquatic food web. So, more future study on environmental model should address pyrethroid environmental risk on sediment. Ecologists revealed that endangered species diversity has good correlation with total species diversity, so we developed a biodiversity index by using the survey data of endangered and rare animals in California. The results showed a negative relationship between count of animal occurrence and predicted environmental risk. This result would be useful to help conserve California's biological diversity by providing information to promote agricultural management and land-use decisions. Conclusions: Pesticide use trend is directly related to environmental risk. Pyrethroid posed less environmental risk than OP in this study. And also, this study got a noticeable result that pesticide uses in intensive agriculture and their associated environmental risks pose negative impacts on biodiversity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84868089356	A Comprehensive Survey of Retracted Articles from the Scholarly Literature	Background: The number of retracted scholarly articles has risen precipitously in recent years. Past surveys of the retracted literature each limited their scope to articles in PubMed, though many retracted articles are not indexed in PubMed. To understand the scope and characteristics of retracted articles across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines, we surveyed 42 of the largest bibliographic databases for major scholarly fields and publisher websites to identify retracted articles. This study examines various trends among them. Results: We found, 4,449 scholarly publications retracted from 1928-2011. Unlike Math, Physics, Engineering and Social Sciences, the percentages of retractions in Medicine, Life Science and Chemistry exceeded their percentages among Web of Science (WoS) records. Retractions due to alleged publishing misconduct (47%) outnumbered those due to alleged research misconduct (20%) or questionable data/interpretations (42%). This total exceeds 100% since multiple justifications were listed in some retraction notices. Retraction/WoS record ratios vary among author affiliation countries. Though widespread, only miniscule percentages of publications for individual years, countries, journals, or disciplines have been retracted. Fifteen prolific individuals accounted for more than half of all retractions due to alleged research misconduct, and strongly influenced all retraction characteristics. The number of articles retracted per year increased by a factor of 19.06 from 2001 to 2010, though excluding repeat offenders and adjusting for growth of the published literature decreases it to a factor of 11.36. Conclusions: Retracted articles occur across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and the authors of most retracted articles have not been accused of research misconduct. Despite recent increases, the proportion of published scholarly literature affected by retraction remains very small. Articles and editorials discussing retractions, or their relation to research integrity, should always consider individual cases in these broad contexts. However, better mechanisms are still needed for raising researchers' awareness of the retracted literature in their field. © 2012 Grieneisen, Zhang.

84870255906	Basin-scale and travertine dam-scale controls on fluvial travertine, Jiuzhaigou, southwestern China	Travertine deposition in fluvial systems builds dams and other forms that create diversity in geomorphic processes, morphology, and associated wetland ecosystems. In Jiuzhaigou Natural Reserve, Sichuan Province, China, we investigate the relation between contemporary fluvial travertine morphology, slope, and water chemistry at the fluvial-system scale and at the local scale of large individual dams in order to address two fundamental questions. First, what factors determine the spatial distribution of such large valley-spanning, or primary, travertine dams? Second, what factors govern smaller but distinctive travertine dams and other secondary travertine morphology present on the sloping downstream side of primary travertine dams? Through remote sensing analysis and field work, we recognize two factors as paramount in controlling spatial distribution of primary fluvial travertine dams: watershed-scale steps in the longitudinal profile and water chemistry, based on a proxy for dissolved calcite. In the steep Jiuzhaigou watershed, hillslope erosion processes that contribute large boulders to the channel influence the majority of the primary dams. However, two valley-spanning primary dams, Pearl Shoals and Norilang Lakes, appear to be dominated by travertine precipitation. The submerged upstream sides of these two dams are nearly vertical with heights >30m. Slope varies with position along the longitudinal profiles over the downstream sides of these two primary dams because the profile shapes are convex. With downstream-dam profile lengths >500m, flow encounters secondary travertine morphology organized as an array of travertine bedforms that vary with local channel slope along the convex profiles. The secondary travertine bedforms include sequences of repeating patterns including smaller dams that impound correspondingly small waterbodies. Morphologic differences between two types of secondary dams are quantified on the basis of their relative size, spacing, and the slope on which they form. Increasing slope is correlated with a decrease in height of secondary travertine bedforms according to a power law where y=0.0053x

84873151800	The application of geoeye-1 stereo pair images to regional gravimetric terrain corrections	The accuracy of the gravity corrections is limited by the ability to survey the near-station topography. By now, regional gravity terrain corrections still rely on traditional high field survey, which is inefficient and expensive. In this paper, we explored an alternative way by using high resolution satellite stereo-photogrammetry for gravimetric terrain corrections. In the proposed approach, geoeye-1 stereo pair images with rational function model were used to obtain high precision and density digital terrain models near gravimetric points. Meanwhile, a differential equation was put forwards to compute the gravity terrain effect. Compared with field gravity surveying data, results illustrated that our model is effective for middle zone terrain correction, and has a good prospect for inner zone terrain correction. © 2012 IEEE.

84878289011	The development of a geographic information system (GIS) database for Jiuzhaigou national nature reserve and its application	The objective of this paper is to develop a GIS (Geographic Information System) database for Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve (Jiuzhaigou, hereafter) in China and demonstrate its application as a research tool. A cost-effective procedure was developed to compile a variety of geographical and biological data of the study area in terms of popular GIS format such as shape files. These files were further calibrated and validated using field surveys data. The developed GIS database was used to quantify the distributions of the wildlife (amphibians, mammals, and birds) using the distances of the wildlife to the centerline of the bus-tour routes. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to quantify the correlation in space between pairs of different wildlife using the number of habitats for given space contexts. An ArcObject-based macro was developed to perform the analysis. The results showed the majority of the habitats of wildlife are located in the proximity of the tour-bus routes with an average distance ranging from 564 to 894 m depending on types of wildlife. This indicates a possibility of the disturbance to the wildlife by human activities. The correlation coefficient of the wildlife ranged from 0.36 to 0.64 depending on pairs of wildlife, indicating some correlations in space. However, due to the limited sample size, the statistical significances need to be further investigated. This paper has successfully demonstrated the use of the GIS-based database as a research tool for environmental study. © 2013 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878832847	The feature of tectonics in the Tibet Plateau from new regional gravity signals	As of 2007, 1:1000000 regional gravity investigations have been completed in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We obtain useful information by analyzing the gravity anomaly in different depth levels of the plateau, based on various data processing results to build a structure model. Our results show that the gravity feature in Tibet is unique, with diverse contact relations with adjacent blocks. The gravity minimum and maximum can be related to the arc-basin and magmatic belts, and suture zones where amphibolites were found. This feature above shows that Tibet is pieced together with many sutures. The gravity field is divided into two parts of the southern and northern within the plateau in different depth by the Bouguer gravity anomaly of Bangong-Nujiang suture zone, which is the most important gravity maximum anomalies over 1000 km long. This information provides evidence that Bangong-Nujiang suture is the northern boundary of Gondwana. Local gravity anomaly exhibits similar feature of geotectonic division. Majority of structural trend is EW-striking from south to north, whereas in the eastern plateau it strikes NW-SN. There are two gravity anomaly lines near the 85°E and 92°E longitude. It suggests that the deep structure of plateau is divided into three parts from east to west, in contrast to the EW-striking surficial structure.

84880133981	The impact of misconduct on the published medical and non-medical literature, and the news media	Better understanding of research and publishing misconduct can improve strategies to mitigate their occurrence. In this study, we examine various trends among 2,375 articles retracted due to misconduct in all scholarly fields. Proportions of articles retracted due to "publication misconduct" (primarily plagiarism and duplicate publication) or "distrust data or interpretations" (primarily research artifacts and unexplained irreproducibility of data) differ significantly between PubMed (35 and 59 %, respectively) and non-PubMed (56 and 27 %) articles and between English- and non-English-speaking author affiliation countries. Retraction rates due to any form of misconduct, adjusted for the size of the literature in different disciplines, vary from 0.22 per 100,000 articles in the Humanities to 7.58 in Medicine and 7.69 in Chemistry. The annual rate of article retractions due to misconduct has increased exponentially since 2001, and the percentage of all retractions involving misconduct allegations has grown from 18.5-29.2 % for each year from 1990-1993 to 55.8-71.9 % for each year from 2007-2010. Despite these increases, the prominence of research integrity in the news media has not changed appreciably over the past 20 years. Articles retracted due to misconduct are found in all major scholarly disciplines. The higher rate of plagiarism among authors from non-English speaking countries may diminish if institutions improved their support for the writing of English manuscripts by their scholars. The training of junior scholars on proper codes of research (and publishing) conduct should be embraced by all disciplines, not just by biomedical fields where the perception of misconduct is high. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

84880582986	Spatial distribution and source apportionment of water pollution in different administrative zones of Wen-Rui-Tang (WRT) river watershed, China	Water quality degradation in river systems has caused great concerns all over the world. Identifying the spatial distribution and sources of water pollutants is the very first step for efficient water quality management. A set of water samples collected bimonthly at 12 monitoring sites in 2009 and 2010 were analyzed to determine the spatial distribution of critical parameters and to apportion the sources of pollutants in Wen-Rui-Tang (WRT) river watershed, near the East China Sea. The 12 monitoring sites were divided into three administrative zones of urban, suburban, and rural zones considering differences in land use and population density. Multivariate statistical methods [one-way analysis of variance, principal component analysis (PCA), and absolute principal component score-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) methods] were used to investigate the spatial distribution of water quality and to apportion the pollution sources. Results showed that most water quality parameters had no significant difference between the urban and suburban zones, whereas these two zones showed worse water quality than the rural zone. Based on PCA and APCS-MLR analysis, urban domestic sewage and commercial/service pollution, suburban domestic sewage along with fluorine point source pollution, and agricultural nonpoint source pollution with rural domestic sewage pollution were identified to the main pollution sources in urban, suburban, and rural zones, respectively. Understanding the water pollution characteristics of different administrative zones could put insights into effective water management policy-making especially in the area across various administrative zones. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84882945462	An optimal model of the equivalent source for reduction-to-plane of potential field on uneven surface and the new method to deduce unit potential field expression of the optimal model	On the basis of the paper of Hanson and Miyazaki (1984), the optimal model of the equivalent source for reduction-to-plane of potential field on uneven surface is defined, and the application program developed by using the optimal model can carry out the reduction-to-plane of potential field on a large-area uneven surface with high precision and high speed. In the process of developing the unit potential field expression of the optimal model, we have put forward a model transformation method based on the mapping relationship between models and their potential field expressions. A quite brief expression of unit potential field can be deduced easily by using the model transformation method. The authors believe that the model transformation method may have some catholicity in deducing potential forward expression, and advise readers who work with potential field theory and method research should pay attention to it, so as to consult and use this method to solve their problems and develop and perfect it.

84883829440	Gravity and magnetic anomaly interpretation for oil and gas basins in Southeast Daxingan Mountains	Regional gravity and magnetic anomaly interpretation shows that many Mesozoic sedimentary basins exist to the north of Xilamulun river in the west out-skater of Songliao basin, and there exists three NW directional deep faults and also some near NEE directional arc structures. Gravity data from 1:200000 survey can generate clear gradient anomalies of the Mesozoic basin boundaries. Aeromagnetic data at the scale of 1:50000 can be used to outline the distribution of Mesozoic and Cenozoic igneous rock. Integrated gravity, magnetic and MT profile interpretation reveals that thickness of the Mesozoic in this region is from 1 km to 4 km, and that thickness of Paleozoic can be 4 km to 6 km. Later Paleozoic thus becomes an important layer for searching oil and gas in this region. Its basement is Silurian and earlier rocks. NE directional distributed garnits in Daxinganling mountain area are mushroom shaped intrusions. With eliminating the affection of igneous rocks in Tuquan and Zhalute basin areas, integrated gravity and magnetic modeling show that Mesozoic thickness variation is from 1.5 km to 4 km and thickness of the later Paleozoic varies from 2 km to 6 km.

84884578674	Earthquake fault framework and seismotectonics of the Songpan-Garze region since 1900	Based on 4 781 observed faults (>2 km length) from a 1:200 000 scale digital geologic map and 5 220 recorded seismic events since the year 1900, 993 earthquake faults are identified within the triangular Songpan-Garze study region. The study area is delineated by the nearly EW-trending East Kunlun fault zone to the north, the NW-trending Xianshuihe fault to the south and the NE-trending Longmenshan thrust belt to the east. Seismicity changes along these earthquake faults, spanning four 10-year intervals since 1970, show that following a strong earthquake swarm, which occurred in the Huya area in the mid-1970s, seismic activity increased from north to south, and migrated eastward along each major strike-slip fault zone. GPS observation data before 2008 indicate a displacement rate across the Xianshuihe fault zone to the south of ∼6.5-8.6 mm/a, whereas across the East Kunlun fault zone to the north it was ∼1.8-2.2 mm/a.

84886296481	Monitoring and modeling dissolved oxygen dynamics through continuous longitudinal sampling: A case study in wen-rui tang river, wenzhou, china	Synoptic water sampling at a fixed site monitoring station provides only limited 'snap-shots' of the complex water quality dynamics within a surface water system. However, water quality often changes rapidly in both spatial and temporal dimensions, especially in highly polluted urban rivers. In this study, we designed and applied a continuous longitudinal sampling technique to monitor the fine-scale spatial changes of water quality conditions, assess water pollutant sources, and determine the assimilative capacity for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in an urban segment of the hypoxic Wen-Rui Tang River in eastern China. The continuous longitudinal sampling was capable of collecting dissolved oxygen (DO) data every 5 s yielding a ~11 m sampling interval with a precision of ±0.1 mg L

0242710698	Remote Sensing Analysis of Rice Disease Stresses for Farm Pest Management Using Wide-band Airborne Data	On-farm pest management and crop protection strongly depend on diagnosis of crop disease stress in fields. In this paper, we first examine the applicability of broadband high-spatial-resolution ADAR (airborne data acquisition and registration) remote sensing data in visible and near infrared regions for rice disease detection and then develop an approach to explore the applicability. Experiments were conducted in 1999 on a large-scale rice field with sheath blight infection in central Arkansas, USA. Based on the measured symptoms, a comprehensive ground disease index (DI) was constructed to indicate the infection severity. Correlations between ground data and image data were analyzed with attempt to develop an applicable method for remote sensing of the rice disease. The results indicate that the broadband remote sensing imagery has valuable capability of application. Some image indices such as the RI

84888869400	Spatial distribution of soil organic matter in tillage layers in a southern China basin using classifications and spatial interpolation algorithms	Soil organic matter (SOM) in tillage layers is a very important component of soil nutrients. A critical issue for effective management of agricultural fields is proper analysis and interpolating SOM point sampling data onto a surface. An optimal approach needs to be developed to investigate the concentration of SOM in tillage layers. In this study, a total of 2341 soil samples were collected. The landforms (Valley plains, Low hilly areas and High hilly areas), land-use patterns (Paddy field and Citrus orchard) and soil types (including Paddy soils and Red earths), which could affect the concentration of SOM in tillage layers, were taken into account as impact factors for the data classification. Five different spatial interpolation algorithms-inverse distance weighting (IDW), radial basis function (RBF), and kriging (including simple kriging (SK), ordinary kriging (OK), and universal kriging (UK)) - were used to analyze the spatial variations of SOM. Cross-validation was applied to evaluate the accuracy of these methods, and subsequent, mean error (ME) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to compare and assess the performance of these interpolation methods. The results showed that in each classification of soil samples, the spatial variation of SOM in tillage layers was moderate to strong and the ratio of sill to nugget falls varied by 10%-50%. The study also revealed that RBF had the lowest RMSE value in most classification groups. With overall evaluation, the RBF was the optimal algorithm for interpolating SOM value in the study region, followed by SK, OK, UK and IDW. Finally, one classification group using RBF method was found to be the optimal method for predicting SOM in tillage layers in our study area, and a prediction map for the concentration of SOM was produced using this method.

84891613800	Quantitative Evaluation of Sustainable Development and Eco-Environmental Carrying Capacity in Water-Deficient Regions: A Case Study in the Haihe River Basin, China	Quantitative assessment of development sustainability could be a challenge to regional management and planning, especially for areas facing great risks of water shortage. Surface-water decline and groundwater over-pumping have caused serious environmental problems and limited economic development in many regions all around the world. In this paper, a framework for quantitatively evaluating development sustainability was established with water-related eco-environmental carrying capacity (EECC) as the core measure. As a case study, the developed approach was applied to data of the Haihe River Basin, China, during 1998 through 2007. The overall sustainable development degree (SDD) is determined to be 0.39, suggesting that this rate of development is not sustainable. Results of scenario analysis revealed that overshoot, or resource overexploitation, of the Basin's EECC is about 20% for both population and economy. Based on conditions in the study area in 2007, in order to achieve sustainable development, i.e., SDD>0.70 in this study, the EECC could support a population of 108 million and gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.72 trillion CNY. The newly developed approach in quantifying eco-environmental carrying capacity is anticipated to facilitate sustainable development oriented resource management in water-deficient areas. © 2014 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

84902549070	Evaluation of spatial-temporal variations and trends in surface water quality across a rural-suburban-urban interface	Water quality degradation is often a severe consequence of rapid economic expansion in developing countries. Methods to assess spatial-temporal patterns and trends in water quality are essential for guiding adaptive management efforts aimed at water quality remediation. Temporal and spatial patterns of surface water quality were investigated for 54 monitoring sites in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed of eastern China to identify such patterns in water quality occurring across a rural-suburban-urban interface. Twenty physical and chemical water quality parameters were analyzed in surface waters collected once every 4-8 weeks from 2000 to 2010. Temporal and spatial variations among water quality parameters were assessed between seasons (wet/dry) and among major land use zones (urban/suburban/rural). Factor analysis was used to identify parameters that were important in assessing seasonal and spatial variations in water quality. Results revealed that parameters related to organic pollutants (dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (manganese) (COD

84907873099	Toxicity evaluation of β-diketone antibiotics on the development of embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio)	This study evaluated the effects of β-diketone antibiotics (DKAs) on the development of embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). When exposure to DKAs, developmental malformations, such as hatching delay, curved body axis, pericardial edema, uninflated swim bladder and yolk sac edema, were observed at 120 h postfertilization (hpf). The estimated 120 hpf nominal concentrations of no observed effect concentration and lowest observed effect concentration for DKAs were 18.75 and 37.50 mg/L, respectively, suggesting that DKAs have much lower toxicity than other persistent pollutants. Following DKA exposure, embryonic heart rates were significantly reduced as compared to the controls at 48 and 60 hpf. The peak bending motion frequency appeared 1 h earlier than in control embryos. The 2.34 and 9.38-mg/L treatment groups had a higher basal swim rate than control groups at 120 hpf in both light and light-to-dark photoperiod experiments. The occurrence of high speed swim rates was enhanced approximately threefold to sevenfold in the 2.34 and 9.38 mg/L treatments compared to the control. Glutathione (GSH) concentrations in the 2.34 and 9.38-mg/L treatments were significantly higher than the control at 72 hpf, suggesting that GSH production was induced at the end of the hatching period. When exposed to DKAs, zebrafish superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activities were significantly inhibited in the early embryonic period, demonstrating that the clearing ability in zebrafish was lower than the generation rate of free radicals. In summary, the combined DKAs were developmentally toxic to zebrafish in their early life stages and had the ability to impair individual behaviors that are of great importance in the assessment of their ecological fitness.
