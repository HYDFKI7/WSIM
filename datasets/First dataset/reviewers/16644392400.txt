36448972356	A method measuring semantic relatedness for concepts in ontology base	The notion of semantic relatedness between concepts in Ontology finds use in many contexts, for example, in search engines, web service semantic matching, and clustering. Many methods relating semantic relatedness or similarity have been suggested that are classified to four sorts: counting words/concepts similarity based on WordNet, obtaining semantic distance only by their structure such as graph methods, getting semantic similarity by machine learning from large quantity of individuals and making probability statistic such as informatics method, some special fields such as using lattices for semantic matching and so on. In this paper, we introduce an easy-to-use, flexible algorithm measuring semantic relatedness between concepts in OWL, based on ontology structure and concepts' semantic relation, which does not need other lexical base such as WordNet, nor machine learning from quite large quantity of individuals. It just occurs in a domain ontology base. Firstly we analysis the concepts' relationship in OWL and classify them corresponding to DL (Description Logic) into subsume, non-subsume, equivalence, reference. Because in DL, subsume is an important relation, the detailed subsuming theories and computing lemma are given. According to these principles, we propose our method measuring classes' semantic relatedness sufficiently using ontology hierarchical structure and semantic relation. A prototype of our approach is currently under development as part of the CSAOR (Content&Situation Awareness Ontology Knowledge Routing) project. At last a case is given and the comparison of our measures against some measures is given showing our method's validity.

62449084831	TDCF: Time Distribution Collaborative Filtering Algorithm	Today collaborative filtering is the most successful recommender system technology. However, in traditional collaborative filtering algorithms, users' interest is considered to be static. That means, in these algorithms, ratings produced at different times are weighted equally, and changes in user purchase interest are not taken into consideration. For this reason, the system may recommend unsatisfactory items when users' interest has changed. To solve this problem, the time factor has been brought into collaborative filtering. In new algorithms, we have divided users' rating history into several equal time stages, and analyzed users' interest distribution in these stages. Experiments have shown that our new algorithm TDCF (Time Distribution Collaborative Filtering Algorithm) substantially improves the precision of item-based collaborative filtering. © 2008 IEEE.

69049099030	A collaborative filtering algorithm with phased forecast	Collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms predict interests of an active user in order to deal with the overload of information. Usually, changes of her interests have been ignored in traditional algorithms, which take user's interest as static data and product rating in different phase with same weight. So when users' interests have changed as time goes on, unneeded items may be recommended. In order to solve above problem, we propose a new item-based collaborative filtering algorithm in this paper. In this algorithm, named PFCF, we firstly divide users' rating history into several periods, then users' interests distributing in these periods are analyzed by a phrased forecast method, which is used to find user's different type interests. The proposed algorithm is strictly tested on the MovieLens data set.

However, user similarity alone is not enough for recommendation. We propose that trust is another important issue in recommender systems. Due to data sparsity of the item ratings matrix, we may not find the similar neighbors of the active user and thus CF Recommender Systems often fails in this condition. Taking trust into consideration can alleviate those problems. We consider replacing similarity weight with trust weight by trust propagation over the trust network. And we propose that trust decreases along propagation. A comparison between MoleTrust and our trust metric-DecTrust based on Epinions.com dataset shows that our trust metric can improve the accuracy while keeping coverage. © 2009 IEEE.

However, it is easier for experts, who are familiar with some topics, to fulfill they needs through search engines due to their backgrounds, domain knowledge and so on. A sharing experts' experiences approach should be struck based on today's Web browsers and major search engines. This paper presents a convenient way for users to share and utilize experts' experiences through a Web browser toolbar for collaborative Web search. The toolbar can catch search histories and favorites and display recommendations for every user in a popular Web browser through integrating with mainstream search engines like Google, Yahoo!, et al. These collected users' data are uploaded to a recommendation server, in which recommendations are built according to some rules based on an utilizing experts' experiences approach. The toolbar can download some valuable recommendations merging into default search list for prompting a searcher. The core of our proposed approach is a scalable method to measure "to what degree a user is an expert" for a given topic and to detect an expert's experiences based on a hierarchical user profile. Experiments showed that the novel collaborative Web search way is acceptant to users and experts' experiences improved search quality when compared to standard Google rankings. More importantly, results verified our hypothesis that a significant improvement on search quality can be achieved by utilizing experts' experiences. © 2010 IEEE.

One of the main limitations of RL is the slowness in convergence. Thus, several methods have been proposed to speed up RL. They involve the incorporation of prior knowledge or bias into RL. In this paper, we present a new method for incorporating bias into RL. This method extends the choosing initial Q-values method proposed by Hailu G. and Sommer G. and one kind of learning mechanism is introduced into agent. This allows for much more specific information to guide the agent which action to choose and meanwhile it is helpful to reduce the state research space.

In order to solve the joint modellings in the assembled structure, this paper presents a new method to creat beam elements between two symmetrical nodes on the contact surface of the joint. The stiffness and damping matrices of the elements are valuated according to the characteristics of the joint. To validate the accuracy of the proposed method, the modeling of an assembled structure with and without the joints is obtained and some corresponding experimental investigations are implemented. The error between the simulated and experimental results of the finite element model is less than 8.8%, while the error of the contact model often used in the existing literatures is one times bigger than the proposed model. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84864301686	OKN: A presentation method for web resource based on ontologies	In order to acquire satisfying knowledge quickly in current Web and semantic Web, it is very important to find an effective method to present Web resource. We proposed a concept of Ontological Knowledge Node (OKN) as the core of semantic search model and give a design schema to organize knowledge representation from domain perspective. OKN is a kind of Web resource representation method, which consists of a 6-tuple set and can represent the intension and extension of ontologies as well as the relationship between ontologies. This method was explained in detail from the perspective of granular computing. In order to show advantages of the OKN, a Semantic Search Engine was established, which combines the OKN with Nutch to search campus resources. OKN was proved to work well on semantic search. © 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH.

84868633683	A survey on emotional semantic mapping in image retrieval	Emotion plays an important role in the human perception and decision-making process. Human comprehension and perception of images is subjective, and not merely rely on lower-level visual features. Semantic gap is regarded as the most important challenge of image retrieval. In this paper, we analyzed the emotional features as well as emotional semantic description of images, which comes from the image emotional semantics retrieval framework. And also the mapping ways and means were summarized from image visual features to emotional semantics. Finally, the disadvantages of emotional semantic mapping and developing tendency were discussed. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84873847979	Identification of image emotional semantic based on feature fusion	Due to the semantic gap, we can only extract the image feature to identify indirectly the image emotional semantic. In view of the feature extraction problem of image emotional semantic identification, the image feature fusion algorithm with weights is proposed and applied to the identification of image emotional semantic in our paper. According to the effects of the extracted color, texture and shape features of image on emotional semantic, the features are weighted and fused into new feature input. Support Vector Machine is used to achieve emotional semantic identification. This algorithm is more accurate than the method that used only a kind of image features in experiments. © 2012 IEEE.

84875762959	Modeling study of the CNC Heavy-duty gantry machine coupling with the characteristics of the joint surfaces	Aiming at the existing of the joint surfaces in the CNC Heavy-dutygantry machine, a new method exactly creating the spring-dumping element of the joints by using joint nodes is presented. By using the finite theory, a mechanical system is divided into two typesof part, Bodies, Joints. Each part has its modeling. Continuous bodies are compartmentalized by using finite method. And the joint surfaces are divided into element and nodes. The joint nodes carry symmetrical characteristics. In the modeling of the joints, the new element that is created by the node and the corresponding node of six degrees of freedom embodies the relationship of the node among the tension, compression and torsion. The CNC Heavy-dutygantry machine model can be built by combining the elements and nodes of the joints and the bodies. In order to validate the imperative of modeling the joints and the effectiveness of the new method, a general CNC heavy-dutygantry with and without the characteristics of the joints are built by using the HYPERMESH and ANSYS software, meantime, the emulated data of the modal analysis and the experimental data are contrasted.

84879025960	The influence of the chucking mode on the manufacture of the z-guide face camber curve of super-span beam	Using finite element method, the authors analyzed the manufacture and installation process of cross-rail, fully taking into account measuring impact of the camber curve under the different ways, and compared the installation difference between the manufacture and the work condition. The measure result was explained and the deviation reason was found. The error of the camber curve came from the clamping difference between the manufacture and the work condition. The authors advice that the reverse curve of deformation according to the work condition cannot be used directly to manufacture, when the clamping condition is different from the work condition. A new camber curve was provided, and the error, brought by the clamping condition, was compensated, and the deviation of the camber curve was eliminated.

84883476200	A OWL-based Semantic Web service discovery framework	Current Semantic Web Service discovery mechanism consumes too much resource and lacks the ability to be used in real-world, large-scale situations. This paper propose a new kind of Semantic Web Service framework based on the concept of dividing the Semantic Web into different domains, and by introducing a kind of Semantic Web Service Router to help reduce the set of service description information which service request information has to be matched against., we hope the service discovery process can proceed more quickly and more precisely and the speed of service discovery can be reduced.

0141564741	The Application of Neural Network and Fuzzy Reasoning in Fault Diagnosis	The task of fault diagnosis is to find a hypothesis that best explains a set of observations. Generally, it is computationally expensive to find a hypothesis because the number of the potential hypothesis is exponentially larger. Recently, many studies have been made to find hybrid methods to solve the above difficulty. In this paper, we propose a model with neural network and fuzzy, logic and expert system for fault diagnosis problem solving. We make use of neural network group and fuzzy expert system to process data from a high pressure air compressor. Experimental results show that the hybrid technique is better.

0141895140	The research on information interoperability and sharing model based on ontology description	This paper expounds the semantic conflicts existing in distributed information systems. In order to iron out the conflicts between data coming from different data sources and facilitate the interoperability among distributed, heterogeneous data sources, we put forward a novel method: using ontology to describe concepts in different sites and structuring the information. It allows for a more disciplined design of database, and it facilitates sharing and reuse. Then we also put forth an interoperable and sharing model for remote education. Though this model is put forward for remote education, it also can be applied to other application domains, such as Web-based databases, digital library, data warehouses, data mining, etc.

84888599259	A study on dynamic Semantic Web service composition	Description Logic possesses strong knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities and offers logical foundation for Semantic Web ontology languages such as OWL and OWL-S. However, the present implementations of OWL and OWL-S are deficient in semantic modeling for dynamic service composition. They also do not consider user preferences. AI planning possesses a better modeling capability of action state transformations in planning and provides an effective method for solving planning problem and task decomposition. However, it is limited in knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. Based on merits of Description Logic, OWL-S and AI planning, this paper extends OWL-S model, proposes a service composition mechanism and testifies its feasibility in Description Logic. The results show that this composition mechanism is not only feasible but also helpful for semantic modeling of service composition in Semantic Web. © 2013 ? IOS Press and the authors.

84903582518	Research for the EDSS framework based-on temporal knowledge representation	In EDSS there have not only temporal data but also temporal knowledge. Temporal repression is a very important problem. This paper describes a simple and maneuverable model framework. It uses the interval algebra theory to reconstruct knowledge base, adopts the layered conception of case character factors to construct cases, and integrates temporal reasoning and cased-based reasoning. This framework can realize knowledge's temporal properties and corresponding relation between the set of character factors and the set of rules. It implements temporal knowledge expression and reasoning and provides dependable proofs for decision-maker. The paper final target is trying to solve the knowledge temporal problem in dynamic decision-making environment and provides an applied platform for researchers. © 2005 World Scientific Publishing Co.
