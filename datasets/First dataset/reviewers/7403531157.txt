84948103477	Neuroendoscopic techniques in the management of pineal region tumors	In recent years, the use of the endoscope is a valid alternative to the classical microscopical approaches for the treatment of the pineal tumors. It can be used for endoscopic tumor biopsy (ETB) as well as endoscopic-assisted complete tumor removal in some cases. At the same time, if there is coexisting hydrocephalus, this can be treated endoscopically with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). The management of pineal region tumors can be summarized as follows: 1. In case of suspected germinoma or pineoblastoma with accompanying hydrocephalus and normal values of AFP and β-hCG, we propose endoscopic tumor biopsy and third ventriculostomy. If the biopsy provides tumor-type diagnosis, further oncological management is pursued as the next step. 2. In case of suspected mature teratoma, non-germinomatous malignant germ cell tumor (NGMGCT), or other tumors, we propose radical excision of the tumor, endoscopically assisted when needed and navigation assisted if necessary. 3. In case of midbrain tumors, we propose endoscopic third ventriculostomy combined with biopsy in selected cases. In some cases an endoscopic removal of the tumor can be achieved. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy has a high success rate in dealing with the hydrocephalus caused by pineal region tumors. At the same time, biopsy samples can be obtained with the endoscope from tumors which protrude in the third ventricle, with good yield rate, comparable to stereotactic biopsy. In selected cases, endoscopy-assisted surgical techniques can be employed to remove pineal region tumors. Complication rate for these procedures is low.

1842477488	Management of hydrocephalus in posterior fossa tumors: How, what, when?	Object: The aim of this work is to analyze the current management of hydrocephalus associated with posterior fossa (PF) tumors. Methods: The personal perspectives of experienced pediatric neurosurgeons were presented at a virtual round table. Discussion: Preoperative hydrocephalus has been reported in about 80% of patients with PF tumors and postoperative treatment is required for persistent or progressive hydrocephalus in about 25-30% of the cases. Preoperative management includes external ventricular drainage (EVD), endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), shunt insertion, and no treatment at all, while ETV and ventriculo-peritoneal (V-P) shunt are recommended as treatment after PF craniotomy. Conclusion: There is no consensus on the way hydrocephalus should be managed before, during, and after PF surgery. While awaiting prospective multicenter trials of various management schemes the perioperative management of hydrocephalus in the context of posterior fossa tumors should be considered as options. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

20344394918	Increased expression of osteopontin gene in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the central nervous system	The atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, primary to the central nervous system, is a highly malignant and aggressive neoplasm of infancy and childhood. Although having distinct biological features and clinical outcomes, it is frequently misdiagnosed as primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma. To further distinguish the underlying pathogenesis and to identify biological markers for clinical use, an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor-derived cell line was established and its gene expression pattern analyzed in comparison to the human astrocyte SVG12 cell line and the human DAOY medulloblastoma cell line using a complementary DNA microarray method. The osteopontin gene was found specifically upregulated in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor cells. This specificity was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in pathological sections of tissues from atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor patients. Even though the role of osteopontin in the cytopathogenesis of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor still needs to be determined, our data support that overexpressed osteopontin is a potential diagnostic marker for atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. © 2005 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

18744382412	Neuroradiological findings in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the central nervous system	Purpose: To evaluate the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of atypical teratoid tumor/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) of the central nervous system (CNS). Material and methods: Twenty cases of CNS AT/RT have been found over the past 23 years in our hospital; these involving 11 boys and 9 girls whose mean age at diagnosis was 5.5 years. Their clinical data, the CT, and MRI findings were reviewed retrospectively. Results: AT/RT was located in the cerebellum in 15 cases. Four cases arose from the supratentorial region, while only one occurred primarily in the lumbar spinal cord. Almost all cases revealed heterogeneous intensity and heterogeneous enhancement. Peripheral cystic components were common. Survival time ranged from 2 months to 3 years, with a mean survival of 11.6 months. Conclusion: Most cases of AT/RT are located in the cerebellum. The radiologic manifestations are non-specific. The diagnosis mainly depends on the pathologic findings. However, AT/RT should still remain in the differential diagnosis of brain tumors in young children, especially those located in the cerebellar hemisphere and with eccentric cysts. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

19944431379	Elevation of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid osteopontin levels in patients with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor	Osteopontin, a cancer metastasis-associated gene, is specifically up-regulated in central nervous system (CNS) atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), but its biological behavior in the progression of CNS AT/RT has never been studied. We obtained plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue specimens from lobectomy of hemispherectomy samples from 39 patients (medulloblastoma, 16; AT/RT, 8; epilepsy, 6; hydrocephalus, 9). By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the median osteopontin levels in plasma and CSF in AT/RT (852.0 and 1,175.0 ng/mL, respectively) were significantly higher than in medulloblastoma (492.5 and 524.5 ng/mL, respectively) and hydrocephalus and epilepsy (208.0 and 168.0 ng/mL, respectively) (P < .05). The results of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that osteopontin expression in AT/RT (n = 5) was significantly higher than in medulloblastoma (n = 8) samples. The differences in osteopontin expression in plasma, CSF, and tumor samples in AT/RT and medulloblastoma correlated with survival differences. In 5 patients with AT/RT, plasma osteopontin levels decreased after treatment but increased with relapse. Osteopontin might be a potential marker to aid in identifying AT/RT recurrence.

0030061682	Quality of life and life satisfaction in families after a child has undergone corpus callosotomy	Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition which can have a detrimental effect on patients' quality of life (QOL). We evaluated the overall satisfaction with QOL and changes in QOL in 25 families with children who had undergone corpus callosotomy for severe epilepsy. The mean age of seizure onset was 3.4 years, and the mean period from seizure onset to operation was 5.2 years. Mean follow-up was 19.3 months. Twenty of 22 patients had various degrees of mental retardation. Mean reduction in severity of seizure activity was 64%. Nineteen of 25 (76%) parents were satisfied with the surgical result. Eighteen of 25 parents (72%) described a good level of satisfaction with their families QOL after callosotomy. Reduction in severity of seizure activity was significantly correlated with how successful families considered the surgery to be and how satisfied they were with their QOL (r = 0.72 and 0.77, respectively). Life domains showing one greatest improvement after callosotomy included level of self-care, family life, and school performance. Improvements in level of self-care, family life, and school performance were associated with higher levels of life satisfaction (r = 0.69, 0.60, and 0.59, respectively). Hyperactivity, attention span, and social skills improved significantly in 11 patients after surgery. Callosotomy did not improve mental performance. We conclude that improved seizure control after callosotomy is also associated with improved QOL.

0030250128	Quantitative measurement of improvement in sitting balance in children with spastic cerebral palsy after selective posterior rhizotomy	The difference in the sitting balance of 17 children with spastic cerebral palsy before and after selective posterior rhizotomy (SPR) was investigated using a quantitative measurement in sitting stability represented as the dispersion index provided by the Chattecx Balance System. Their sitting stability under static and dynamic, visual and nonvisual testing conditions was assessed before SPR and three months after SPR. Significant improvement was observed in the sitting balance at postoperative evaluation except for the static-nonvisual testing condition. Results indicate that dynamic sitting balance was worse than static sitting balance in these patients.

0030830115	Primary cerebellar extramedullary myeloid cell tumor mimicking oligodendroglioma	Extramedullary myeloid cell tumors (EMCTs) are tumors consisting of immature cells of the myeloid series that occur outside the bone marrow. Most of them are associated with acute myelogenous leukemia or other myeloproliferative disorders, and a small number occur as primary lesions, i.e., are not associated with hematological disorders. Occurrence inside the cranium is rare, and there has been only one case of primary EMCT involving the cerebellum reported in the literature. The case we report here is a blastic EMCT occurring in the cerebellum of a 3-year-old boy who had no signs of leukemia or any hematological disorder throughout the entire course. The cerebellar tumor was at first misdiagnosed as an 'oligodendroglioma' because of the uniformity and 'fried egg' artifact of the tumor cells. The tumor disappeared during chemotherapy consisting of 12 treatments. However, it recurred and metastasized to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shortly after the therapy was completed. A diagnosis of EMCT was suspected because of the presence of immature myeloid cells in the CSF, and was confirmed by antimyeloperoxidase and anti-lysozyme immunoreactivity of the cerebellar tumor. The patient succumbed 1 year and 3 months after the first presentation of the disease.

0030934290	Neuropsychological sequelae after treatment for medulloblastoma in childhood - the Taiwan experience	The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional independence, intellectual performance and academic achievement of children treated for medulloblastoma at the Veterans General Hospital - Taipei. Adverse factors that it was thought would result in significant intellectual impairment were also studied. Nineteen patients with medulloblastoma located over the posterior fossa were enrolled in this study. Their mean age at tumor removal was 6.16 ± 3.30 (range 2-14) years. Mean full intelligent quotient (FIQ) was 86.00 ± 22.66, performance intelligent quotient (PIQ) was 85.29 ± 21.23, and verbal intelligent quotient (VIQ) was 90.50 ± 23.50. In 11 cases academic achievement at school was poor. Sixteen patients received radiation therapy after tumor removal. Significant negative correlations were noted between IQ and whole-brain irradiation dose (r = -0.72) and between IQ and years after radiation therapy (r = -0.63). The results indicate a need for ongoing attention and intervention to prevent, remedy or minimize deficits produced by the tumor itself and by the cancer treatment.

0032137105	Prognostic Factors and Therapeutic Options of Radiotherapy in Pediatric Brain Stem Gliomas	Background: A retrospective analysis was made to clarify the relationship between prognosis, radiation dose and survival of brain stem gliomas. Methods: From 1983 to 1995, 22 children with brain stem tumors were treated by radiotherapy in the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei. Twelve patients had pathology proof and the remainder were diagnosed by computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Seven patients had postoperative radiotherapy. Fifteen patients had radiotherapy as primary management, five of whom had adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients received 4000-7060 cGy, either in conventional daily or hyperfractionated twice daily radiotherapy. Survival from date of diagnosis was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analyses and multivariate analyses were calculated by the log rank test and the Cox proportional hazard model, respectively. Results: Most patients showed improvement following treatment. The overall 2-year survival rate was 55.5% with a median survival of 27.1 months. Two-year survival for patients with primary management of operation and radiotherapy (n = 7), radiotherapy alone (n = 10) and radiotherapy with adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 5) were 66.7, 50 and 53.3%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the study revealed that the growth pattern of tumors and the simultaneous presence of cranial neuropathy and long tract sign were significant prognostic factors (P= 0.017 and 0.036). A trend of better outcome with radiation dose > 6600 cGy and the hyperfractionation scheme was also noted in our study (P= 0.0573 and 0.0615). However, only the hyperfractionation scheme showed significance in multivariate analyses (P= 0.0355). Survival was not significantly affected by age, gender or method of diagnosis. Conclusion: Radiotherapy appears to be an effective treatment modality of brain stem tumors. Patients with both cranial neuropathy and long tract signs had a poorer outcome. Hyperfractionated radiotherapy may give better local control and lead to better survival.

0032526213	MIB-1 labeling index in nonpilocytic astrocytoma of childhood: A study of 101 cases	BACKGROUND. The prognosis of pediatric patients with nonpilocytic astrocytoma, and in particular those with anaplastic astrocytoma, is somewhat unpredictable. This study used MIB-1 monoclonal antibody, a proliferative marker that can be used in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues, to study nonpilocytic pediatric astrocytoma. METHODS. Astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and glioblastoma specimens excised from a total of 101 pediatric patients during the period from January 1975 to September 1996 were retrieved from the authors' surgical pathology file. Histologic grading of the specimens was performed based on a modified Ringertz system. The proliferative potential of the tumors was estimated by using the MIB-1 labeling index (LI), which was evaluated with morphologic grades of tumors and survival of the patients. RESULTS. Of the 101 patients, 34 had astrocytoma, 33 had anaplastic astrocytoma, and 34 had glioblastoma. Their mean survival times were 165.2 ± 14.9 months (mean ± standard error; SE), 46.1 ± 9.9 months, and 21.8 ± 5.6 months, respectively. The mean MIB-1 LI of different tumor grades were as follows: astrocytoma, 3.9 ± 4.3 (mean ± standard deviation; range, 0.0-21.6); anaplastic astrocytoma, 24.3 ± 15.6 (range, 1.7-62.8); and glioblastoma, 35.9 ± 16.4 (range, 7.36-63.3). The mean survival of the entire group of patients with LIs ≤ 11 was 173.2 ± 12.2 months (mean ± SE), and the mean survival of those with LIs > 11 was 20.3 ± 4.1 months. The survival of anaplastic astrocytoma patients with LIs ≤ 11 was similar to that of astrocytoma patients, whereas the survival of anaplastic astrocytoma patients with LI > 11 was similar to that of patients with glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study show that histopathologic grading can predict the outcome for patients with astrocytomas and glioblastomas, whereas MIB-1 LI can separate better and worse prognostic groups in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma.

27644477966	Prognostic value of electrocorticography findings during callosotomy in children with Lennox - Gastaut syndrome	Objectives: To analyze findings and acute changes in electrocorticograms (ECoGs) obtained during corpus callosotomy in order to identify any relationships with the postoperative outcome of seizure activity. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed ECoGs obtained during anterior callosotomy (4-6 cm) in 48 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (32 boys and 16 girls, age 1-20 years, mean age 7.6 years) who underwent surgery between July 1993 and November 1996 to correlate recording findings with postoperative seizure activity. At the time of analysis, all patients had been followed postoperatively for more than 4 years. Results: Of 48 patients, 31 (64.6%) had significant improvement in seizure control after surgery. In pre-excisional ECoGs, 38 (79.2%) of 48 patients had bisynchronous epileptiform discharges. Patients (23 of 33 patients, 69.7%) with significant blockage of bisynchronous discharges recorded during callosotomy achieved the best postoperative seizure outcomes, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Based on our experience, changes in ECoG during callosotomy do not predict postoperative seizure outcome. Insignificant blockage of bisynchronous epileptiform discharges in ECoGs during callosotomy does not predict a worse prognosis than that associated with significant intraoperative blockage. © 2005 BEA Trading Ltd.

27644488204	Primary pediatric brain tumors: Statistics of Taipei VGH, Taiwan (1975-2004)	BACKGROUND. The purpose of the current study was to investigate a hospital series of 986 cases of primary pediatric brain tumors in Taiwan. METHODS. The authors reviewed the database of primary pediatric brain tumors in patients < 18 years of age collected in Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei VGH) from 1975 to May 2004. Age and gender distribution, location, and classification of brain tumors were analyzed. Intracranial tumors with diagnostic imaging were included. Nontumoral lesions, cysts, and vascular malformations were excluded. RESULTS. The mean age of these 986 patients was 7.8 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.4:1. Supratentorial (including pineal-quadrigeminal) located tumors (58.3%) was predominant to infratentorial tumors (41.1%). In these series, 886 patients had either histologic diagnosis (842 patients) or clinical diagnosis (44 patients). The most common 5 categories of tumors were astrocytic tumors (31.1%), germ cell tumors (14.0%), medulloblastomas (13.3%), craniopharyngiomas (8.3%), and ependymal tumors (5.8%). Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs), a rare but highly malignant tumor, were 2.1%. The high incidence of primary intracranial germ cell tumors correlated with reported series from Japan and Korea. For the remaining 100 patients without diagnostic classifications, the majority were most likely astrocytic tumors in brain stem. CONCLUSIONS. The authors analyzed a large hospital series of primary brain tumors in children. Both histologically verified and unverified tumors were recruited to avoid selective bias. Although it was not a study of a population-based brain tumor registry, it could still be representative of primary pediatric brain tumors in Taiwan. © 2005 American Cancer Society.

30644463358	Antiproliferation and radiosensitization of caffeic acid phenethyl ester on human medulloblastoma cells	Purpose: To investigate antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) on medulloblastoma (MB) Daoy cells. Methods and materials: Daoy cells were treated with CAPE in different concentrations and assessed for cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycles, cyclin Bl expressions, radio-sensitization and chemosensitization. Human astroglia SVGp12 cells were treated with CAPE to present the possible protection or complication effects in normal tissues. Results: CAPE inhibited the growth of Daoy cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in MTT and Trypan blue exclusion assays. Flow cytometry revealed that CAPE significantly decreased G2/M fraction, and increased the S phase fraction. Western blot demonstrated a down-regulated cyclin B1 protein expression. Pretreatment with CAPE markedly decreased the viability of irradiated Daoy cells. The sensitizer enhancement ratios (SERs) were increased in CAPE-treated Daoy cells. CAPE in doxorubicin and cisplatin did not show chemosensitizing effect. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of CAPE for Daoy cells, which might bring improvement to the treatment of MB. For clinical application, in vivo models are expected. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

33644559052	Impact of radiotherapy for pediatric CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (single institute experience)	Purpose: To assess outcomes and prognostic factors in radiotherapy of pediatric central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). Methods and Materials: Seventeen patients with central nervous system AT/RT were retrospectively reviewed after curative radiotherapy as primary or adjuvant therapy between January 1990 and December 2003. Overall and failure-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank method was used to compare the effects of dosage (>50 Gy or ≤50 Gy) and treatment duration (>45 days or ≤45 days). Multivariate analysis was performed for prognostic factors. Results: Median overall survival and failure-free survival were 17 and 11 months, respectively. The 3 longest-surviving patients were older, underwent gross tumor removal, and completed both craniospinal and focal boost irradiation. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between the following: overall survival and performance status (p = 0.019), failure-free survival and total irradiation dose (p = 0.037), time interval between surgery and radiotherapy initiation (p = 0.031), and time interval between surgery and radiotherapy end point (p = 0.047). Conclusion: Radiotherapy is crucial in the treatment of AT/RT. We recommend initiating radiotherapy immediately postoperatively and before systemic chemotherapy in pediatric patients ≥3 years of age. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33646158697	Monitoring the growth effect of xenotransplanted human medulloblastoma in an immunocompromised mouse model using in vitro and ex vivo green fluorescent protein imaging	Introduction: Medulloblastoma (MB) is one of the most common malignant brain tumors in children. It is a radiosensitive tumor. At 5 years after radical surgical excision and craniospinal axis irradiation, the tumor-free survival rate is from 50 to 70% [Halperin EC, Constine LS, Tarbell NJ, Kun LE. Pediatric radiation oncology (2005)]. Case Report: In this study, we established xenotransplanted human MB (hMB) cells - Isochromosome 17q - In a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model. We further transduced green fluorescent protein (GFP) into hMB cells to evaluate these hMB cells grafted in SCID mice. Results: The result of an ex vivo GFP imaging system showed that a small lesion of the third-week-hMB-transplanted graft presented "green" signals with a clear tumor margin before any tumor-related symptoms were noted. We also demonstrated that the tumor progression could be monitored by GFP imaging for up to 12 weeks post-transplantation. Conclusions: This novel approach of GFP imaging assessment provides more accurate information of tumor status for experimental brain tumor studies. Because MB is sensitive to radiation and also response to chemotherapy, this SCID mouse model will be helpful for preclinical studies in the future. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33745197939	Using Gelatin Scaffold With Coated Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor as a Transfer System for Transplantation of Human Neural Stem Cells	Gelatin scaffolds for ex vivo cell cultures are a promising development. These scaffolds can be used as three-dimensional skeletons for cell attachment and culture before transplantation. In this study, we isolated and cultivated neural stem cells from human brain tissues in serum-free medium (DMEM+F12 nutrient). Better neuron growth was observed using the tetrazolium assay (MTT) in the group when basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was coated on the gelatin polymer scaffold. Further development of this nontoxic system may help the future development of transplantation of human neural stem cells. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33746284553	Corpus callosotomy in children	Introduction: For children of medical resistant epilepsy without resectable epileptogenic zone, corpus callosotomy and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy are the two commonly used palliative epilepsy surgeries that can be considered. Although their routes and mechanisms to control epilepsy are different, both surgeries have shown their efficacy in selected candidates. The most common candidates for palliative surgery are in infants and children with organic encephalopathic types of epilepsy including infantile spasms/West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci (SE-MISF) and selected symptomatic partial epilepsy to relief seizures and to stabilize co morbidities (Hirsch and Arzimanoglou, Revue Neurologique [Hirsch E and Arzimanoglou A, Rev Neurol (Paris). 160 Spec No 1:5S210-S219, (2004); Ohtahara S and Yamatogi Y, J Clin Neurophysiol 20(6):398-407, (2003); Wheless JW and Epilepsia 45(Suppl 5):17-22, (2004); Trevathan E, J Child Neurol 17 Suppl 2:2S9-2S22, (2002]. Discussion: Callosotomy is a major and destructive but affordable surgical procedure as compare to the relative simple but costly extracranial procedure of VNS therapy. However, callosotomy is a safe and effective palliative operation in neurosurgeons familiar with the surgical procedure. Equipments for callosotomy can be as simple as headlight and binocular loupes, self-retention brain retractor, bipolar cauterization, and simple microinstruments. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33748091339	A comparison of seizure outcome after callosotomy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and a positive or negative history for West syndrome	Purpose: This retrospective study was designed to clarify the role of West syndrome in post-callosotomy seizure outcome in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Methods: From September 1989 to May 1999, 74 patients diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome received anterior corpus callosotomy at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. All patients were followed for more than 4 years after surgery. Among them, 21 (28.4%) patients had a history of West syndrome (Group A) whereas 53 (71.6%) patients did not have a history of West syndrome (Group B). Postoperative seizure outcome was compared for these two patient groups. Results: A total of 16 (76.2%) patients in Group A (positive history) and 29 (54.7%) patients in group B (negative history) achieved significant improvement in seizures after surgery (e.g., seizure reduction of more than 50%). There was no statistical significance (p = 0.088) in the difference in outcome between the two groups. Conclusions: A history of West syndrome does not appear to influence post-callosotomy seizure outcome in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. © 2006.

33751254113	Lamotrigine adjunctive therapy in children with refractory epilepsy: A medical center study	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of adjunctive lamotrigine (LTG) in refractory epilepsy in Taiwan, especially including patients who had undergone ineffective epileptic surgeries. Totally, 27 recruited children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy were treated with LTG add-on therapy, but 23 were enrolled statistically during 2 years period trial. Ten of the 23 patients (43.5%), including 5 undergoing epileptic surgeries, before had a >50% reduction in seizure frequency. Surprisingly, LTG was found to have excellent response in six patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), 5 of whom had received anterior 2/3 callosotomy prior to the trial. Non-seizure related positive effects were presented in 3 patients, including greater alertness and attentiveness in 2 patients and improvement in mood in one patient. This open trial found that LTG was an effective add-on anti-epileptic drug (AED) in Taiwanese children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy and in cases with LGS even after ineffective callosotomy.

35148895089	Plastic phase-locking and magnetic mismatch response to auditory deviants in temporal lobe epilepsy	The magnetic equivalent (MMNm) of mismatch negativity may reflect auditory discrimination and sensory memory. To study whether temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) affects automatic central auditory-change processing, we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to standard and duration-deviant sounds in 12 TLE patients and 12 age-matched controls, and repeated MEG measurement in 8 patients 6-30 months following epilepsy surgery and in 6 controls 3-8 months after their first measurement. We compared the MMNm between patients and controls, and also evaluated intertrial phase coherences as indexed by phase-locking factors (PLF) using wavelet-based analyses. We observed longer MMNm latencies for patients than for controls. Dipole modeling and minimum-current estimates together showed bi-frontotemporal sources for MMNm. The phase locking across trials was dominant at the 4- to 14-Hz band, and the main difference in PLF between deviant- and standard-evoked responses occurred in the time frame of 150-250 ms after stimulus onset. Notably, in the 5 patients who became seizure free after removal of right temporal epileptic focus, the phase-locking phenomena resulting from deviant stimuli were enhanced, and even more distributed in the frontotemporal regions. We conclude that mesial TLE might affect auditory-change detection, and a successful surgery causes a possible plastic change in phase locking of deviant-evoked signals. © The Author 2007.

36549055183	Germinoma involving the basal ganglia in children	Background: Germinoma originating in the basal ganglia is rare, and the majority of reported papers have been from Japan. In a collection of the first 500 cases of primary brain tumors in children in Taipei Veterans General Hospital, six pure germinomas with tissue diagnosis situated in this location. Materials and methods: We reviewed the clinical features, neuroimaging studies, tumor markers, management, and outcome of these six patients. Results: All of them were boys. The median age of onset of symptoms was 9.7 years. They uniformly presented with hemiparesis. The average duration of symptoms before surgical management was 1 year. One patient had bilateral basal ganglia tumors. Serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels was elevated (128 mIU/ml) in one patient. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies in four patients clearly showed that the tumor arose as a tiny lesion at the lenticular nucleus. Five patients had cysts within tumors. Five patients received partial, subtotal, to total resection. One patient had stereotactic biopsy of the tumors. Postoperative primary adjuvant therapies included radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone, and combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Five patients survived, and one patient died of radiation-induced sarcoma with median follow-up period of 13.7 years. Local recurrence was observed in all of three patients after solitary postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusions: The lenticular nucleus is a significant locus for germinomas and can be bilateral. Although rarely reported in Western countries, it does exist in Taiwan as well. Treatment of germinomas in this specific location is similar to germinoma in other intracranial locations. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

0032998242	Pilocytic astrocytoma of the posterior fossa: A follow-up. Study in 15 patients	Background. The extent of resection in pilocytic astrocytoma of the posterior fossa remains undefined, as the problem of hydrocephalus has not yet been solved. We retrospectively reviewed the data from 15 patients with a pilocytic astrocytoma of the posterior fossa to evaluate the impact of surgical technique, in terms of resection extent, by serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. In addition, the issue of hydrocephalus was considered and related to the different treatment modalities. Methods. Macroscopic, gross, total resection of the tumor was performed in all 15 patients. Follow-up was obtained in 14 patients for a period ranging between 11 and 119 months (median, 41.5 months). The ages of patients ranged from two to 13 years (mean, 7 ±3 years). All patients underwent serial MRI examinations in the first month, every six months for the first two years and then yearly. Results. Outcome was good in 12 patients who had no neurologic deficit and fair in two patients who were slightly handicapped but had an independent life. There were four patients with an abnormally persistent enhancement on MRI, with a median follow-up of 30 months. One of these patients had progressively increasing size of the enhancement. Three of them had the same size of enhancement during the follow-up period. The MRI findings showed residual tumors in four patients. One of them had tumor regrowth one year after surgery. There were 11 cases with pilocytic astrocytoma and hydrocephalus. Five patients were treated with tumor removal and external CSF drainage. Six patients underwent tumor removal only, without perioperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Only one patient had a permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Conclusions. Our study illustrated that the extent of tumor resection of pilocytic astrocytoma can be defined by postoperative serial MRI examinations. Long-term follow-up with MRI seems mandatory in cases with abnormal enhancement. Hydrocephalus is a common finding in patients with a pilocytic astrocytoma. A permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt is required only in patients with postoperative hydrocephalus.

0033377769	Pediatric intracranial germinoma treated with chemotherapy alone	Background. Pediatric intracranial germinoma treated with radiotherapy is considered a standard treatment, but may cause significant delayed damage to the central nervous system. Chemotherapy has been shown to be effective for the treatment of an intracranial germinoma. In the past 10 years, we treated 11 cases of primary intracranial germinoma with chemotherapy alone. The purpose of this retrospective study is to review the clinical outcome of these patients. Methods. Eleven children with newly diagnosed, previously untreated primary intracranial germinomas were treated with six courses of chemotherapy (vinblastine bleomycin, cisplatin and etoposide, VBPE). The response to chemotherapy, relapses and outcomes are reviewed and evaluated. Results. All 11 assessable children achieved a complete response and are alive, with a median follow-up of 61 months. Five patients with tumors located in the midline position of the brain, including pineal, sellar, suprasellar and hypothalamic areas, had no relapse. Six patients had relapses, and all of them achieved a second complete remission after salvage focal radiotherapy. The time of onset of relapse was from nine to 24 months after chemotherapy, with an average of 16.8 months. Conclusions. VBPE chemotherapy was effective for treating newly diagnosed intracranial germinomas. Although a high rate of relapse (6/11) was observed, all of these patients survived with first or second complete remissions. It was beneficial for five children that focal radiation was eliminated and delayed post- irradiation neurologic sequelae were avoided.

0034057151	Seizure outcome after corpus callosotomy: The Taiwan experience	From September 1989 to August 1996, we performed anterior corpus callosotomy in 83 patients. Unfortunately, 9 patients were lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 74 patients, 59 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (evolved from infantile spasms in 22), 9 had complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalized seizures, 1 had multifocal independent epileptogenic foci (MISF) syndrome, 3 had hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE), and 2 had infantile spasms. All cases were followed up for at least 2 years after surgery. The highest rate of significant improvement (more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was noted in the patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 82.1% of whom experienced significant improvement, followed by those with generalized tonic seizures (76.7%), atonic seizures (72.7%), myoclonic seizures (64.9%), atypical absences (58.6%), and complex partial seizure with or without secondary generalization (61.5%). Complete freedom from seizures was noted in 14 cases (18.9%). One patient had the anterior half of his right palm amputated following radial artery thrombosis complicated by insertion of an arterial line during anesthesia. Otherwise, there were no major postoperative complications except for brief mutism and multifocal jerks in some patients during the 1st postoperative week. Thus, we conclude that corpus callosotomy is a safe alternative treatment for all kinds of medically intractable seizures, especially generalized epilepsy.

0034075911	Postoperative seizure outcome after corpus callosotomy in reflex epilepsy	Flickering light and color patterns, reading, language, movement, decision making, eating, tapping and touching, hot water immersion and auditory stimulation can induce seizures in some epileptic patients. These are known as the 'reflex epilepsies'. The mechanism of reflex epilepsy is not clear. Recently, we performed anterior two-thirds corpus callosotomies in two reflex epilepsy patients (ages 12 and 14 years), with follow-up for more than three years. Patient 1 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with auditory-induced generalized atonic or tonic seizures (startle epilepsy), which decreased by 60% after callosotomy. Patient 2 had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with somatosensory-induced generalized tonic seizures (tap epilepsy). He was seizure-free for one year immediately after callosotomy, but his seizures recurred with the same degree and frequency as before surgery. The nonsignificant postoperative seizure outcome suggests that the corpus callosum only plays a partial role in seizure generation. Our report also discusses the possible mechanisms of generation of reflex seizures.

0034107370	Membranous occlusion of the foramen of Monro following ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion: A role for endoscopic foraminoplasty	We report two cases of lateral ventricle dilatation due to membranous occlusion of the foramen of Monro following ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. Both cases were treated successfully by endoscopic foraminoplasty of the obstructed foramen of Monro and III ventriculostomy. One child had meningomyelocele and hydrocephalus. She had CSF infection after repair of the back lesion. Isolated left lateral ventricle occurred after insertion of a right ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus when the girl was 2 months old. A right ventriculoperitoneal shunt was then inserted. Chronic shunt infection with abdominal pseudocyst was found 8 years later. The shunts were exteriorized. Membranous obstruction of the foramen of Monro was found endoscopically. Fenestration of the membranous obstruction along with a III ventriculostomy was performed. After the endoscopic procedure, the exteriorized ventriculoperitoneal shunt was removed 2 weeks later. The patient was still symptom free without shunting 14 months after the operation. The other child had hydrocephalus after a premature birth and hemorrhage. Repeated ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections contributed to membranous obstruction of bilateral foramen of Monro. After the shunt infection was treated this patient's shunting procedure was simplified by endoscopic foraminoplasty of the left and right foramen of Monro along with a III ventriculostomy. He was symptom free with a new ventriculoperitoneal shunt 9 months after the operation.

0034127220	Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the central nervous system: A comparative study with primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma	Eleven atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) and 121 primitive neuroectodermal tumors/medulloblastomas (PNET/MB) were included in this study for evaluation of the histopathological features of AT/RT and comparison between AT/RT and PNET/MB. Histopathological studies of AT/RT showed that in addition to the commonly recognized components, i.e., rhabdoid cells, small (PNET/MB) cells, spindle cells and epithelial components, there was a previously unrecognized component, sickle-shaped embracing cells, which were present in all cases and could be useful as a histological marker of this tumor. Immunohistochemical studies showed divergent differentiation of the tumor cells and among the 16 antibodies studied, vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, epithelial membrane antigen and glial fibrillary acidic protein were most commonly reactive. The frequency of AT/RT expressed as a ratio of AT/RT to PNET/MB was 1:11 in general and increased to 1:3.8 among patients younger than 3 years old. The AT/RT patients were younger than those with PNET/MB and had a female predominance. The MIB-1 labeling index of AT/RT was significantly higher than that of PNET/MB (mean 63.9 vs 40.1), which correlated with a shorter survival in patients with AT/RT than those with PNET/MB (median survival time 15.4 months vs 156.4 months).

0033914706	Postcallosotomy seizure outcome in hemiconvulsion-hemiatrophy-epilepsy syndrome	Recently, three patients with hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome who underwent callosotomy were monitored for more than four years. All patients had atrophy of the right brain hemisphere with left hemiparesis and seizures. Two cases were probably the result of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and one was due to an unknown cause. Wada tests were done in cases 1 and 2, which showed spared motor function of the atrophic hemisphere, supporting the choice of callosotomy instead of hemispherectomy. Patient 1 had atypical absence seizures and asymmetric generalized tonic seizures before surgery, the latter of which decreased by about 60% after callosotomy. Patient 2 had simple partial seizures of the motor type and complex partial seizures, the latter of which were also induced by touch (somatosensory- induced reflex epilepsy). This patent's complex partial seizures disappeared completely, but the simple partial seizures remained unchanged. Patient 3 had generalized tonic seizures, simple partial seizures of the sensory type and complex partial seizures. After surgery, the frequency of the generalized tonic seizures decreased more than 90%. The simple partial seizures of the sensory type remained unchanged. There were two new types of seizures after surgery, simple partial seizures of the motor type and brief generalized myoclonic jerks. All patients had significant reductions in numbers of seizures of more than 50%.

39449122174	Comparison of hypothalamopituitary axis dysfunction of intrasellar and third ventricular craniopharyngiomas in children	In this study, we attempted to determine if different locations of a tumor influence the hypothalamopituitary axis function and outcomes with childhood craniopharyngiomas. The preoperative, postoperative, and long-term follow-up endocrinological disturbances of 66 children with a craniopharyngioma were retrospectively studied. The patients were divided into two subgroups according to the location of the tumor (intrasellar and third ventricle floor). The mean age at onset was 8.02 (range, 1.42-17.58) years. These patients were followed-up for a median duration of 7.2 (range, 2-22) years. Vision problems as the first symptom were more common in Group One (with intrasellar tumors) compared to Group Two (55.6% vs 15.4%; p = 0.001; Fisher's exact test). Increased intracranial pressure was the most common initial symptom in patients in Group Two (51.3%) and the second most common symptom in Group One (37%). The majority of patients in both Group One and Group Two required some forms of pituitary hormone supplements (96% vs 84%). At the last follow-up, more patients with intrasellar craniopharyngiomas needed cortisone supplements (79.2% in Group One vs 45.9% in Group Two; p = 0.016; Fisher's exact test); however, children with third ventricle floor tumors had more prevalent weight gain (4.2% in Group One vs 27.0% in Group Two; p = 0.038; Fisher's exact test). There were different initial presentations and endocrinological outcomes between children with intrasellar and third ventricle floor craniopharyngiomas. The intrasellar tumors had greater pituitary hormone disturbance. However, at the long-term follow-up, children with third ventricle floor tumors had a greater prevalence of being overweight and obese, which was associated with hypothalamic dysfunction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

84876697816	Spinal subdural hematoma following posterior fossa surgery	Spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) is a rare but potentially devastating complication of cranial surgery. This study presents two cases of SSDH after posterior fossa surgery. The first case was a 44-year-old man who harbored a fourth ventricle metastatic adenocarcinoma, and the second case was a 4-year-old boy with a posterior fossa medulloblastoma. Both patients underwent suboccipital craniotomy, and SSDHs were found postoperatively. The first case underwent an additional lumbar laminectomy due to cauda equina syndrome; the second case received conservative treatment because there were no obvious neurologic deficits. Meticulous hemostasis and the avoidance of cerebrospinal fluid overdrainage may reduce the risk of SSDH after cranial surgery. Emergent decompression is warranted for SSDH in the presence of progressive neurologic deterioration. © 2013.

84887815637	Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Nonpharmacological Interventions for Fatigue in Children and Adolescents With Cancer	Background: Fatigue is one of the most distressing and prevalent symptoms reported by pediatric oncology patients. With the increase in cancer survival rates, medical teams have focused on methods that control cancer-related fatigue in children during the disease and its treatment in order to increase the quality of life for these patients. Aim: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for fatigue in children and adolescents with cancer. Methods: The search strategy was designed to retrieve studies published between 1960 and 2010 in either English or Chinese. This review included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies. The studies that were selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical-appraisal instruments. Results: The review included six studies, and the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of exercise interventions in reducing general fatigue (effect size = -0.76; 95% CI [-1.35, -0.17]) in children and adolescents with cancer. Conclusions and Implications: The review provides an evidence-based guide to future priorities for clinical practice. Exercise interventions could reduce the levels of general fatigue in children aged 6-18 years. In particular, exercise interventions for fatigue are feasible and safe. © 2013 Sigma Theta Tau International.

49349104835	Caffeic acid phenethyl ester preferentially enhanced radiosensitizing and increased oxidative stress in medulloblastoma cell line	Objectives: Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an active component of propolis, was recently reported to have radiosensitizing effects on medulloblastoma (MB) cells. However, the mechanisms of radiosensitivity involved in medulloblastoma cells are still unclear. The specific aim of this study was to investigate the role of CAPE-induced oxidative stress to influence of radiosensitivity and anti-proliferative effects in medulloblastoma cells. Materials and methods: Medulloblastoma (Daoy) cells were treated with CAPE in different concentrations and assessed for cell viability. The following were also evaluated: migratory ability, reduced glutathione (GSH) level, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activity, and apoptosis in CAPE alone, radiation alone, or radiation combined with CAPE in Daoy cells. Results: The results indicated that CAPE inhibited the growth of Daoy cells. CAPE treatment in Daoy cells could effectively decrease glutathione reductase and significantly increase glutathione peroxidase. Radiation-activated NF-κB was reversed by CAPE pretreatment. Finally, the result of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay showed that CAPE treatment can enhance radiation-induced apoptosis in Daoy cells. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the anti-proliferative and radiosensitizing effects of CAPE on MB cells, which may be achievable through depleting GSH, increased ROS activity, and inhibiting NF-κB activity. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

52749083506	Extended focal radiotherapy of 30 Gy alone for intracranial synchronous bifocal germinoma: A single institute experience	Objects: To evaluate the disease characteristics and treatment outcomes for patients with intracranial synchronous bifocal germinomas treated with extended focal irradiation alone. Methods: Between January 1996 and March 2007, seven patients (three males and four females) with intracranial synchronous bifocal germinomas treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were reviewed. The median age at diagnosis was 14 years (range, 11-28 years). Four patients had surgery before radiotherapy. All patients underwent extended focal irradiation encompassing the whole ventricle system with a total radiation dose of 30 Gy (2 Gy daily). No patient received scheduled systemic chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy. Disease characteristics, treatment outcomes, and the impact of lesion numbers (single vs. bifocal) on survivals were investigated. Results: With a median follow-up time of 49 months (range, 20-66 months), the 2- and 5-year survival rates were both 100%. After treatment, all patients had good performance without recurrence. No severe complication was observed. In comparison, the overall survival (OS, p=0.475) and the disease-free survival (DFS, p=0.537) rates were not significantly different between bifocal- and single-lesion groups. Lesion numbers did not affect both OS and DFS. In addition, the incidence of neuraxial seeding was not higher in patients with bifocal germinomas as compared to those with single lesion. Conclusions: Intracranial germinomas are extremely radiosensitive. Young patients with synchronous bifocal germinomas could be successfully treated with extended focal 30-Gy radiotherapy alone. The therapeutic advantage using this regimen needs to be further evaluated with larger sample size and longer follow-up time. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

Over 10 years, her seizure frequency and severity decreased markedly. Hemispherectomy is the main surgical option for HME although HME appears to correlate with a less favorable seizure outcome. However, the clinical presentation of LGS and possible generalized cortical dysplasia, which is indicative of a secondarily generalized epilepsy, might predict a favorable surgical outcome of corpus callosotomy in patients of HME, as in our case. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

56349128627	Responsiveness of progressive optic pathway tumors to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in children	Background: Though the pathology of optic pathway tumor is mostly pilocytic astrocytoma, the benign tumor behaves like malignant tumor because total resection is not feasible. Adjuvant chemotherapy might be a reasonable strategy for management of these low grade tumors which keep growing. We evaluate the responsiveness of optic pathway tumor to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Methods: Patients with unresectable and progressive optic pathway tumors received conventional chemotherapy including cisplatin, etoposide, and vinblastine were enrolled in this study from 1992 to 2007. Patients treated with radiotherapy previously were excluded. Brain MRI was performed every 3 months to evaluate the objective response to chemotherapy. Results: There are seven girls and nine boys enrolled in this study. The median age at diagnosis was 30 months old (range from 3 months to 11 years old). The median follow-up duration was 81.5 months (range from 24 months to 14.5 years). The pathology showed pilocytic astrocytomas in 11 patients, astrocytoma in one patient, and anaplastic astrocytomas in two patients. The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) is 100%, 12-month PFS is 81.3%, 3-year PFS is 71.4% and 5-year PFS is 55.5% respectively. The toxicity of the cisplatin-based chemotherapy showed mild bone marrow suppression in 13 patients (81.3%), infection in nine patients (56.3%), gastrointestinal discomfort in seven patients (43.8%), renal insufficiency in two patient (12.5%), cerebral salt wasting syndrome with hyponatremia in one patient (6.25%) and high pitch hearing loss in two patients (12.5%). Conclusion: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is an effective regimen for control of progressive optic pathway tumors. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

56349138232	Spinal dysraphism: A cross-sectional and retrospective multidisciplinary clinic-based study	Background: Spinal dysraphism is a common birth defect that causes different kinds of secondary impairments, including joint deformities, reduced mobility, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Due to the diversity in terminology, cultural/ethnic differences, and medical policies, prior study results cannot be generalized to all populations. Therefore, we performed this study to define the characteristics of patients in Taiwan with spinal dysraphism. Methods: Patients diagnosed with a myelomeningocele or lipomyelomeningocele were identified from the database of our spinal dysraphism multidisciplinary clinic. A cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone interview and retrospective chart review. Clinical characteristics, such as neurologic level, orthopedic deformities, assistive device use, and level of ambulation, were collected. Spearman's correlation (r) tests were performed between ambulation or neurologic level and other variables. Results: Seventy-eight subjects were included in the current study. Subjects with myelomeningoceles had more severe neurologic involvement, poorer ambulation outcome, and higher rates of orthopedic deformities, assistive device use, lower hand function, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. The correlation test revealed that the level of ambulation was negatively influenced by a higher neurologic level, a history of shunt placement, and various orthopedic deformities. Neurologic level also had widespread influence on history of shunt placement, orthopedic deformities, assistive device use, the need for additional assistive devices, aggressiveness of assistive devices, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Conclusion: For patients with spinal dysraphism, the neurologic level is the most important prognostic factor for many other clinical characteristics, including ambulation status. © 2008 Elsevier.

60249098740	Brain abscesses in children: Analysis of 20 cases presenting at a medical center	Background and Purpose: Brain abscess is an uncommon intracranial suppuration, especially in children. We reviewed the records of children with brain abscess admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, and analyzed data on presenting symptoms, predisposing factors and outcomes. Methods: Information was obtained retrospectively from medical records of children diagnosed with brain abscess. Demographic data, presenting symptoms, predisposing factors, sites of abscess, infectious organisms, treatment regimen, and prognosis were collected and analyzed. Results: Twenty cases of brain abscess within an 11-year period were included in this study. Fever, seizure and focal neurological deficits were the most common presenting symptoms. Cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD), present in 35% of patients, was the most common predisposing factor. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen. Approximately two-thirds of cases followed up had some form of seizure disorder sequelae; such sequelae were more common in patients with the initial presentation of seizure. Conclusion: CCHD was the most common predisposing factor for brain abscess in children, and a high level of seizure disorder sequelae was noted. Children suffering from brain abscess, whose initial presentation reveals seizure, are at increased risk of further seizure disorder. © 2008 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

70350629170	Finding on brain MRI mimicking focal cortical dysplasia in early Rasmussen's encephalitis: A case report and review	Introduction: Rasmussen's encephalitis (RE) is one of the important causes of refractory seizure. The most impressive clinical manifestation of RE is epilepsia partialis continua (EPC). Others include progressive hemiparesis and neuropsychological deterioration. Currently, the best approach to RE is hemispherectomy. Case histories: We describe a patient whose clinical manifestations were compatible with RE; however, the initial brain MRI was interpreted as focal cortical dysplasia over right parietal region. Discussion: The follow-up brain MRI 1 year later showed diffuse atrophy of the brain with more atrophic change in right hemisphere, and the EPC disappeared after right hemispherectomy. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

0034743103	Interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in cerebrospinal fluid of children with bacterial meningitis	Certain cytokines may contribute to the sequence of events that lead to meningeal inflammation in bacterial meningitis. The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with bacterial meningitis and aseptic meningitis of different etiologies. We determined the concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in the CSF of 171 specimens of 144 patients whose cases were classified as follow: bacterial meningitis (n=23), aseptic meningitis (n=26) and non-meningitis (n=95). The detectable IL-1β concentration (≥20 pg/ml) in the bacterial meningitis, aseptic meningitis and non-meningitis groups were observed with 78.3%, 3.8%, and 8.4%, respectively. Significantly higher serum IL-1β concentrations were detected in those with bacterial meningitis than those with aseptic meningitis (538.93±605.32 pg/ml vs 2.52±11.57 pg/ml; P<0.001) or among non-meningitis subjects (2.90±11.91 pg/ml; P<0.001). The mean TNF-α concentration was 148.74±338.77 pg/ml. There was significantly more TNF-α than aseptic meningitis (6.85±17.93 pg/ml; P<0.001) or non-meningitis (7.67±16.07 pg/ml; P<0.001). With regard to diagnosis, measurement of IL-1β and TNF-α levels showed sensitivities of 78% and 74%, respectively; specificities of 96% and 81%, respectively. It is suggested that the levels of these cytokines, especially IL-1β and TNF-α, are useful markers for distinguishing bacterial meningitis from aseptic meningitis.

0034782854	Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability in children with epilepsy	Object: Children with epilepsy have been found to be at increased risk of death during childhood. Sudden unexpected death (SUDEP) has accounted for at least 12% of deaths of children with epilepsy. The exact mechanisms of SUDEP are unknown; however, theories suggested have, to date, focused on autonomic instability. The purpose of this study was to investigate autonomic function in children with chronic epilepsy by means of power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability. Methods: Thirty patients with epilepsy and 30 control subjects, all between the ages of 4 and 10 years, were enrolled in this study. Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) was performed under standardized conditions after the patients had rested for 15 min. Each patient was tested in a supine position first and then again in a head-up tilted position, with 15 min between the two tests. Results: There was no significant difference between the low-frequency component (LF) and the high-frequency component (HF) of heart rate variability, or the LF/HF ratio, between the study and control groups, whether the test subjects were in the supine or the head-up tilt position. In the control group, however, the subjects showed a significantly greater LF component and a smaller HF component of heart rate variability, and a greater LF/HF ratio in the head-up position than in the supine position. This implies a normal sympathovagal balance. This phenomenon was not observed in the study group. This implies that the modulating effects on autonomic function deriving from the hemisphere were probably disturbed, owing to the brain lesions that each of the study group patients had already sustained. Conclusions: A disturbed balance of activity between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system might result from the loss of hemispheric influence in patients with epilepsy. Nevertheless, further investigation is clearly necessary to ascertain the possible association of this disturbed balance with SUDEP. Further investigation is also needed to establish the exact location of the region in the brain that gives rise to this modulating influence.

0035066985	The outcome of shunted hydrocephalic children	Background. Neurological sequelae and mental retardation may result from different etiological types of hydrocephalus. The aim of our study is to determine the intellectual development and the "shunt history" of these children with regard to the complications and revision rates. Methods. We reviewed the medical history of non-tumoral pediatric hydrocephalic patients who had received first shunt insertions between 1983 and 1997 and had been regularly followed up at the out-patient clinics of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. These patients were categorized into five different etiological groups. Their intelligence test scores and the surgical morbidity encountered over this period were used as the main outcome measures. Results. Out of the seventy-three patients, post-meningitis hydrocephalus patients had the significantly highest shunt revision rate (2.50±0.82, p = 0.01). They also showed retardation in IQ scores, but the different was not significant when compared with other groups. The results of IQ tests were not related to either the age of initial shunt insertion (p = 0.461) or revision rates (p = 0.292). For physical disabilities, post-meningitis hydrocephalic patients showed highest incidence of epilepsy (40%) while hydrocephalic patients associated with myelomeningocele had the highest incidence of motor deficits (56.25%). Conclusions. Childhood hydrocephalic patients had different developmental neuroimpairments with respect to different etiologies. This study provides information about the physical and mental outcome of post-operative hydrocephalic patients which is valuable to assist in counsel of their families.

0034848171	A comparative MR and pathological study on fetal CNS disorders	Object: We used MR after sonography to help us in prenatal counseling in 58 complicated pregnancies from 1998 to 2000. Methods: All fetal MR examinations were undertaken with a 1.5-T magnet using a body-phased-array coil and an ultrafast imaging technique, half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE). Twelve fetuses were found to have major anomalies, and in each of these cases either delivery was induced or the pregnancy was terminated. In 6 of the fetuses, with anomalies of the central nervous system, postmortem examinations were then performed after they failed to survive, and these constitute the patient sample investigated in the current study. The fetal gestational ages in these 6 cases ranged from 24 to 32 weeks. MR imaging demonstrated morphological details of the anomalies. They were: alobar holoprosencephaly in 2, middle interhemispheric fusion in 1, alobar holoprosencephaly with Dandy-Walker malformations in 1, a Dandy-Walker variant in 1 and twin-twin transfusion syndrome with hypoxic-ischemic injury to the brain in 1. Conclusions: Postmortem examinations confirmed the MR diagnoses, and these observations support us in improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of fetal CNS anomalies.

0035144544	Seizure outcomes after anterior callosotomy in patients with posterior-dominant and with anterior-dominant epileptiform discharges	Objects: We wished to find whether there was any difference in the postoperative seizure outcome between patients with bisynchronous anterior-dominant and those with posterior-dominant EDs after anterior callosotomy. Methods: Seizure outcomes after anterior callosotomy in 7 patients with bisynchronous posterior-dominant epileptiform discharges and in 54 patients with anterior-dominant seizures were compared. All 61 cases had been followed up for more than 2 years after operation. One patient (14.3%) had become seizure free. Two patients (28.6%) had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, but 4 patients (57.2%) showed no improvement at all. The percentage of cases with significant improvement (more than 50% reduction of seizure frequency) was 43% (3 in 7), which is lower than in the patients with bisynchronous anterior-dominant EDs (64.8%). Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that anterior partial callosotomy could still be helpful in cases with bisynchronous posterior-dominant epileptiform discharges but the prognosis may be less optimistic than for those with anteriorly located discharges.

0035187921	A clinicopathologic study of 81 patients with ependymomas and proposal of diagnostic criteria for anaplastic ependymoma	Optimal histologic criteria for the classification of and grading of ependymomas, including their anaplastic forms, remain elusive. This is especially true because of the poor correlation of these criteria with clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to identify the histopathologic parameters that could distinguish different prognostic groups of patients with ependymomas. Eighty-one patients with ependymal tumors, including those originally diagnosed ependymomas, anaplastic ependymomas and myxopapillary ependymomas, were enrolled in this study. Thirteen histologic parameters, including hypercellularity, nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, necrosis, clear cell, thrombi, dystrophic calcification, psammoma bodies, bone, cartilage, Rosenthal fibers and MIB-1 labeling index (LI), were evaluated in each patient and correlated with clinical outcome. We assigned one score for each histopathologic parameter evaluated and used a stepwise selection method with entry model based on the significance of the log-rank statistic to formulate a scoring model.

71849089624	Linear Scleroderma "En Coup De Sabre": Initial Presentation as Intractable Partial Seizures in a Child	Linear scleroderma is a form of localized scleroderma characterized by sclerotic lesions distributed in a linear, band-like pattern. The "en coup de sabre" subtype of linear scleroderma is more often associated with systemic morbidity, including ocular, oral, and neurological abnormalities. Here, we report one patient with typical linear scleroderma "en coup de sabre" (LSCS). Initially, he presented with refractory partial seizures before the characteristic skins lesion on his head developed. This was a rare case with obvious brain parenchyma involvement. We did not prescribe medication but performed serial brain magnetic resonance imaging follow-up for the intraparenchymal lesion. The atrophic changes of the skin, face and brain remained the same, and his seizures had not worsened at the most recent follow-up. Parry-Romberg syndrome, a very similar condition, should be differentiated from LSCS. © 2009 Taiwan Pediatric Association.

72649086446	Electrocorticogram changes during corpus callosotomy for uncontrolled symptomatic generalized epilepsy	We report a 19-year-old man who presented to our facility with medically intractable, symptomatic generalized epilepsy manifesting as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs). Before he underwent an anterior callosotomy (6 cm), these seizures, which he had experienced for 11 years, seemed to have a left-sided focal origin. Intraoperatively, no epileptiform discharges were found on the electrocorticogram (ECoG) performed prior to sectioning, but more than 10 left-sided seizures were recorded after sectioning. In the 10 years since surgery, the patient's seizures have remained generalized; however, the frequency and severity of the seizures have decreased. These findings indicate that the presence of electrocorticographic seizures, as measured by ECoG immediately following callosotomy, may not predict a poor surgical outcome, even though such a finding might be indicative of epileptogenicity in general. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77949269537	Differential expression profiling between atypical teratoid/rhabdoid and medulloblastoma tumor in vitro and in vivo using microarray analysis	Objectives: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) and medulloblastoma (MB) are the most malignant primary brain tumors in early childhood. AT/RT is frequently misdiagnosed as primitive neuroectodermal tumor/medulloblastoma. The biological features and clinical outcomes of AT/RT and MB are extremely different. In this study, we used microarray as a platform to distinguish these two tumors with the definitive diagnostic marker as well as the profiling of expression genes. Methods: In order to clarify the pathogenesis and find the biological markers for AT/RT, we established a derivative AT/RT primary cell culture. The differential profiling between AT/RT and MB were analyzed by using microarray method. Results: With the use of the microarray method, we demonstrated that 15 genes were significantly changed (at least 5-fold in upregulation and 1/5-fold in downregulation) between AT/RT and MB in tissues and cell lines. The quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses further confirmed that mRNA expression levels of SERPINI1 and osteopontin were highly expressed in AT/RT cells and tissues than those in MB. Importantly, our microarray result suggested that AT/RT presents the stemness-like pattern and expression profiling of embryonic stem cells as well as high mRNA expressions of Oct-4, Nanog, Sox-2, and c-Myc. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the differential gene expression profiling between AT/RT and MB. Based on the microarray findings, AT/RTs present embryonic stem-like gene recapitulation and further provide novel insights into their underlying biology. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77949920316	Pediatric primary central nervous system germ cell tumors of different prognosis groups show characteristic miRNome traits and chromosome copy number variations	Background: Intracranial pediatric germ cell tumors (GCTs) are rare and heterogeneous neoplasms and vary in histological differentiation, prognosis and clinical behavior. Germinoma and mature teratoma are GCTs that have a good prognosis, while other types of GCTs, termed nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors (NGMGCTs), are tumors with an intermediate or poor prognosis. The second group of tumors requires more extensive drug and irradiation treatment regimens. The mechanisms underlying the differences in incidence and prognosis of the various GCT subgroups are unclear.Results: We identified a distinct mRNA profile correlating with GCT histological differentiation and prognosis, and also present in this study the first miRNA profile of pediatric primary intracranial GCTs. Most of the differentially expressed miRNAs were downregulated in germinomas, but miR-142-5p and miR-146a were upregulated. Genes responsible for self-renewal (such as POU5F1 (OCT4), NANOG and KLF4) and the immune response were abundant in germinomas, while genes associated with neuron differentiation, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (including SNAI2 (SLUG) and TWIST2) were abundant in NGMGCTs. Clear transcriptome segregation based on patient survival was observed, with malignant NGMGCTs being closest to embryonic stem cells. Chromosome copy number variations (CNVs) at cytobands 4q13.3-4q28.3 and 9p11.2-9q13 correlated with GCT malignancy and clinical risk. Six genes (BANK1, CXCL9, CXCL11, DDIT4L, ELOVL6 and HERC5) within 4q13.3-4q28.3 were more abundant in germinomas.Conclusions: Our results integrate molecular profiles with clinical observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms causing GCT malignancy. The genes, pathways and microRNAs identified have the potential to be novel therapeutic targets. © 2010 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77953587766	Optimal Treatment for Intracranial Germinoma: Can We Lower Radiation Dose Without Chemotherapy?	Purpose: To review the effectiveness of reduced-dose and restricted-volume radiation-only therapy in the treatment of intracranial germinoma and to assess the feasibility of reducing or eliminating the use of chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: Between January 1996 and March 2007, a retrospective analysis was performed that included 38 patients who received either reduced radiation alone (30 Gy for 26 patients) or reduced radiation with chemotherapy (n = 12 patients). All 38 patients received extended focal (including whole-ventricle) irradiation and were followed up until February 2008. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were calculated. Variables associated with survival were evaluated by univariate Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Median follow-up was 62.4 months (range, 10.1-142.5 months). The total 5-year OS rate was 93.7%. The 5-year OS and RFS rates for patients receiving radiation only were 100% and 96.2%, respectively. The rates for those receiving radiation plus chemotherapy were 83.3 % and 91.7%, respectively (not statistically significant). No predictive factor was significantly associated with the OS or RFS rate. Chemotherapy had no significant effect on survival but was associated with a higher incidence of treatment-related toxicity. Conclusions: A further decrease in the radiation dose to 30 Gy with whole-ventricle irradiation is sufficient to treat selected patients with intracranial germinoma. Wide-field irradiation or chemotherapy should be avoided as these methods are unnecessary. Thus, reduction of the radiation dose to 30 Gy may be feasible, even without chemotherapy. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77955259196	Scoliosis and syringomyelia with chiari malformation after lumbar shunting	Unsteady gait was noted in a 2-year-old boy with a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt that had been inserted 1 year earlier for increased head circumference caused by communicating hydrocephalus. Scoliosis was also noted during postoperative follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed new hindbrain tonsillar herniation and an extensive syrinx from C3 to L1. The malfunctioning LP shunt was removed and posterior fossa decompression with ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion was performed. The unsteady gait recovered completely and scoliosis improved. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated resolution of the syrinx and tonsillar herniation. Acquired Chiari I malformation after LP shunt is well documented; usually, patients have no symptoms. This is the first report to have all the cause and effect mechanisms among syringomyelia, scoliosis and Chiari I malformation in 1 patient. We review the literature and discuss the possible mechanisms. © 2010 Elsevier.

77955914266	Primary yolk sac tumor of bilateral basal ganglia	A primary intracranial yolk sac tumor (YST) is a type of germ cell tumor (GCT) and usually involves the pineal or suprasellar regions, as do other GCTs. Primary YST in the basal ganglia is not common, and bilateral basal ganglia involvement is even rarer. Early diagnosis is often difficult because of minimal or subtle findings without space-occupying lesions shown on neuroimaging during the early course of the disease. We report a case of primary intracranial YST encountered in the basal ganglia bilaterally and describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic problem, imaging characteristics, histopathologic features, and prognosis of the tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the third reported case of primary YST confined to the basal ganglia in the literature. © 2010 Elsevier.

77956181833	Role of temozolomide in the treatment of newly diagnosed diffuse brainstem glioma in children: Experience at a single institution	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of TMZ on diffuse brainstem glioma, either concomitant with radiotherapy or as an adjuvant treatment after radiotherapy in children. Methods and materials: Eighteen children (median age at diagnosis was 8.3 years) meet the following criteria: (1) newly diagnosed diffuse brainstem glioma; (2) aged less than 18 years old, which were treated with TMZ at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 2004 to December 2008. They were divided into two groups according to treatment modalities: a radiotherapy alone followed by adjuvant TMZ (RT+TMZ) group received conventional radiation after initial diagnosis, and a concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant TMZ (CCRT+TMZ) group received concurrent chemotherapy during radiation with TMZ (75 mg/M2/day). After completion of the radiotherapy, TMZ (150 mg/M2) was administered once per day for five consecutive days for all enrolled patients in each 28-day cycle. We evaluated the progression-free survival in both groups of patients. Results: There were 10 patients in RT+TMZ group and eight in CCRT+TMZ group. All patients experienced progression of disease. Twelve patients (75%) died, and all deaths were attributed to the disease progression. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.4 months for the RT+TMZ group and 6.4 months for the CCRT+TMZ group. The 6-month and 1-year PFS in the RT+TMZ group were 70% (SD 14%) and 30% (SD 14%), respectively, and in the CCRT+TMZ group, they were 50% (SD 17%) and 0%, respectively. The log-rank test in PFS between the two groups was not statistically significant. Conclusions: In this study, CCRT with TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ did not result in a better outcome when compared with RT alone followed by adjuvant TMZ. In addition, TMZ either as adjuvant therapy or as CCRT did not improve the prognosis of the patients with newly diagnosed diffuse brainstem glioma. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77956190485	Medulloblastoma-derived tumor stem-like cells acquired resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and radiosensitivity	Objects Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most malignant primary brain tumor in early childhood that contains cellular and functional heterogeneity. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the tumor stem cells (TSC) may explain the radiochemoresistance of brain tumors, including MB. The aim of the present study is to investigate the possible role of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in viability and tumorigenicity of MB cells and MB-derived TSC. Methods MB-associated TSC were isolated and cultured by serum-free medium with bFGF and EGF. The parental MB cells and MB-TSC cells were treated with TRAIL in different concentrations and assessed for cell viability, invasion ability, colony forming ability, and radiotherapy effect. Results We enrich a subpopulation of MB-TSC cells using tumor spheroid formation approach. MB-TSC display enhanced self-renewal and highly expressed -stemness- genes (CD133, Sox-2, Bmi1, Nestin). Additionally,MB-TSC showed significant resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and radiosensitivity compared to the parentalMB cells due antiapoptotic gene (c-FLIP, Caspase 8, Bcl-2, and Bax) upregulation. Conclusions Our data suggest that MB-TSC are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and tumorigenic properties. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which to operate the physiological characteristics in MB-TSC cells offers attractive approach for MB treatment. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

79955563020	Gamma knife radiosurgery for central neurocytoma: Retrospective analysis of fourteen cases with a median follow-up period of sixty-five months	Object: Central neurocytoma (CN) is considered to be a benign neuronal tumor with possible atypical behavior. Microsurgery, radiation therapy (RT) and radiosurgery all have been used in treating this rare disease during the past decade. In this study, the authors present the experience with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on 14 patients with CN during a median follow-up period of 65 months and document the safety and efficacy of GKRS in the treatment of CN. Methods: Between November 1997 and December 2009, 14 patients pathologically diagnosed with CN were treated with GKRS. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 6-month intervals. Tumor volume and adverse radiation effects (ARE) were documented to evaluate tumor response to GKRS. The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and neurological status were used to assess clinical outcome. The mean radiation dose prescribed to the tumor margin was 12.1 Gy (ranging from 11 to 13 Gy). The mean tumor volume was 19.6 ml (ranging from 3.5 to 48.9 ml). The mean follow-up period was 70 months (ranging from 30 to 140 months), and the median follow-up period was 65 months. Results: Tumor shrinkage was found in all patients at the final MRI follow-up. The mean volume reduction was 69% (ranging from 47 to 87%). No tumor progression, ARE or radiation-related toxicity developed in any of the cases. The KPS scores of all patients were the same or had increased, and the neurological functions were all stable without deterioration at the final follow-up. Conclusion: In our observations, GKRS was found to be an effective and safe alternative as adjuvant therapy for pathology-confirmed CN. The tumor volume and functional outcome can be controlled with a favorable result in long-term observation. Compared with RT and microsurgery, GKRS plays an important role in the treatment of CN as a minimally invasive technique with low morbidity. Regular long-term MRI follow-up should be mandatory to document the tumor response and possible recurrence. Multicenter consortia should be considered for further investigation and evaluation of GKRS for such a rare tumor. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG.

0035707667	Electromyographic evaluation in children with spina bifida	Background. It is controversial to predict ambulation potential using neurological level or specific pattern of muscle strength in patients with spina bifida. We attempted to analyze the relationship between the mobility outcome and its influencing factors utilizing electromyography to study motor unit activity in lower limbs. A subsidiary aim was to evaluate the external anal sphincter with electromyography and to determine the relevant factors of bowel and bladder functions. Methods. Among 156 patients with spina bifida who had received electromyographic examination and were followed at the out-patient clinic between 1998 and 2000, functional assessment with Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) was applied in 47 randomly selected patients. Other assessments included clinical neurological examination, bowel and bladder function survey, and ambulation evaluation. We correlated the parameters of electromyography with the ambulatory ability and PEDI scores. The innervation of external sphincter was compared between groups with or without neurogenic bowel or bladder dysfunction. Results. The innervations of hip adductor and quadriceps were found to correlate with walking ability (p < 0.01); above muscles as well as anterior tibialis, and gastrocnemius were related to PEDI scores (p <0.01). The neurological level still manifested correlation with walking ability (p < 0.05) and PEDI scores (p <0.01). Both denervation potentials and recruitment pattern were important parameters for ambulation and mobility prediction. Significant difference was obtained in denervation patentials of sphincter within bowel groups (p = 0.036) and bladder groups (p=0.016). Conclusions. Both traditional neurological level and specific muscle innervation exert crucial influence on walking and mobility functions. Electromyographic assessment demonstrates its contribution in prediction of functional outcome in spina bifida.

79957856748	Pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound enhances the relative permeability of the bloodtumor barrier in a glioma-bearing rat model	The use of pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) has been shown to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) noninvasively and reversibly in the targeted regions. This study evaluated the relative permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) after sonication by pulsed HIFU. Entry into the brain of chemotherapeutic agents is impeded by the BBB even though the permeability of this barrier may be partially reduced in the presence of a brain tumor. F98 glioma-bearing rats were injected intravenously with Evans blue (EB) with or without BTB disruption induced by pulsed HIFU. Sonication was applied at an ultrasound frequency of 1 MHz with a 5% duty cycle, and a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. The accumulation of EB in brain tumor and the tumor-to-contralateral brain ratio of EB were highest after pulsed HIFU exposure. Sonication followed by EB injection showed a tumor-to-contralateral brain ratio in the target tumors which was about 2 times that of the control tumors. This research demonstrates that pulsed HIFU enhances the relative permeability of the BTB in glioma- bearing rats. The results of this pilot study support the idea that further evaluation of other treatment strategies, such as HIFU exposure in addition to combined chemotherapy or repeated pulsed HIFU exposure to increase delivery of drugs into brain tumors, might be useful. © 2011 IEEE.

79959710294	Neuroendoscopy in the management of pineal tumors	Introduction: Endoscopy has been applied for the management of pineal tumors and the associated obstructive hydrocephalus. The techniques include endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), endoscopic biopsy, and endoscopicassisted open surgery of tumor in selected cases. The purpose of this study is to report our experience and techniques of endoscopic surgeries for pineal tumors in children. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 36 ETVs, 25 endoscopic transventricular biopsies (ETB), 2 endoscopic transnasal transsphenoid biopsies, and 5 endoscopic-assisted open resections of pineal tumors. Results: One patient died of delay tumor hemorrhage after ETV and ETB were excluded. With a mean follow-up period of 5.4 years, ETV failure occurred in 7 of 35 patients with long-term success rate of 80.0%. Histological diagnosis was established in 21 of 25 (84.0%) patients through ETBs. Tissue diagnosis was obtained in two selected patients with bifocal germ cell tumors by endsocopic transnasal transsphenoid approach to the intrasellar lesion. Direct radical resections were achieved in four of five selected patients of pineal tumors with hydrocephalus by endoscopic-assisted open surgery. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

80054703158	Hydrocephalus with brain tumors in children	Background: Tumor-associated hydrocephalus is common in primary pediatric brain tumors. The managements involve radical tumor resection, temporary external ventricular drainage, and different definite shunting procedures. The purpose of this study is to sum up our experience of definite shunting procedures for tumoral hydrocephalus in children and correlate with reported literatures. Methods: This is a retrospective review of a series of 1,250 cases of primary pediatric brain tumors in patients <18 years of age collected in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 1971 to 2008. Cases with questionable records about hydrocephalus were excluded. Results: A total of 56.7% of cases presented hydrocephalus, including hydrocephalus that occurred at tumor diagnosis (51.5%), and hydrocephalus developed after tumor diagnosis (5.1%). At tumor diagnosis, the hydrocephalus was mainly obstructive type (98%) and rarely communicating type (1.9%). Definite shunting procedures in this series comprised of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in 54.4%, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in 10.9%, subduroperitoneal (SP) shunt in 4.8%, septostomy in 0.7%, lumboperitoneal shunt in 0.6%, and ventriculoatrial shunt in 0.1% of patients with hydrocephalus. There was a tendency of decreasing requirement and changing timing for VP shunt implantation. There was a gradual increase in usage of ETV for hydrocephalus in specific types and locations of tumors. Conclusion: In the past two decades, we tended to use the VP shunt more cautiously for obstructive tumoral hydrocephalus. We try to perform initial radical resection of tumors as indicated and the more frequent use of ETV in selective cases that help to decrease the requirement of VP shunt implantation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80255132751	Brain, the last fortress of sarcoma: Similar dismal outcome but discrepancy of timing of brain metastasis in bone and soft tissue sarcoma	Background and Objective Brain metastasis is a rare but dismal event in sarcomas. However, the pattern of occurrence and the prognostic factors associated with post-brain metastasis survival (PBMS) are not yet well-characterized. Methods Sarcoma patients treated at one institute within 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed and those with brain metastasis were identified. The incidence of brain metastasis was demonstrated by case per person-years and cumulative incidence curves. Univariate factors associated with PBMS were analyzed. Results Among 611 sarcoma patients, 20 (3.3%) developed brain metastasis. Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and osteosarcoma were the most common subtypes. Overall, the cumulative incidence was 3.9% at 5 years and 8.4% at 10 years. However, the incidence in STS patients continued to rise up to 10 years after primary diagnosis, whereas it reached a plateau in bone sarcoma patients at 3 years. Median PBMS was 1.67 months. Univariate factors associated with better PBMS included ASPS histology, initial surgical treatment, and brain irradiation for non-surgically treated patients. Conclusion Our study revealed a discrepancy in the timing of occurrence of brain metastasis between STS and bone sarcoma. However, patients with brain metastasis had a poor prognosis, implicating the brain as the last fortress of sarcoma. J. Surg. Oncol. 2011; 104:765-770. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84355162119	Intact INI1 gene region with paradoxical loss of protein expression in AT/RT: Implications for a possible novel mechanism associated with absence of INI1 protein immunoreactivity	Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant central nervous system tumor often misdiagnosed as some other type of pediatric embryonal tumor, such as medulloblastoma (MB). Distinguishing AT/RT from primitive neuroectodermal tumor/MB is of clinical significance, as the reported survival rate of patients with AT/RT is much lower than that of patients with average-risk primitive neuroectodermal tumor/MB. The diagnosis of AT/RT currently relies primarily on the morphologic assessment and immunostaining of a few known markers, such as the lack of INI1 protein expression. Immunohistochemical staining of INI1 is considered very sensitive and is highly specific for the detection of INI1 genetic defects. Genetic studies have shown that deletion or mutation of the INI1 gene, which is located on 22q11.2, occurs in AT/RT lesions. During our gene expression microarray analysis, we unexpectedly found a subgroup of AT/RT patients still expressing INI1 mRNA, even though INI1 proteins were negative by immunohistochemistry in those cases. Direct DNA sequencing showed no INI1 sequence alternation in 3 of 4 AT/RTs. Point mutation was found in only 1 allele of the fourth case, which would result in a frameshift mutation and generate a new INI1 protein with an extra 100-aa tail. Global array comparative genomic hybridization analysis confirmed no aberration around the INI1 gene at 22q11.2. It also extended our knowledge on the chromosomal aberration situations in our series. This study reveals that a novel yet unidentified posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism(s) for INI1 protein synthesis exists in AT/RT tumor cells. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

84859869368	Change in treatment strategy for intracranial germinoma: Long-term follow-up experience at a single institute	BACKGROUND: Previous intracranial germinoma (IG) studies have investigated the effect of different radiotherapy (RT) volumes and the necessity for adjunctive chemotherapy, but there is currently no consensus on the best treatment for this tumor. METHODS: From January 1989 to December 2009, 80 IG patients (≤20 years old) were treated with various RT regimens. Of them, 14 patients had craniospinal irradiation (CSI) + primary boost (PB); 8 patients had whole-brain irradiation (WBI) + PB; 31 patients had whole ventricular irradiation (WVI) + PB; and 27 patients had focal RT only. Twenty-nine patients (36.2%) also received systemic chemotherapy (CHT). Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and variables affecting survival were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Eleven patients (13.8%) developed local recurrence or dissemination after treatment, and 10 of these patients were in the focal RT group. The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) for the CSI, WBI, WVI, and focal RT patients were 100%, 85.7%, 100%, and 84.6%, respectively (P =.001). The 5-year overall survival (OS) for CSI, WBI, WVI, and focal RT patients was 100%, 83.3%, 100%, and 87.9%, respectively (P =.125). Focal irradiation (P =.02) and initial use of CHT (P =.021) were negatively associated with RFS. CONCLUSIONS: Focal RT plus CHT were associated with inferior control of IG and a higher incidence of CHT-related toxicities. Adjustment of the radiation volume to the whole ventricular system without CHT is sufficient for treatment of nondisseminated IGs, even with lower primary RT doses (<36 Gy). Cancer 2011. © 2011 American Cancer Society. Adjustment of radiation volume to whole ventricular irradiation with lower radiation dose provides long-term control and reduced toxicity for patients with intracranial germinoma. Large-field irradiation with chemotherapy is only suitable for patients with initial dissemination or after multisite relapse. © 2011 American Cancer Society.

84861985598	Focused ultrasound and interleukin-4 receptor-targeted liposomal doxorubicin for enhanced targeted drug delivery and antitumor effect in glioblastoma multiforme	The clinical application of chemotherapy to brain tumors has been severely limited because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) often prevents therapeutic levels from being achieved. Here we show that pulsed HIFU and human atherosclerotic plaque-specific peptide-1 (AP-1)-conjugated liposomes containing doxorubicin (AP-1 Lipo-Dox) act synergistically in an experimental brain tumor model. We developed an intracranial brain-tumor model in NOD-scid mice using human brain glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 8401 cells. Pulsed HIFU was used to transcranially disrupt the BBB in these mouse brains by delivering ultrasound waves in the presence of microbubbles. Prior to each sonication, AP-1 Lipo-Dox or unconjugated Lipo-Dox was administered intravenously, and the concentration in the brains was quantified by fluorometer. Compared to control animals treated with injections of AP-1 Lipo-Dox or unconjugated Lipo-Dox, animals receiving the drug followed by pulsed HIFU exhibited enhanced accumulation of the drug in tumor cells. Drug injection with sonication increased the tumor-to-normal brain doxorubicin ratio of the target tumors by about twofold compared with the control tumors. Moreover, the tumor-to-normal brain ratio was highest after the injection of AP-1 Lipo-Dox with sonication. Combining sonication with AP-1 Lipo-Dox also significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with chemotherapy alone. There was a modest but significant increase in the median survival time in mice treated with AP-1 Lipo-Dox followed by pulsed HIFU, compared to those treated with AP-1 Lipo-Dox without sonication. The use of AP-1-conjugated liposomes carrying cytotoxic agents followed by pulsed HIFU represents a feasible approach for enhanced targeted drug delivery in brain tumor therapies.

84862830247	Treatment strategies for initially disseminated intracranial germinomas: Experiences at a single institute	Purpose: Initially disseminated intracranial germinomas (IDIGs) can be observed in pre-adult and adolescent brain tumor patients. However, the disease prognosis is undetermined, and the method of optimal treatment remains controversial. Methods: From January 1990 to January 2011, data on 91 intracranial germinoma patients (≤20 years old) were gathered from the Pediatric Brain Tumor database at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. A total of seven patients with a median age of 17.0 years had IDIGs (lesion sites >2), including IDIGs in the ventricular system or the spinal column. Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) plus a primary or metastatic boost was the mainstay strategy for radiotherapy. Six out of a total of seven patients (85.7%) also received systemic chemotherapy (CHT) after radiotherapy. Survivals rates between IDIGs and patients without dissemination were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The median follow-up time for all seven patients was 67.5 months (range, 10.3-142.3 months). None of the IDIG patients experienced a recurrence or mortality after the completion of treatment. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) between IDIG and non-dissemination patients were 100%, 100%, 93.0% and 78.6%, respectively (p=0.339). The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) between IDIGs and non-dissemination cases were 100%, 100%, 93.7% and 89.4%, respectively (p=0.473). Conclusions: IDIG patients did not show reduced survival compared to non-dissemination patients if optimal radiotherapy and chemotherapy were used together. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84862305857	Treating glioblastoma multiforme with selective high-dose liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy induced by repeated focused ultrasound	Background: High-dose tissue-specific delivery of therapeutic agents would be a valuable clinical strategy. We have previously shown that repeated transcranial focused ultrasound is able to increase the delivery of Evans blue significantly into brain tissue. The present study shows that repeated pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can be used to deliver high-dose atherosclerotic plaque-specific peptide-1 (AP-1)-conjugated liposomes selectively to brain tumors. Methods: Firefly luciferase (Fluc)-labeled human GBM8401 glioma cells were implanted into NOD-scid mice. AP-1-conjugated liposomal doxorubicin or liposomal doxorubicin alone was administered followed by pulsed HIFU and the doxorubicin concentration in the treated brains quantified by fluorometer. Growth of the labeled glioma cells was monitored through noninvasive bioluminescence imaging and finally the brain tissue was histologically examined after sacrifice. Results: Compared with the control group, the animals treated with 5 mg/kg injections of AP-1 liposomal doxorubicin or untargeted liposomal doxorubicin followed by repeated pulsed HIFU not only showed significantly enhanced accumulation of drug at the sonicated tumor site but also a significantly elevated tumor-to-normal brain drug ratio (P < 0.001). Combining repeated pulsed HIFU with AP-1 liposomal doxorubicin or untargeted liposomal doxorubicin has similar antitumor effects. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that targeted or untargeted liposomal doxorubicin, followed by repeated pulsed HIFU, is a promising high-dose chemotherapy method that allows the desired brain tumor region to be targeted specifically. 2012 Cárdenas et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84862338450	Evaluation of the increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier during tumor progression after pulsed focused ultrasound	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the permeability of the blood-brain barrier after sonication by pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound and to determine if such an approach increases the tumor:ipsilateral brain permeability ratio. Materials and methods: F98 glioma-bearing Fischer 344 rats were injected intravenously with Evans blue with or without blood-tumor barrier disruption induced by transcranial pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound. Sonication was applied at a frequency of 1 MHz with a 5% duty cycle and a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. The permeability of the blood-brain barrier was assessed by the extravasation of Evans blue. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images were used to monitor the gadolinium deposition path associated with transcranial pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound, and the influencing size and location was also investigated. In addition, whole brain histological analysis was performed. The results were compared by two-tailed unpaired t-test. Results: The accumulation of Evans blue in brains and the tumor:ipsilateral brain permeability ratio of Evans blue were significantly increased after pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound exposure. Evans blue injection followed by sonication showed an increase in the tumor:ipsilateral brain ratio of the target tumors (9.14:1) of about 2.23-fold compared with the control tumors (x4.09) on day 6 after tumor implantation. Magnetic resonance images showed that pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound locally enhances the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier in the glioma-bearing rats. Conclusion: This method could allow enhanced synergistic effects with respect to other brain tumor treatment regimens. © 2012 Yang et al.

84865980504	Body image of children and adolescents with cancer: A metasynthesis on qualitative research findings	Children and adolescents with cancer are confronted with many challenges. This review considered studies that used qualitative methods to examine the body image experience of children and adolescents with cancer. A systematic literature search of English and Chinese databases was undertaken, covering the period between 1960 and October 2010. Qualitative research findings were extracted and pooled using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. Eight papers met the inclusion criteria. The derived four metasyntheses included being distanced from the body, loss of self-identity, self-protective strategies and support, and getting rid of the shackles of the body. In conclusion, children and adolescents with cancer also experience various problems associated with changes in their body image. Repeated courses of treatment lead to loss of a normal, orderly life, and might even result in changes in interpersonal interactions. In response to body image change, individuals with cancer develop self-protective, coping strategies. Children and adolescents who experience life-threatening cancer come to face body image change positively, and might hold a confident attitude toward their future. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

0037355546	Early diagnosis of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections and malfunctions in children with hydrocephalus	This retrospective study assessed the parameters of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection and malfunction found in 129 children with hydrocephalus who had undergone a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 1997 to June 2001. The clinical characteristics and differences among these patients were reviewed to determine the potential predictors of shunt infection and malfunction. Fever (60%, 6/ 10) and seizure (40%, 4/10) occurred significantly more often in the infection group than in the malfunction and control groups (p<0.05). A higher blood C-reactive protein level was noted in the infection group than in the malfunction and control groups (p<0.05). Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients showed significantly higher white blood cell count and neutrophil count, higher protein concentration, and lower glucose levels compared with the other 2 groups (p<0.05). However, the number of patients with cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia was significantly higher in the malfunction group (p<0.05). The diagnostic usefulness of laboratory parameters in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection is as follow: cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count over 100/mm

0037593486	Skew ocular deviation: A catastrophic sign on MRI of fetal glioblastoma	Case Report: We report the prenatal observation of fetal ocular skew deviation in a case of a glioblastoma found prenatally at 33 weeks' gestation by MRI. The fetal MRI, obtained by half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) pulse sequences, showed a tumor (80 mm in maximum diameter) in the right deep cerebral hemisphere with extension to the mid-cranial fossa and tentorial hiatus in addition to severe hydrocephalus. On coronal MR images a vertical dysconjugated gaze was recognized. One week after the MRI, frequent delayed deceleration prompted an emergency cesarean section. The baby was born with left hemiparesis and central neurogenic hyperventilation, which evolved into decerebrate rigidity and apneustic breathing within 2 h. Postmortem examination revealed a glioblastoma in the right deep hemisphere, a tumor with brain stem involvement, and transtentorial herniation. Conclusions: We suggest, therefore, that recognition of ocular skew deviation on fetal MR images would indicate brain stem involvement and poor postnatal prognosis. Early recognition of the catastrophic sign would lead to proper management.

84866739579	Salvage treatment for recurrent intracranial germinoma after reduced-volume radiotherapy: A single-institution experience and review of the literature	Purpose: Intracranial germinomas (IGs) are highly curable with radiotherapy (RT). However, recurrence still occurs, especially when limited-field RT is applied, and the optimal salvage therapy remains controversial. Methods and Materials: Between January 1989 and December 2010, 14 patients with clinically or pathologically diagnosed recurrent IGs after RT were reviewed at our institution. Of these, 11 received focal-field RT, and the other 3 received whole-brain irradiation, whole-ventricle irradiation, and Gamma Knife radiosurgery as the respective first course of RT. In addition, we identified from the literature 88 patients with recurrent IGs after reduced-volume RT, in whom the details of salvage therapy were recorded. Results: The median time to recurrence was 30.3 months (range, 3.8-134.9 months). One patient did not receive further treatment and was lost during follow-up. Of the patients, 7 underwent salvage with craniospinal irradiation (CSI) plus chemotherapy (CT), 4 with CSI alone, 1 with whole-brain irradiation plus CT, and 1 with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. The median follow-up time was 105.1 months (range, 24.2-180.9 months). Three patients died without evidence of disease progression: two from second malignancies and one from unknown cause. The others remained disease free. The 3-year survival rate after recurrence was 83.3%. A total of 102 patients from our study and the literature review were analyzed to determine the factors affecting prognosis and outcomes. After recurrence, the 5-year survival rates were 71% and 92.9% for all patients and for those receiving salvage CSI, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that initial RT volume, initial RT dose, initial CT, and salvage RT type were significant prognostic predictors of survival. On multivariable analysis, salvage CSI was the most significant factor (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Protracted follow-up is recommended because late recurrence is not uncommon. CSI with or without CT is an effective salvage treatment for recurrence after reduced-volume RT. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84868586326	Boron neutron capture therapy for glioblastoma multiforme: Enhanced drug delivery and antitumor effect following blood-brain barrier disruption induced by focused ultrasound	Aim: This study investigated whether the efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy was enhanced by means of intravenous administration of boronophenylalanine (BPA) with blood-brain barrier disruption induced by focused ultrasound (FUS). Materials & methods: BPA was administered, followed by pulsed FUS, and the boron concentration in the treated brains was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Growth of the firefly luciferase-labeled glioma cells was monitored through noninvasive biophotonic imaging. Finally, the brain tissue was histologically examined after sacrifice. Results: Compared with the nonsonicated tumor group, animals treated with an injection of 500 mg/kg of BPA followed by FUS exhibited not only significantly increased accumulation of the drug at the sonicated tumor site, but also a significantly elevated tumor-to-normal brain drug ratio (p < 0.05). Discussion: The data demonstrated that FUS significantly enhances the tumor-to-normal brain drug ratio in the sonicated tumor and subsequently the efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.

84876546237	YM500: A small RNA sequencing (smRNA-seq) database for microRNA research	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs ∼22 nt in length that are involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Advances in high-throughput small RNA sequencing (smRNA-seq), one of the next-generation sequencing applications, have reshaped the miRNA research landscape. In this study, we established an integrative database, the YM500 (http://ngs.ym. edu.tw/ym500/), containing analysis pipelines and analysis results for 609 human and mice smRNA-seq results, including public data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and some private sources. YM500 collects analysis results for miRNA quantification, for isomiR identification (incl. RNA editing), for arm switching discovery, and, more importantly, for novel miRNA predictions. Wetlab validation on >100 miRNAs confirmed high correlation between miRNA profiling and RT-qPCR results (R = 0.84). This database allows researchers to search these four different types of analysis results via our interactive web interface. YM500 allows researchers to define the criteria of isomiRs, and also integrates the information of dbSNP to help researchers distinguish isomiRs from SNPs. A user-friendly interface is provided to integrate miRNA-related information and existing evidence from hundreds of sequencing datasets. The identified novel miRNAs and isomiRs hold the potential for both basic research and biotech applications. © The Author(s) 2012.

84879783607	Unusual giant intraspinal teratoma in an infant	There are few cases of giant pediatric intraspinal teratoma. We report a case of a 4-month-old female baby with giant intraspinal teratoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed a large intradural tumor from the C7 to S2 level, with solid, cystic, and fatty components. Partial surgical removal of the tumor showed pathology of a mature cystic teratoma. The imaging diagnosis of intraspinal teratoma included the location, solid and cystic component, and fatty content. The MR techniques adopted included gradient echo sequences as used to detect teeth or calcification. The difficulties in surgical resection of this case are also presented. © 2013.

84879210959	Efficacy of therapeutic play for pediatric brain tumor patients during external beam radiotherapy	Objective: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is frequently used to improve disease control for pediatric brain tumor patients. However, to facilitate the radiotherapy (RT) procedure, "forced" type interventions including conscious sedation or general anesthesia are frequently used to manage patients' fear and anxiety. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of therapeutic play (TP) in reducing anxiety for pediatric brain tumor patients treated by EBRT. Methods: Between April 1st and September 30th, 2009, 19 young brain tumor patients, aged 3-15 years and recommended for RT, were recruited: ten to a control group and nine to the study intervention group. The study group was introduced with TP during EBRT. The Beck Youth Anxiety Inventory and the Faces Anxiety Scale were used to evaluate patients' psychological levels of anxiety. The heart rate variability and salivary cortisol concentrations were used to indicate the patients' physical levels of anxiety. Both the psychological and physiological tests were administered to all subjects before and after the RT procedure. Results: The study group had significantly lower anxiety scores and expressed fewer negative emotions than did the control group before EBRT. Conclusions: TP can not only improve the quality of medical services but can also reduce costs and staffing demands. In addition, it can help lower young patients' anxiety and fear during medical procedures. As a result, it further decreases the potential negative impacts of hospitalization on these young patients. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84881370814	Clinical analysis of catastrophic epilepsy in infancy and early childhood: Results of the Far-East Asia Catastrophic Epilepsy (FACE) study group	Purpose: We studied children younger than 6 years old who developed catastrophic epilepsy and were registered in the FACE study group to clarify their clinical characteristics and prevalence of seizure as well as epilepsy types. Subjects: Subjects were prospectively recruited from children with epilepsy who satisfied the following criteria and underwent intensive examination between 2009 and 2012 in 14 collaborative centers: (1) younger than 6 years old and (2) more than 10 seizures/month refractory to all available medical treatments including ACTH therapy, leading to significant psychosocial morbidity. Methods: We analyzed epilepsy onset age, predominant seizure type, etiology, neuropsychological findings, and syndromic classification according to the pre-determined registration format. Results: A total of 314 children were enrolled in this study. Epilepsy onset age in 239 cases (80%) was younger than 12. months. The most frequent seizure type was epileptic spasms (ES), followed by generalized tonic seizures (GTS), which accounted for 42% and 20%, respectively. West syndrome (WS) was the most frequent epileptic syndrome and accounted for 37%, followed by unclassified epilepsy at 21%, neocortical epilepsy at 19%, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome at 12%, Dravet syndrome at 4%, Rasmussen syndrome at 2%, and others. The two most frequent causes of epilepsy were cortical dysplasia and chromosomal anomalies, as shown in 16% and 6%, respectively. However, the etiology of nearly one half of all patients remained unknown. Psychomotor development was already worse than a moderate degree in 62% of subjects at the first examination. Conclusion: The highest proportion of catastrophic epilepsy was WS and its related syndromes featuring ES and GTS, followed by neocortical epilepsy, whose psychomotor development was significantly retarded at examinations. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

84884516064	Health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with spinal dysraphism: Results from a Taiwanese sample	Purpose: This study was designed to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQL) in children and adolescents with spinal dysraphism and to determine the differences between the myelomeningocele (MMC) and lipomyelomeningocele (LMMC) groups. Methods: Thirty-two patients (mean age, 13.2 years) with MMC and 28 patients (mean age, 11.3 years) with LMMC participated in this study. HRQL was measured using the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50). The CHQ-PF50 scores for the study participants were compared with those of a reference sample of healthy Taiwanese children. Outcomes for children with MMC were compared with those for children with LMMC. We also explored the relationships of the lesion level and associated medical problems with HRQL in these subjects. Results: Patients with MMC had significantly lower scores on the physical and psychosocial aspects of CHQ-PF50 than did healthy children. Patients with LMMC had lower scores on some domains but had comparable psychosocial summary scores. Significant differences were noted between the MMC and LMMC groups for all subscales and both summary scores. Children with a higher lesion level had poor physical health (r = -0.52, P < 0.001) but not poor psychosocial health. The number of associated medical problems, indicating their severity, was related to both physical (r = -0.77, P < 0.001) and psychosocial health (r = -0.57, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Children and adolescents with MMC have reduced HRQL compared with those with LMMC. Children and adolescents with more associated medical problems have the greatest risk of diminished physical and psychosocial well-being. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0141520558	Screening of fetal CNS anomalies by MR imaging	Introduction: MR with ultrafast imaging techniques is, nowadays, a standard clinical service in most medical centers for prenatal counseling when sonographic examination is not conclusive or a complicated pregnancy is encountered. Compared with other imaging modalities, MR has multi-faceted superiorities in that it uses non-ionization radiation, it has freedom in selecting an imaging plane, it produces standardized and easily reproducible imaging views, it provides excellent tissue contrast and overview of the fetus, there is no scanning dead space, and no limit to penetration depth. Central nervous system anomalies are the most common indications for fetal MR imaging. Technical aspects: Among the various ultrafast imaging techniques, T2-weighted imaging, e.g., spin echo-based half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo and gradient echo-based steady-state free precession, and T1-weighted imaging, e.g., fast low angle shot and fast spoiled gradient recalled sequences, are commonly used. Future: In the future, morphometry in three dimensions, real-time imaging, and the functional and metabolic evaluation of the fetal brain will be the important ongoing challenges.

0043172267	Magnetoencephalographic yield of interictal spikes in temporal lobe epilepsy: Comparison with scalp EEG recordings	To compare magnetoencephalography (MEG) with scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in the detection of interictal spikes in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), we simultaneously recorded MEG and scalp EEG with a whole-scalp neuromagnetometer in 46 TLE patients. We visually searched interictal spikes on MEG and EEG channels and classified them into three types according to their presentation on MEG alone (M-spikes), EEG alone (E-spikes), or concomitantly on both modalities (M/E-spikes). The M-spikes and M/E-spikes were localized with MEG equivalent current dipole modeling. We analyzed the relative contribution of MEG and EEG in the overall yield of spike detection and also compared M-spikes with M/E-spikes in terms of dipole locations and strengths. During the 30- to 40-min MEG recordings, interictal spikes were obtained in 36 (78.3%) of the 46 patients. Among the 36 patients, most spikes were M/E-spikes (68.3%), some were M-spikes (22.1%), and some were E-spikes (9.7%). In comparison with EEG, MEG gave better spike yield in patients with lateral TLE. Sources of M/E- and M-spikes were situated in the same anatomical regions, whereas the average dipole strength was larger for M/E- than M-spikes. In conclusion, some interictal spikes appeared selectively on either MEG or EEG channels in TLE patients although more spikes were simultaneously identified on both modalities. Thus, simultaneous MEG and EEG recordings help to enhance spike detection. Identification of M-spikes would offer important localization of irritative foci, especially in patients with lateral TLE. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

0344740561	Elevated nitric oxide levels in childhood brain tumors	Objectives: One of the fundamental aspects of nitric oxide (NO) is the regulation of the inflammatory processes involved in neuronal apoptosis. Expressions of NO and NO synthase (NOS) are considered to be involved in brain tissue injuries and brain tumors. The purpose of our study was to investigate the roles of NO and inducible-form NOS (iNOS) in the pathogenesis of brain tumors. Methods: NO levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 36 brain tumor patients were detected utilizing the NO-chemiluminescence method. Deparaffinized tissue sections were immunostained for the presence of antibodies against iNOS and for apoptosis using the TUNEL stain. The results were compared with 10 control patients (with epilepsy and hydrocephalus). Conclusions: Higher levels of NO and iNOS activities may induce immune responses and neurotoxicities. This preliminary study revealed elevated NO and NOS activities with an increased amount of apoptotic processes in brain tumor tissues, which may indicate the possible roles of NO in the formation of brain tumors.

84888203619	Preoperative embolization of hypervascular pediatric brain tumors: Evaluation of technical safety and outcome	Background: Surgical management of pediatric hypervascular brain tumors is challenging because of the risk of bleeding. We sought to evaluate the technical factors associated with safety and outcome of preoperative embolization of pediatric hypervascular brain tumors. Materials and methods: Eight pediatric brain tumor patients received preoperative endovascular embolization during the past 8 years. The cases included four choroid plexus papillomas, one yolk sac tumor, one intraventricular meningioma, one astrocytoma, and one hemangioblastoma. Embolization was done by superselection of the feeding arteries with microcatheters followed by slow injection of either n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) or tris-acryl gelatin microspheres (Embosphere). Surgery for tumor removal was done in the same session right after embolization in all but one patient. Blood loss during surgery and clinical outcome were recorded. Results: Preoperative embolization was successfully done in all patients. Technical complication was noted in two patients. One patient developed bleeding while embolizing the tumor with Embospheres but was immediately embolized with NBCA without sequel. The other patient experienced tumor bleeding 4 h after embolization with Embospheres, and suffered left hemiparesis despite an emergency surgery. Surgical intervention was successfully done in all patients without procedure-related complication. Surgical blood loss ranged from 50 to 1,600 ml. Conclusion: Though associated with the risk of procedure-related bleeding, preoperative embolization of pediatric hypervascular brain tumors has high technical success rates and can enhance the surgical management. We suggest to perform the embolization and surgery in a single session and to use NBCA as the embolic agent to minimize the procedure-related risk. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84891843374	Neuropsychological functions and quality of life in survived patients with intracranial germ cell tumors after treatment	Background. The notable survival chances of intracranial germ cell tumors (icGCTs) lead to a rising concern over long-term neurocognitive outcome. Yet, prior evidence related to this issue fails to provide a comprehensive examination of the effects of tumor location and radiotherapy. We attempt to explore their impacts on the neuropsychological functions and life quality in children with icGCT after multimodality treatments. Methods. Aretrospective reviewof 56 patients diagnosed with icGCTs at age,20 and treated at theTaipeiVeterans General Hospital was provided. Intelligence, memory, visual organization, attention, and executive function were assessed by neurocognitive tests; adaptation to life, emotional and behavioral changes, interpersonal relationships, and impact on the family were evaluated by parentreport instruments. Effects of tumor locations (germinomas and nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors in the pineal, suprasellar, and basal ganglia) and irradiation on these measurements were examined. Results. Patients with tumors in the basal ganglia region had lower full-scale IQs than those with tumors in the pineal or suprasellar regions. Subscores of intelligence scale and short-term retention of verbal and visual stimuli showed evident group differences, as did the quality oflife and adaptive skills, particularly in psychosocial domains. Patients treated with whole-ventricular irradiation had better outcomes. Extensive irradiation field and high irradiation dosage influenced intellectual functions, concept crystallization, executive function, and memory. Conclusions. Tumor location and irradiation field/dosage appear to be the crucial factors related to certain neuropsychological, emotional, and behavioral dysfunctions that in turn alter the quality of life in children with icGCTs who survive after treatment. © The Author(s) 2013.

84891757926	DriverDB: An exome sequencing database for cancer driver gene identification	Exome sequencing (exome-seq) has aided in the discovery of a huge amount of mutations in cancers, yet challenges remain in converting oncogenomics data into information that is interpretable and accessible for clinical care. We constructed DriverDB (http://ngs.ym.edu.tw/driverdb/), a database which incorporates 6079 cases of exome-seq data, annotation databases (such as dbSNP, 1000 Genome and Cosmic) and published bioinformatics algorithms dedicated to driver gene/mutation identification. We provide two points of view, 'Cancer' and 'Gene', to help researchers to visualize the relationships between cancers and driver genes/mutations. The 'Cancer' section summarizes the calculated results of driver genes by eight computational methods for a specific cancer type/dataset and provides three levels of biological interpretation for realization of the relationships between driver genes. The 'Gene' section is designed to visualize the mutation information of a driver gene in five different aspects. Moreover, a 'Meta-Analysis' function is provided so researchers may identify driver genes in customer-defined samples. The novel driver genes/mutations identified hold potential for both basic research and biotech applications. © 2013 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

84895815256	Frequent overexpression of HMGA2 in human atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor and its correlation with let-7a3/let-7b miRNA	Purpose: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) are highly aggressive pediatric malignancies characterized by biallelic inactivation of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor gene. We searched for novel genomic aberrations by investigating the copy number and expression alterations of let-7a3/let-7b micro- RNA (miRNA) and correlated these with expression of high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) oncoprotein, a target of let-7 miRNA family, in 18 AT/RT samples to elucidate potential roles of HMGA2 in the pathogenesis of AT/RT. Experimental Design: Genomic aberrations, let-7a3/let-7b miRNA and HMGA2 expression in AT/RT tissues were identified using quantitative PCR, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry. The impact of let-7b miRNA on HMGA2 expression and the malignant potential of human rhabdoid tumor cell G401 (SMARCB1 -/- ) were investigated by antisense inhibition and ectopic overexpression studies. Results: The copy number of let-7a3/let-7b miRNA was substantially decreased in 4 of 11 AT/RT samples. A significantly inverse correlation between let-7a3/let-7b miRNA expression and HMGA2 mRNA expression was observed in AT/RT tissues (R = 0.34; P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that HMGA2 was highly overexpressed in 83.3% (15 of 18) of AT/RT tissues. Restoration of let-7 miRNA or knockdown of HMGA2 expression significantly suppressed proliferation and colony formation, and almost abolished the invasive potential of G401 cells. Conclusion: Reduction of let-7a3/let-7b miRNA may be one of mechanisms leading to overexpression of HMGA2 in AT/RT tissues. HMGA2 oncoprotein plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of AT/RT development; and reconstitution of let-7 miRNA or knockdown of HMGA2 oncoprotein may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with AT/RT. © 2014 AACR.

84906937356	Comparison of resilience in adolescent survivors of brain tumors and healthy adolescents	BACKGROUND:: Resilience is essential for the psychological adjustment of adolescents experiencing difficulty. Comparing differences in resilience between adolescent survivors of brain tumors and healthy adolescents may help identify factors related to resilience in adolescents. OBJECTIVE:: The purpose of this study was to clarify how illness impacts the normative development of adolescent survivors of brain tumors by comparing them to healthy adolescents in terms of resilience and how it is affected by various health problems. METHODS:: This cross-sectional, case-control study used convenience sampling to recruit 13- to 18-year-old adolescent survivors of brain tumors and healthy adolescents matched by school level, gender, and living area. Data were collected by structured questionnaires. RESULTS:: The sample included 60 adolescent survivors and 120 healthy adolescents. Participants in both groups were predominantly male adolescents (63.3%) and junior high school students (55%). The 2 groups did not differ significantly in resilience, but survivors without emotional problems had a higher mean resilience score than did healthy adolescents and survivors with emotional problems (F = 8.65, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS:: Our results identify emotional problems as a risk factor for resilience in both adolescent survivors of brain tumors and healthy adolescents. In addition, the impact of emotional problems on resilience was more severe in brain tumor survivors than in healthy adolescents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: Our results suggest that pediatric oncology nurses design interdisciplinary school-based interventions to reduce the impact of emotional problems on resilience in both healthy adolescents and those who survived brain tumors. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84906274216	New grading of moyamoya disease using color-coded parametric quantitative digital subtraction angiography	Background: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder characterized by idiopathic progressive stenosis or the occlusion of the intracranial arteries. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the reference diagnostic imaging modality for MMD. Use of the conventional Suzuki grading remains the gold standard for evaluating the severity of MMD. In this study, we propose a quantitative method using color-coded parametric quantitative DSA (QDSA) to improve prediction of the severity of MMD. Methods: Eighteen DSA examinations from 18 patients with MMD and 14 control participants were included. All patients with MMD underwent DSA and dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI). QDSA was used to determine the delay time of maximal opacification (Td) between the internal carotid artery and the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery. The time-to-peak (TTP) was measured in the medial frontal, lateral frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes from the DSC-PWI. The relative TTP (rTTP) values were then obtained by subtracting the TTP of the cerebellum. Results: The Td was significantly longer in the patients with MMD presenting with infarction than in the control group. The Td significantly correlated with the angiographic Suzuki grading system and showed closer correlation with prolonged rTTP in the medial frontal, lateral frontal, and parietal regions compared with Suzuki grading. Conclusion: The Td significantly correlated with conventional angiographic grading and with the status of hemodynamic impairment in patients with MMD. QDSA and Td measurements can provide a simple and quantitative angiographic grading system for patients with MMD. © 2014.

The locations of FCDs resected were in the frontal lobe in 18 cases, temporal lobe in 7, parietal lobe in 2, and in bilobes including frontoparietal lobe in 2 and parieto-occipital lobes in 1. Eight cases that had FCDs involved in the rolandic cortex presented hemiparesis before surgical resection. Motor function in four of them improved after operation. The histopathological types of FCDs were type Ia in 1, type Ib in 7, type IIa in 7, type IIb in 12, and type III in 3 patients. FCDs were completely resected in 20 patients. Eighteen (90 %) of them were seizure free (p < 0.001) with three patients that received more than one surgery to accomplish complete resection. The patients who had early seizure onset, no significant cognitive function deficit, and early surgical intervention with complete resection in less than 2 years of seizure duration showed best outcomes on seizure control, cognitive function, and quality of life.

13544260775	Spinal cord hemongioblastoma with extensive syringomyelia	We present the case of a 20-year-old male with intermittent right upper extremity numbness for 3 months. His pain perception and temperature sensation were severely disturbed. An incidental magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding of one small intramedullary enhancing nodule at spinal cord level T10-11 with long-segment syrinx formation suggested the diagnosis of spinal hemangioblastoma with syringomyelia. Surgical removal of the tumor and decompression of the spinal cord with opening of the syrinx were performed smoothly, and the pathology confirmed the diagnosis of spinal hemangioblastoma. Reviewing the literature, MRI is the examination of choice for spinal hemangioblastomas, and is helpful in preoperative planning and the differential diagnosis of spinal cord neoplasms and vascular lesions. ©2005 Elsevier.
