84927727857	Time-integrated and time-dependent angular analyses of B → J/ψKπ: A measurement of cos2β with no sign ambiguity from strong phases	We present results on B → J/ψKπ decays using e<sup>+</sup> e<sup>-</sup> annihilation data collected with the BABAR detector at the Y(4S) resonance. The detector is located at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy storage ring facility at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Using approximately 88 × 10<sup>6</sup> BB̄ pairs, we measure the decay amplitudes for the flavor eigenmodes and observe strong-phase differences indicative of final-state interactions with a significance of 7.6 standard deviations. We use the interference between the Kπ S-wave and P-wave amplitudes in the region of the K*(892) to resolve the ambiguity in the determination of these strong phases. We then perform an ambiguity-free measurement of cos2β using the angular and time-dependent asymmetry in B → J/ψK* <sup>0</sup>(K<inf>S</inf><sup>0</sup>π<sup>0</sup>) decays. With sin2β fixed at its measured value and cos2β treated as an independent parameter, we find cos2β = 2.72<inf>-0.79</inf><sup>+0.50</sup>(stat) ± 0.27(syst), determining the sign of cos2β to be positive at 86% C.L. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

1542787408	Study of Particle Identification Using dE /dx in the BES Large Cylindrical Drift Chamber	The method for particle identification using dE / dx in the BES large cylindrical drift chamber has been briefly described. The performance of the particle identification using dE / dx has been given. After applying systematic effect corrections and absolute energy calibration to the dE / dx raw data, the dE / dx energy resolution of 7.5% has been obtained for minimum ionization particles (0.4 - 0.5GeV / c π) in a case corresponding to more than 30 dE / dx samples per track. This results in 3σ K / π separation for momentum up to 0.65GeV / c and 3σ e / π separation in a momentum range of 0.2≤p≤4GeV / c.

A high mass enhancement with mass around 2.15 GeV/c2 is also observed.

Here the symbol D0 indicates decay of a D0 or D̄0 into K+π-, while the symbol D*0 indicates decay of a D*0 or D̄*0 to D0π0 or D0γ. These final states can be reached through the b→c transition B-→D(*)0K- followed by the doubly Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)-suppressed D0→K+π-, or the b→u transition B-→D̄(*)0K- followed by the CKM-favored D̄0→K+π-. The interference of these two amplitudes is sensitive to the angle γ of the unitarity triangle. Our results are based on 232×106 Υ(4S)→BB̄ decays collected with the BABAR detector at SLAC. We find no significant evidence for these decays. We set a limit rB|A(B-→D̄0K-)/A(B-→D0K-)|<0.23 at 90% C.L. using the most conservative assumptions on the values of the CKM angle γ and the strong phases in the B and D decay amplitudes. In the case of the D* we set a 90% C.L. limit rB*2|A(B-→D̄*0K-)/A(B-→D*0K-) |2<(0.16)2 which is independent of assumptions on γ and strong phases. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

No ρπ signal is observed, and the upper limit of the cross section is measured to be σ(e+e-→ρπ) <6.0pb at 90 C.L. Considering the interference between the continuum amplitude and the ψ(3770) resonance amplitude, the branching fraction of ψ(3770) decays to ρπ is determined to be B(ψ(3770) →ρπ) (6.0×10-6,2.4×10-3) at 90% C.L.

31444431756	A beam test of a prototype of the BESIII drift chamber in magnetic field	A prototype of the BESIII drift chamber was tested with He/C3H8(60/40) gas mixture in a 1T magnetic field at the π-2 beam line of KEK 12 GeV PS. The drift distance-time relationship was extracted for various conditions. The performance of the chamber, such as the spatial resolution, the dE/dx resolution and the cell efficiency, was studied in detail. The dE/dx was measured as a function of βγ to calculate the particle separation power. Based on the test results, the operating voltage of the BESIII drift chamber is optimized to be 2200 V, resulting in a spatial resolution better than 110μm, a cell efficiency over 98%, a dE/dx resolution better than 5% and the 3σπ/K separation at a momentum exceeding 700MeV/c.

The data sample comprises 229×106Υ(4S)→BB̄ decays collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- storage ring. Flavor-changing neutral current decays are highly suppressed in the standard model and their predicted properties could be significantly modified by new physics at the electroweak scale.

In one approach, we combine the inclusive B̄→Xuν̄ rate, integrated up to a maximum hadronic mass mX<1.67GeV/c2, with a measurement of the inclusive B→Xsγ photon energy spectrum. We obtain |Vub|=(4.43±0.38stat±0.25syst±0.29theo)×10-3. In another approach we measure the total B̄→Xuν̄ rate over the full phase space and find |Vub|=(3.84±0.70stat±0.30syst±0.10theo)×10-3. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33745020680	Search for the decay τ-→3π-2π+2π0ντ	A search for the decay of the τ lepton to five charged and two neutral pions is performed using data collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. The analysis uses 232fb-1 of data at center-of-mass energies on or near the Υ(4S) resonance. We observe 10 events with an expected background of 6.5-1.4+2.0 events. In the absence of a signal, we set the limit on the branching ratio B(τ-→3π- 2π+2π0ντ)<3.4×10-6 at the 90% confidence level. This is a significant improvement over the previously established limit. In addition, we search for the decay mode τ-→2ωπ-ντ. We observe 1 event with an expected background of 0.4+1.0-0.4 events and calculate the upper limit B(τ-→2ωπ-ντ)<5.4×10-7 at the 90% confidence level. This is the first upper limit for this mode. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Using 232×106 BB̄ pairs recorded on the Υ(4S) resonance by the BABAR detector at the e+e- asymmetric B factory PEP-II at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, we measure the branching fractions B(B0→D*+D*-)=(8.1±0. 6±1.0)×10-4, B(B0→D*±D)=(5.7±0.7±0. 7)×10-4, B(B0→D+D-)=(2.8±0.4±0.5)×10-4, B(B+→D*+D̄*0)=(8.1±1.2±1.2)×10-4, B(B+→D*+D̄0)=(3.6±0.5±0.4)×10-4, B(B+→D+D̄*0)=(6.3±1.4±1.0)×10-4, and B(B+→D+D̄0)=(3.8±0.6±0.5)×10-4, where in each case the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. We also determine the limits B(B0→D*0D̄*0)<0.9×10-4, B(B0→D*0D̄0)<2.9×10-4, and B(B0→D0D̄0)<0. 6×10-4, each at 90% confidence level. All decays above denote either member of a charge-conjugate pair. We also determine the CP-violating charge asymmetries A(B0→D*±D)=0.03±0.10±0.02, A(B+→D*+D̄*0)=-0.15±0.11±0.02, A(B+→D*+D̄0)=-0.06±0.13±0.02, A(B+→D+D̄ *0)=0.13±0.18±0.04, and A(B+→D+D̄0)=-0. 13±0.14±0.02. Additionally, when we combine these results with information from time-dependent CP asymmetries in B0→D(*)+D(*)- decays and world-averaged branching fractions of B decays to Ds(*)D̄(*) modes, we find the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase γ is favored to lie in the range (0.07-2.77) radians (with a +0 or +π radians ambiguity) at 68% confidence level. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33746608115	Study of the decay B̄0→D*+ωπ-	We report on a study of the decay B̄0→D*+ωπ- with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B-factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Based on a sample of 232×106 BB̄ decays, we measure the branching fraction B(B̄0→D*+ωπ-)=(2.88±0. 21(stat.)±0.31(syst.))×10-3. We study the invariant mass spectrum of the ωπ- system in this decay. This spectrum is in good agreement with expectations based on factorization and the measured spectrum in τ-→ωπ-ντ. We also measure the polarization of the D*+ as a function of the ωπ- mass. In the mass region 1.1 to 1.9 GeV we measure the fraction of longitudinal polarization of the D*+ to be ΓL/Γ=0.654±0.042(stat.)±0.016(syst.).

We fit the Dalitz plot distribution using an isobar model and measure the magnitudes and phases of the decay coefficients. We find no evidence of CP violation for the individual components of the isobar model. The decay dynamics is dominated by the K+K- S-wave, for which we perform a partial-wave analysis in the region m(K+K-)<2GeV/c2. Significant production of the f0(980) resonance, and of a spin zero state near 1.55GeV/c2 are required in the isobar model description of the data.

The data of the beam test were analyzed and some diffraction angles were obtained. The experimental results were in good agreement with standard data from ICDD powder diffraction file. The precision of diffraction angles was 1% to 4.7%. Most of the relative errors between measured values of diffraction angles and existing data were less than 1%. As for the detector, the best position resolution in the test was 138 μm (σ value) with an X-ray tube. Finally, discussions of the results were given. The major factor that affected the precision of measurement was deviation from the flat structure of the detector. The effect was analyzed and the conclusion was reached that it would be the optimal measurement scheme when the distance between the powder sample and detector was from 400 mm to 600 mm. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Ltd.

51649085369	Anomalous line shape of the cross section for e+e-→ hadrons in the center-of-mass energy region between 3.650 and 3.872 GeV	We observe an obvious anomalous line shape of the e+e-→ hadrons total cross sections in the energy region between 3.700 and 3.872 GeV. It is inconsistent with the explanation for only one simple ψ(3770) resonance with a statistical significance of 7σ. The anomalous line shape may be explained by two possible enhancements of the inclusive hadron production near the center-of-mass energies of 3.764 and 3.779 GeV, indicating that either there is likely a new structure in addition to the ψ(3770) resonance around 3.773 GeV, or there are some physics effects reflecting the DD̄ production dynamics. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

60249098417	A study of the calibration of wire positions for the BESIII drift chamber using physics data without magnetic field	A method to determine precisely three-dimensional wire positions in the BESIII drift chamber using physics events is introduced. In part the proposed technique takes advantage of the possibility that the magnetic field can be turned off, thereby providing a huge sample of straight tracks for which effects due to multiple scattering, energy loss and non-uniformity of the magnetic field are minimized during the calibration process. A toy Monte Carlo study is performed to demonstrate the viability of the method. As a result of the calibration process, the rms of the distribution of wire position deviation is reduced from 35 μm to 10 μm.

77957608629	The study of the two-dimensional position sensitive gas electron multiplier based on strips readout	To meet the need of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) in two-dimensional detectors, a two-dimensional position sensitive X-ray gas electron multiplier(GEM) detector based on PCB strips and anolog readout were designed and constructed. Through the test of two kinds of strip pitchs and based on the system of multi-channel charge sensitive preamplifier and VME buffer-ADC, the spatial resolution of soft X-ray was measured and pretty good spatial resolutions of about 84 μm and 75 μm respectively were obtained. The effect of the sum of the voltages applied on the three GEM foils on the spatial resolution was studied and position veracity and linearity of GEM was tested. The principles of GEM based on anode readout and the anolog electronic system were clarified meanwhile. © 2010 Chin. Phys. Soc.

80051548788	Study of B± → J/Ψπ± and B± → J/ΨK± decays: Measurement of the ratio of branching fractions and search for direct CP violation	Decays that measure the ratio of branching fractions and searches for direct CP violations were analyzed. The decays were collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric B factory at SLAC. The fitted asymmetries for the small observed differences in the tracking efficiency were corrected between positively and negatively charged track. It was found that the uncertainty in the fixed parameters of the PDFs, determined by fits to stimulated or nonsignal data sets, contributed 0.001 to the systematic errors.

84898971112	Investigation of GEM-Micromegas detector on X-ray beam of synchrotron radiation	To reduce the discharge of the standard bulk Micromegas and GEM detectors, a GEM-Micromegas detector was developed at the Institute of High Energy Physics. Taking into account the advantages of the two detectors, one GEM foil was set as a preamplifier on the mesh of Micromegas in the structure and the GEM preamplification decreased the working voltage of Micromegas to significantly reduce the effect of the discharge. At the same gain, the spark probability of the GEM-Micromegas detector can be reduced to a factor 0.01 compared to the standard Micromegas detector, and an even higher gain could be obtained. This paper describes the performance of the X-ray beam detector that was studied at 1W2B Laboratory of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Finally, the result of the energy resolution under various X-ray energies was given in different working gases. This indicates that the GEM-Micromegas detector has an energy response capability in an energy range from 6 keV to 20 keV and it could work better than the standard bulk-Micromegas. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and IOP Publishing Ltd.
