84929391897	2012 CHINET surveillance of bacterial resistance in China	Objective To investigate the susceptibility and resistance of clinical bacterial isolates from hospitals in several major regions of China. Methods Thirteen general hospitals and two children's hospitals were involved in this program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method or automated systems. Results were analyzed according to the breakpoints of CLSI 2012. Results A total of 72 397 clinical isolates were collected from January through December 2012 of which Gram negative organisms and Gram positive cocci accounted for 71. 9% (52 043/72397) and 28. 1 % (20 354/72397) respectively. The average prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains in S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) was 47.9% and 77. 1%, respectively. The resistance rates of MR strains to beta-lactams and other antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of MS strains. However, nearly 87. 0% of MRSA strains were still susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while 89. 1 % of MRCNS strains were susceptible to rifampin. No stahylococcal strain was found resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezdid. Nearly 0. 4% of the MRCNS strains were found resistant to teicoplanin. In Enterococcus spp., the resistance rates of E. fecalis strains to most antimicrobial agents tested (except chloramphenicol) were much lower than those of E. faecium. Some strains of both species were resistant to vancomycin, most of which were VanA type based on their phenotype. Some strains resistant to teicoplanin or linezolid were identified in both species. The prevalence of ESBLs producing strains was 55. 3% in E. coli, 33. 9% in Klebsiella spp. (K. pneumoniae and K. ojcytoca) and 20. 7% in Proteus mirabilis on average. ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae strains were more resistant than non-ESBLs-producing strains to all the antimicrobial agents tested. Enterobacteriaceae strains were still highly susceptible to the three carbapenems tested, the overall resistance rates being 4. 4%-6. 3%. The resistance rates of Acinetobacter spp. (A. baumannii accounted for 89. 6%) to imipenem and meropenem were up to 57. 0% and 61. 0%, respectively. Some carhapenem resistant strains were found in various Enterobacteriaceae spp., especially in K. pneumoniae. Conclusions Bacterial resistance is still an important problem in clinical setting in China, especially the carhapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which is of great concern.

84937805891	CHINET 2011 surveillance of antibiotic resistance in A. baumannii isolates in china	Objective To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of A. baumanii strains isolated from 15 hospital (13 general hospitals and 2 Children's hospitals) in severl regions across China during 2011. Methods A total of 6 723 clinical isolates of Acinetobacter were collected from 15 teaching hospitals in China, most of which were A. baumanii (5 958, 88. 6%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-Bauer method according to a unified protocol. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5. 6 software according to CLSI 2012 breakpoints. Results A. baumanii isolates showed the lowest resistant rates to cef-operazone-sulbactam and minocycline (43. 4% and 31. 1 %, respectively). The resistant rates to other antimicrobial agents were higher than 52. 4%. The resistant rates to imipenem and meropenem were 65. 2% and 66. 2%, respectively. The antimicrobial resistance pattern varied in different hospitals across China. The resistance of A. baumanii varied from one department to another, especially higher in intensive care units. A number of pandrug-resistant (PDR) (27. 4%, 1 635/5 958) and multidrug- resistant (MDR) A. baumanii strains (51.7%, 3 081/5 958) were identified. Conclusions A. baumanii is the most popular pathogenic species of Acinetobacter. The prevalence of antibiotic resistant A. baumanii strains is still increasing. More than 60% of the collected isolates during 2011 were resistant to most of antimicrobial agents tested except cefoperazone-sulbactam and minocycline, which showed good in vitro activity against A. baumanii. The resistance of A. baumanii varies greatly with hospital and department.

S. pyogenes strains were highly sensitive to penicillin and cephalosporins. The resistant rates of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates to erythromycin and clindamycin were higher than 70. 0%, but these strains were highly sensitive to fluoroquinolones, vancomycin and linezolid. The prevalence of [Î²-lactamase in H. influenzae strains isolated from children and adults were 16. 8% and 34. 8%, respectively. More than 90. 0% of H. influenzae isolates were still sensitive to azithromycin.cefuroxime and levofloxacin. Methicillin resistant strains in S. aureus (MRSA)accounted for 60. 1 %. No S. aureus strain was found resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. Enterobacteriaceae strains were relatively susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, cefoperazone-sulbactam and pip- eracillin-tazobactam. But 23. 6% of the K. pneumoniae strains isolated from ICU were resistant to imipenem. The prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains was 80. 1% and 52. 0% in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. The over all resistant rates of A. baumannii to imipenem and meropenem were higher than 60. 0%. The resistant rate of P. aeruginosa was lower than 25. 0% to amikacin, pipercillin-tazobactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin orgentamicin.

31344445630	Genotypic diversity and epidemiology of high-level gentamicin resistant Enterococcus in a Chinese hospital	Objective: To investigate the antibiotics resistance of Enterococcus, the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AME) and homology of high-level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) Enterococcus in clinical specimens for the implementation of effective infection control measures. Methods: The resistance of 13 antimicrobial agents was determined by Kirby-Bauer (K-B) or agar dilution method. And the HLGR and high-level streptomycin resistant (HLSR) isolates were screened by agar screen. Production of Î²-lactamases was tested by the nitrocefin disc method. The aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to analyze the homology of HLGR isolates from in-patients. Results: No isolates resistant to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin were found. Ampicillin-resistant isolates did not produce Î²-lactamases and 68 HLGR isolates were screened at the rate of 64.2%. The positive rate of aac(6â²)-Ie-aph(2â³)-Ia was 86.8% and 3 isolates had the new AME gene designated aph(2â³)-Ie mostly similar to aph(2â³)-Id. Among 51 HLGR isolates from in-patients, PFGE grouped 17 Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) isolates into 4 clusters (A-D), and 33 Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) isolates into 8 clusters (A-H), of which the A cluster is the main. Conclusions: HLGR has become the important antibiotic resistance pathogen causing nocosomial infection. And the aac(6â²)-Ie-aph(2â³)-Ia gene was the main aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene leading to HLGR. Â© 2005 The British Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

3142721760	Typing and characterization of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex in a Chinese hospital	This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (Acb complex) and to type carbapenemases. The relatedness of 45 isolates of carbapenem-resistant Acb complex collected from a clinical setting was analysed by PFGE. The carbapenemases produced by these isolates were typed by IEF, a three-dimensional test, 2-mercaptopropanoic acid inhibition assay, PCR and DNA cloning and sequencing. Results showed that all 45 isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics including meropenem. The resistance rates to cefoperazone/sulbactam and ampicillin/sulbactam were 2.2 and 6.5 %, respectively. About 71.7-78.3 % of these isolates were intermediately resistant to cefepime, ceftazidime and cefotaxime. Forty-five isolates were classified into type A (98 %) and B (2 %) based on their PFGE patterns. Most of type A isolates were from the ICU. Type A was the dominant isolate, including subtypes A1 (22 %), A2 (71 %), A3 (2 %) and A4 (2 %). Only one isolate, from the haematology department, belonged to type B. Forty-three isolates (96 %) were positive for carbapenemase. One isolate had two bands by IEF, the pls of which were 6.64 and 7.17. The band with the pl of 6.64 was OXA-23. The other 42 isolates produced two bands with pls of 6.40 and 7.01 which could not be inhibited by clavulanic acid, cloxacillin or 2-mercaptopropanoic acid. It can be concluded that the prevalent carbapenem-resistant Acb complex isolates from this hospital all had similar Î²-lactamase patterns.

Methods: Th e drug resistance to 14 antibiotics of 136 COS-AB isolates collected in Ruijin Hospital from June 2004 to May 2005 were analyzed. 66 A. baumannii isolates were collected from May to December 2004, of which 33 strains were COS-AB and the other 33 non-COS-AB. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and pulsed-field gel electrophotesis (PFGE) were applied to analyze the homology of these strains. Results: RAPD analysis (with the primers ERIC2 and 272) showed all COS-AB strains as identical, while PFGE analysis showed that these COS-AB were of two closely related genotypes distinctly different from that of the non-COS-AB. The COS-AB strains obtained from the Burns Ward were PFGE B type causing interward outbreak of single clone. And the COS-AB strains obtained from another wards were PFGE BA type causing inter-departmental outbreak, mainly among the departments of surgical system. Conclusion: The cross-infection of COS-AB is severe. Strict dis infection and sterilization should be implemented. The epidemiology of COS-AB in environment and patients should be closely monitored. PFGE analysis is a more accurate method in typing A. baumannii.

Methods: The high-level aminoglycoside resistant (HLAR), high-level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) and high-level streptomycin resistant (HLSR) isolates were screened by the agar screening method. The resistance of these strains to 12 antimicrobial agents was determined by K-B method. The aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The prevalence of HLAR was 73.6% in Ente rococcus isolates. None of these HLAR isolates was found resistant to linezolid, vancomycin or teicoplanin. The prevalence of resistance to Î²-lactam antibiotics or quinolones was higher in Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis. The positive rate of aac(6â²)-Ie-aph(2â³)-Ia was 92.6% among HLGR isolates. Three HLGR isolates have the resistance gene mostly similar to aph(2â³)-Id. The rates of 6â²-ant, 3â³-ant and str were all lower in HLSR strains. Conclusions: HLAR Enterococcus spp. has become o ne of the most important antibiotic resistant pathogens of nosocomial infections. The resistance of HLGR is mainly conferred by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes encoded by aac(6â²)-Ie-aph(2â³)-Ia.

Methods: Ninety five strains of imipenem resistant A. baumannii were isolated from August 2003 to December 2004 in the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The MICs of 16 antimicrobial agents against these strains were determined by agar dilution and E-test method. The homology of these isolates was analyzed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The coding gene of carbapenemases was amplified. PCR products were purified, cloned and sequenced. Plasmid DNA was extracted and purified. Conjugation and Southern blot were performed to locate the position of oxa-23 gene. Results: The resistance rates to ampicillin-sulbactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam were 67.9% and 30.2%. Polymyxin E had the lowest resistance rate of 17%. The resistance rate to other antimicrobial agents was higher than 90%. The 95 strains, isolated from 10 clinical units, were classified into 6 clones. Clones A and B were predominant clones. All strains produced carbapenemases which were confirmed as OXA-23 by PCR and sequencing analysis. No plasmid was extracted and conjugation was not successful. Southern bolt showed that oxa-23 gene was located on ApaI-digested chromosomal segments about 220 kb and 200 kb in Clones A and B, respectively. Conclusions: OXA-23-producing A. baumannii has become one of the most important multi-resistant pathogens in our hospital. Clones A and B have widely spread in our hospital. Oxa-23 gene is located on chromosomal DNA.

The genotypes of ESBLs were analyzed by PCR, DNA sequencing and isoelectric focusing. Results: The susceptibility rate of 50 isolates was 100% in imipenem, 60%-80% in cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam, and lower in other antimicrobial agents tested. Only 6.0% of the isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime. Four hundred and forty-seven of 509 isolates had been confirmed the genotype of ESBLs. Four hundred and sixteen strains produced only one type of ESBLs, including CTX-M-14 (271 strains), CTX-M-3 (70 strains), CTX-M-24 (35 strains), CTX-M-22 (8 strains), CTX-M-15 (4 strains), CTX-M-9 (4 strains), CTX-M-28 (3 strains), CTX-M-12 (1 strain), CTX-M-13 (1 strain), CTX-M-27 (1 strain), CTX-M-29 (1 strain), SHV-12 (10 strains), SHV-5 (4 strains), SHV-2 (2 strains), and SHV-9 (1 strain). Thirty isolates carried two or three types of ESBLs, and producing CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-3 together were the most common type. Conclusion: The resistance of E. coli and K. pneumonia producing ESBLs in China was a serious issue and CTX-M type ESBLs were the most common genotype. CTX-M-14 was the predominant genotype. Some isolates produced two or three ESBLs. Â© 2006 The British Infection Society.

34347404673	Surveillance of bacterial resistance in community-acquired respiratory tract infection during 2005-2006 in China	Objective: To investigate antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens isolated from community acquired respiratory tract infections to cefaclor and other 5 antimicrobial agents during 2005-2006. Methods: A total of 506 bacterial isolates were collected, including 280 strains of H. influenzae, 105 S. pneumoniae, 61 M. catarrhalis, 30 oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 30 beta-hemolytic Streptococcus from 6 hospitals. The strain identification confirmation and E-test were conducted in Beijing Hospital. Results: H. influenzae was isolated from 56.9% (115/202) of the patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 64.5% (60/93) of the patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). Results of susceptibility testing showed that the prevalence of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) was 50.5%. About 31.4% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), and 18.1% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). The highest prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP) was found in Shanghai and Guangzhou (78.6%), followed by Sichuan (50%), Tianjin (46.7%), Zhejiang (37.5%) and Beijing (21.1%). Beta-lactamase was produced in 21.1% of H. influenzae isolates and93.4% of M. catarrhalis isolates. The 98.6%, 97.8%, 98.6%, and 85.8% of the H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to cefaclor, cefprozil, azithromycin, ampicillin and moxifloxacin respectively. The resistance rates of S. Pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and MSSA to azithromycin were 94.3%, 60% and 56.7% respectively. The MIC values of cefaclor were 1-2 times lower than cefprozil against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Conclusions: The resistance rate of S. pneumoniae to penicillin is increasing rapidly compared with the surveillance results in 2003. The prevalence of Î²-lactamase production was rising in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The resistance rate of S. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and MSSA to azithromycin was high. Cefaclor still maintains good in vitro activity for most bacterial isolates (70%-100%) from community-acquired respiratory tract infections. It should be recommended as a good choice for mild to moderate community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

34548243954	CHINET 2005 surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae	Objective: To investigate the resistance of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from hospitals in several regions of China, 2005. Methods: Eight representative hospitals were included in this program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-Bauer (KB) technique with a unified protocol. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5.4 software according to CLSI 2005. Results: The prevalence of extended spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBLs) was 38.9%, (20%-57%) in E. coli and 40.5% (13%-70%) in K. pneumoniae. These two species were still highly sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Only 0-3% of the isolates was resistant. Carbapenem-resistant strains were isolated from 4 hospitals. The resistance rates of ESBLs-producing E. coli to cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime and amikacin were all lower than 20%, while in ESBLs-producing K. pneumoniae, the corresponding resistance rates were higher than 50%. The resistance rates of ESBLs(-) E. coli strains to ampicillin, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, SMZ-TMP were all higher than 50%. ESBLs(-) K. pneumoniae strains were highly resistant to ampicillin. The resistant pattern of ESBLs producing strains varied widely in different hospitals. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance in each hospital has specific feature. Carbapenems remain highly active against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Some carbapenem-resistant strains have been identified. The mechanism of such resistance should be further examined.

34548259787	Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates from First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College in 2005	Objective: To investigate the antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates from First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College in 2005. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-Bauer (KB) technique. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5.3 software. Results: Of the 4 551 clinical isolates collected, 66.2% were gram-negative bacilli and 33.8% were gram-positive cocci. Nonfermentative gram negative strains accounted for 55.2% of all gram-positive isolates. About 68.6% of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and 86.8% of coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRCNS). No vancomycin or teicoplanin-resistant isolate was found in Staphylococcus, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. The prevalence of extended spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBLs) was 55.8% in E. coli, 43.5% in K. pneumoniae and 9.1% in Proteus mirabilis. Imipenem and meropenem were the most potent antimicrobial agents against Enterobacteriaceae (>96%). About 35.7% of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam, while more than 60% of the isolates were resistant to imipenem or meropenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa was lowest to amikacin (14.7%), followed by ceftazidime, cefepime, cefoperazone-sulbactam and aztreonam (23%-29%). More strains were resistant to imipenem (33.4%) than to meropenem (25.2%). Minocycline showed good activity against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Chryseobacterium meningosepticum and Burkholderia cepacia (resistance in <10% of the strains). Conclusions: Special attention should be paid to the serious antimicrobial resistance in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli, especially A. baumannii.

36448931654	The molecular epidemiological study of colistin-only-sensitive strains in multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii	This paper reported the epidemiology of the colistin-only-sensitive Acinetobacter baumannii (COS-AB) in a tertiary teaching hospital in China. We analyzed the clinical data of 136 COS-AB isolates from June 2004 to May 2005 and collected 66 A. baumannii isolates in which 33 strains were COS-AB, and the rest were non-COS-AB. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis (primer ERIC2 and 272) showed that all COS-AB were identical, while pulsed-field gel electrophotesis (PFGE) analysis showed two separate genotypes of these COS-AB which were distinctly different from that of non-COS-AB. The COS-AB from burn wards showed the identical PFGE pattern which was distinguished from the genotype of COS-AB in other departments, mainly surgical systems. The cross-infection was severe and strict methods of disinfection and sterilization should be implemented. Meanwhile, the epidemiology of COS-AB in environment and patients should be closely monitored. The PFGE analysis is a reliable method of A. baumannii typing.

38549132895	Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens from 15 teaching hospitals in China in 2005	Objective: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance among the nosocomial gram-negative pathogens from 15 teaching hospitals located in different areas in China in 2005. Methods: A total of 1927 non-repetitive nosocomial gram-negative pathogens were collected from 15 teaching hospitals in different areas in China and sent to the central lab for reidentification and susceptibility testing. The levels of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 18 antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution method. WHONET 5.4 software was used to analyze the data. Results: The strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteous mirabilis isolates that did not produce extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) showed high sensitivity to Î²-lactams. The antibiotics with a susceptibility rates over 80% against the strains of Entorobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogene, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp, and Proteous vulgaris producing AmpC enzyme included meropenem, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam, and these 3 drugs showed a susceptibility rate of more than 80% against the ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other antimicrobial agents showing a relatively high activity against Enterobacter spp, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp and Proteous vulgaris included cefepime (67.3%-100%), amikacin (67.3%-95.2%), ceftazidime (52.9%-100%) and cefoperazone-sulbactam (51.9%-100%). The susceptibility rate of fluoroquinolones was 34.8%-36.1% against non-ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and was 13.4%-17.1% against ESBL-producing isolates. The most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was polymyxin B (95.6%). The agents with the activity rates of 70%-80% included meropenem, imipenem, amikacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The antibiotic with a high susceptible rate against Acinetobacter baumannii was polymyxin B (98.3%), followed by imipenem (80.8%), meropenem (76.2%), and minocycline (67.4%). The susceptible rates of other agents were all below 60%. The agents with relatively high activity against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia included minocycline (85%), levofloxacin (82.5%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (77.5%). The agents with a relatively high activity against Burkholderia cepacia included minocycline (77.2%) and meropenem (61.4%) Conclusion: Carbapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin and cefepime remained relatively high activity against nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, Non-fermenting pathogens have lower susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents than before.

58149314088	Detection of integron, homology and genotype of carbapenemases in multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii isolated from burn wound	Objective: To investigate the relationship among antibiotic resistance integron homology of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii isolated from burn ward. Methods: Thirty-one strains of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from samples of burn wound exudate in hospitalized patients of Gansu Province People's Hospital. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these strains against 11 antibiotics was examined by agar dilution mehod. Homology of these strains was analyzed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Class 1,2 and 3 integrase, integron genes and genotype of carbapenemases were amplified by PCR and verified by DNA sequencing. Results: Acinetobacter baumannii were highly resistant to all antibiotics except imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone-sulb-actam, piperacillintazobactam (antibiotic resistance rate was 45.2%, 48.4%, 48.4%, 41.0%, respectively). All strains were classified into 3 types of clones (A, B, C clone included 18, 7, 6 strains respectively) based on PFGE pattern. Integrons of 20 strains of Acinetobacter Baumannii harbored aadA1, aadA5, aacA4, aac3, catB8, aacC1, aac(6â²)-Ib, drfA17 and drf8 gene. Conclusion: Multi-drug resistance Acinetobacter baumannii (major in clone A) spread widely in burn ward of Gansu Province People's Hospital. Integrons of Acinetobacter baumannii mediated drug resistance against aminoglycoside antibiotics, chloram-phenicol. All carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii can produce OXA-23 carbapenemase.

0034891213	Prevalence and analysis of risk factors for infections caused by resistant Escherichia coli strains in Anhui, China	Background: This study analyzes the prevalence of hospital and community-acquired infections caused by Escherichia coli. Patients and Methods: The antibiotic resistance pattern was used to characterize the isolates, and a retrospective observational study was performed to assess the relationship between antimicrobial use and bacterial resistance. The study was conducted during a 1-year and 7-month period in a 1,500-bed tertiary care hospital in Anhui, China. Results: An E. coli infection was diagnosed in 1.4% of patients (519/36,179) admitted to the hospital between March 1, 1999 and August 31, 2000. Of the 519 isolates, 489 (94.2%) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial; 86% were resistant to ampicillin, 85% to cephalothin, 83% to piperacillin, 77% to ampicillin/sulbactam, 72% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), 70% to ciprofloxacin, 61% to cefoperazone, 58% to tobramycin, 56% to gentamicin, 48% to ticarcillin-clavulanate, 44% to cefazolin, 43% to cefuroxime, 36% to cefoxitin, 32% to cefepime, 29% to aztreonam, cefetaxime and ceftriaxone, 28% to ceftazidime, 19% to piperacillin/tazobactam, 10% to amikacin, while all strains tested were susceptible to imipenem. Conclusion: Prior receipt of amtimicrobial therapy was significantly associated with infection caused by a resistant organism.

77954684523	Efficacy and safety of tigecycline monotherapy vs. imipenem/cilastatin in Chinese patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections: A randomized controlled trial	Background: Tigecycline, a first-in-class broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria commonly encountered in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), including aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. In the current trial, tigecycline was evaluated for safety and efficacy vs. imipenem/cilastatin in hospitalized Chinese patients with cIAIs.Methods: In this phase 3, multicenter, open-label study, patients were randomly assigned to receive IV tigecycline or imipenem/cilastatin for â¤2 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints were clinical response at the test-of-cure visit (12-37 days after therapy) for the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations. Because the study was not powered to demonstrate non-inferiority between tigecycline and imipenem/cilastatin, no formal statistical analysis was performed. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the response rates in each treatment group and for differences between treatment groups for descriptive purposes.Results: One hundred ninety-nine patients received â¥1 dose of study drug and comprised the modified intent-to-treat population. In the microbiologically evaluable population, 86.5% (45 of 52) of tigecycline- and 97.9% (47 of 48) of imipenem/cilastatin-treated patients were cured at the test-of-cure assessment (12-37 days after therapy); in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat population, cure rates were 81.7% (49 of 60) and 90.9% (50 of 55), respectively. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 80.4% for tigecycline vs. 53.9% after imipenem/cilastatin therapy (P < 0.001), primarily due to gastrointestinal-related events, especially nausea (21.6% vs. 3.9%; P < 0.001) and vomiting (12.4% vs. 2.0%; P = 0.005).Conclusions: Clinical cure rates for tigecycline were consistent with those found in global cIAI studies. The overall safety profile was also consistent with that observed in global studies of tigecycline for treatment of cIAI, as well as that observed in analyses of Chinese patients in those studies; no novel trends were observed.

84896994209	Development of a multilocus sequence typing scheme for Ureaplasma	Ureaplasma is a commensal of the human urogenital tract but is always associated with invasive diseases such as non-gonococcal urethritis and infertility adverse pregnancy outcomes. To better understand the molecular epidemiology and population structure of Ureaplasma, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on four housekeeping genes (ftsH, rpL22, valS, thrS) was developed and validated using 283 isolates, including 14 serovars of reference strains and 269 strains obtained from clinical patients. A total of 99 sequence types (STs) were revealed: the 14 type strains of the Ureaplasma serovars were assigned to 12 STs, and 87 novel and special STs appeared among the clinical isolates. ST1 and ST22 were the predominant STs, which contained 68 and 70 isolates, respectively.

84897971080	Fosfomycin resistance among vancomycin-resistant enterococci owing to transfer of a plasmid harbouring the fosB gene	The presence and characterisation of plasmid-mediated fosfomycin resistance determinants were investigated among 45 clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated in Zhejiang Province, China. In total, 19 VRE were resistant to fosfomycin, of which 18 isolates had conjugative fosfomycin resistance and were positive for fosB. No reported fos genes were detected in the remaining isolate. Among the 18 fosB-carrying isolates, the fosB gene was always flanked by tnpA, suggesting the same novel fosB transposon. In 10 of the 18 fosB-carrying isolates, the fosB and tnpA genes were found reversely inserted in the vanA transposon Tn1546. In the remaining eight isolates the fosB and vanA genes were located on different plasmids. These findings indicate that acquisition of the conjugative plasmid harbouring the novel fosB transposon (ISL3-like transposon) and the Tn1546-like transposon (containing vanA and fosB) may explain, at least in part, the recent increase in fosfomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in China.

84925450859	Global transcriptional response of Acinetobacter baumannii to a subinhibitory concentration of tigecycline	Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a significant nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Multidrug resistance has limited the treatment options for A. baumannii. Tigecycline belongs to a new class of modified tetracycline antimicrobials known as glycylcyclines and has demonstrated good in vitro antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. However, tigecycline-resistant strains may be generated during treatment. To explore the response to tigecycline in A. baumannii, the transcriptional profile of A. baumannii was determined in the presence and absence of tigecycline. The results showed that a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pump and multiple transcriptional regulators possibly involved in the stress response and drug resistance were upregulated in response to tigecycline. Strong suppressors in the aerobic phenylacetate catabolic pathway and a number of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were also observed after exposure to tigecycline. Furthermore, A. baumannii showed a lower minimum inhibitory concentration of ceftazidime in the presence of tigecycline owing to downregulated OXA-23 and AmpC. These finding suggest that the response of A. baumannii to tigecycline is multifactorial and includes MFS family efflux pump transcriptional regulators and metabolic pathways, such as the phenylacetate catabolic pathway.

42149117744	Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnr and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr in extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in China	Objectives: To characterize the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnr and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr in extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Methods: qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6â²)-Ib-cr and ESBL-encoding genes were detected by PCR. MICs of 10 antimicrobial agents were determined by Etest. PFGE was used to investigate the clonality of qnr- and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr-producing isolates. Conjugation and Southern hybridizations were used to confirm whether qnr, aac(6â²)-Ib-cr or ESBL-encoding genes were located on plasmids. Results: Twenty-nine (8.0%) of 362 isolates were positive for qnr genes, and the qnrA-, qnrB- and qnrS-type genes were detected alone or in combination in 13 (3.6%), 8 (2.2%) and 9 (2.5%), respectively. Sixty-two (17.1%) isolates were positive for aac(6â²)-Ib, of which 36 (9.9% of all) had the -cr variant. Conjugation and Southern hybridization revealed that qnrA, aac(6â²)-Ib-cr and ESBL-encoding genes were always located on the same plasmids. Conclusions: qnr and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr genes were detected in 8.0% and 9.9% of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. The plasmids carrying the qnr gene could be transferred by conjugation together with ESBL-encoding genes and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr. Â© The Author 2008.

45149126965	Prevalence of the 16S rRNA methylase gene in imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains among 19 hospitals in China	Objective: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of 16S rRNA methylases in imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from 19 hospitals of 6 provinces in China and to analyze their homology. Methods: Three hundred and forty-two clinical isolates of imipenemresistant A. baumannii from Nov. 2004 to Nov. 2005 among 19 hospitals in China were collected. Agar dilution and E test were used to determine the MIC of 14 antibiotics. The homology of these isolates was analyzed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Four 16S rRNA methylase genes, armA, rmtA, rmtB and rmtC were detected by PCR-based assays and PCR products were purified, cloned and sequenced. Plasmid DNA was extracted and conjugation and Southern blot were also performed to locate the armA gene. Results: All of the 342 strains were characterized by a multi-drug resistance phenotype, including amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, isepamicin and netilmicin, with resistant rates of 92.6%, 98.6%, 87.4%, 90.9% and 92.4%, respectively. Total of 221 were positive for armA gene. These strains distributed in 17 tested hospitals. No rmtA, rmtB or rmtC gene was detected. Among the 342 clinical A. baumannii isolates, 298 strains could be classified into 6 epidemic clones, and other 44 strains were sporadic. Clone A, B and C are 3 main clones, which spread widely among 6, 3 and 11 hospitals, respectively. Conjugation, plasmid extraction, electrotransformation and Southern blot confirmed that the armA coding gene is located on the chromosomes of the isolates. Conclusion: Imipenem-resistant strains of A. baumannii had highly resistant rate to different antibiotics including aminoglycoside agents. It is surprising that the armA gene, which confers high-level resistance to all the clinically available aminoglycosides, distributed so widely in A. baumannii in China. The clone spread of armA-positive A. baumannii isolates existed widely in Chinese hospitals. The spread of the multidrug-resistant isolates producing 16S rRNA methylases may become a clinical problem.

53349108003	CHINET 2007 surveillance of bacterial resistance in China	Objective: To investigate the resistance of clinical isolates from hospitals in several provinces in China. Methods: Ten general hospitals and two children's hospitals were involved in this program. Bacterial susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2007. Results: A total of 36 001 clinical isolates were collected from January through December 2007, of which Gram negative organisms and Gram positive cocci accounted for 65.7% and 34.3% respectively. Methicillin resistant strains in Staphylococcus spp (MRSA and MRCNS) accounted for an average of 58% and 77%. The resistance rates of MR strains to Î²-lactams and other antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of methicillin-sensitive strains. However, about 60%-80% of the MR strains were still susceptible to fosfomycin, TMP-SMZ and rifampin. No vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid resistant strains were found. In Enterococcus spp, the resistance rate of E. faecalis strains to most drugs tested was lower than that of E. faecium. However, the resistance rate of the later strains to chloramphenicol was only 6%. Resistance rates of E. faecalis strains to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin were below 10%. Several strains resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin were found in both E. faecalis and E. faecium, which was VanA type resistance as confirmed by PCR technique. ESBLs producing strains were detected in 55% and 45% of strains of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca) respectively. Beta-lactamase producing strains in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 27.4% and 96.1% respectively. Penicillin non-susceptible strains (PISP + PRSP) accounted for 88.5% and 26.4% in children' s strains and adult strains respectively. Strains of Enterobacteriaceae were still highly susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. The overall resistance rate to both imipenem and meropenem was lower than 1%. Resistance rate of P. aeruginosa strains to imipenem and meropenem was in average of 36% and 28.5% respectively. Resistance rates of Acinetobacter spp to the above two drugs were 40% and 35% respectively. Minocycline had good activity against S. maltophilia and Burkholderia spp. The isolates resistant to minocycline were less than 5%. The resistance rates of non-fermentative Gram negative organisms to antimicrobial agents tested were much higher than those of Enterobacteriaceae, the resistance rates to cefoperazone-sulbactam being the lowest among all the drugs tested. Pan-resistant Gram negative strains were found in most hospitals, mostly P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., and strains of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii to a lesser extent. Conclusions: Bacterial resistance is still increasing, especially VRE, MDR and pan-resistant strains in Gram negative organisms. It is mandatory for hospitals to take effective control measures.

54449095783	Construction and identification of an antisense Glucose Transporter-1 plasmid	Our aim was to construct a pcDNA3.1(+) eucaryotic expression system vector containing the antisense glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) gene. Total RNA was isolated from human Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells, and the Glut-1 and antisense Glut-1 sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Expression plasmids containing the sense and antisense cDNA were constructed using the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The resulting sense and antisense vectors, pcDNA3.1(+)-Glut-1 and pcDNA3.1(+)-antiGlut-1, respectively, were examined by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. The pcDNA3.1(+)-antiGlut-1 was subsequently transfected into Hep-2 cells. AntiGlut-1 mRNA expression was detected, indicating the successful construction of an antisense Glut-1 plasmid capable of transfecting Hep-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells. These data provide a firm basis for additional studies using the plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)-antiGlut-1 to determine its therapeutic potential for the treatment of laryngeal carcinoma.

63349096569	Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive cocci isolated from 10 teaching hospitals in China during 2007	Objective: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive cocci isolated from patients in China during 2007. Methods: From June to December 2007, 931 consecutive and non-duplicate gram-positive bacterial isolates were collected from 10 teaching hospitals. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents were determined by agar dilution method. MIC results were interpreted according to CLSI (2008) standards. Results: According to the breakpoint of parenteral penicillin, the prevalence of penicillin-resistant (PRSP) and penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) was 2.6% and 25% respectively among the 152 S. pneumoniae isolates. Vancomycin and teicoplanin were the most active agents against S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, 98% and 100% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone and chloramphenicol could inhibit 72.4%, 80.9% and 84.2% of these isolates respectively. About 64.5% and 59.1% of the penicillin-susceptible S. Pneumoniae (PSSP) were also susceptible to cefprozil and cefaclor respectively. All the PISP and PRSP isolates were resistant to cefprozil and cefaclor. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) was 49.5% and 84.8%, respectively. All isolates of S. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. There were 3 MRSH (methicillin-resistant S. haemolyticus) and 1 MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis) were intermediate to teicoplanin. About 83.2%, 71.1% and 50% of the MRSA isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin, respectively. About 60.4% of E. faecalis and 75.9% of E. faecium isolates were resistant to high level gentamicin. The susceptibility of E. faecalis to all the antibiotics except chloramphenicol and tetracycline were higher than E. faecium. All the E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Two vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates were identified. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci were different at various geographical regions. Teicoplanin and vancomycin are still highly active against gram-positive cocci. The prevalence of PISP seems to be increasing.

64849116482	Causative agent distribution and antibiotic therapy assessment among adult patients with community acquired pneumonia in Chinese urban population	Background: Knowledge of predominant microbial patterns in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) constitutes the basis for initial decisions about empirical antimicrobial treatment, so a prospective study was performed during 2003-2004 among CAP of adult Chinese urban populations. Methods: Qualified patients were enrolled and screened for bacterial, atypical, and viral pathogens by sputum and/or blood culturing, and by antibody seroconversion test. Antibiotic treatment and patient outcome were also assessed. Results: Non-viral pathogens were found in 324/610 (53.1%) patients among whom M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent (126/610, 20.7%). Atypical pathogens were identified in 62/195 (31.8%) patients carrying bacterial pathogens. Respiratory viruses were identified in 35 (19%) of 184 randomly selected patients with adenovirus being the most common (16/ 184, 8.7%). The nonsusceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillin and azithromycin was 22.2% (Resistance (R): 3.2%, Intermediate (I): 19.0%) and 79.4% (R: 79.4%, I: 0%), respectively. Of patients (312) from whom causative pathogens were identified and antibiotic treatments were recorded, clinical cure rate with Î²-lactam antibiotics alone and with combination of a Î²-lactam plus a macrolide or with fluoroquinolones was 63.7% (79/124) and 67%(126/188), respectively. For patients having mixed M. pneumoniae and/or C. pneumoniae infections, a better cure rate was observed with regimens that are active against atypical pathogens (e.g. a Î²-lactam plus a macrolide, or a fluoroquinolone) than with Î²-lactam alone (75.8% vs. 42.9%, p = 0.045). Conclusion: In Chinese adult CAP patients, M. pneumoniae was the most prevalent with mixed infections containing atypical pathogens being frequently observed. With S. pneumoniae, the prevalence of macrolide resistance was high and penicillin resistance low compared with data reported in other regions. Â© 2009 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods: Ten general hospitals and two children s hospitals were involved in this program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-Bauer (KB) according to the unified protocol. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5. 4 software according to CLSI 2007 breakpoint. Results: A total of 2 634 nonduplicate Enterococcus isolates were collected, including 1 281 E. faecalis (48.6%), 1 017 E. faecium (38. 6%), 94 E. durans (3.6%), 50 E. avium (1.9%) and 50 E. gallinarum (1.9%). The resistant rates of E. faecalis to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin were lower than 10%. The resistant rate to ampicillin was 12.9%. The resistant rate of E. faecium strains to most drugs tested was higher than that of E. faecalis. Nearly 90% E. faecium strains was resistant to ampicillin, but only 6.1% to chloramphenicol. More than 70% of E. faecium and nearly 50 % of E. faecalis isolates were resistant to gentamicin (high level). A total of 6 E. faecalis and 21 E. faecium strains were found resistant to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistance gene vanA was detected in all VRE strains. Linezolid-resistant strain was not found. Conclusions: Enterococcus isolates exhibit multidrug resistance. The prevalence of VRE is increasing in some hospitals, which should be paid serious attention to in clinical and laboratory practice.

Methods: A total of 2 718 nonduplicate strains of A. baumannii were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method in every center. The antimicrobial susceptibility data was analyzed by WHONET 5.4 software. Results: Cefoperazone-sulbactam is the most effective agent (72.1%) against A. baumanii among 14 antimicrobial agents. The susceptibility rates to imipenem and meropenem were 60.6% and 55.5%, respectively, followed by minocycline (50.8%) and amikacin (42.9%). The antimicrobial activity of some antimicrobial agents was significantly different among hospitals. The data collected from 12 hospitals demonstrated that the prevalence of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDRAB) was up to 47.7% (4.7%-64.0%). The resistance of A. baumannii varied from one department to another. The highest was in ICU. Conclusions: Cefoperazone-sulbactam and carbapenems are the most effective antimicrobial agents against A. baumannii in vitro. However, the prevalence of MDRAB and PDRAB is up to 47.7% and 2.8%, respectively. The susceptibility of A. baumannii to certain antimicrobial agents varies significantly from one hospital or department to another.

Methods: Disc diffusion test (K-B method) was employed to study the antimicrobial resistance. WHONET 5.4 was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 9734 clinical isolates were analyzed in 2007, including 6527 isolates of E. coli, 3051 of K. pneumoniae and 206 of K. oxytoca. And 24.0% (1566/6527) of E. coli and 17.8% (542/3051) of K. pneumoniae isolates were collected from two children hospitals. The overall prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains in E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates was 55.0% and 44.9%, respectively. The prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains varied with hospital, ranging from 12.3% to 72.1% in E. coli, from 15.4% to 70.6% in Klebsiella spp. Both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. had the lowest resistance (<10%) to imipenem, meropenem and cefoperazone-sulbactam. ESBLs-producing strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (<20%) also showed least resistant to imipenem, meropenem and cefoperazone-sulbactam. Up to 50% ESBLs-producing strains were resistant to both gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. It was found that 21 strains of K. pneumoniae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of K. oxytoca were not susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem. These strains were identified in five hospitals. And 21 of the 24 strains were resistant to all the antimicrobial agents tested. Conclusions: Carbapenems and cefoperazone-sulbactam remain most active against straims of E. coli and Klebsiella spp., the detection rates and result of susceptibility fest of ESBLs-producing strains isolated from different sifies varied.

66649114188	Distribution and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus spp.: Results of National CHINET Program 2007	Objective: To investigate the antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates of Streptococcus collected in 2007 CHINET program. Methods: A total of 1 821 isolates of Streptococcus were collected from 12 hospitals nationwide in 2007. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol of Kirby-Bauer method (KB). Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2007 criteria. Results: Among the 1 821 strains of Streptococcus, S. pneumoniae accounted for 38.1% (694/1821). The Î²-hemolytic streptococcus isolates accounted for 44.0% (802/1821). The other Streptococcus included S. viridans group (17.8%). Among the S. pneumoniae isolates, the prevalence of penicillin susceptible strains (PSSP) from children and adults were 11.5% and 73.7%, respectively. The penicillin non-susceptible strain (PISP and PRSP) accounted for 69.2% and 19.3% in children. The rates of PISP and PRSP in adults were 13.8% and 12.6%. Among the Î²-hemolytic Streptococcus isolates, Group A type accounted for 61.2% (491/802), Group B 23.3% (187/802), and Group C, G, F accounted for 11.2% (90/802) totally. The resistance rates of group A and B types to erythromycin were 93.6% and 42.9%. The resistant rates of other groups of Streptococcus to erythromycin ranged from 51.0% to 64.7%. All five groups were still highly sensitive to penicillin. The resistant rates of S. viridans isolated from sterile sites to penicillin and erythromycin were 20.0% and 63.3%. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and teicoplanin. Conclusions: S. pneumoniae and Î²-hemolytic Streptococcus are still the common pathogens in children and adults in China. The prevalence of PNSP (PISP and PRSP) in children is higher than that in adults. The resistant rates of Î²-hemolytic Streptococcus to erythromycin vary greatly with Streptococcus types. All types of Streptococcus are highly resistant to erythromycin in our country.

66649114756	CHINET 2007 surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Haemophilus influenzae in China	Objective: To investigate the antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) in China during 2007. Methods: Clinical isolates of HI were collected from 9 hospitals in China. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer method. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2007. Beta-lactamases were detected by nitrocefin disk test. Results: A total of 755 clinical isolates of HI were collected. About 59.4%, 30.1% and 16.9% of the 755 strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol, respectively. No more than 10% of these strains were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, azithromycin, or cefuroxime. About 37.4% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin. Beta-lactamase was produced in 34.9% of the isolates from children. Beta-lactamase-positive strains were more resistant than the isolates from adults (13.7% and 10.6%). Only 1.6% of the isolates from children were resistant to ciprofloxacin, apparently lower than the isolates from adults (19.1%). The overall prevalence of Î²-lactamase was 27.4%. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains was 25.3% (159/609). Conclusions: The resistance of HI to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is increasing. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used as empirical treatment of HI infection. The resistance rate to ampicillin and prevalence of Î²-lactamase are higher in children's isolates than in the isolates from adults(P<0.05). The primary mechanism of antibiotic resistance in HI is production of beta-lactamases. More attention should be paid to the multidrug-resistant HI isolated from children.

Methods: Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from 12 teaching hospitals in China were collected and antimicrobial susceptibility were tested by K-B method. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5.4 software. Results: Of 3988 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates, 94.3% were from the hospitalized patients, 76.2% from respiratory tract. The P. aeruginosa isolates showed the lowest resistance rate (18.7%) to amikacin. The resistance rates to other antimicrobial agents were higher than 20%. The resistance rates of the P. aeruginosa strains from Shanghai Huashan Hospital were higher than 30% to most antibiotics except cefoperazone-sulbactam. For the strains from Shanghai Pediatric Hospital, the resistance rates to each of the antimicrobial agents were lower than 10%. The pan-resistant P. aeruginosa strains (only sensitive to colistin) accounted for 3.2%. Conclusions: The antimicrobial resistance of P. aeruginosa is still a serious problem in China. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern varied in different hospitals. The surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is very important for guiding rational antimicrobial therapy.

68949164782	The expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in Chinese overweight and obese patients	Background: ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCA1, ABCG1) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) are the three most important cellular cholesterol transporters/receptor in regulating cholesterol efflux. We have investigated whether the expression of these transporters/receptor is altered in overweight and obese patients, and the potential association with the circulating adipokines. Methods: Adiponectin, leptin and resistin were assayed in two groups of healthy controls, overweight and obese patients. The expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI in monocytes was measured. Cholesterol efflux from monocyte-derived macrophages was also determined. Results: Circulating adiponectin was decreased, whereas leptin and resistin were increased in overweight and obese patients compared with healthy controls. ABCA1 expression was significantly decreased in overweight and obese patients (P<0.01), whereas the levels of ABCG1 and SR-BI were comparable between the two groups. Adiponectin was correlated with ABCA1 (r=0.44, P<0.001), but not with ABCG1 and SR-BI. No associations between leptin, resistin and the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI were found. Cholesterol efflux from monocyte-derived macrophages to apolipoprotein AI or to autologous serum was significantly impaired in overweight and obese patients, which were correlated with ABCA1 expression (r=0.47, P<0.001; r=0.43, P<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The expression of ABCA1 in monocytes is reduced in overweight and obese patients, and the reduction in ABCA1 is associated with the impairment of cholesterol efflux from monocyte-derived macrophages.

70349562558	CHINET 2008 surveillance of bacterial resistance in China	Objective: To investigate the resistance of clinical isolates from hospitals in several regions of China. Methods: Ten general hospitals and two Children's hospitals were involved in this program. Bacterial susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2008. Results: A total of 36 216 clinical isolates were collected from January to December 2008, of which Gram negative organisms and Gram positive cocci accounted for 69.5% and 30.5% respectively. Methicillin resistant strains in S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) accounted for an average of 55.9% and 75.9% respectively. The resistance rates of MR strains to Î²-lactams and other antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of methicillin-sensitive strains. However about 72.4% and 61.2% of MRSA strains were still susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and fosfomycin, while 88.8% and 60.1% of MRCNS strains were susceptible to rifampin and fosfomycin. No vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid resistant strains were found. In Enterococcus spp, the resistance rates of E. faecalis strains to most tested drugs were lower than those of E. faecium, however the resistance rates of the later strains to chloramphenicol was lower. There were some strains resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin in both species; most of these resistant strains were VanA type based on their phenotype. No linezolid resistant strains were found. Penicillin non-susceptible strains in S. pneumoniae (PISP + PRSP) isolated from Children's strains were much more than those in adult strains. Strains of Enterobacteriaceae were still highly susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. The overall resistance rate was <1%. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa strains to imipenem and meropenem were 30.5% and 24.5%, respectively. The resistance rates of Acinetobacter spp to the two drugs were 48.1% and 49.3% respectively. Minocycline had good activity against S. maltophilia and Burkholderia spp. The isolates susceptible to minocycline were both higher than 90%. A number of pan-resistant strains in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were found. Conclusions: Bacterial resistance is still increasing, especially VRE and pan-resistant A. baumannii strains. It is mandatory for hospitals to take effective control measures.

70350508580	Clinical evaluation of oral levofloxacin 500 mg once-daily dosage for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections: A prospective multicenter study in China	Levofloxacin (LVFX), a fluoroquinolone agent, has a broad spectrum that covers Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and atypical pathogens. It demonstrates good clinical efficacy in the treatment of various infections, including lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral LVFX 500 mg once daily, a large open-label clinical trial was conducted in 1266 patients (899 with LRTIs and 367 with UTIs) at 32 centers in China. In the per-protocol population, the clinical efficacy rate (cure or improvement) at 7 to 14 days after the end of treatment was 96.4% (666/691) for LRTIs and 95.7% (267/279) for UTIs. In 53 patients diagnosed with atypical pneumonia the treatment was effective. The bacteriological efficacy rate was 96.6% (256/265) for LRTIs and 93.3% (126/135) for UTIs. The eradication rate of the causative pathogens was 100% (33/33) for Haemophilus influenzae and 96.0% (24/25) for Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRTIs, and 94.1% (80/85) for Escherichia coli in UTIs. The overall efficacy rates were 89.3% (617/691) for LRTIs and 87.8% (245/279) for UTIs. The incidence of drug-related adverse events (ADRs) was 17.3% (215/1245), and the incidence of drug-related laboratory abnormalities was 15.7% (191/1213). Common ADRs were dizziness, nausea, and insomnia. Common laboratory abnormalities included "WBC decreased", "alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased", "aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased", and "lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased". All of these events were mentioned in the package inserts of fluoroquinolones including LVFX, and most events were mild and transient. Thirty-four patients (2.7%) were withdrawn from the study because of the ADRs. No new ADRs were found. This study concluded that the dosage regimen of LVFX 500 mg once daily was effective and tolerable for the treatment of LRTIs and UTIs.

0035436399	Changes in intestinal microflora in patients with chronic severe hepatitis	Objective To investigate changes in intestinal microflora in patients with chronic severe hepatitis (CSH), and their role in this life-threatening disease. Methods We classified nineteen patients with chronic severe hepatitis as the CSH group, thirty patients with chronic hepatitis (CH) as the CH group and thirty-one healthy volunteer as the control group. Fecal flora from all subjects were analyzed. Concentrations of plasma endotoxin, serum cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) and liver function were assessed. Results The number of fecal bifidobacterium (P < 0.001, P < 0.05 respectively), as well as bacteroidaceae ( P < 0.001, P < 0.01 respectively) were significantly deceased in patients with chronic severe hepatitis compared with the CH and control groups, while the number of enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.001, P < 0.05 respectively) and yeasts (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 respectively) were significantly increased. Levels of plasma endotoxin, serum TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and total bilirubin (TBiL) were significantly increased in the CSH group. The concentration of endotoxin positively correlated with levels of both TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and TBiL (P < 0.001, respectively). Levels of plasma endotoxin were positively correlated with the number of fecal enterobacteriaceae and negatively correlated with bifidobacterium ( P < 0.05, P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion Intestinal flora in patients with chronic severe hepatitis were severely disturbed and gut mircobiological colonization resistance was impaired. Changes in intestinal flora may have a pivotal role in both the elevation of plasma endotoxin and further hepatic lesions; resulting in liver failure.

73549088507	Antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates from the Chinese Meropenem Surveillance Study (CMSS), 2003-2008	The Chinese Meropenem Surveillance Study (CMSS) programme was initiated in 2003 with the aim of monitoring the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli in China. From 2003 to 2008, a total of 3892 isolates were collected from 10 teaching hospitals. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 11 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. During the study period, a marked decrease in the susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp. to meropenem and imipenem was noticed, from 94.6% to 60.7% and from 92.5% to 62.1%, respectively. However, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa the susceptibility was relatively stable, with susceptibility rates of 86.2% to 76.0% for meropenem and 74.8% to 70.5% for imipenem. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited the highest activities against enterobacterial organisms, with ranges of MIC

77949658199	Molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Chinese hospitals	We investigated the molecular epidemiology and carbapenem resistance mechanisms of 258 non-duplicate carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from 2006 to 2007 at 28 hospitals in China. Up to 88% of the carbapenem-resistant isolates were multidrug-resistant. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that levels of intrahospital and interhospital dissemination of clones were low. To assess the mechanisms leading to resistance, all 258 carbapenem-resistant isolates were analysed for expression of the chromosomal Î²-lactamase (AmpC), the porin important for entry of carbapenems (OprD) and an efflux system (MexAB-OprM) known to extrude some Î²-lactams. Carbapenem resistance was driven mainly by mutational inactivation of OprD, accompanied or not by hyperexpression of AmpC or MexAB-OprM. Metallo-Î²-lactamase genes were detected in 22 carbapenem-resistant isolates in China, belonging to eight pulsotypes. The bla

77952536690	Clinical and economic outcomes associated with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections caused by extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria in China	Background: To compare clinical and economic outcomes in patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (IAI) due to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing (ESBL-positive) bacteria versus non-ESBL-producing (ESBL-negative) bacteria in China. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review study of patients hospitalized with community-acquired IAI due to ESBL-positive or ESBL-negative infections caused by Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Data were collected from six hospitals in China that participated in the Study for Monitoring Antibiotic Resistance Trends (SMART) during 20062007. Outcomes included clinical response at discharge and following first-line antibiotic, number of antibiotic agents and classes, duration of hospitalization, and overall hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic costs. Results: Of the 85 patients included in the study, 32 (37.6) had ESBL-positive and 53 (62.4) had ESBL-negative infections; E. coli was responsible for 77.6 of infections. Infection resolved at discharge in 30 (93.8) ESBL-positive and 48 (90.6) ESBL-negative patients (PNS). Fewer ESBL-positive patients achieved complete response following first-line antibiotics (56.3 versus 83.0; P=0.01). ESBL-positive patients required longer antibiotic treatment, more antibiotics, longer hospitalization (24.3 versus 14.6 days; 1.67-fold ratio; P0.001), and incurred higher hospitalization costs (Â¥24,604 vs. Â¥13,788; $3604 vs. $2020; 1.78-fold ratio; P<0.001). Conclusions: Patients with ESBL-positive infection had similar resolution rates at discharge compared to those with ESBL-negative infection, despite poorer first-line antibiotic response. However, ESBL-positive infection led to significantly greater hospitalization cost and intravenous antibiotic cost, and longer hospital stay. Â© 2010 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

77952238149	Antimicrobial resistance and molecular characterization of Staphylococcus haemolyticus in a Chinese hospital	The aim of this study was to perform the molecular characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MRSH) from clinical specimens of patients in a Chinese hospital. One hundred and thirty-three strains of S. haemolyticus collected from April 2002 to April 2003 were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents was determined by the broth microdilution method. The resistant rates to penicillin G and oxacillin were higher than 90%. There were no isolates resistant to linezolid or vancomycin, and only 6.0% of the strains were resistant to teicoplanin. The positivity rate for mecA genes was 90.2% by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ninety MRSH (isolated from inpatients and mecA-gene-positive) were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after SmaI digestion. Twenty-five different PFGE patterns (Aâ¼Y) were found and a major clone (type A; n = 36) with five subtypes was identified. Clone A was detected during a 1-year period. Identical PFGE types were found in different wards and patients. The results of this study suggest the clonal spread of MRSH within our hospital. This emphasizes the need for control and prevention measures. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77955293152	Familial syndrome resembling Aarskog syndrome	Aarskog(-Scott) syndrome (AAS) is characterized by short stature, and facial, limb, and genital anomalies. AAS can be an X-linked condition caused by mutations in the FGD1 gene, but there is evidence that an autosomal dominant or recessive form also exists. We report on a Chinese family in whom several members have manifestations of AAS, but differ in limb anomalies and show additional characteristics. FGD1 sequencing and linkage analysis excluded FGD1 as the cause in this family. A common known submicroscopic chromosome imbalance is less likely. Both autosomal dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance remain possible. Â© 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77954921214	An open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in patients with lower respiratory tract infections or urinary tract infections	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in the treatment of patients with community acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) or urinary tract infections (UTIs), a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center study was conducted. Methods: Patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (LUTI), acute pyelonephritis (APN), recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) or complicated UTI were treated by levofloxacin 500 mg tablet once daily. Results: Among the 1 266 patients enrolled, 1 245 were included in full analysis set (FAS) and 1 082 were included in the per protocol set (PPS). The safety analysis population was identical to the FAS population. At test of cure (day 7-14 after the end of treatment) among the PPS population, the clinical efficacy rates of CAP, AECB, LUTI, APN, recurrent UTI and complicated UTI were 96.8% (306/316), 96.0% (360/375), 93.7% (74/79), 98.7% (76/77), 94.9% (93/98) and 96.0% (24/25), respectively. The bacteriological efficacy rates were 98.4% (120/122), 95.1% (136/143), 97.6% (41/42), 94.1% (48/51), 92.3% (24/26) and 81.3% (13/16), respectively. The overall efficacy rates were 91.7% (289/315), 87.2% (328/376), 93.5% (72/77), 89.7% (70/78), 86.7% (85/98) and 69.2% (18/26), respectively. The incidence of drug-related adverse reactions (ADRs) was 17.3% (215/1 245). The most common ADRs were dizziness, nausea and insomnia. The incidence of drug-related laboratory abnormalities was 15.7% (191/1 213) with "WBC decreased", "ALT increased" and "AST increased" being the most frequent. Most events were mild and transient. Only 2.7% of the patients withdrew from the study due to ADRs. No drug-related serious adverse events (SAE) were found. Conclusions: The dosing regimen of levofloxacin 500 mg once daily is effective and tolerable for the treatment of LRTIs and UTIs.

77958017939	CHINET 2009 surveillance of bacterial resistance in China	Objective To investigate the resistance of clinical isolates from hospitals in several regions of China. Methods Twelve general hospitals and two children's hospitals were involved in this program. Bacterial susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2009. Results A total of 43 670 clinical isolates were collected from January to December 2009, of which gram negative organisms and gram positive cocci accounted for 71% and 29% respectively. Methicillin resistant strains in S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) accounted for an average of 52. 7% and 71. 7% respectively. The resistance rates of MR strains to Î² lactams and other antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of MS strains. However, nearly 72% and 65% of MRS A strains were still susceptible to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole and fosfomycin, while 89% and 66% of the MRCNS strains were susceptible to rifampin and fosfomycin. No staphylococcal strain was resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. The resistance rate of E. faecalis strains to most of the drugs tested was much lower than those of E. faecium. Some strains of both E. faecium and E. faecalis were found resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. Most of the vancomycin-resistant strains were Van-A type based on their phenotype. Some linezolid-resistant E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates were first reported in our surveillance. Regarding non-meningitis S. pneumoniae strains, the number of PSSP were less than those isolated in 2008 in children strains, while the number of PRSP increased. Moreover, quinolone-resistant children strains were found for the first time. Strains of Enter- obacteriaceae were still highly susceptible to imipenem and meropenem, the overall resistance rates being less than 2%. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to imipenem and meropenem were 30. 5% and 25. 2% , respectively. The resistance rates of Acinetobacter spp. to the two carbapenems were 50% and 52. 4%. Compared with the data in 2008, the prevalence of pan-drug resistant K. pneumoniae and A. baumanii increased markedly. A few pan-drug resistant strains of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were found for the first time. Conclusions Bacterial resistance is on the rise, especially the incidence of pan-resistant gram negative organisms, which has become a major challenge to medical clinics.

78249245418	Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections in China: The 2002-2009 Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART)	The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and susceptibility of aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in China. From 2002 to 2009, minimum inhibitory concentrations of 14 antibiotics for 3420 aerobic and facultative GNB from up to eight hospitals in six cities were determined by the broth microdilution method. Enterobacteriaceae comprised 82.9% (2834/3420) of the total isolates, with Escherichia coli (49.2%) being the most commonly isolated species followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.0%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and Citrobacter freundii (2.3%). Amongst the antimicrobial agents tested, the three carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem) were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 96.1-99.6% (2002-2009), 98.2-100% (2002-2009) and 99.6-100% (2002-2004), respectively, followed by amikacin (86.8-95.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (84.5-94.3%). Susceptibility rates of all tested third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae declined by nearly 30%, with susceptibility rates of 40.2%, 39.1%, 56.3% and 51.8% in 2009 for ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime, respectively. The occurrence of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases increased rapidly, especially for E. coli (from 20.8% in 2002 to 64.9% in 2009). Susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin decreased from 57.6% in 2002 to 24.2% in 2009. The least active agent against Enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (SAM) (25.3-44.3%). In conclusion, Enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing IAIs, and carbapenems retained the highest susceptibility rates over the 8-year study period. Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and SAM may not be ideal choices for empirical therapy of IAIs in China.

78649953244	CHINET 2009 surveillance of antibiotic resistance in streptococcus spp in China	Objective To investigate the resistance of clinical isolates of Streptococcus isolates collected from 14 hospitals nationwide in 2009 CHINET program. Methods A total of 1 838 Streptococcus isolates were collected from 14 hospitals nationwide during 2009. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to a unified protocol of Kirby-Bauer method (KB) and E-test. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2009 criteria. Results Among the 1 838 strains of Streptococcus, S. pneumoniae accounted for 54.7% (1006/ 1 838), Î²-hemolytic Streptococcus 37.0% (681/1 838), of which group A accounted for 38. 9% , group B 38. 8% , and group C to G together with other unspecified 22. 3%. The isolates of a-hemolytic Streptococcus from sterile body fluids (excluding S. pneumoniae) accounted for 8. 2% (151/ 1 838). The prevalence of penicillin non-susceptible strains PISP and PRSP in the nonmeningitis S. pneumoniae isolates from children and adolescents were 17. 4% and 13. 7% respectively, which were higher than that from adults (3. 8% and 1.2%). The percentage of group A to G of Ã-hemolytic Streptococcus strains resistant to penicillin ranged from 0 to 5. 3%. About 13.2% of a-hemolytic Streptococcus strains were resistant to penicillin, which was higher than other Streptococcus isolates. More than 50% of Streptococcus isolates were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin. AU isolates were highly sensitive to levofloxacin, vancomycin, linezolid, moxifloxacin and meropenem. Conclusions Penicillin is still the first choice for the treatment of the infections caused by Streptococcus isolates (except CNS infections). Streptococcus isolates are still highly resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin in China.

78649957943	CHINET 2009 surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus in China	Objective To investigate the resistance of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus collected from hospitals in several regions of China during 2009. Methods Fourteen representative general hospitals were involved in this program. Bacterial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of a unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method. Results were analyzed according to CLSI 2009 criteria. Results Of the 6 859 clinical staphylococcal isolates, S. aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) accounted for 60. 0% and 40. 0% respectively. CNS strains were isolated from blood or other sterile body fluids, most of which were S. epidermidis (19.8%), S. hominis (7. 4%) and S. haemolyticus (3.6%). The prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains was 52.7% (8. 5%-78.3%) in S. aureus and 71. 7% (45.7%90.1%) in CNS. No vancomycin resistant strains (VISA and VRSA) were found. About 65%-72% of MRSA isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin and SMZ-TMP. About 66. 0% and 89. 0% of MRCNS were still susceptible to fosfomycin and rifampin, respectively. The prevalence and pattern of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus isolates varied greatly with region and hospital. Conclusions MRSA is still an important issue in gram positive cocci. It is a major challenge to medical clinics. A nationwide surveillance of bacterial resistance system by means of a unified protocol and the hospital-specific surveillance data of bacterial resistance are most important and valuable for rational antimicrobial therapy in the corresponding hospital.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-Bauer (KB) according to a unified protocol. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5.4 software according to CLSI 2009 breakpoint. Results A total of 3 769 nonduplicate Enterococcus isolates were collected, including E. faecalis ( n = 1 764, 46. 8 % ), E. faecium ( n = 1 605, 42.6%), E. gallinarum (n = 60, 1.6%) and E. avium (n = 51, 1.4%). Strains of Enterococcus were still highly susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The overall resistant rates were <4%. Only 3 strains were found resistant to linezolid. The percentage of E. faecalis and E. faecium strains resistant to vancomycin were 0. 3% and 3. 5%. About 4. 3%, 11. 3% and 15. 6% of E. faecalis were resistant to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and ampicillin. Forty percent (40%) of E. faecalis isolates were resistant to gentamicin (high level). E. faecium strains were more resistant to most of the antibiotics tested than E. faecalis. More than 90% E. faecium strains were resistant to ampicillin) and nearly 70% resistant to gentamicin (high level), but only 5. 4% resistant to chloramphenicol. The antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus varied widely with region or hospital. Conclusions The increasing prevalence of VRE in some hospitals, especially the emergence of linezolid resistant strains, should be paid serious attention to in clinical and laboratory practice.

Methods Disc diffusion test (Kirby-Bauer method) was employed to study the antimicrobial resistance. WHONET 5. 4 was applied for data analysis. Results A total of 12 548 clinical isolates collected during 2009 were analyzed) including 7 992 strains of E. coli, and 4 556 strains of K. pneumoniae. About 21.3% (1 700/7 992) of E. coli and 19. 0% (865/4 556) of K. pneumoniae were collected from pediatric patients. The total prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains in E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates was 56. 5% and 42. 5% , respectively. The prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains varied with hospital, ranging from 33. 3% to 78. 5% in E. coli, from 19. 4% to 72. 4% in K. pneumoniae. E. coli still showed the lowest resistance (<1%) to imipenem, meropenem or ertapenem, followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam, the resistance rate to which was lower than 6%. K. pneumoniae also showed the lowest resistance to the 3 carbapenem agents. The resistance rates ranged from 2. 9% to 5. 2%, followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam (10. 8%) and piperacillintazobactam (15. 1%). Less than 25% of ESBLs-producing strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were found resistant to the 3 carbapenem agents, cefoperazone-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam. Up to 50% ESBLs-producing strains were resistant to both gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. A total of 132 strains of K. pneumoniae and 20 strains of E. coli, isolated from 10 hospitals, were not susceptible to both imipenem and meropenem. And 103 of the 132 strains of K. pneumoniae and 8 of the 20 strains of E. coli were resistant to all the antimicrobial agents tested. Such pan-resistant strains were mainly found in Shanghai Huashan Hospital. Conclusions Compared with the CHINET data in 2008, carbapenems, cefoperazone-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam are still highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. It is worthy to note that the prevalence of the strains nonsusceptible to carbapenem is increasing rapidly, especially vK. pneumoniae.

78651433165	ST11, the dominant clone of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in China	Objectives: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae has spread rapidly in China. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates in China. Methods: Ninety-five carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from 13 hospitals in nine cities covering five provinces in China were analysed. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the Etest. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and PFGE were used for epidemiological analysis. The genetic structure around blaKPC and the encoding genes of extended-spectrum b-lactamases and plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes were detected by PCR and sequencing. Plasmids were analysed by transformation, restriction and Southern blot. Results: All isolates harboured the blaKPC-2 gene. Seven sequence types (STs) were obtained. The dominant clone was ST11 (61/95), which was identified in isolates from Zhejiang province (four hospitals in Hangzhou and one hospital in Ningbo), Jiangsu province (one hospital in Nanjing) and Anhui province (one hospital in Hefei). Isolates with ST11 showed .80% similarity in PFGE patterns. Plasmids from 14 selected transformants, their original isolates representing different STs and/or regions, had a diversity of HindIII restriction maps. Conclusions: The dominant clone of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in China is ST11, which is closely related to ST258, which has been reported worldwide. Â© The Author 2010.

80052037718	Resistance study of community respiratory pathogens isolated in China from 2005 to 2007	Objective: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of community respiratory pathogens isolated in China. Methods: The strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, S. pyogenes were isolated from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections at 14 Chinese hospitals from 2005 to 2007.Etest and disk diffusion methods were used to survey the susceptibility of 14 antibiotics against these strains. These antibiotics included penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefprozil, ceftriaxone, cefepime, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT). Results: A total of 1870 strains were collected including S. pneumoniae (n = 997), S. pyogenes (n = 176), H. influenzae (n = 499) and M. catarrhalis (n = 198). The 2005-2007 prevalence of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) were 92.6%, 73.9%, 74.1% and penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) 4.5%, 9.5%, 14.3% and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 2.9%, 16.6%, 11.6% respectively. 36.9% of S. pneumoniae strains isolated from â¤ 6 years old children were penicillin-non-susceptive isolates (PNSSP) and < 22.0% of PNSSP isolated from other age groups. The susceptible rates of Î²-lactamase antibiotics to PRSP and PISP isolates were less than 25.0% and 49.2% respectively. From 48.5% to 98.6% PSSP isolates were susceptible to Î²-lactamase antibiotics. The susceptible rates of PNSSP and PSSP to erythromycin, tetracycline and SXT were below 7.1% and 32.1% respectively. About 95% S. pneumoniae were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin. All of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to Î²-lactamase antibiotics, and 16.7%, 27.1% and 15.6% Of S. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to erythromycin. 8.5%, 19.9%, 15.3% of H. influenzae and 57.4%, 78.8%, 95.5% of M. catarrhalis produced Î²-lactamase during the 3-year period. The susceptible rates of cefepime, ceftriaxone, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxcin to H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were â¥ 92.9%. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae is rising. The prevalence of PNSSP isolated from children â¤ 6 years old is higher than other age groups. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin remain highly active against common community respiratory pathogens.

80052849429	Genomic analysis of the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain MDR-ZJ06 widely spread in China	We previously reported that the multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii strain MDR-ZJ06, belonging to European clone II, was widely spread in China. In this study, we report the whole-genome sequence of this clinically important strain. A 38.6-kb AbaR-type genomic resistance island (AbaR22) was identified in MDR-ZJ06. AbaR22 has a structure similar to those of the resistance islands found in A. baumannii strains AYE and AB0057, but it contained only a few antibiotic resistance genes. The region of resistant gene accumulation as previously described was not found in AbaR22. In the chromosome of the strain MDR-ZJ06, we identified the gene bla

80053367332	Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Asia: Report from the Community-Acquired Respiratory Tract Infection Pathogen Surveillance (CARTIPS) study, 2009-2010	A multicentre resistance surveillance study [Community-Acquired Respiratory Tract Infection Pathogen Surveillance (CARTIPS)] investigating the susceptibilities of 2963 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus spp. from Asia against 12 antimicrobial agents was undertaken from 2009 to 2010. Based on the breakpoints for oral penicillin V recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSSP) ranged from 46% to 100%. Azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited variable resistance rates of 0-88% against S. pneumoniae, 0-57% against MSSA and 0-76.5% against Streptococcus spp. isolates. The prevalence of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae varied from 5.1% to 58.5%. Î²-Lactamase production rates amongst H. influenzae isolates ranged from 15% to 46.6% and amongst M. catarrhalis isolates from 90% to 100%. Amongst M. catarrhalis isolates, macrolide resistance and cefaclor resistance rates of 5.8% and 1.2%, respectively, were found, mainly in Mainland China.

84858987570	Surveillance of antimicroabial resistance in gram-positive cocci isolated from 12 teaching hospitals in China during the period from June to December 2010	Objective To investigate the antimicrobial resistance among the gram-positive cocci isolated form 12 teaching hospitals in China. Methods from June 2010 to December 2010, 1 181 Strains of consecutive and nonduplicate grampositive cocci were collected from 12 teaching hospitals in 9 cities across China. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents were determined by agar dilution method and the rate of resistance was calculated. Results The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Sta phylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was 40.6% (191/470) and 79.6% (187/236), respectively. The prevalence of MRSA ranged from 22.2% to 72.7% in different specimens. The prevalence of MRSA in ICU was 71.4%, higher than that in general inpatients and outpatients. All staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. The MICs of tigecycline against these staphylococcal isolates were 0.032 - 0.5 mg/L. Ten strains of E. faecium and 2 strains of E. faecalis were resistant to vancomycin. All E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. About 98.3% of E. faecalis strains and 100% of E. faecium strains were susceptible to linezolid. The prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was 6.0% (14/232). The prevalence of PRSP was 13.8% (9/65) in the strains isolated from children under 5, and 5.1% (3/59) in the strains isolated from old people above 65. All S. pneumoniae strains were susceptible to teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid and tigecycline. Conclusions The prevalence of MRSA in ICU was higher than that in general inpatients and outpatients. MRSA strains were mainly from respiratory specimens and pus. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was rarely identified, and most of the VRE strains were E. faecium. The prevalence of PRSP in the strains isolated from children under 5 was higher than in other age groups. Teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline showed high in vitro activity against Staphylococcus, E. faecalis, E. faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

84858991088	CHINET 2010 surveillance of antibiotic resistance in stenotrophomonas MaltoPhilia in China	Objective To investigate the resistance of clinical Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from 14 hospitals in several regions of China during 2010. Methods Fourteen representative general hospitals were involved in this program. Bacterial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of unified protocol using Kirby-Bauer method and MIC determination. The results were analyzed according to CLSI 2010 breakpoints. Results Most (97.5%) of the 1 661 clinical strains of S. maltophilia were i-solated from inpatients. Only 42 (2.5%) isolates were from outpatients. About 68.3% of the strains were isolated from the elderly patients (â¥60 years of age). Only 4.8% of the strains were from patients under 18 years old. Most (83.0%) isolates were from sputum and respiratory tract secretions, followed by blood, abdominal fluid and other sterile body fluids (4.7%). The percentage of S. maltophilia resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, levofloxacin, minocycline and cefoperazone-sulbactam was 11.2%, 10.7%, 3.4%, and 13.8%, respectively. About 21.6% and 33.3% of the strains isolated from urine were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cefoperazone-sulbac-tam, significantly higher than the isolates from other specimens (P<0. 01). Conclusions S. maltophilia was mainly isolated from the sputum of inpatients of 60 years or older. The organism was inherently resistant to most antibacterial agents, but less resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline, the antibiotics recommended by CLSI. Cefoperazone-sulbactam also shows good in vitro activity against these organisms. The surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is very important for guiding rational antimicrobial therapy, especially for the nosocomial infections.

84859620890	Novel vancomycin-resistance transposon, plasmid replicon types, and virulence factors of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci in Zhejiang, China	Forty-seven vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains were isolated from clinical samples in 13 Zhejiang hospitals and fecal samples from ICU patients in a large teaching hospital in China. No VRE isolates were detected in healthy human subjects. CC17 was the main clonal complex in clinical Enterococcus faecium isolates but not in isolates from healthy human subjects. Novel vancomycin-resistance transposons were detected among VRE strains. This is the first report demonstrating insertion of tnpA and fosB genes in the vanRS-vanH intergenic region of Tn1546 leading to coresistance to vancomycin and fosfomycin. The four plasmid replicon types (pRUM, pRE25, pEF418, and pB82) were more common in VRE isolates, suggesting their association with vancomycin resistance and nosocomial transmission. The prevalence rate of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-related Inc18-like plasmid, pIP501, in VRE was 21.3%. The prevalence of the esp gene among VRE isolates was high (76.6%). In several VRE strains, the esp and hyl genes were cotransferred with the vanA gene by conjugation. Although the frequency of VRE is low in Chinese hospitals, its association with virulence determinants, the vancomycin- resistance transposon with other resistance gene insertions or plasmids may lead to multidrug resistance and the evolution of pathogenic VRE.

84861188148	In vitro activity of cefditoren and other comparators against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections in China	The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of cefditoren and comparators against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs). A total of 391 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 266 H. influenzae, and 76 M. catarrhalis were isolated from 10 centers located at 6 cities in China from January 2009 to May 2010. The microdilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The pneumococci comprised 189 (48.3%) penicillin susceptible, 129 (33.0%) penicillin intermediate, and 73 (18.7%) penicillin resistant. Moxifloxacin and levofloxacin showed the highest activity (99.2% and 97.7%, respectively) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by parenteral penicillin G (95.7%), cefditoren (83.1%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (79.3%). Among the 266 H. influenzae isolates, 26 (9.8%) were ampicillin-resistant Î²-lactamase-producing strains and 24 (9.0%) were ampicillin-resistant Î²-lactamase-nonproducing strains (BLNAR). Most of antimicrobial agents demonstrated good activity (>97% susceptibility) against H. influenzae except ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cefaclor, which showed relatively lower activity (81.2%, 88.7%, and 88%, respectively). Cefditoren showed excellent activity with the lowest MIC

84861200072	Antimicrobial resistance trends among 5608 clinical Gram-positive isolates in China: Results from the Gram-Positive Cocci Resistance Surveillance program (2005-2010)	A total of 5608 clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria were collected from 12 teaching hospitals across China from 2005 to 2010. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 19 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method at the central laboratory. Overall, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRSCoN) were 46.8% and 81.5%, respectively. Isolates from inpatients exhibited a higher rate of MRSA than that from outpatients (52.3% versus 26.2%, P < 0.001). The prevalence of MRSA in respiratory infections (67.5%) was higher than in other sources of infections (P < 0.001). A shift in vancomycin MICs from <0.5 to 1.0 Î¼g/mL was observed during the 6-year period. In 2005, 70.5% of S. aureus isolates were inhibited at the vancomycin MIC of 0.5 Î¼g/mL, while in 2010, 89% of the isolates were inhibited at the vancomycin MIC of 1 Î¼g/mL. With the use of penicillin oral breakpoints, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) increased from 28.6% in 2005 to 59.5% in 2010 and varied among different age groups, with an average rate of 70.6% for children under 5 years old. Importantly, an obvious penicillin MIC right shift was observed from 0.032 to 4 Î¼g/mL during the study period. Serotyping for the isolates from 2005 and 2010 indicated that the high rate of PRSP could be due to the increased prevalence of serogroup 19. The prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) increased from 0 in 2005 to 4.9% in 2010. Of the 27 VRE isolates, vanA gene was the most prevalent gene. During the study period, 97.9-100% of different species tested were susceptible to teicoplanin. Linezolid and tigecycline showed potent activities, and no resistant isolate was identified. In conclusion, although the prevalence of MRSA and MRSCoN remained stable over the 6 years, a sharp increase in the prevalence of PRSP was identified. In addition, MIC shifts, including the MICs of penicillin against S. pneumoniae and vancomycin against S. aureus, were observed. Continuous surveillance is warranted to evaluate the resistance trend of clinically important Gram-positive organisms in the future. Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862510396	CHINET 2010 surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis in China	Objective To investigate the antibiotic resistance of clinical strains of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MC) isolated from different regions in china during 2010. Methods Clinical strains of HI and MC were collected from 9 general hospitals and 2 children's hospitals. Kirby-Bauer method and agar dilution method were used to determine the susceptibilities of these strains. Results were analyzed according to the CLSI 2010 breakpoints. Beta-lactamases were detected by nitrocefin disk test. Results Among the 734 clinical strains of HI, the resistance rate to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin was 64.5%, 31.7%, 14.5%, 12.5% and 14.2%, respectively. About 90% of these HI strains were still susceptible to cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, azithromycin, or cefuroxime. The resistance rate to ampicillin and the prevalence of Î²-lactamases in the HI strains from children (35.1%, 30.1%) were higher than in the strains from adults (26.6% and 24.1 %). The resistance rate to ciprofloxacin was 4.0% in the HI strains from children, significantly lower than in the strains from adults (17.0%, P<0.05). The overall prevalence of Î²-lactamases was 28.1 % in the HI strains. There are 39 HI strains resistant to ampicillin but Î²-lactamase negative. The 214 clinical strains of MC kept highly susceptible to second and third cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, levofloxacin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96.7%-100%). About 45.1 % of these MC strains were resistant to azithromycin. The prevalence of Î²-lactamases was 96.7 % in these MC strains. Conclusions HIand MC are stably susceptible to cephalosporins, beta-lactam-lactamase inhibitor combinations as well as quinolones. Production of (3-lactamase is still the major mechanism of ampicillin resistance in these two bacterial species. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the Î²-lactamase-negative and ampicillin resistant strains.

84862528540	CHINET 2010 surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Enterobacter spp. in China	UDjecuve 10 investigate tne ctistriDution ana antibiotic resistance of clinical Enterobacter isolates. Methods A total of 1 961 clinical strains of Enterobacter spp. were collected from 14 hospitals during January 1 through December 31, 2010. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with Kirby-Bauer method or determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. The results were analyzed according to CLSI 2010 standards. Results The main source of isolates was sputum (n = 1 146, 58.4%) and urine (n = 229, 11.7%), blood (n = 108, 5.5%), and others (n = 478, 24.4%). The resistance rate of Enterobacter strains was the highest to ampicillin, cefazolin and cefoxitin (>93%), relatively higher to ceftazidime and cefotaxime (38.6% and 51.2%, respectively), and relatively lower to piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, cefoperazone-sulbactam, ertapenem, amikacin, or ciprofloxacin (generally <20%), and the lowest to imipenem and meropenem (5.2% and 4.8%, respectively). The resistance rate varied with hospitals and theclinical setting (inpatients or outpatients). Eight strains were identified as pan-drug resistant including resistance to carbapen-em antibiotics. Conclusions Antibiotic resistance in clinical Enterobacter isolates is serious in China. Every hospital should take effective control measures to curb the growth of resistant strains.

84862539749	CHINET surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Klebsiella spp. during 2010	Objective To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of Klebsiella spp. strains isolated from 14 hospitals infmitted to China CHINET in 2010. Methods Disc diffusion test (Kirby-Bauer method) and automatic microbiology analysis system were employed to study the antimicrobial resistance. WHONET 5.4 was used for data analysis according to 2010 CLSI breakpoints. Results A total of 5 461 clinical isolates were analyzed during 2010, including 5 032 strains of K. pneumoniae and 432 strains of K. oxytoca. About 19.4% (1 058/5 461) of the Klebsiella strains were collected from children. About 62.4% of the strains were isolated from respiratory tract specimens. All the isolates kept the lowest resistance to imipenem, meropenem or er-tapenem (about 10%), followed by cefoperazone-sulbactam (14.8%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (16.7%). A total of 508 strains of K. pneumoniae and 31 strains of K. oxytoca were resistant to imipenem and/or meropenem. Such carbapenem-resistant strains were identified in all the 14 hospitals. Furthermore, 221 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of K. oxytoca were pan-drug resistant, which were mainly found in the two hospitals located in Eastern China. Conclusions Car-bapenems, cefoperazone-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam remain active against Klebsiella spp. The carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella strains are emerging in Eastern China. More efforts should be taken to control the superbugs.

84862551978	Mechanisms of cefditoren-resistance in the strains of streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from community-acquired respiratory tract infections	Objective To study the mechanisms of cefditoren-resistance in the clinical strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methods Thirt -seven strains of S. pneumoniae with cefditoren MICs of â¥1 mg/L were isolated from community-acquired respiratory tract infections in 10 teaching hospitals from January 2009 to January 2010. Six strains of S. pneumoniae with cefditoren MICs of â¤0.5 mg/L were collected as control group. Broth microdilution method was used to determine the MICs of penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefditoren, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and vancomycin. Multiplex-PCR was used to determine the serotypes of all the test isolates. PCR was used to amplify the genes of pbp2b, pbpla, pbp2x and murM in 43 clinical isolates. PCR products were digested by restriction enzyme to analyze the DNA fingerprints. One to five PCR products exhibiting the same DNA fingerprint pattern were sequenced. Amino acid sequences were then compared to the sequence of S. pneumoniae strain R6 to analyze the mutations in the conserved motifs of PBP genes, especially for SXXK box, SXN box and KT(S)G box. Results Isolates were divided into three groups according to the susceptibility profile: CI group included 3 strains which were susceptible to penicillin and with cefditoren WIC ofâ¤0.5 mg/L; C2 group included 3 strains which were intermediate to penicillin and with cefditoren WIC ofâ¤0.5 mg/L; R group included 37 strains which were intermediate to penicillin and with cefditoren MIC of 1-4 mg/L. Isolates from group R were all susceptible to levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and vancomycin, and resistant to cefuroxime, cefaclor, azithromycin and clarithromycin. Only 8.2% and 5.4% of the isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone, separately. The serotyping results indicated that 37 isolates of group R included 35 isolates with type 19F, 1 with type 14 and 1 with type 19A The conserved motifs of PBPs in CI group had no mutations when compared with R6. However, the conserved motifs of PBPs in C2 group isolates had following common mutations: Thr445âAla in PBP2B, Thr371âSer/Ala and Pro432âThr in PBPlA, Thr338âAla and Leu546âVal in PBP2X. For group R, additional mutations of Ala618âGly in PBP2B, Met339âPhe and Tyr595âPhein PBP2X were found in addition to the mutations in group C2. Conclusions The mutations of PBP2B, PBPlA and PBP2X have close relationship to cefditoren-resistance in S. pneumoniae. Ala618âGly in PBP2B, Met339âPhe and Tyr595âPhe in PBP2X may be highly related to the increasing cefditoren MICs.

Methods According to the study protocol, a total of 1 35 7 nonduplicate nosocomial strains of Enterobacteriaceae were collected and sent to the central lab for re-identification and susceptibility testing. The minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) of 15 antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution method. WHONET 5. 6 software was used to analyze the data. Results The antimicrobial agents exhibiting high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis included meropenem(to which 97.6%-100% of the strains were susceptible), panipenem(79.8 %-98.4%), imipenem(64.9 %-98.1 %), ertapenem(91.3 %-97.4%), piperacillin-tazobactam(87.2%-97.4%), cefmetazole(82.l%-97.0%) and amikacin(89.9%-93.8%). Meropenem(to which 98.7% of the strains were susceptible), panipenem(96.4%), imipenem(95.4%) and amikacin(85.7%) were highly active against Enterobacter spp. Carbapenems(92.0%-100%), piperacillin-tazobactam(93.l%-99.1%), amikacin(89.0%-94.3%) and cefepime(86.2%-93.1 %) displayed high activity against Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marces-cens. Conclusions Carbapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin remain highly active against nosocomial strains of Enterobacteriaceae, while cefmetazole exhibited high activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis isolates.

84862571921	CHINET 2010 surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa	Objective to investigate the antimicrobial resistance of P. aeruginosa in China during 2010. Methods Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected from 14 teaching hospitals in China. The antimicrobial susceptibility were tested by Kirby-Bauer method and MIC determination. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5.4 software. Results Of the 5 080 clinical strains of P. aeruginosa, 91.2% were isolated from hospitalized patients, and 69.9% were isolated from ret tory tract. These P. aeruginosa isolates showed the lowest resistance rate (15.3%) to amikacin. The percentage of tr aeruginosa isolates resistant to other antimicrobial agents was generally above 18%. The P. aeruginosa strains collected Kunming Hospital showed the highest resistance rate to 13 of the 14 antimicrobial agents compared with the strains from hospitals. More than 28% of the isolates from Kunming Hospital were resistant to any of the antimicrobial agents tested. than 40% of the strains isolated from a Beijing hospital were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents tested. The islates collected from a hospital in Gansu Province were less resistant (<20%) to any of the antibiotics except cefoperazone and onam. For the strains from Shanghai Children's Hospital, the resistance rate to any of the antimicrobial agents was lower 5%. The resistance of P. aeruginosa strains from ICU was significantly higher than the resistance of the strains as a w The panresistant (only sensitive to colistin) P. aeruginosa strains accounted for 1.7% on average. Conclusions The antin bial resistance of P. aeruginosa is still a serious problem in China, but shows slight downward trend. The antimicrobial ceptibility pattern varied greatly with the hospital, and geographical region. ICUs are the focus of interest for resistance taring and control. The surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is very important for guiding rational antimicrobial thera healthcare facilities.

Methods Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and Staphylococcus protein A gene (spa) typing were used to type the 114 strains of MRSA. The lukS gene encoding Panton - Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was detected. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method. Results Among the 114 strains, eight MLST-spa molecular types were identified, of which ST239-t030, ST239-t037 and ST5- t002 were the most predominant types, accounting for 41.2%, 28.8% and 21.9%, respectively. Only one MRSA strain was lukS positive. Vancomycin and tigecycline were most active against all the MRSA strains tested (100%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (86.8%). The major molecular types, ST239-t030, ST239-t037 and ST5-t002, were found with similar susceptibility patterns. However, all strains resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were identified as ST239-t037. Conclusions The prevalence of MRSA in China is predominated by several major molecular clones, which is consistent with the situation in surrounding countries or regions.

84863763681	Trends in computed tomography utilization and association with hospital outcomes in a chinese emergency department	Background: Excessive use of computed tomography (CT) in emergency departments (EDs) has become a concern due to its expense and the potential risks associated with radiation exposure. Although studies have shown a steady increase in the number of CT scans requested by ED physicians in developed countries like the United States and Australia, few empirical data are available regarding China. Methods and Findings: We retrospectively analyzed a database of ED visits to a tertiary Chinese hospital to examine trends in CT utilization and their association with ED outcomes between 2005 and 2008. A total of 197,512 ED visits were included in this study. CT utilization increased from 9.8% in 2005 to 13.9% in 2008 (P<.001 for trend). The ED length of stay for visits with CT utilization was 0.6 hour longer than those in which CT was not obtained. CT utilization increased the ED cost by an average $48.2. After adjustment for patients' demographics, arrival hours and clinical condition, CT utilization during ED visits was significantly associated with high ED cost (Odds Ratio [OR]: 21.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 17.00-27.71), long ED length of stay (OR: 1.22; 95%CI, 1.12-1.34), and more likely to receive emergency operations (OR: 2.31; 95%CI, 1.94-2.76). However, there was no significant correlation between CT use and the possibility to be admitted to inpatient wards (OR: 0.82; 95%CI, 0.65-1.04). With respect to the time-related trends, CT utilization during ED visits in all study years was significantly associated with high ED cost and more likely to receive emergency operations. Conclusion: CT utilization was associated with higher ED cost, longer ED length of stay and more likely to receive emergency operations, but did not correlate with a significant change in the admission rate.

84866068259	An uncontrolled open-label, multicenter study to monitor the antiviral activity and safety of inhaled zanamivir (as rotadisk via diskhaler device) among chinese adolescents and adults with influenza-like illness	Background It is the first multicenter clinical study in China to investigate zanamivir use among Chinese adolescents and adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) since 2009, when inhaled zanamivir (RELENZAÂ®) was marketed in China. Methods An uncontrolled open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the antiviral activity, and safety of inhaled zanamivir (as Rotadisk via Diskhaler device); 10 mg administered twice daily for 5 days in subjects â¥12 years old with ILI. Patients were enrolled within 48 hours of onset and followed for eight days. Patients were defined as being influenza-positive if the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test had positive results. Results A total of 400 patients â¥12 years old were screened from 11 centers in seven provinces from March 2010 to January 2011. Three hundred and ninety-two patients who took at least one dose of zanamivir were entered into the safety analysis. The mean age was 33.8 years and 50% were male. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. All the reported adverse events, such as rash, nasal ache, muscle ache, nausea, diarrhea, headache, occurred in less than 1% of subjects. Mild sinus bradycadia or arrhythmia occurred in four subjects (1%). Most of the adverse events were mild and did not require any change of treatment. No severe adverse events (SAE) or fatal cases were reported. Bronchospasm was found in a 38 years old woman whose symptoms disappeared after stopping zanamivir and without additional treatment. All the 61 influenza virus isolates (43 before enrollment, 18 during treatment) proved to be sensitive to zanamivir.

0036806095	Epidemiological and antibiotic resistant study on extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in Zhejiang Province	Objective To investigate the epidemiological status of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and the drug resistance profiles of such organisms. Methods A total of 282 clinical isolates of E. coli and 180 of K. pneumoniae were collected from different districts of Zhejiang Province. Inhibitor potentiated broth dilution tests were performed for detecting extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases. Etests were performed to detect the drug resistance of these strains against nine commonly used antibiotics. Results The prevalence of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 34.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The average prevalence of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 35.7%. The resistance prevalence of extended spectrum Î²-lactamase producing strains to ceftazidime and cefotaxime was 40% and 26% respectively, so were those to cefepime, cefoxitin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. All these strains were sensitive to imipenem. Conclusion The results in this study showed that the prevalence of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases was high, while extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase producing strains were resistant to most antimicrobial agents except imipenem.

84874988510	Study on the antibiotic resistance, homology of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from older	Objective: To identify the antibiotic resistance, homology of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from older in Zhejiang Hospital and the carbapenemases determinants of imipenem-resistant strains. Methods: Two hundred and sixty-two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated through May 2006 to May 2009 from older in Zhejiang Hospitals. K-B method was used to determine the 16 antimicrobial agents resistance of these 262 strains. The MICs of strains to 14 antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution and E test method. The coding sequence of Metallo-Î²-lactamases (MBL) were amplified, PCR products were purified, cloned and sequenced. The homology of these isolates was analyzed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: One hundred and four strains of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were screened from 262 strains. The resistant rates of 104 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ampicillin/sulbactam and cefoperazone/sulbactam were 78.9% and 35.9%; polymyxin E had a minimal resistance of 6.0%; minocycline had a resistance rate of 58.3%. The resistant rates to other antimicrobial agents were more than 70.0%. Twelve imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains contained MBL gene and two kinds of integron were detected from 10 of these 12 strains. Twelve strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa belonged to 5 epidemic PFGE-clone. Conclusion: All of the imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa which had cause outbreaks in Zhejiang Hospital. MBL were not the most popular gene type. All of the MBL gene types were VIM-2. The bla

84878659762	A Chinese patient with KBG syndrome and a 9q31.2-33.1 microdeletion	KBG syndrome is characterized by postnatal short stature, macrodontia, facial and hand anomalies, delayed bone age and intellectual disability. KBG syndrome is an infrequently reported autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation or haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11 at 16q24.3. We report on a patient, who showed many manifestations of KBG syndrome and was found to harbor a de novo ANKRD11 mutation, c.362T > A (p.Met121Lys). As the patient showed additional characteristics not occurring in KBG syndrome, a CGH array was performed which showed a de novo microdeletion of 9q31.2-q33.1. The majority of findings in our patient can be explained by the combined ANKRD11 mutation and 9q31.2-33.1 deletion. The case demonstrates well the need for comparing an abnormal genotype with a detailed phenotype analysis and the need for further studies in case the phenotype is unusual for the genotype. Â© 2013.

84879168624	Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from 13 teaching hospitals across China	Objective: To explore the antimicrobial resistance of nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli across China. Methods: A total of 1247 consecutive and non-repetitive Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from 13 Chinese teaching hospitals from March to August 2012. All isolates were sent to a central laboratory for reidentification and susceptibility testing. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of meropenem and other antibacterial agents were determined by agar dilution method. And the data were analyzed with WHONET-5.6 software. Results: The activity of antimicrobial agents against Enterobacteriaceae was in the following descending order of susceptibility rate: meropenem(97.5%, 849/871), amikacin(94.5%, 823/871), imipenem(93.6%, 815/871), ertapenem (92.9%, 809/871), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.9%, 783/871), cefoperazone/sulbactam (83.5%, 727/871), cefepime (78.1%, 680/871), polymyxin B (77.0%, 670/871), cefiazidime (69.6%, 606/871), levofloxacin (69.2%, 603/871), ciprofloxacin (63.6%, 554/871), minocyline (63.1%, 550/871), ceftriaxone (55.7%, 485/871), cefotaxime (54.2%, 472/871) and cefoxitin (51.4%, 448/871). The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was 64.3% (117/182) in Escherichia coli(E. coli) and 32.1% (60/187) in Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumoniae). The sensitivities of E. coli to meropenem and imipenem were 100%. And over 90% of E. coli was sensitive to ertapenem, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and polymyxin B. However, over 60% of E. coli was resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. The susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to meropenem, imipenem, amikacin and polymyxin B maintained at over 90%. The activities of antimicrobial agents against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes and Citrobacter freundii were in the following descending order of susceptibility rate: meropenem (96.0% - 100%), imipenem (96.0%-100%), polymyxin B (95.8% - 100%), amikacin (92.2% - 100%), ertapenem (85.6% - 93.3%), cefepime (77.8% - 93.3%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (78.4% - 90.0%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (65.0% -89.8%). The most susceptible agent against Acinetobacter baumannii(A. baumannii) was polymyxin B(100%). The susceptibilities of A. baumannii to imipenem, meropenem and minocyline were 37.8% (65/172), 36.0% (62/172) and 62.8% (108/172) respectively. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) were polymyxin B (97.2%, 173/178), followed by amikacin (89.3%, 159/178) and cefiazidime (83.7%, 149/178). Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute revised P. aeruginosa susceptibility standard in 2012. The sensitivity of piperacillin/tazobactam changed from 83.7% (149/178) to 77.5% (138/178). The sensitivity of meropenem decreased from 78.1% (139/178) to 71.3% (127/178) while that of imipenem declined from 69.7% (124/178) to 59.6% (106/178). The prevalence of multi-drug resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were 65.7% (113/172) and 9.0% (16/178) respectively. Conclusions: Carbapenems remain highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. Increasing resistance of A. baumanni to all antimicrobial agents is noted. New breakpoint to P. aeruginosa has obvious effects on antimicrobial sensitivity.

84881577130	A 10 year surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in community- and hospitalassociated intra-abdominal infections in China	The objective of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of hospital-associated (HA) and community-associated (CA) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in China. From 2002 to 2011, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 12 antibiotics against 3074 E. coli and 1025 K. pneumoniae from 23 centres located in 16 cities were determined by the broth microdilution method. During the 10 year study period, ertapenem, imipenem, amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam retained high and stable activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates regardless of whether their source was HA or CA and regardless of their extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. However, the susceptibility of E. coli to cephalosporins and ampicillin-sulbactam decreased dramatically during the 10 years, especially for the CA isolates. Fluoroquinolones showed low activity against E. coli. During the whole study period, the ESBL rates for E. coli isolates from IAIs increased from 36.1 % in 2002-2003 to 68.1 % in 2010-2011 (P<0.001). Correspondingly, the ESBL rates in HA isolates increased from 52.2 % in 2002-2003 to 70.0 % in 2010-2011 (P = 0.001), and in CA isolates from 19.1 % in 2002-2003 to 61.6 % in 2010-2011 (P<0.001). The ESBL-positive rate in K. pneumoniae remained between 30.1 and 39.3 % of the total isolates with no significant change during the 10 years. In conclusion, carbapenems retained the highest susceptibility rates against HA and CA E. coli and K. pneumoniae. High prevalence of ESBL in HA E. coli and fast-growing resistance in CA E. coli severely limit the empirical use of the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins in the therapy of IAIs.

84881227454	Molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of 50 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated	Objective To investigate the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from Beijing Electric Power Hospital during the period from October 2009 to March 2010. Methods A total of 50 S. aureus isolates were collected and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Staphylococcus protein A gene (spa) typing and detection of the lukS gene encoding PVL. In addition, SCCmec typing was performed for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The antimicrobial activities of 14 agents including ceftaroline and tigecycline against MRSA isolates were further determined by agar dilution method. Results Thirty-three strains were identified as MRSA among the 50 S. aureus isolates, including one CA-MRSA. Six clone typeswere recognized from these MRSA strains. ST239-t030-III was the predominant type. Prevalence of an unusual molecular type, ST239-t2270-III, was observed. In comparison, no significant clonal spread was detected in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Glycopeptides and tigecycline showed potent activity against MRSA. The lukS gene was only identified in the CA-MRSA isolate, which showed the drug resistant pattern different from HA-MRSA. Conclusions Unlike MSSA, MRSA showed clustered clonal types, suggesting a nosocomial spread in hospital. The most common molecular clone identified in this hospital was ST239-t030-H, which is consistent with the overall situation in China.

84881623163	A surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance of gram-positive cocci strains isolated from 16 teaching hospitals in China in 2012	Objective: To investigate antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive cocci strains in China in 2012. Methods: From June 2012 to December 2012, 1790 consecutive and non-repetitive gram-positive cocci strains were collected from 16 teaching hospitals. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial drugs were determined by agar dilution method. A retrospective study was conducted on the rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents. Data was analyzed using chi-square test. Results: The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCoNS) were 43.6% (264/605) and 75.7% (227/300), respectively. The prevalence of MRSA ranged from 20.5% to 60.9% in different regions. About 54.4% (106/195) of Staphylococcus aureus from respiratory tract specimens, 43.6% (58/133) of Staphylococcus aureus from blood samples, and 29.8% (56/188) of Staphylococcus aureus from wound and pus were resistant to methicillin. The prevalence of MRSA in elder patient group (53.9%, 110/204) was higher than that in the younger adult patients (41.4%, 149/360) (P < 0.05). The susceptible rates of MRSA to chloramphenicol and SXT were 92.4% (244/264) and 89.8% (237/264), respectively. Susceptibility of MRSA to gentamycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracyclines, rifampicin and quinolones were ranged from 12.5% to 51.9%. One vancomy-cin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) was found in this study. All Staphylococci isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline. The prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) in children below 3 years-old (61.2%, 49/80) was higher than that in adult patients (40.2%, 90/224) (P < 0.05). About 93.6% (292/312) and 86.2% (269/312) of S. pneumonia were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. Penicillin still showed a very high activity against Streptococcus spp. Î²-Hemolytic group, but more than 60% of Streptococcus spp. Î²-hemolytic group were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracyclines. Four vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) strains were found in this study. All Enterococcus isolates were susceptible to daptomycin and tigecycline, and 96.9% (157/162) of E. faecalis and 99.3% (150/151) of E. faecium were susceptible to linezoild. About 51.9% (84/162) of E. faecalis and 61.6% (93/151) of E. faecium were resistant to high concentration gentamycin. The susceptibility of E. faecalis to all antibiotics except chloramphenicol and tetracycline was higher than that of E. faecium. Conclusion: The rates of antimicrobial resistance of Gram-positive cocci are different among strains isolated from different age groups or regions. Teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin showed very high activity against Gram-positive cocci. Copyright Â© 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84881257476	CHINET 2010 surveillance and analysis of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus spp. in China	Objective To investigate the antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of Stapylococcus collected from hospitals in several regions of China. Methods Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted in 14 general hospitals of China according to a unified protocol. Results Of the 7 530 clinical isolates of Stapylococcus, S. aureos and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) accounted for 59.1% and 40.9%, respectively. The major CNS species were S. epidermidis (21.6%), S. hominis (7.3%) and S. haemolyticus (4.5%), mainly isolated from blood and sterile body fluids. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains was 51.7% (11.5% to 77. 6%) in S. aureus and 74.8% (62.7% to 95.5%) in CNS. About 60% of the MRSA strains were susceptible to fosfomycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. About 68.7 % and 87.8 % of the MRCNS strains were still susceptible to fosfomycin and rifampin, respectively. The prevalence of MRSA and MRCNS in ICU was the highest. No glycopeptides- or linezolid- resistant strains were identified. Conclusions MRSA and MRCNS was relatively prevalent in the hospital setting of China, espicially in the specill units of some hospitals. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus varied widely with geographical regions and hospitals. More attention should be paid to the detection of hVISA and VRSA.

84881268321	Tigecycline treatment of infection caused by KPC-producing Escherichia coli in a pediatric patient	Tigecycline shows great antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and has been considered to be an appropriate choice in controlling infection caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, such as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). Although many clinical trials evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline on adults, rare reports recommend tigecycline to treat pediatric patient. In this study, we presented a clinical case with tigecycline as an anti-infectious agent on a 14-year-old child who was suffering from infection of intraperitoneal abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC)-producing Escherichia coli with extreme drug resistant profile. By accessing the clinical outcome and efficacy of the patient, and the side effects of tigecycline, our research explored the documented experience of tigecycline on controlling infection caused by CPE isolate in children.

84881366033	2011 CHINET surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa across China	Objective To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of P. aeruqinosa clinical isolates across China during 2011. Methods Clinical isolates of P. aeruqinosa were collected from 15 teaching hospitals across China. Antimicrobial susceptibility were tested by Kirby-Bauer method or automated systems. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5. 6 software. Result Of the 6 012 clinical P. aeruqinosa isolates, 92.9% were isolated from hospitalized patients, and 73.7% were from respiratory tract. The P. aeruqinosa isolates showed the lowest resistance rate (14.3%) to amikacin. More than 30% of the P. aeruqinosa strains were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents tested in the hospital where P. aeruqinosa strains showed the highest resistance. In the hospital where P. aerugnosa strains showed the lowest resistance, less than 20% of the P. aeruginosa steins were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents. Less than 17% of the P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to any of the antimicrobial agents tested in the two Children's Hospitals. Less than 25% of the P. aeruginosa strains isolated from out patients were resistant to any of the antimicrobial agents tested. More than 23% of the P. aeruginosa strains isolated from ICU were resistant to any of the antimicrobial agents tested excep amikacin (16.1%). The prevalence of panresistant P. aeruginosa strains was 1.8%. Conclusions The antimicrobial resistance of P. aeruginosa is still a serious problem across China. The resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents remain stable from 2008 to 2011. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern varies with geographic region, hospital, and department. Antimicrobial resistance surveillance is very important for rational antimicrobial therapy.

84882632324	Complete Genome Sequence of a PantÃ³n-Valentine Leukocidin-Negative Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Strain of Sequence type 72 from Korea	In the past decade, community-associated (CA-) infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have emerged throughout the world. Different CA-MRSA strains dominate in different geographical locations. Many CA-MRSA lineages contain genes coding for the PantÃ³n-Valentine leukocidin. However, the role of this leukotoxin in CA-MRSA pathogenesis is still controversial. The genome sequences of two key PVL-positive CA-MRSA strains (USA300, USA400) have been reported, but we lack information on the more recently found PVL-negative CA-MRSA strains. One such strain is the PVL-negative ST72, the main cause of CA-MRSA infections in Korea. Here, we report the entire genome sequence of CA-MRSA ST72 and analyze its gene content with a focus on virulence factors. Our results show that this strain does not have considerable differences in virulence factor content compared to other CA-MRSA strains (USA300, USA400), indicating that other toxins do not substitute for the lack of PVL in ST72. This finding is in accordance with the notion that differential expression of widespread virulence determinants, rather than the acquisition of additional virulence factors on mobile genetic elements, such as PVL, is responsible for the increased virulence of CA- compared to hospital-associated MRSA.

84882644527	Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria isolated from bloodstream infections in CHINET program in China during 2011	Objective To investigate the distribution and changing pattern of susceptibility in blood culture isolates in 15 hospitals across China during 2011. Methods The blood culture isolates were routinely isolated and identified. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates were tested with more than 20 antimicrobial agents by Kirby-Bauey methods in the participating institutions. Results A total of 6 992 strains were isolated from blood specimens during 2011. Gram positive cocci and Gram negative bacilii accounted for 61.9% and 38.1%,respectively. The most frequent isolates were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (43.6%), E.coli (15.2%), Enterococcus spp. (7.7%), Klebsiella spp. (7.5%), E.arreus (6. 3%), Acinetobactrr spp. (3.7%), E.viridans (3.0%), P. aeruginosa (2.7%), Entrobacter spp. (2.0%), Salmonella spp. (1.1%) and S. maltophilia (1.1%). All these species together accounted for 93.9% of all the blood culture isolates. Prevalence of MRSA and MRCNS among S. aureus and CNS were 42.5% and 68.0%, respectively. The prevalence of E. faecalis strains resistant to high level gentamicin and ampicillin was 37.0% and 11.1%,respectively. E. faecium isolates showed significantly higher resistant rates to most of the antimicrobial agents tested than the E. faecalis isolates. Penicillin resistance was identiiied in 8.4% of the S. viridans isolates. About 57.9% of the S. pneumoniae strains isolated from children were resistant to penicillin, signiiicantly higher than that in the strains isolated from adults (22.2%). No strains were found resistant to vancomycin or linezolid in the Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis isolates. Vancomycin resistance was demonstrated in 4.6% of the E. faecium isolates. Enterobacteriaceee strains was highly susceptible to carbapenems. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant isolates was less than 10%. Nonfermenters was highly resistant to carbapenems,especially in Acinetobacter isolates,more than 60% of which were resistant. Conclusions CHINE surveilance data of 2011 indicate that gram positive coccus, especilly CNS, plays an important role in blood stream infections. Resistance to the lirst line antibiotics is common among all blood isolates. Antimicrobial agents should be used appropriately to reduce the selection pressure. Hospital infection control should be strengthened to prevent the spread of resistant organisms.

84882648679	CHINET 2011 surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Enterobacter spp. in China	Objective To investigate the distribution and antibiotic resistance of clinical Enterobacter isolates. Methods A total of 2 519 clinical strains of Enterobacter spp. were collected from 15 hospitals from January 1 through December 31, 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with Kirby-Bauer or minimum inhibitory concentration method. The results were analyzed according to CLSI 2011 standards. Results Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aero- genss accountedfor 74.7% (1 882/2 519) and 23.0% (579/ 2 519) of the 2 519 Enterobacter strains, respectively. The main source of the isolates was sputum, accounting for 56.6% (1 426/2 519). The Enterobacter strains showed the highest resistance rate to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanicacid, cefazolin and cefoxitin >89%), relatively higher resistance to cefazidime and cefotaxime (37.3% and 50.7%, respectively), and lower resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, cefoperazone-sulbactam, ertapenem, amikacin, or ciprofloxacin (generally between 10% and 20%), and the lowest resistance to imipenem and meropenem (4.2% and 4.5%, respectively). About 0 to 7.4% (depending on specific hospitals) of the 'Enterobacter cloacae isolates showed resistance to imipenem and meropenem. And 0 to 24.6% (depending on speciiic hospitals) of the Enterobacter aero genes isolates were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. Conclusions The surveillance data in 2011 indicate that the antibiotic resistance of Enterobacter spp. does not show signiticant change from previous year. The situation of antibiotic resistance is still very serious. We should take effective measures to control the antimicrobial resistance.

84884702057	Wide distribution of CC92 carbapenem-resistant and OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in multiple provinces of China	Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has spread rapidly across China and is currently reported to be a worldwide nosocomial menace. In light of its increasing clinical significance, this study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant and carbapenem-susceptible isolates obtained from multiple provinces of China. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion assay according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to investigate the molecular epidemiology of the isolates. In addition, a minimum spanning tree algorithm was applied to cluster sequence types (STs) into clonal complexes (CCs) in order to analyse their evolutionary relatedness. Generally, the average rate of resistance to most antibiotics in carbapenem-resistant isolates was extremely high (>85%), except for minocycline (20.45%). Analysis of MLST data confirmed that the genetic background of carbapenem-resistant isolates was relatively simple, with ST92 being the most prevalent clone, occurring in every province, followed by ST138, ST75 and ST381. In contrast, carbapenem-susceptible isolates had a more diverse genetic background. Furthermore, the most widely distributed CC of carbapenem-resistant isolates was bla

84886508335	National surveillance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in hina highlights a still-evolving epidemiology with 15 novel merging multilocus sequence types	The global spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a serious problem, particularly in mainland China. In order to better understand the national molecular epidemiology and resistance profiles of hospital-associated MRSA (HAMRSA) in China, a laboratory-based multicenter surveillance study was conducted. Sixty-nine hospitals in 45 large cities in 27 provinces were involved, and a total of 1,141 HA-MRSA isolates were collected during the 6-month study period in 2011. All MRSA isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, spa typing, detection of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) locus (lukS-PV and lukF-PV), and antibiogram analysis. ST239-III-t030, ST239-III-t037, and ST5-II-t002 were the predominant HA-MRSA clones (overall prevalence rates, 57.1%, 12.9%, and 8.1%, respectively), although the prevalence rates of these major clones varied markedly in different administrative regions. Of note, 6.6% of the HA-MRSA isolates were found to belong to ST59, which had typical community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) features, including carriage of SCCmec type IV or V and PVL and less antimicrobial resistance than other major HA-MRSA clones. Moreover, among 36 MLST sequence types (STs) identified, 15 STs, accounting for 3.5% of total isolates, were novel. A novel ST designated ST2590, which is a single-locus variant of ST5-II-t002, was identified in three hospitals in two large cities, with a total of 17 isolates. To further monitor trends in HA-MRSA prevalence, epidemic clonal shifts, clone emergence, and transmission between community and health care settings, longitudinal national MRSA surveillance is required.

Inhibitor potentiated broth dilution tests (IPBDT) were performed. Compare the results of DDT, E-test and Vitek test with those of IPBDT. The strains with different results of IPBDT and DDT were typed by gene cloning and secruencing. Results Comparing with the results of IPBDT, the sensitivity of DDT(96.4% ) is higher than that of E-test and Vitek test (70.4% and 75.9% , respectively). Of five strains having different results of IPBDT and DDT, three were identified as TEM-1 producer and the other two were non TEM and SHV producer. Conclusion DDT is an applicable method for detecting ESBLs and can be routinely used in clinical laboratories.

0041829085	The status of drug resistance and ampC gene expression in Enterobacter cloacae	Objective. To investigate the status of the drug resistance and the ampC gene expression of Enterobacter cloacae. Methods. Disk diffusion tests were made for detecting the susceptibility of antimicrobial agents against Enterobacter cloacae. AmpC gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and verified by DNA sequencing. AmpC gene expression was analyzed according to antimicrobial agent sensitive phenotype. Results. The sensitivity rates of 144 strains to imipenam, cefepime and cefoperazone/sulbactam were 98.61%, 65.97% and 63.89%, respectively. The sensitivity rates of 144 strains to other antimicrobial agents were lower. Among the 144 strains 120 were found to be positive by PCR for ampC. The PCR product showed high homology to the GenBank ampC sequence. Stably derepressed strains, hyperinducible strains and unexpressing or lower level expressing strains accounted for 30.0% (36/120), 37.5% (45/120), and 32.5% (39/120), respectively. Fifty-six out of 120 strains (46.67%) also produced extended spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBLs). The hyperinducible strains were highly sensitive to all the antimicrobial agents except amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefuroxime, while the stably derepressed strains were only sensitive to imipenam and cefepime. However, sensitivity to cefepime decreased if the strains also produced ESBLs. Conclusions. The durg resistant status of Enterobacter cloacae is severe. Clearing out the expressive status of ampC gene will be helpful in selection of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of clinical infection.

84890407663	Decreased susceptibility to tigecycline in acinetobacter baumannii mediated by a mutation in trm encoding SAM-dependent methyltransferase	Objectives: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen and multidrug-resistant isolate. Although tigecycline is a potent antibiotic for treating infections with multidrug-resistant isolates, resistance is becoming a problem. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of tigecycline resistance in A. baumannii. Methods: A serial passage experiment was performed to collect isolates selected by tigecycline. The expression of efflux pumps was quantified in the final selected isolate, 19606-T8. The whole genome of 19606-T8 was sequenced and the putative mutations were confirmed using PCR and Sanger sequencing. A complementation experimentwas performed to evaluate the contribution of the mutations to decreased susceptibility to tigecycline. Thesignificanceofadeletionmutationwas further investigatedintermsof growth rateandantibiotic susceptibilities. Results:Wecollectedserial isolatesbyselectivepressureof tigecycline, anddesignatedthem19606-T1to19606-T8. The efflux pumps AdeABC, AdeFGH and AdeIJK were not overexpressed in 19606-T8, which had decreased susceptibility to tigecycline. Isolate 19606-T8 carried one deletionmutation in trmand three non-synonymous substitutions inmsbA (A84V), lolA (P91L) and filC (N168K). The deletionmutation in trm(encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine- dependent methyltransferase) resulted in decreased susceptibility to tigecycline aswell as to minocycline and doxycycline. In complementation experiments, theMICs of tigecycline, minocycline and doxycycline in a tigecyclineresistant isolatewere restored by complementation with wild-type trm. Conclusions: Given that the deletionmutation in trmwas associatedwith decreased susceptibility to tigecycline and that awild-type trmplasmid could restore the susceptibility, trmis considered to play an important role in decreased susceptibility to tigecycline in A. baumannii.

84895886235	Whole genome analysis of a community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST59 isolate from a case of human sepsis and severe pneumonia in China	We report a case of necrotizing pneumonia in a young patient caused by community acquired-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) in a teaching hospital in the People's Republic of China. The patient had a typical clinical presentation and was successfully treated with antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulin. A CA-MRSA strain, named SA268, was isolated from the blood of the patient. The isolate was susceptible to most antimicrobial agents, except cephalosporins, penicillins, and Î²-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) assigned SA268 to ST59, a clone widely spread in eastern Asia. The strain was positive for Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)-encoding genes and SCCmec type V. We sequenced the complete genome of the SA268 isolate. The genome of SA268 was almost identical to that of the Taiwanese ST59 CA-MRSA strains M013 and SA957. However, we observed several differences in gene composition, which included differences in the SCCmec element and several lipoprotein genes that were present in the Taiwanese strains but absent from SA268.

84899846571	Characterization of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome composite island of Staphylococcus haemolyticus SH32, a methicillin-resistant clinical isolate from China	Staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) elements contribute considerably to virulence and resistance to antibiotic agents in staphylococci. SCC elements in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are highly diverse and there is evidence suggesting that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, only a small number of SCC elements have been characterized in CoNS and their exact roles in the emergence and evolution of MRSA remain to be demonstrated. Here, we determined the structure of an SCC composite island (CI

84903382689	Molecular characterization of Rifr mutations in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium	Mutation rate is an important factor affecting the appearance and spread of acquired antibiotic resistance. The frequencies and types of enterococci mutations were determined in this study. The MICs of rifampicin in enterococci and their rifampicin-resistant mutants were determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) agar dilution method. The Enterococcus faecalis isolates A15 and 18165 showed no significant differences in mutation frequencies or mutation rates. In Enterococcus faecium, the mutation frequency and mutation rate were both 6.4-fold lower than in E. faecalis. The spectrum of mutations characterized in E. faecium B42 differed significantly from that of E. faecalis. The types and rate of mutations indicated that E. faecalis had a higher potential to develop linezolid resistance. Rifampicin resistance was associated with mutations in the rpoB gene. Rifampicin MICs for the E. faecalis mutant were 2048 mg/l, but rifampicin MICs for E. faecium mutants ranged from 64 to 1024 mg/l.

84904433756	Diversity and evolution of oligopeptide permease systems in staphylococcal species	Several oligopeptide permease (Opp) systems have been found in staphylococcal species, including Opp1-4, Opp3' and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME)-encoded Opp system (ACME-Opp). They confer upon bacteria the increasing fitness, but their evolutionary histories remain unclear. In this work, we performed a genome-wide identification of Opp systems in staphylococcal species. Novel Opp systems were identified, including the duplicate of Opp4 in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the ACME-Opp-like systems in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the identified Opp systems were derived from Opp3 system by operon duplication during species divergence, while lateral gene transfer might also confer to the dissemination of Opp in staphylococci. In addition, we proposed an improved theory on evolution of ACME: the Opp and arginine-deiminase systems were firstly transferred from Staphylococcus haemolyticus to Staphylococcus epidermidis independently; in S. epidermidis they were assembled together and then transferred to Staphylococcus aureus.

84905665060	Correlation between Ureaplasma subgroup 2 and genitourinary tract disease outcomes revealed by an expanded multilocus sequence typing (eMLST) scheme	The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme of Ureaplasma based on four housekeeping genes (ftsH, rpL22, valS, and thrS) was described in our previous study; here we introduced an expanded MLST (eMLST) scheme with improved discriminatory power, which was developed by adding two putative virulence genes (ureG and mba-np1) to the original MLST scheme. To evaluate the discriminatory power of eMLST, a total of 14 reference strains of Ureaplasma serovars and 269 clinical strains (134 isolated from symptomatic patients and 135 obtained from asymptomatic persons) were investigated. Our study confirmed that all 14 serotype strains could successfully be differentiated into 14 eMLST STs (eSTs), while some of them could not even be differentiated by the MLST, and a total of 136 eSTs were identified among the clinical isolates we investigated. In addition, phylogenetic analysis indicated that two genetically significantly distant clusters (cluster I and II) were revealed and most clinical isolates were located in cluster I. These findings were in accordance with and further support for the concept of two well-known genetic lineages (Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum) in our previous study. Interestingly, although both clusters were associated with clinical manifestation, the sub-group 2 of cluster II had pronounced and adverse effect on patients and might be a potential risk factor for clinical outcomes. In conclusion, the eMLST scheme offers investigators a highly discriminative typing tool that is capable for precise epidemiological investigations and clinical relevance of Ureaplasma.

84905973725	Species distribution of clinical Acinetobacter isolates revealed by different identification techniques	A total of 2582 non-duplicate clinical Acinetobacter spp. isolates were collected to evaluate the performance of four identification methods because it is important to identify Acinetobacter spp. accurately and survey the species distribution to determine the appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Phenotyping (VITEK 2 and VITEK MS) and genotyping (16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequencing) methods were applied for species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility test of imipenem and meropenem was performed with a disk diffusion assay. Generally, the phenotypic identification results were quite different from the genotyping results, and their discrimination ability was unsatisfactory, whereas 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequencing showed consistent typing results, with different resolution. Additionally, A. pittii, A. calcoaceticus and A. nosocomialis, which were phylogenetically close to A. baumannii, accounted for 85.5% of the non-A. baumannii isolates. One group, which could not be clustered with any reference strains, consisted of 11 isolates and constituted a novel Acinetobacter species that was entitled genomic species 33YU. None of the non-A. baumannii isolates harbored a bla

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, after which the fos genes in all isolates and van genes in vancomycin-resistant isolates were characterized by PCR and sequencing. Conjugation experiments were carried out with fosB-positive E. faecium, DNA fragments flanking the fosB3 gene were sequenced and the genetic environment of fosB3 was analysed. Fosfomycin-resistant E. faecium (FREF) strains were characterized further by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and PFGE. Among 145 E. faecium clinical isolates, 10 were resistant to fosfomycin with MICs > 1024 mg l

84920276474	Rare and persistent Rhodococcus equi infection in a diffuse large B cell lymphoma patient: Case report and review of the literature	Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is an uncommon gram positive organism. It is a rare but recognized pathogen in humans and has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Generally, R. equi infection needs combined treatment with effective antibiotics, and often requires the immune adjuvant therapy. Here we reported a 49-year-old man presented dyspnea with fever, skin ulcer for 5 months, and the final diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma with R. equi septicemia and pneumonia, the treatment was failure, the blood culture was always positive during the course of disease, though he was given combined treatment with effective antibiotics, perhaps the immune reconstitution or immune supportive treatment was more important.

11144252898	A novel plasmid-mediated IMI-1-like carbapenemase	Objective: To investigate the resistant mechanism of imipenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae. Methods: The minimal inhibitive concentration (MIC) was detected by E test. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis(IEF), three dimensional test, conjugation experiment, Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction(PCR), cloning and sequencing methods were applied for analyzing the enzyme activity and the encoding gene. Results: The carbapenemase produced by Enterobacter cloacae had the bands with pIs 8.1. The carbapenemase had some characteristics of Class 2f. The activity of hydrolysising imipenem was inhibited by clavulanic acid, but not inhibited by cloxacillion and EDTA. The imipemen-resistant gene was located on a about 80kb plasmid and the amino acid sequence have 99% of homology with chromosome-mediated IMI-1. Conclusion: The E. cloacae resistant to imipenem was explained by a novel plasmid-mediated IMI-1-like carbapenemase.

11144336775	The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis(PFGE) typing at the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus	Objective: To explore the characteristic of the molecular epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis(PFGE) was used to analyze the homology of 50 strains of MRSA, isolated from clinic specimen. Results: Six different PFGE types (A-F) were found among 50 strains of MRSA and most of MRSA were type A (27 strains), type B (10 strains) and type C (10 strains). Type A and type B spread from Jun. 2001 to Apr. 2002. Type C spread from Jul. 2001 to Apr. 2002. Thirty-four percent of strains were related with intensive care unit(ICU). The epidemic strains spread over different wards. Conclusion: MRSA spread in our hospital from Jun. 2001 to Apr. 2002. ICU ward is the high incident region of MRSA infection. Neuro-surgical ward, liver-gallbladder-pancreas-surgical ward and VIP ward are the relatively high incident region of MRSA infection. The strains isolated from one individual may be different types.
