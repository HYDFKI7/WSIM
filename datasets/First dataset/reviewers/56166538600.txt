38049173126	Study on pool boiling heat transfer of nano-particle suspensions on plate surface	The characteristics of boiling heat transfer of nanofluids (nano-particle suspension) have been considerable of interest in recent years for enhancing cooling capability in many high heat flux devices. In this paper, an experimental investigation of pool boiling heat transfer at horizontal plate surface is firstly conducted for 26 nm Fe-water and 13 nm, 28 nm Al2O3-water nano-particle suspensions. The experimental results show that the boiling heat transfer will be enhanced for the metal nano-particle suspension having larger thermal conductivity. The main mechanisms of nano-particle suspension on pool boiling heat transfer are analyzed in this work as: (1) nano-particles increase the thermal conductivity of boiling fluid, which enhances the convection heat transfer induced by the micro-layer evaporation and bubble upward motion near the boiling surface, thus enhancing boiling heat transfer (termed as a thermal effect); (2) nano-particles might cover or trap into some cavities on the boiling surface, which causes these cavities decreasing their nucleation activity or even losing their activity during the boiling, thus decreasing boiling heat transfer (termed as a surface effect). The boiling heat transfer for nano-particle fluid would finally be enhanced or deteriorated depending on the summarization of these two effects. It is concluded that the nano-particle suspension with larger thermal conductivity (such as metal particles) and having some amount of volumetric density can enhance the boiling heat transfer when the surface effect can be controlled. © 2007 by Begell House, Inc.

Based on the microstructure of magnetic fluid and considering the effect of nanolayer, a model for the thermal conductivity of the magnetic fluid has been developed. The anisotropic thermal transport inside the magnetic fluid is investigated by the present method. The results show that in the presence of an external magnetic field the particles form chainlike clusters along the magnetic field direction, which leads to an increment in the,thermal conductivity along the field direction and little change in the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. The thermal conductivity of magnetic fluid presents an anisotropic feature. With the increase of the magnetic field strength the chainlike clusters in the magnetic fluid becomes more obvious and the anisotropic feature of heat conduction in the fluids becomes more evident.

A method is proposed for predicting the anisotropic thermal conductivity of magnetic fluids. By introducing an anisotropic structure parameter which characterizes the nonuniform distribution of particles suspended in the magnetic fluids, the traditional Maxwell formula is modified and extended to calculate anisotropic thermal conductivity of the magnetic fluids. The results show that in the presence of an external magnetic field the magnetic nanoparticles form chainlike clusters along the direction of the external magnetic field, which leads to the fact that the thermal conductivity of the magnetic fluid along the chain direction is bigger than that along other directions. The thermal conductivity of the magnetic fluids presents an anisotropic feature.

[K. Qu, C. Shu, Y.T. Chew, Phys. Rev. E 75 (2007) 036706]. A simple function, which satisfies the zeroth- through third-order moments of the Maxwellian distribution function, is introduced to replace the Maxwellian distribution function as the continuous equilibrium distribution function in 3D space. The function is then discretized to discrete-velocity directions via a 25-point Lagrangian interpolation polynomial. To simulate compressible flows with shock waves, an implicit-explicit finite-difference scheme based on the total variation diminishing flux limitation is adopted to solve the discrete Boltzmann-BGK equation in order to capture the shock waves in compressible flows with a finite number of grid points. The model is validated by its application to some typical inviscid compressible flows ranging from 1D to 3D, and the numerical results are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solutions and/or other numerical results. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Multicomponent lattice Boltzmann model on fine mesh is used in regions where physical parameters, such as density and velocity change tempestuously, otherwise a single component one on coarse mesh is used. In order to keep continuity of physical information (physical parameters) in overlapping regions, principle of mass and momentum conservation is used. It shows that in the model microcosmic characteristics of nanofluid flow can be obtained.

77449159245	Multiscale simulation of flow and heat transfer of nanofluid with lattice Boltzmann method	Based on the lattice Boltzmann (LB) approach, a novel hybrid method has been proposed for getting insight into the microscale characteristics of the multicomponent flow of nanofluid. In this method, the whole computational domain is divided into two regions in which different-sized meshes are involved for simulation (fine mesh and coarse mesh). The multicomponent LB method is adopted in the fine mesh region, and the single-component LB approach is applied to the coarse mesh region where the nanofluid is treated as a mixed single-component fluid. The conservation principles of mass, momentum and energy are used to derive a hybrid scheme across the different scaled regions. Numerical simulation is carried out for the Couette flow and convective heat transfer in a parallel plate channel to validate the hybrid method. The computational results indicate that by means of the present method, not only the microscopic characteristics of the nanofluid flow can be simulated, but also the computational efficiency can be remarkably improved compared with the pure multicomponent LB method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77952831521	Energy transport mechanisms in nanofluids and its applications	Nanofluid is a solid-liquid mixture consisting of solid nanoparticles or nanofibers with sizes typically of 1-100 nm suspended in liquid. Thermal conductivity and heat transfer performance of nanofluids is superior to those of the original pure carrier fluids because the suspended nanoparticles remarkably improve energy exchange capability of the suspensions. In the present paper, the investigations efforts cover microscopic and mesoscaled approachs for the heat transfer enhancement mechanism of the nanofluid, flow and heat transfer mechanism and the relevant control methods of the magnetic fluid by suspending magnetic nanoparticles in base fluids, and some applications of nanofluid on a variety of thermal systems in order to understand energy transfer mechanism of nanofluids and guide future applications of nanofluids to thermal engineering.

77953344925	Improved axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann scheme	This paper proposes an improved lattice Boltzmann scheme for incompressible axisymmetric flows. The scheme has the following features. First, it is still within the framework of the standard lattice Boltzmann method using the single-particle density distribution function and consistent with the philosophy of the lattice Boltzmann method. Second, the source term of the scheme is simple and contains no velocity gradient terms. Owing to this feature, the scheme is easy to implement. In addition, the singularity problem at the axis can be appropriately handled without affecting an important advantage of the lattice Boltzmann method: the easy treatment of boundary conditions. The scheme is tested by simulating Hagen-Poiseuille flow, three-dimensional Womersley flow, Wheeler benchmark problem in crystal growth, and lid-driven rotational flow in cylindrical cavities. It is found that the numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions and/or the results reported in previous studies. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

In this paper, two types of Cu-water nanofluids (Cu particles with 25 nm diameter or 100 nm) are introduced into submerged single jet impingement cooling system as the working fluid. The heat transfer features of the nanofluids were experimentally investigated. The effects of the nanoparticle concentration, Reynolds number, nozzle-to-plate distance, fluid temperature, and nanoparticle diameter on the heat transfer performances of the jet impingement of nanofluids are discussed. The experimental results show that the suspended nanoparticles remarkably increase the convective heat transfer coefficient of the base fluid. The convective heat transfer coefficient of Cu-water nanofluid with the volume fraction of 3.0% has 52% higher than the pure water. The experiments also revealed that the suspended nanoparticles brought almost no extra addition of pressure drop in both submerged single jet impingement. In addition, by considering the effects of the suspended nanoparticles as well as the condition of impinging jet, a new heat transfer correlation of nanofluids for the submerged single jet impingement has been proposed. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The spectral properties of the model were calculated by using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The light extraction efficiency of the model was obtained. The results show that the embedded Ag grating can couple the near-field evanescent wave to the propagation wave that can emit out of the LED chip, which lead to the enhancement of the light extraction efficiency of LED.

0037146343	A preliminary analysis of the intensified thermal-conductivity mechanism of nano-fluids	The mechanism of an intensified thermal conductivity achieved through the use of nano-fluids is analyzed from the following two aspects, namely, a changed liquid structure due to the addition of nano-particles and the micro-motion of nano-fluids. The results of the analysis indicate that relative to the enhanced thermal conductivity effected by the addition in fluids of millimeter or micrometer-grade particles the enhanced thermal conductivity made possible by nano-fluids has come about mainly due to the micro-motion of the nano-particles. Through the measurement of the thermal conductivity of nano-fluids under various temperatures it has been verified that the micro-motion of the nano-particles represents a major factor contributing to the enhancement of thermal conductivity by the nano-fluids.

0041805569	Convective heat transfer and flow characteristics of Cu-water nanofluid	An experimental system is built to investigate convective heat transfer and flow characteristics of the nanofluid in a tube. Both the convective heat transfer coefficient and friction factor of Cu-water nanofluid for the laminar and turbulent flow are measured. The effects of such factors as the volume fraction of suspended nanoparticles and the Reynolds number on the heat transfer and flow characteristics are discussed in detail. The experimental results show that the suspended nanoparticles remarkably increase the convective heat transfer coefficient of the base fluid and show that the friction factor of the sample nanofluid with the low volume fraction of nanoparticles is almost not changed. Compared with the base fluid, for example, the convective heat transfer coefficient is increased about 60% for the nanofluid with 2.0 vol% Cu nanoparticles at the same Reynolds number. Considering the factors affecting the convective heat transfer coefficient of the nanofluid, a new convective heat transfer correlation for nanofluid under single-phase flows in tubes is established. Comparison between the experimental data and the calculated results indicate that the correlation describes correctly the energy transport of the nanofluid.

Four different Cu-nanoparticle volume fractions ranged from 0.17 Vol.% to 0.64 Vol.% and two dispersant sodium dodecyl benzoic sulfate (SDBS) mass concentrations varied from 0.05 wt% to 0.1 wt% were involved. The influences of the nanoparticle volume fraction and the dispersant SDBS on the heat transfer of nanofluids were discussed. The experimental results show that the suspended nanoparticles increase the heat transfer performances of the jet arrays impingement cooling system. It had also been found that compared with the case of using nanofluids without any addition of dispersant, the nanofluid with dispersant led to a great deterioration on impingement heat transfer coefficient and even the heat transfer coefficients were smaller than that of the base liquid. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84892398421	Crack-free and scalable transfer of carbon nanotube arrays into flexible and highly thermal conductive composite film	Carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays show great promise in developing anisotropic thermal conductive composites for efficiently dissipating heat from high-power devices along thickness direction. However, CNT arrays are always grown on some substrates and liable to be deformed and broken into pieces during transfer and solution treatment. In the present study, we intentionally synthesized well-crystallized and large-diameter (∼80 nm) multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) arrays by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method. Such arrays provided high packing density and robust structure from collapse and crack formation during post solution treatment and therefore favored to maintain original thermal and electrical conductive paths. Under optimized condition, the CNT arrays can be transferred into flexible composite films. Furthermore, the composite film also exhibited excellent thermal conductivity at 8.2 W/(m·K) along thickness direction. Such robust, flexible, and highly thermal conductive composite film may enable some prospective applications in advanced thermal management. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84896433625	Heat transfer enhancement of Jet impingement cooling with nanofluids	Jet impingement cooling is a vital technique for thermal management of electronic devices of high heat flux by impinging fluid on a heater surface due to its high local heat transfer rates. One may find plenty of publications on the heat transfer characteristics of jet impingement cooling technique such as the distance between the jet outlet and the heated surface, the magnitude of the jet velocities, turbulence intensity, the angle of impingement, the array of jets and the roughness of the heater surface. But little attention is paid to the effect of the thermal properties of the impingement fluid, which may be another way to further improve the heat transfer performance of the jet impingement. With development of enhanced heat transfer techniques in conventional systems, the conventional working fluid with low thermal conductivity turns into a bottleneck factor for promoting the performance effectiveness of thermal systems. Improvement of the thermal properties of impinging fluids may become a promising trick of augmenting heat transfer process in the jet impingement cooling system. Recent advances in the nanotechnology have permitted the creation of a new and special class of fluids, named 'nanofluids'. The thermal conductivity and heat transfer performance of nanofluids are superior to those of the original pure carrier fluids because the suspended nanoparticles remarkably improve energy transport capability of the suspensions. Nanofluid offers the exciting possibility of increased heat transferability of jet impingement. In this current study, experiments were conducted to investigate the heat transfer enhancement of the nanofluid in the impinging jet cooling system. Two types of nanofluids were used as the working fluid. Cu-water nanofluid was studied in submerged single jet impingement cooling while Cu-ethylene glycol/water nanofluid was introduced into free surface jet array impingement cooling, respectively. In submerged single jet impingement, nanofluids with volume fraction ranged from 1.5% to 3.0% were studied for different jet-totarget spans. Experiments have revealed that the suspended nanoparticles increase the heat transfer performance of the base liquid in the jet impingement cooling system. It had been found that an enhancement of 18.5% compared with the base fluid at the Reynolds number of 8000 when nanofluids are used. In addition, the experiments have shown that the suspended nanoparticles almost result in no extra addition of pressure drop in both submerged single jet and free surface jet array impingement. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

84900839493	Multiscale simulation of thermal contact resistance in electronic packaging	A multiscale model of thermal contact resistance (TCR) between two rough surfaces is developed. The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method and the traditional finite difference (FD) method are coupled to calculate the heat transfer between two rough surfaces. The LB method and the FD method are, respectively, applied to two different regions with different meshes (fine meshes and macro meshes). A coupling region for transmitting the boundary information between these two regions is established to ensure the continuity of physical parameters. In the multiscale model, the profile heights of actual surfaces are measured to construct the rough surface models, which have a higher accuracy than Gaussian surface. The elastic-plastic mechanics is applied to calculate the deformations of rough surfaces under pressure. A series of comparisons between both the numerical and experiments results are carried out to verify the validity of the multiscale model. The results show that the TCR is synthetically affected by several factors, such as surface roughness, surface flatness, pressure, microhardness, and thermal conductivity. In those parameters, the surface roughness, flatness, and thermal conductivity of materials exert great influences on the TCR under low-pressure condition. When the pressure increases, the pressure and microhardness play dominant roles in TCR. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

84904969760	Characterization and application of engineered regular rough surfaces in thermal contact resistance	Proper characterization of rough surfaces is indispensable for accurate estimation of thermal contact resistance (TCR). This work is to establish a proper algorithm of characterizing surface topographies mechanically processed by lathe turning and end-face milling, which is to provide accurate and convenient methods of modeling surfaces for predicting the TCR. The correlations of surface roughness with wavelength and element height in these two types of mechanically machined surfaces are established. Based on the Fourier transforms, the models of the surface topographies of both lathe turning surfaces and end-face milling surfaces are proposed. The presented surface models are applied to both the macroscopic and the multiscale approaches of simulating the TCR to verify the accuracy of the presented surface models. A higher accuracy is verified by the comparisons between the experimental data of the TCR and the numerical results obtained from the presented surface models. The contact conditions of using lathe turning surfaces and end-face milling surfaces are simulated. The results indicate that short wavelength is able to increase real contact area, which is benefit for reducing the TCR at interface. Meanwhile, large flatness angle of lathe turning surfaces will severely decrease the real contact area and lead to increase in the TCR. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0346911663	Investigation on transient behaviors of flat plate heat pipes	By means of both experimental and theoretical approaches, this paper is aimed to study performance and mechanism of a flat plate heat pipe (FPHP) in which a layer of sintered copper powder is applied to the heated surface of the heat pipe to enhance evaporation process. The performance of the FPHP is experimentally measured under different heat fluxes, orientations and amount of the working fluid in order to investigate the effects of charge amount of the working fluid, thickness of the sintered layer, and orientation of the heat pipe on the performance of the FPHP. On basis of some assumptions, a theoretical model is proposed to simulate dynamic behavior and steady-state performance of the FPHP. The model and simulation method developed in this article are verified by the experimental results. Simulation shows that dynamic behavior of a FPHP is affected by geometrical parameters, charge amount of the working fluid and installation orientation. The porous sintered layer on the heated surface can enhance evaporation process and improve performance of the FPHP. Such a technique ensures proper operation of the heat pipe at high heat flux in arbitrary orientation. With regard to the potential application to electronic cooling, comparison between the FPHP and conventional solid heat sink is provided. Compared with the solid heat sink, the FPHP has great potential for electronic elements with high power consumption because of its unique performance of high response, efficiency, isothermal and lightweight feature. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.
