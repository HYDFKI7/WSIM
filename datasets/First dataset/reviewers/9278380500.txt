2442481759	Progress of cardiac tissue engineering: Primary and passaged culturing of cardiomyocytes from human adult ventricular myocardium in vitro	Aim: This study describes a method of isolating, culturing, purifying, subculturing, and identifying noncontracting ventricular myocytes grown from myocardium removed from valvular heart disease patients during corrective cardiac surgery. Methods: Minced myocardium was digested in trypsin and collagenase. The isolated cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. The cardiomyocytes were purified by differential attachment technique. Subculturing was done by 0.125% trypsin and 0.01% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) digestion and transferring of the cells to new culture dishes containing the above culture medium. The myocardial sarcomeric actin and myoglobin were identified by immunofluorescence antibody staining. Myofibrils and mitochondria were visible by electron microscopy. Results: The ratio of viable cells was 99% identified by trypan staining. The ratio of attachment cells was 95% after 24 h in culture. The cultured human adult heart cells were roundness-shaped, rod-shaped, shuttle-shaped, ellipse-shaped, star-shaped and bifurcate-shaped with non-contractility. The myocardial actin and myoglobin were identified by immunocytochemistry antibody staining and immunofluorescence antibody staining. The ultrastructure of cells was similar to that of the cardiac tissue in vivo by electron microscopy. Human adult heart cells after 30 d of primary culturing and after 15 d of passaged culturing were growed well. Conclusion: The method for isolating and culturing human adult heart cells is successful and reliable. The cultured cardiomyocytes promise to be useful in the study of normal and abnomal aspects of the cell and molecular biology of the heart.

25144524030	Comparative study on cerebral injury after open heart surgery in patients with congenital and rheumatic heart disease	Objective: To comparatively study the different effects of open heart surgery on brain tissues of patients with congenital and rheumatic heart disease. Methods: Forty patients with congenital heart disease (CHD, CHD group, n = 20) or rheumatic heart disease (RHD, RHD group, n = 20) underwent on-pump (cardiopulmonary bypass, CPB) heart-beating open heart surgery. Blood samples before CPB, and 20 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days after CPB were collected, and the levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and protein S-100b in the plasma were determined with enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. All the patients were examined with electroencephalogram (EEG) before and 1 week after operation. The changes of NSE, S-100b and EEG compared to verify the difference of postoperative cerebral injury between CHD cases and RHD cases. Results: The plasma level of S-100b increased significantly 20 minutes after CPB and was still higher than the preoperative level at 24 hours after operation in both groups (P < 0.01). The plasma level of NSE increased more significantly in the CHD group than in the RHD group 20 minutes after CPB and it returned to the normal level 24 hours after CPB in the CHD group but remained at a high level in the RHD group (P < 0.01). The levels of NSE and S-100b returned to the normal levels on the 7th day after CPB. Abnormal EEG was found in 75% of the patients in the CHD group and 60% in the RHD group. Conclusions: On-pump heart-beating open heart surgery can cause certain cerebral injury in the patients with CHD or RHD. The injury was more severe and recovered more quickly in the CHD group than in the RHD group.

27844455476	Establishment of an animal model of non-transthoracic cardiopulmonary bypass in rats	Objective: To establish an animal model of non-transthoracic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in rats. Methods: Ten adult male Sprague-Dawlay rats, weighing 350-500 g, were used in this study. CPB was established in these animals through cannulating the left carotid and right jugular vein for arterial perfusion and venous return. The components of perfusion circuit, especially the miniature oxygenator and cannula, were specially designed and improved. The mean arterial pressure was measured with a blood pressure meter through cannulating the left femoral artery. The hemodynamic and blood gas parameters were also monitored. Results: The rat model of non-transthoracic CPB was established successfully. The hemodynamical parameters were changed within an acceptable region during CPB. The miniature oxygenator was sufficient to meet the standard of satisfactory CPB. Conclusions: The rat model of non-transthoracic CPB established through the carotid and jugular cannulation is feasible, easily operated, safe, reliable, and economic. It is an ideal model for the pathophysiological research of CPB.

33745593750	Risk factors associated with ARDS following cardiopulmonary bypass	Objective: To study the risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after cardiopulmonary bypass, and to improve the treatment. Methods: From January 1996 to March 2004, 52 patients de veloped ARDS in our ICU. The clinical data of the patients were collected in cardiovascular surgery database designed by our work team. The number in the control group was 6 time that in the ARDS group. Patients in the control group underwent similar operations during the same period without ARDS. The binary Logistic regression analysis model was used to evaluate the variables. Results: Mortality of ARDS group was 21.2%. Bin ary Logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative renal dysfunction (OR = 6.443), excess large BW (OR = 14.331), preoperative coexisting disease (OR = 11.455), perioperative unexpected events or other postoperative complications (OR = 7.988), large quantity of chest drainage (OR = 3.804), and larger quantity of blood transfusion (OR = 9.763) were the independent risk factors of ARDS following open heart operation. Conclusion: Active and effective treatments should be carried out in the patients with high risk factors of ARDS following open heart operation. It would play an important role in the prevention, early diagnosis and management of ARDS.

33751264582	Hyperbilirubinemia after extracorporeal circulation surgery: A recent and prospective study	Aim: To clarify the incidence and nature of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia in patients after modern extracorporeal circulation, to analyze possible perioperative risk factors, and to elucidate the clinical significance of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia associated mortality and morbidity. Methods: Between March 2005 and May 2006, three hundred and eighty six consecutive patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation surgery due to a variety of cardiac lesions were investigated prospectively. The incidence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia was defined as a serum total bilirubin concentration of more than 51 Î¼mol/L. Several perioperative parameters were compared by logistic regression between hyperbilirubinemia and non-hyperbilirubinemia patients to determine possible risk factors contributing to postoperative hyperbilirubinemia and mortality. Results: Overall incidence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia was 25.3% (98/386). In patients with postoperative hyperbilirubinemia, 56.2% reached peak total bilirubin concentration on the first postoperative day, 33.5% on the second day, and 10.3% on the seventh day. Eighty percent of the increase of total bilirubin resulted from an increase of both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. Development of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia was associated with a higher mortality (P < 0.01), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (P < 0.05) and longer ICU stay time (P < 0.05). Preoperative total bilirubin concentration, preoperative right atrium pressure, numbers of valves replaced and of blood transfusion requirement were identified as important predictors for postoperative hyperbilirubinemia. Conclusion: Early postoperative hyperbilirubinemia after modern extracorporeal circulation is mainly caused by an increase in both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, and is associated with a high mortality. Important contributing factors are the preoperative total bilirubin concentration, preoperative severity of right atrial pressure, numbers of valve replacement procedures, and the amount of blood transfusion requirement during and shortly after surgery. We suggest that postoperative hyperbilirubinemia is a multifactorial process, which is caused by both the impaired liver function of bilirubin transport and the increased production of bilirubin from haemolysis.

33845495378	Effects of trimetazidine on apoptosis in human cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation	Aim: To investigate effects of trimetazidine on apoptosis and its signal regulation in human cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation. Methods: Human cardiomyocytes were obtained from minced myocardium digested in trypsin and collagenase. The cultured cells apoptosis was induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation. Optional time of apoptosis was hypoxia 24 h and reoxygenation 4 h. The bcl-2, bax, caspase-3 and cytochrome C proteins were detected by using immunocytochemistry (ICC). Bcl-2 mRNA and caspase-3 mRNA were detected by using in situ hybridization method (ISH). Apoptosis signal was expressed by optical density. SPSS 10.0 was used for statistical analysis. Results: (1). Twenty-four hours of hypoxia followed by 4 h of reoxygenation significantly increased the rate of apoptosis [(18.50Â±1.00)%]. Results revealed that H/R significantly induced the down-regulation of bcl-2 proteins (0.189Â±0.006) and up-regulation of bax (0.240Â±0.002), caspase-3 (0.230Â±0.002) and cytochrome C (0.225Â±0.003) proteins; down-regulation of bel-2 mRNA (0.300Â± 0.003) and up-regulation of caspase-3 mRNA (0.307 Â±0.004) in cardiomyocytes comparing with control group respectively (all P < 0.01). (2). Trimetazidine significantly decreased the rate of apoptotic, up-regulated the expression level of bcl-2 and down-regulated expression levels of bax, caspase-3 and cytochrome C protein , respectively (all P <0.01). Trimetazidine also up-regulated the expression level of bcl-2 mRNA and down-regulated the expression level of caspase-3 mRNA. Conclusion: Trimetazidine has anti-apoptosis effect and its mechanisms may be related to the increased expression levels of bcl-2 proteins and bcl-2 mRNA and decreased expression levels of bax, caspase-3, cytochrome C proteins and caspase-3 mR-NA.

33846390655	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma in the regulation of inflammatory reaction in rats with myocardial hypertrophy	Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-Î³) can restrain the inflammatory reaction of hypertrophic myocardium through restraining the expression of interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase, endothelin-1, nitricoxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase-9, gelatinase and adhesion molecule, etc. Objective: To observe the influence of rosiglitazone sodium(the ligand for PPAR-Î³) on inflammatory factors in rats with myocardial hypertrophy in the course of myocardial hypertrophy resulting from pressure load. Design: Randomized controlled trial based on animals. Settings: Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xinqiao Affiliated Haspital, the Third Military Medical University of Chinese PLA. Materials: Fifty purebred male SD rats of S.P.F. grade, whose body mass was (220Â±22) g. Methods: The experiment was completed in the Institute of Battle Surgical Research, the Third Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from August 2004 to October 2005. Fifty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control group, sham operation-normal saline group, sham operationresiglitazone group, myocardial hypertrephy-normal saline group and myocardial hypertrophy-rosiglitazone group, 10 rats per group. The rat model of myocardial hypertrophy induced by pressure overload was established with the method of coarctation of abdominal aorta. Rosiglitazone group: At the postoperative 4th week, the rats were injected intraperitaneally with the normal saline solution of rosiglitazone sodium [4 mg/(kgÂ·d)] for 1 week. Normal saline group: At the postoperative 4th week, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with normal saline[1 mL/(kgÂ·d)] for 1 week. At the post-operative 5th week, the indexes of myocardial hypertrophy and hemodynamics were determined. The contents of tumor necrosis factor-Î±, platelet activating factor and myeloperoxidase in the left ventricle muscle were determined with radioimmunosorbent technique. The expression of PPAR-Î³ mRNA was detected with RT-polymerase chain reaction. The activity of nuclear factor-ÎºB was detected with EMSA. Main Outcome Measures: The indexes of hemodynamics, cardiac ventricle reeonstitution and cardiac muscle in the rat models. Results: Except 1 rat in the control group died of the external injury induced by biting after 3 weeks, 49 of 50 rats entered the result analysis. 1 After the coarctation of aorta, the contents of tumor necrosis factor-Î±, platelet activating factor and myeloperoxidase of hypertrophic myocardium in the myocardial hypertrophy-rosiglitazone group were lower significantly than those in the myocardial hypertrophy-normal saline group(P < 0.01-0.05), but they were still higher than those in the control group(P < 0.01). 2 The expressions of PPAR-Î³ mRNA of myocardial tissue in both the myocardial hypertrophy-rosiglitazone and myocardial hypertrophy-normal saline groups were higher obviously than those in the control group(P < 0.01), and those in the myocardial hypertrophy-rosiglitazone group were higher than those in the myocardial hypertrophy-normal saline group(P < 0.01). 3 The activity of nuclear factor-ÎºB combined with DNA in cardiac muscle cell in both the myocardial hypertrophy-normal saline and myocardial hypertrophy-resiglitazone groups were higher obviously than those in the control group (P < 0.01), and those in the myocardial hypertrophy-rosiglitazone group were lower obviously than those in the myocardial hypertrophy-normal saline group(P < 0.01). Conclusion: The increasing of pressure load induces myocardial hypertrophy. The activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB in the tissue of hypertrophic myocardium is strengthened obviously. The expressions of tumor necrosis factor-Î±, platelet activating factor and myeloperoxidase in hypertrophic myocardium increase. This inflammatory reaction, which is strengthened obviously, can be restrained, by rosiglitazone sodium that is the synthetical ligand for PPAR-Î³.

33847149366	Good recovery after nontransthoracic cardiopulmonary bypass in rats	Background. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been shown to be associated with systemic inflammatory response leading to postoperative organ dysfunction. Unwanted side effects of CPB are well known but poorly understood due to the absence of a stable recovery animal model that is easy to handle and reduces experiment cost and time. The purpose of this study was to establish a good recoverable rat model of CPB to study the pathophysiology of these potential complications. Materials and Methods. Twenty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 480 Â± 20 g were randomly divided into either the CPB group (n = 10) or the sham group (n = 10). All rats were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated. The carotid artery and jugular vein were cannulated. The blood was drained from the right atrium via the right jugular and further transferred by a miniaturized roller pump to a hollow fiber oxygenator and back to the rat via the left carotid artery. Priming consisted of 8 mL of homologous blood and 6 mL of colloid. The surface of the hollow fiber oxgenator was 0.075 m

34047131273	Open-heart surgery in patients with liver cirrhosis: Indications, risk factors, and clinical outcomes	Background: Because of recent advances in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, there are broadened indications to approach patients with a high operative risk. Meanwhile, there is an increasing number of patients with severe liver dysfunction subjected to open-heart surgery. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the operative indications and clinical outcomes in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) undergoing open-heart surgery. In addition, determinants influencing their prognosis were assessed. Patients and Methods: Between May 1996 and June 2005, 24 patients with LC underwent CPB open-heart surgery in our institution. The preoperative severity of the LC was determined according to the Child-Pugh classification. Their perioperative data were analyzed. Several perioperative factors were compared by multivariate logistic regression analysis between survivors and nonsurvivors to determine possible risk factors contributing to mortality. Results:There were 14 females and 10 males. Their age ranged from 36 to 72 (mean 53 Â± 13) years. Seventeen cases were classified as having Child-Pugh class A LC, 6 as having Child-Pugh class B, and 1 as having Child-Pugh class C LC. All patients underwent CPB surgery. The mean operation time and the cross-clamp time were 160 Â± 53 and 90 Â± 42 min, respectively. During the first 24 h after the operation, the mean chest tube output was 1,080 Â± 320 ml. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 32 Â± 22 h, and the mean intensive care unit stay was 11 Â± 8 days. Sixty-six percent of the patients experienced significant morbidity. Fifty-three percent of the patients with Child-Pugh class A LC and 100% of those with Child-Pugh class B and C LC suffered postoperative complications. The overall mortality rate was 25%. The postoperative mortality rates of the patients with Child-Pugh class A, B, and C LC were 6, 67, and 100%, respectively. Preoperative serum total bilirubin and cholinesterase levels and EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) values along with CPB time were identified as the important predictors to differentiate between survivors and nonsurvivors by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: The Child-Pugh class is associated with hepatic decompensation and mortality after open-heart CPB surgery in patients with LC. Such surgery can be performed safely in patients with a Child-Pugh class A LC. But cardiac interventions using CPB in patients with more advanced LC are associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. The preoperative total plasma bilirubin and cholinesterase concentrations as well as the EuroSCORE along with the CPB time are identified as statistically significant predictors of mortality after open-heart surgery in patients with LC. Our findings indicate that patients with chronic liver disease scheduled for open-heart surgery should be carefully evaluated before the operation and that the CPB duration should be as short as possible.

34248212665	Open-heart surgery in patients with liver cirrhosis	Background: This retrospective study was designed to examine morbidity and mortality rates and to find predictors of outcome in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) undergoing open-heart surgery. Methods: Between May 1996 and June 2005, 24 patients with LC underwent an open-heart surgery in our institution. Results: There were 14 females and 10 males. Their age ranged from 36 to 72 (average 53 Â± 13) years. Seventeen cases were classified as having Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, six as having class B cirrhosis, and one as having class C cirrhosis. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and the cross-clamp time were 160 Â± 53 and 90 Â± 42 min, respectively. In the first 24 h after operation, the mean chest tube output was 1080 Â± 320 ml. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 32 Â± 22 h and mean intensive care unit stay time was 11 Â± 8 days. Sixty-six percent of the patients experienced significant morbidity. Fifty-three percent of patients with class A cirrhosis and 100% of those with class B and C cirrhosis suffered postoperative complications. The overall mortality rate was 25%. Postoperative mortality of patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, class B cirrhosis, and C cirrhosis were 6, 67, and 100%, respectively. Preoperative serum total bilirubin (TB), cholinesterase (ChE), and CPB time were defined as predictors to differentiate survivors and nonsurvivors. Conclusion: Child-Pugh class is related to morbidity and mortality after open-heart surgery in patients with LC. But CPB surgery is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced LC. The increased serum level of TB and the low serum concentration of ChE preoperatively, and the prolonged CPB time were found to be predictors of outcome in patients with LC undergoing open heart surgery.

34248342606	The preventative role of growth hormone on acute liver injury induced by cardiopulmonary bypass in a rat model	Objective: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced acute liver injury is a life-threatening complication after cardiac surgery and is thought to be associated with inflammatory response and acute-phase response (APR). Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) can modulate the APR and inflammatory response. Here, we tested the protective effect of GH on CPB-induced liver injury in the rat. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (group G, received 2.5 mg/kg of rhGH intramuscularly at 8 a.m. every 24 h for 3 days and just before the initiation of CPB; group C served as control) underwent CPB (120 min, 120 ml/kg per minute, 34 Â°C) and were killed 3 h after the termination of CPB. Results: Administration of rhGH markedly increased serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-I-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 compared with group C. Group G showed significantly lower serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin after CPB termination. Those receiving rhGH demonstrated a significant increase in serum prealbumin and serum transferrin and a marked decrease in serum amyloid A and serum C-reactive protein compared with group C. rhGH significantly decreased serum tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), whereas no changes were found for serum IL-6 and IL-10 compared with group C. rhGH significantly increased total liver protein content, hepatocyte proliferation, and decreased hepatocyte apoptosis versus group C. Conclusions: These results suggest that GH administration in rats seems to play a preventative role in acute liver injury associated with CPB via the decrease in acute-phase proteins, proinflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², and hepatocyte apoptosis, which is associated with increase in constitutive hepatic proteins, total liver protein content, and hepatocyte proliferation.

84867055503	eNOS correlates with mitochondrial biogenesis in hearts of congenital heart disease with cyanosis	Background: Mitochondrial biogenesis program in heart appears to exhibit adaptive remodeling following biomechanical and oxidative stress. The adaptive mechanisms that protect myocardium metabolism during hypoxia are coordinated in part by nitric oxide (NO). Objective: To observe mitochondrial biogenesis and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression in hearts of congenital heart disease with cyanosis, discuss mitochondrial response to chronic hypoxia in myocardium. Methods: 20 patients with cyanotic (n=10) or acyanotic cardiac defects (n=10) were investigated. Samples from the right ventricular outflow tract myocardium taken during operation were studied. Morphometric analysis of mitochondria was performed with transmission electron microscope. Relative mtDNA/nDNA ratio was determined with real-time PCR. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI), peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator-1Î± (PGC-1Î±), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) transcript levels were detected by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR. COXI and nNOS, iNOS and eNOS protein levels were measured with western blot. Results: Mitochondrial volume density (Vv) and numerical density (Nv) were significantly elevated in patients with cyanotic compared to acyanotic congenital heart disease. Elevated mtDNA and up-regulated COXI, PGC-1Î±, NRF1 and Tfam mRNA levels were observed in cyanotic patients. Protein levels of COXI and eNOS were significantly higher in the myocardium of cyanotic than of acyanotic patients. PGC-1Î± transcript levels correlated with the levels of eNOS. Conclusion: Mitochondrial biogenesis is activated in right ventricular outflow tract myocardium in congenital heart disease with cyanosis, which could be the adaptive response to chronic hypoxia and possibly involves eNOS up-regulation.

84876809322	A Rabbit Model to Study Regression of Ventricular Hypertrophy	Background: The purpose of this study is to develop and characterise a reproducible rabbit model of LVH regression following pressure-induced myocardial hypertrophy. Materials and methods: Without endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, a median sternotomy was performed. The median incision was made exactly along the midline of the sternum. Ascending aortic diameter was reduced 50% above the aortic valve, which lead to an approximate 75% reduction in crosssectional area. The sham-operated rabbits underwent the same procedures without actual ligation of the aorta. The animals of early DB group and late DB group were subjected to the second operation for removing the ligation eight weeks or 16 weeks after the initial banding surgery, respectively. Echocardiography, haemodynamic assessment, histology, and electron microscopy were used to assess functional and structural aspects of myocardial hypertrophy at each time point. Results: The pressure overload resulted in robust LVH assessed by echocardiography, haemodynamic assessment, LV weight/body weight ratios, histology, and electron microscopy. Ascending aortic debanding completely or partially reversed LVH. The degree of LVH regression was association with the duration of pressure overload, proved by the fact that restoration of LV structure and function was complete in animals subjected to eight weeks of aortic banding but incomplete in animals subjected to 16 weeks of aortic banding. The animals did not experience severe mechanical ventilatory impairment. Conclusions: These results demonstrate an efficient and reproducible method of promoting LVH regression in rabbits without endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

84887970142	The application of on-pump beating-heart surgery for partial atrioventricular septal defect: A report of 87 cases	Background: Partial atrioventricular septal defect (P-AVSD) is a common congenital heart disease. Because of the presence of left and right atrioventricular valve deformities and the shift in the atrioventricular node and cardiac conduction bundle, the surgical repair of P-AVSD is difficult. This study was performed to compare the effects on the coronary sinus septum in the left versus the right atrium during surgical treatment for P-AVSD and report our experiences regarding the application of on-pump beating heart surgery under mild hypothermia for patients with P-AVSD. Materials and Methods: The effects of on-pump beating heart surgery were analyzed retrospectively in 87 P-AVSD patients. Of the 87 total patients, 84 with anterior mitral leaflet cleft underwent valvuloplasty and 3 underwent mitral valve replacement. Seventy-seven patients underwent tricuspid valve annuloplasty, 2 underwent tricuspid valve replacement, and 1 underwent left superior vena cava ligation, and 3 patients with atrial fibrillation were treated with radiofrequency ablation. Patients with an ostium primum atrial septal defect underwent autologous pericardial modified Kirklin repair. Of these, 46 patients had their coronary sinus septum separated into the left atrium and 41 had their coronary sinus retained in the right atrium. Fingertip oxygen saturation was compared between patients in whom the coronary sinus was separated to the left atrium and those in whom the coronary sinus was retained in the right atrium. Results: There was 1 postoperative early death (1.15%) due to respiratory failure, and 1 patient had a III degree atrioventricular block (1.15%) and underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker. The fingertip oxygen saturation levels of the left atrium group were 96.81 Â± 3.17 preoperatively, 95.37 Â± 4.62 at 7 days postoperatively, and 94.53 Â± 4.95 at 3 months postoperatively. Those of the right atrium group were 98.53 Â± 2.84 preoperatively, 97.19 Â± 3.57 at 7 days postoperatively, and 96.89 Â± 4.19 at 3 months postoperatively. During the follow-up period, which ranged from 3 months to 7 years, the cardiac function was adequately restored. Conclusions: On-pump beating heart surgery under mild hypothermia is a safe and feasible method. The retention of the coronary sinus in the right atrium might maintain oxygen saturation.

84908594099	Liver X receptor activation protects against inflammation and enhances autophagy in myocardium of neonatal mouse challenged by lipopolysaccharides	Liver X receptors (LXRs) has been emerged as negative regulators of cardiomyocytic inflammation. The cellular process of autophagy is believed to play a protective role in myocardium during the inflammatory status. In this study, we investigated the role of LXRs agonist TO901317 (TO) on lipopolysaccha-rides (LPS)-induced myocardial inflammation and autophagy. The results showed that TO pretreatment significantly reduced the LPS-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, elevation of NF-ÎºB protein, TNF-Î±, and IL-6 mRNA levels in the myocardium. Moreover, LPS stimulated autophagy in neonatal mice heart, and this effect was further enhanced by TO pretreatment as evidenced by increased LC3-II/GAPDH ratio increment. Furthermore, TUNEL assay revealed LPS stimulation also increased the number of apoptotic cells in the myocardium, and the increment was inhibited by TO pretreatment. Our findings suggested that attenuation of inflammation and apoptosis, and enhancement of autophagy by TO may contribute to the protection of myocardium under inflammatory condition.

43249114423	Application of modified ultrafiltration in infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass	Objective: Infants are usually subjected to serious complications after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a modified ultrafiltration technique (MUF) on infants undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Methods: A total of 261 infants less than 1 year old with congenital heart disease and who required CPB were randomized into receive MUF during CPB (n = 205) or not (n = 56, control group). Bypass duration, aortic cross-clamp duration, postoperative blood effluents and transfusions, mechanical ventilation duration following operation, and hematocrit and oxygenation index 24 hrs postoperatively were compared between the two groups. Results: No ultrafiltration-related complication was found in the MUF group. There were no significant differences in the duration of bypass and aortic cross-clamp between the two groups. Postoperative blood effluents and transfusions in the MFU group were significantly reduced (79.5 Â± 18.6 mL vs 57.3 Â± 15.4 mL and 78.1 Â± 32.5 mL vs 67.9 Â± 25.6 mL respectively) compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The duration of mechanical ventilation following operation in the MFU group was shorter than that in the control group (28.6 Â± 9.1 hrs vs 32.3 Â± 8.7 hrs; P < 0.05). MUF produced a significant improvement in hematocrit (34.6 Â± 3.7 min vs 29.8 Â± 2.8 min; P <0.01) and oxygenation index (275.2 Â± 39. 1 vs 202.2 Â± 25.6; P < 0.01) 24 hrs postoperatively when compared with the control group. Conclusions: MFU can reduce postoperative bleeding and blood transfusions, improve pulmonary function and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation in infants undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.

55049116070	Anomalous origin of left pulmonary artery branch from the aorta with fallot's tetralogy	We report the case of a ten-year-old boy who had often presented with respiratory distress since birth. Chest X-ray showed an enlarged right ventricle. Echocardiography demonstrated TGE characteristic features of Fallot's tetralogy and the left pulmonary artery could not be visualized. However, cardiac catherization disclosed that the left pulmonary artery had an anomalous origin from the ascending aorta. The patient underwent total surgical correction of the defects. Nine days later, he was discharged. We present the results of a literature review of the incidence, physiopathological, clinical, diagnostic, and surgical characteristics of this rare disease.

63049119016	Anti-inflammatory effect of erythropoietin pretreatment on cardiomyocytes with hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and the possible mechanism	Objective: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of erythropoietin (EPO) pretreatment on cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury (H/R) and explore the possible mechanism. Methods: The cultured neonatal rats' ventricular cardiomyocytes were divided randomly into 4 groups, control group (C group), EPO pretreatment group (E group), EPO and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) pretreatment group (EP group) and PDTC pretreatment group (P group). After 24 hours' pretreatment, the cardiomyocytes were exposed to H/R. After pretreatment and H/R, the expression of tumor necrosis factor- a (TNF- Î±) gene in all the groups was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The nuclear factor- Îº B (NF- Îº B) activity was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and the inhibitor- Îº BÎ± (I- Îº B Î±) protein level was detected by Western blot. Results: The decrement of I- Îº B Î± protein and the increasing NF- ÎºB activity were found in cardiomyocytes pretreated with EPO before H/R compared to other groups (t=-3.321, 4.183, P<0.01). However, after H/R, NF-ÎºB activity and expression of TNF- Î± gene were significantly reduced, I-Îº B Î± protein expression was increased in cardiomyocytes of E group compared to other groups (t=-3.425, 3.687, 3.454, P<0.01). All theses changes caused by EPO pretreatment were eliminated by the intervention of PDTC (an antagonist to NF- ÎºB) during pretreatment. Conclusions: EPO pretreatment can inhibit the activation of NF- Îº B and upregulation of TNF- Î± gene in cardiomyocytes exposed to H/R through a negative feedback of NF- Îº B signaling pathway, and thus produces the anti-inflammatory effect. This might be one of the ways EPO produces the anti-inflammatory effect.

67249093754	Tacrolimus Versus Cyclosporine for Adult Lung Transplant Recipients: A Meta-Analysis	Background: Tacrolimus and cyclosporine are the 2 major immunosuppressants for lung transplantation. Several studies have compared these 2 drugs, but the outcomes were not consistent. The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to compare the beneficial and harmful effects of tacrolimus and cyclosporine as the primary immunosuppressant for lung transplant recipients. Methods: We conducted searches of electronic databases and manual bibliographies. We performed a meta-analysis of all RCTs comparing tacrolimus with cyclosporine as primary immunosuppression for lung transplant recipients. Extracted, pooled data for mortality, acute rejection, withdrawals, and adverse events were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel tests with a random effects model. Results: Three RCTs including 297 patients were assessed in this study. Mortality at 1 year or more was comparable between lung recipients treated with tacrolimus and cyclosporine (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-2.10; P = .88). Tacrolimus-treated patients experienced fewer incidences of acute rejection (MD = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.01; P = .04). Pooled analysis showed a trend toward a lower risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) among tacrolimus-treated patients, although it did not reach significances (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.12; P = .10). Fewer patients stopped tacrolimus than cyclosporine (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.48; P = .003). The rate of new-onset diabetes was higher among the tacrolimus group (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.17-11.62; P = .03). The incidence of hypertension and renal dysfunction were comparable in these 2 groups (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.03-1.70; P = .15; and OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.70-3.96; P = .25, respectively). There was a trend toward lower risk of malignancy in tacrolimus-treated patients, although it did not reach significance either (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-1.13; P = .07). The incidence of infection was comparable in these 2 groups (MD = -0.29, 95% CI, -0.68 to 0.11; P = .16). Conclusion: Using tacrolimus as primary immunosuppressant for lung transplant recipient resulted in comparable survival and reduction in acute rejection episodes when compared with cyclosporine.

67349161511	Increase of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) expression in cardiomyocytes during chronic hypoxia	Background: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) might play an important role in the myocardium during chronic hypoxia because MIF protects the heart during myocardial ischemia by activating 5â²-adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). Methods: We investigated 35 infants with cyanotic or acyanotic cardiac defects and H9c2 embryonic rat cardiomyocytes to examine the effect of chronic hypoxia on the expression of MIF in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Results: We found out an increase of endogenous cardiac MIF expression positively correlated with degree of hypoxia. Also, AMPK activation was elevated while MIF expression was increased in cells exposed to long periods of hypoxia in vitro. There was no significant difference in the growth ratio of cells cultivated in long periods of hypoxia and normoxia. Conclusions: The expression of MIF is significantly increased in cardiomyocytes exposed to chronic hypoxia, and the activation of AMPK was increased accordingly. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

70350074650	Thrombus precursor protein for monitoring anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valve prosthesis	Objective: To evaluate the plasma concentration of thrombus precursor protein (TPP) in patients after mechanical heart valve replacement, and to explore whether it can be used as a marker for monitoring anticoagulation. Methods: Totally 60 patients who took warfarin after mitral valve replacement and 20 control patients with non-valvular heart diseases were subjected in this study. Their plasma TPP concentration and international normalized ratio (INR) were determined, and compared not only between the anticoagulant patients and the control patients, but also between the patients with atrial fibrillaiton (AF, n=37) and the patients with sinus rhythm (SR, n=23) after mechanical valve replacement. The relationship between plasma TPP concentration and INR in the 60 anticoagulant patients was analyzed with linear regression. Results: It was found that the anticoagulant therapy effectively decreased plasma TPP concentration and elevated INR. In the anticoagulant group, the patients with AF had higher plasma TPP concentration than the others with sinus rhythm (P<0.05), although there was no significant difference in INR level between these 2 groups of patients (P>0.05). No significant correlation was found between plasma TPP concentration and INR in the anticoagulant patients (P>0.05). INR did not accord with plasma TPP concentration in several patients. Conclusion: INR can't reflect the coagulation status and guide the anticoagulation correctly sometimes; TPP may be a valuable assistant marker for monitoring anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valve prothesis; Patients with AF may require higher density of anticoagulation and TPP is strongly suggested to be monitored in these patients.

77749242813	An animal model of ascending aortic Stenosis in rabbits without endotracheal intubation	Background and Aim: Experimental animal studies of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) usually involve endotracheal intubation, which is associated with a risk of serious tracheal injury and other significant negative sequelae. We developed an animal model of pressure overload hypertrophy caused by constriction of the ascending aorta in rabbits that does not require endotracheal intubation. Methods: New Zealand White rabbits of either sex (1.94 Â± 0.12 kg) were randomly assigned to the aortic banding (AB) group (n = 9) and the sham-operated group (n = 8). The sternum was carefully incised along the midline to avoid injury to the parietal pleura. Then, the intervention group underwent AB with three to zero Prolene proximal to the innominate artery without endotracheal intubation. To investigate the effects of the surgical procedure on physiological parameters, echocardiography, histology, and electron microscopy were performed to assess functional and structural hypertrophy at various time intervals. Results: Banding of the ascending aorta created the expected increases in both aortic velocity and the pressure gradient between proximal and distal aorta coarctation. The pressure overload resulted in a robust LVH assessed by transthoracic echocardiography and histology. The animals did not experience severe mechanical ventilatory impairment. Conclusion: We developed a safe, efficient, and reproducible method of producing LVH in rabbits without the need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Ultimately, this model will facilitate focused study of the mechanisms involved with LVH progression. Â© 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77949488380	Warm versus cold cardioplegia for heart surgery: a meta-analysis	Much controversy persists regarding the optimal techniques for myocardial protection during heart surgery. Numerous studies have compared warm cardioplegia with cold cardioplegia for myocardial preservation, but the outcomes were inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was to compare the beneficial and harmful effects of warm and cold cardioplegia during heart surgery. Electronic databases and manual bibliographical searches were conducted. A meta-analysis of all RCTs comparing warm cardioplegia to cold cardioplegia perfusion during cardiac surgery was performed. Data for clinical events (in-hospital death, myocardial infarction (MI), low output syndrome, postoperative use of intra-aortic balloon pump, stroke and atrial fibrillation), postoperative cardiac index, postoperative creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin release were extracted, and we summarised the combined results of the data of the RCTs as relative risk (RR), with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 41 RCTs including 5879 patients were assessed in this study. We found that there was no statistical difference between patients receiving warm cardioplegia and cold cardioplegia in the incidences of clinical events. Warm cardioplegia was associated with improved postoperative cardiac index. CK-MB and cardiac troponin concentrations after surgery were significantly lower in the warm group as compared with the cold group. Using warm cardioplegia for myocardial protection during heart surgery resulted in similar incidences of clinical events, significant improvement in postoperative cardiac index and reduction in postoperative enzyme release as compared with cold cardioplegia.

78649322561	VKORC1-1639G>A, CYP2C9, EPHX1691A>G genotype, body weight, and age are important predictors for warfarin maintenance doses in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses in southwest China	Objective: To investigate the contribution of genetic polymorphisms of vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 gene VKORC1-1639G>A, cytochrome P450 2C9 gene (CYP2C9), EPHXI, and clinical factors to warfarin sensitivity in southwest Chinese Han patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses. Methods: A total of 127 patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses who have been followed up at our department during the past 23 years were enrolled in this study and compared to a control group that consisted of 133 randomly selected healthy blood donors. These Chinese patients met stable warfarin dosage requirements and had reached the target international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5-2.0. PCR and direct sequencing were carried out to identify the polymorphisms of VKORC1-1639G>A (rs9923231), CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), CYP2C9 IVS3-65G>C (rs9332127), and EPHX1691A>G (rs4653436). In addition, total and free (non-protein-bound) warfarin concentrations were analyzed. Results and conclusions: There were great interindividual differences in warfarin maintenance dosage (ranging from 0.6 to 8.4 mg/day) among the 127 patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses. VKORC1-1639G>A, CYP2C9, EPHX1691A>G polymorphism, body weight, and age were found to affect the dose demands. Multiple linear regression models incorporating genetic polymorphisms of VKORC1, CYP2C9, EPHX1691A>G, and the nongenetic factors of age and body weight were developed, and explained up to 76.8% of the total variation (adjusted R

79953836707	Hypoxia-induced SOCS3 is limiting STAT3 phosphorylation and NF-ÎºB activation in congenital heart disease	Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a critical attenuator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and it is involved in mediating the intensity and duration of STAT3 activation in the process of myocardial protection. Nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) has emerged as a decisive transcription factor in cardiac myocyte compensatory responses to stress that enhance survival. However, the expression, activation and regulation of this signaling molecule in response to hypoxic stress have not been elucidated. We investigated 40 infants with cyanotic or acyanotic cardiac defects, as well as H9c2 embryonic rat cardiomyocytes, to examine the effect of hypoxia on the expression or activation of SOCS3, STAT3 and NF-ÎºB in vivo and in vitro. We found an increase in endogenous cardiac SOCS3, p-STAT3 and AC-RelA activation in the myocardium of infants with cyanotic cardiac defects. In hypoxic cultivated H9c2 cells, SOCS3, STAT3 and AC-RelA activity slowly increased and then reached a stable expression. We evaluated the interaction of SOCS3 with STAT3 and NF-ÎºB by transfecting the SOCS3 plasmid to hypoxic cultured H9c2 cells. Forced expression of SOCS3 suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and transcription of the C-myc and interleukin-6 genes. AC-RelA activation was also suppressed by over expression of SOCS3. These findings suggest that the mechanism of a positive transactivation loop that maintains higher levels of NF-ÎºB and p-STAT3 and the negative feedback factor SOCS3, which maintains balanced NF-ÎºB and p-STAT3 activities, is important in the process of myocardial adaptation to chronic hypoxia. SOCS3 is a rapid hypoxia inducible gene and acts to inhibit activation of the cellular signaling pathway in a classical negative feedback loop. Upregulated SOCS3 might play an important role in cardiocytes during chronic hypoxia as SOCS3 regulates cell signaling crosstalking between NF-ÎºB and p-STAT3 under stressful conditions.

79955675608	Glucose-insulin-potassium therapy in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery: A meta-analysis	Glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) has long been used as adjuvant treatment for patients with serious cardiovascular disease. Although many studies have reported their results based on GIK therapy in the setting of heart surgery, the outcomes remain controversial and inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to determine the clinical effects of GIK in adult cardiac surgery patients. Electronic databases and manual bibliographical searches were conducted. A meta-analysis of all RCTs comparing GIK with control in heart surgery was performed. Data for all-causes mortality (within 2 months after surgery), perioperative myocardial infarction, postoperative inotropic support, atrial fibrillation, cardiac index, durations of intensive unit care stay and total hospital stay were extracted, and we summarized the combined results of the data of the RCTs as relative risk (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 33 RCTs including 2113 patients were assessed in this study. GIK infusion was associated with significantly fewer perioperative myocardial infarctions (RR. =0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.95), less inotropic support requirement (RR. =0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.96), better postoperative cardiac index (weighted mean difference (WMD). =0.43, 95% CI 0.31-0.55), and reduced length of stay in the intensive care unit (WMD. =-7.96, 95% CI -13.36 to -2.55). Further analysis showed that diabetic patients were benefited from GIK with glycemic control, but not GIK infusion without glucose control. GIK significantly reduced myocardial injury and improved hemodynamic performance in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Glycemic control with GIK might be required for cardiac surgery patients with diabetes. Â© 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

79958065282	Long-term diazoxide preconditioning attenuates the cardioprotective effect against isoproterenol induced myocardial injury in a rat model	Short-term diazoxide (DZ) preconditioning exerts efficient protective effect on myocardial ischemia injury. This study aimed to investigate the effects of long term DZ preconditioning on isoproterenol (ISO) induced myocardial injury. DZ (20 mg/kg/d) was intraperitoneally injected into rats for different durations (1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 w) and myocardial injury was then introduced through intraperitoneal injection of ISO. The mitochondrial respiratory function and the cardiac troponin (cTnI) level in the blood were measured. In addition, the mRNA and protein expressions of SUR2A were detected. After DZ preconditioning for 1~4 w, the myocardial protective effect was observed in this ISO induced myocardial injury model and was similar to that after 3 days of DZ preconditioning. After DZ preconditioning for 6 to 8 w, the protective effect was markedly attenuated, characterized by impaired mitochondrial respiratory function and increased blood cTnI level. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and western blot assay revealed no significant difference in the mRNA and protein expressions of SUR2A among groups. Long term DZ preconditioning (â¥6 w) may attenuate the protective effect against the ISO induced myocardial injury, which might be associated with the persistent opening of mitochondrial ATP sensitive potassium channel.

80051721082	Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappa B pathway is involved in myocardial injury in a rat chronic stress model	Chronic stress is considered to predispose to various cardiovascular events such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and even heart failure. In this study, rats were exposed to stress for 1 day, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks to establish a chronic stress model. A specific toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist eritoran was used to block the activity of TLR4. On the second day after the last stress exposure, the animals were killed. The expression of TLR4 mRNA and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) DNA-binding activity in the myocardium were measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interleukin (IL-6) in myocardium were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Myocardial injury was evident after chronic stress for 2 weeks. The TLR4 mRNA expression reached a peak after stress for 1 week. It was sustained at a stable level after stress exposure for 3 weeks and was restored to a nearly normal level in the fourth week. NF-ÎºB DNA-binding activity was significantly enhanced after the stress for 1 day and markedly enhanced again after a 2-week stress exposure. It was weakened and reached a normal level after stress exposure for 4 weeks. The levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6 gradually increased and reached peaks after stress for 4 weeks. Meanwhile, eritoran significantly decreased the TLR4 mRNA expression and NF-ÎºB activity in rats from the 2-week stress group. However, it did not downregulate the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6. Importantly, it significantly improved the myocardial injury induced by the chronic stress. In conclusion, TLR4/NF-ÎºB participates in myocardial injury during chronic stress.

80052366719	Predictors of in-hospital mortality in children after long-term ventricular assist device insertion	Objectives: This study aimed to determine the pre-implantation predictors for in-hospital mortality in children with ventricular assist device (VAD) support. Background: Candidate selection is of critical importance for improved outcomes in patients supported with VAD. However, risk factors for post-VAD survival in children are still not clearly understood. Methods: From June 1996 to December 2009, 92 children underwent implantation of a long-term VAD at Germany Heart Institute Berlin. Data on all these patients were retrospectively analyzed, and pre-operative risk factors for in-hospital survival after VAD implantation were identified by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of the 92 subjects, the median age at implantation was 7 years (range 12 days to 18 years), and the median support time was 35 days (range 1 to 591 days). The overall survival rate to transplantation or recovery of ventricular function was 63%. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in children included congenital etiology (odds ratio [OR]: 11.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 to 47.5), norepinephrine requirement (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 1.4 to 31), C-reactive protein level >6.3 mg/dl (OR: 4.9; 95% CI: 1.1 to 22.1), and central venous pressure >17 mm Hg (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 20). Conclusions: Congenital etiology, pre-operative norepinephrine requirement, higher serum C-reactive protein, and central venous pressure were associated with increased in-hospital mortality in children with VAD support. Optimal candidate selection and timing of VAD insertion may be of great importance for improved outcomes in children with advanced heart failure. Â© 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

84860309546	Pivotal role of activating transcription factor 6Î± in myocardial adaptation to chronic hypoxia	Hypoxic states are generally associated with cardiovascular disease. Adaptation to chronic hypoxia is one well-defined means of improving cardiac tolerance to certain kinds of stresses. However, the details of the mechanisms underlying myocardial adaptation to chronic hypoxia are still poorly understood. Hypoxia stresses the endoplasmic reticulum and activates unfolded protein response. However, the behavior of individual signaling pathways can vary markedly over time. By examining myocardial samples from patients with cyanotic congenital cardiac defects, we detected endoplasmic reticulum stress and found that, out of all the components of the unfolded protein response, only activating transcription factor 6Î± limb was activated in cyanotic patients. The activation of activating transcription factor 6Î± and expression of glucose regulated protein 78 were notably induced in cardiac myocytes cultured for prolonged hypoxia (1% O

84863084830	Cardioprotective effect of mangiferin on left ventricular remodeling in rats	The purpose of this study was to clarify the protective role of mangiferin on postinfarction myocardial remodeling and potential mechanisms. The myocardial infarction (MI) model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cardiac function, myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis, serum tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were examined by echocardiography, histological staining, ELISA and Western blot, respectively. Mangiferin attenuated MI and prevented the development of intercellular fibrosis. Western blotting underscores that the p38 MAPK cascade plays an important role in the cardioprotective effect of mangiferin during MI. Inhibition of p38 MAPK significantly decreased serum TNF-Î± levels. Transferase-mediated uridine nick end labeling and Masson staining also showed that mangiferin reduced apoptosis and fibrosis in myocardium remodeling. Based on these results, we conclude that mangiferin has a therapeutic effect on post-MI left ventricular remodeling and improves cardiac function. Copyright Â© 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84866129374	Application of lower sternal incision with on-pump, beating heart intracardiac procedures in congenital heart disease	Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the application of lower sternal incision with on-pump, beating heart intracardiac procedures for the treatment of congenital heart disease. Methods: A total of 106 cases with congenital heart disease were performed with lower sternal incision under the beating heart condition. The sternum was sawed open to the third sternocostal joint through a small incision in the lower sternum. Cardiopulmonary bypass was developed without aortic cross-clamping. The simultaneous left atrium and ventricle suction and integrating sequential deairing procedure was established to improve the exposure of the surgical field and intraoperative de-airing. We also randomly selected 100 patients with similar disease and age as controls. These control patients underwent middle sternal incision surgery with arresting heart. Results: The results showed that all the patients were successfully completed with the surgery without death and serious complications, eg, air embolism, residual shunt, and complete atrioventricular block. The operative and cardiopulmonary bypass time in the experimental group was not significantly different from that in the control group. The length of the skin incision in the experimental group was shortened by 4.8 cm compared to that in the control group. The incidence of sternal deformity in patients under 3 years old in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Conclusions: Lower sternal incision with beating heart can reduce the surgical injury, simplify the operation procedure, and improve the therapeutic efficacy. It is a safe and effective approach for the treatment of congenital heart disease. Â© 2012 Forum Multimedia Publishing, LLC.

This study was to investigate the feasibility of total preservation of the leaflet and subvalvular apparatus at the native anatomic position during MVR in a rheumatic population with enlarged left ventricular chamber. Material and Methods: The techniques of valvular apparatus preservation used during MVR with or without aortic valve replacement were investigated in 128 patients with an enlarged left ventricular chamber suffering from rheumatic mitral regurgitation between October 2003 and December 2007. Seventy patients had the anterior leaflet and subvalvular apparatus excised but the posterior leaflet and subvlvular apparatus preserved during the mitral valve replacement (P-MVR group), and 58 patients had the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets and the subvalvalur apparatus completely preserved at the native anatomical position during the mitral valve replacement (C-MVR group). Echocardiography was performed preoperatively, at discharge, and after 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years to determine the left ventricular dimensions and function. Results: There were 2 cases (3.4%) of early death in the C-MVR group, and there were 4 cases (5.7%) of early death in the P-MVR group. There were 3 cases of late death 1 year after surgery, of which 1 case in the C-MVR group was caused by congestive heart failure and the other 2 cases in the P-MVR group were due to sudden death. Both groups exhibited significant improvement (P < .05) in left ventricular function instantly and late postoperatively. The reduction of the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was more significant in the C-MVR group as compared to the P-MVR group (P < .05). A statistically significant increase in fractional shortening (FS) occurred in the C-MVR group compared to the P-MVR group. Conclusion: This study shows that complete mitral leaflet preservation at the native anatomical position during MVR is feasible in rheumatic patients with an enlarged left ventricular chamber and confers significant short-term and long-term advantages by preserving left ventricular function and geometry. Therefore, it is a safe, simple, and effective surgical technique and should be individualized during clinical use. Â© 2013 Forum Multimedia Publishing, LLC.

84884418751	Primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot in infants: Transatrial/ transpulmonary or transventricular approach	Objective: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Transatrial/transpulmonary repair avoids a ventriculotomy (in contrast to the transventricular approach) in order to preserve the structure and function of the right ventricle. We performed a pilot prospective randomized controlled trial in infants with TOF undergoing primary repair. Methods: A pilot prospective controlled clinical trial was conducted in infants with TOF undergoing primary repair between January 2008 and December 2009. One hundred and six patients were recruited in the trial and divided into a transatrial-transpulmonary approach group (Group A; n = 53) and a transventricular approach group (Group B; n = 53), depending on the different surgical techniques used. Results: Preoperative patient characteristics and procedure-related variables were similar. There were no deaths in Group A, while two patients died in Group B. There were significant differences in cardiopulmonary bypass time (95.02 Â± 23.8 vs. 85.23 Â± 22.63 minutes, p = 0.032), cross-clamp time (69.4 Â± 10.36 vs. 61.17 Â± 9.38 minutes, p = 0.035), inotropic support (1.63 Â± 0.97 vs. 2.1 Â± 1.09 days, p = 0.02), intubation time (26.62 Â± 12.48 vs. 33.02 Â± 17.55 hours, p = 0.033), duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (2.25 Â± 1.28 vs. 2.85 Â± 1.46 days, p = 0.026), and the incidence of arrhythmia [3 patients (5.7%) vs. 10 patients (18.9%), p = 0.038]. No significant differences in right/left ventricular pressure ratio and hospital stay were observed. Conclusion: Transatrial/transpulmonary repair of TOF is associated with excellent surgical results and immediately follow-up. Â© 2012, Asian Surgical Association. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

84888827430	MiR-138 protects cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-induced apoptosis via MLK3/JNK/c-jun pathway	Cardiomyocytes experience a series of complex endogenous regulatory mechanisms against apoptosis induced by chronic hypoxia. MicroRNAs are a class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate cellular pathophysiological processes. Recently, microRNA-138 (miR-138) has been found related to hypoxia, and beneficial for cell proliferation. Therefore, we intend to study the role of miR-138 in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and the main mechanism. Myocardial samples of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) were collected to test miR-138 expression. Agomir or antagomir of miR-138 was transfected into H9C2 cells to investigate its effect on cell apoptosis. Higher miR-138 expression was observed in patients with cyanotic CHD, and its expression gradually increased with prolonged hypoxia time in H9C2 cells. Using MTT and LDH assays, cell growth was significantly greater in the agomir group than in the negative control (NC) group, while antagomir decreased cell survival. Dual luciferase reporter gene and Western-blot results confirmed MLK3 was a direct target of miR-138. It was found that miR-138 attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis using TUNEL, Hoechst staining and Annexin V-PE/7-AAD flow cytometry analysis. We further detected expression of apoptosis-related proteins. In the agomir group, the level of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-PARP and Bad significantly reduced, while Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax ratio increased. Opposite changes were observed in the antagomir group. Downstream targets of MLK3, JNK and c-jun, were also suppressed by miR-138. Our study demonstrates that up-regulation of miR-138 plays a protective role in myocardial adaptation to chronic hypoxia, which is mediated mainly by MLK3/JNK/c-jun signaling pathway.

84900296227	Emergent endovascular vs. open surgery repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms: A meta-analysis	Objectives: To systematically review studies comparing peri-operative mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) to patients who underwent open surgical repair (OSR). Methods: The Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until Apr 30, 2013 using keywords such as abdominal aortic aneurysm, emergent, emergency, rupture, leaking, acute, endovascular, stent, graft, and endoscopic. The primary outcome was peri-operative mortality and the secondary outcome was length of hospital stay. Results: A total of 18 studies (2 randomized controlled trials, 5 prospective studies, and 11 retrospective studies) with a total of 135,734 rAAA patients were included. rAAA patients who underwent EVAR had significantly lower peri-operative mortality compared to those who underwent OSR (overall OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.67, P<0.001). rAAA patients with EVAR also had a significantly shorter mean length of hospital stay compared to those with OSR (difference in mean length of stay ranged from -2.00 to -19.10 days, with the overall estimate being -5.25 days (95% CI = -9.23 to -1.26, P = 0.010). There was no publication bias and sensitivity analysis showed good reliability. Conclusions: EVAR confers significant benefits in terms of peri-operative mortality and length of hospital stay. There is a need for more randomized controlled trials to compare outcomes of EVAR and OSR for rAAA. Â© 2014 Qin et al.

84901772687	Bipolar radiofrequency ablation is useful for treating atrial fibrillation combined with heart valve diseases	Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhymia, and it results in increased risk of thromboembolism and decreased cardiac function. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, concomitant radiofrequency ablation to treat AF is effective in restoring sinus rhythm (SR). This study is an observational cohort study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of bipolar radiofrequency ablation (BRFA) for treating AF combined with heart valve diseases. Methods. Clinical data were analyzed retrospectively from 324 cases of rheumatic heart disease combined with persistent AF patients who underwent valve replacement concomitant BRFA. The modified left atrial and the simplified right atrial ablation were used for AF treatments. Of the 324 patients, 248 patients underwent mitral valve replacement and 76 patients underwent double valve replacement. Meanwhile, 54 patients underwent concomitant thrombectomy and 97 underwent tricuspid valvuloplasty. And all of them received temporary pacemaker implantation. The 24 hours holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and echocardiography was performed before the operation, on the first day after operation, on discharge day, and at 6 and 12 months after operation. Results: There were 299 patients with SR on the first day after operation (92.30%), 12 patients with junctional rhythm (3.70%), 11 patients with AF (3.39%), and 2 patients with atrial flutter (0.62%). The temporary pacemaker was used in 213 patients (65.74%) with heart rates less than 70 beat/minute in the ICU. Two patients died early and the mortality rate was 0.62%. Two patients had left ventricular rupture and the occurrence rate was 0.62%. They both recovered. There was no degree III atrioventricular blockage and no permanent pacemaker implantation. Overall survival rate was 99.38% (322 cases) with SR conversion rate of 89.13% (287 cases) at discharge. The SR conversion rate was 87.54% and 87.01% at 6 and 12 months after operation. Sinus bradycardia occurred in 3.42% of patients at 6 months after operation and in 3.03% of patients at 12 months after operation. Echocardiography showed that the left atrial diameter was significantly decreased, and ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly improved. Conclusions: BRFA for treating AF in concomitant valve replacement is safe and with good efficacy. Â© 2014 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84902546497	Identification of differently expressed genes and small molecule drugs for tetralogy of Fallot by bioinformatics strategy	This study aimed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore small molecule drugs for Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The gene expression profile of TOF GSE26125 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 16 idiopathic TOF samples and five healthy controls. The DEGs were identified by the Limma package in R language and underwent functional enrichment analysis via Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery tools. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was then constructed and the significant clusters were selected for functional analysis. In addition, the DEGs were mapped to the connectivity map (CMap) database to identify potential small-molecule drugs. As a result, a total of 499 DEGs were selected between TOF and healthy controls. Meanwhile, the functional changes of DEGs related to TOF were mainly associated with cellular respiration and energy metabolism. Furthermore, in the PPI network, two clusters were identified via cluster 1 analysis. And only cluster 1 was significantly enriched into gene ontology terms, including respiratory chain, electron transport chain, and oxidation reduction. The hub gene of cluster 1 was NDUFAB1. Additionally, small molecules, such as harmine, solanine, and testosterone, may have the potential to repair the disordered metabolic pathways of TOF. Â© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

84902287960	On-pump with beating heart for mitral valve replacement in 814 cases	Background: As a effective operative alternative, great efforts were paid to develop and improve the on-pump beating heart technique in recently. This study to assess the outcome of mitral valve replacement and discuss the risk factors of cardiac valve surgery under mild hypothermia on-pump beating heart. Methods: From Nov 1996 to Jul 2011, 814 cases of mitral valve replacement were carried out in our institute. Of 814 cases, there were 310 male and 504 female, with age range from 8 to 69 years. The technique of on-pump with beating heart for replacement of mitral valve was described in detail and the clinical data were analysed retrospectively. Results: Of the 814 patients, concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty were performed in 225 of patients (27.64%), clearance of left atrial thrombus in 89 cases (10.93%), placating of giant left atrium in 72 cases (8.72%), and left atrial and simplified right atrial maze ablation by using AtricureTM bipolar radiofrequency ablation apparatus for persistent atrial fibrillation in 16 cases (1.97%). There were 12 patients died in the early postoperative stage with an early mortality rate of 1.47%. The causes of death were severe low output syndrome in 3 cases, ventricular fibrillation in 3 cases, hepatic failure in 2 cases, multiorgan failure in 2 cases, pulmonary failure in 1 case, and prosthetic valve dysfunction in 1 case. Severe postoperative complications occurred 67 cases (8.23%) which included low output syndrome, re-exploration, poststernal infection, pulmonary failure, hepatic failure, multiorgan failure, and fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Conclusions: This study shows that onpump beating heart results in satisfying clinical outcome in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement. It offers a alterative options of effective and safe myocardial protection, and offers a safe, practical option especially in patients with severe critical valvular disorder.

84904501755	Can serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and phosphate predict cardiovascular diseases and total mortality in individuals with preserved renal function? A systemic review and meta-analysis	Background: It is demonstrated that elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and phosphate indicate a higher risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality in population with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but it remains unclear whether this association exists in people with normal or preserved renal function. Method: Clinical trials were searched from Embase and PubMed from inception to 2013 December using the keywords "ALP", "phosphate", "CVD", "mortality" and so on, and finally 24 trials with a total of 147634 patients were included in this study. Dose-response and semi-parametric meta-analyses were performed. Results: A linear association of serum levels of ALP and phosphate with risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) events, CVD events and deaths was identified. The relative risk(RR)of ALP for CVD deaths was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.04). The RR of phosphate for CVD deaths and events was 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02-1.09) and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03-1.06), respectively. A non-linear association of ALP and phosphate with total mortality was identified. Compared with the reference category of ALP and phosphate, the pooled RR of ALP for total mortality was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.27-1.95) for the high ALP group, while the RR of phosphate for total mortality was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.21-1.46) for the high phosphate group. It was observed in subgroup analysis that higher levels of serum ALP and phosphate seemed to indicate a higher mortality rate in diabetic patients and those having previous CVD. The higher total mortality rate was more obvious in the men and Asians with high ALP. Conclusion: A non-linear relationship exists between serum levels of ALP and phosphate and risk of total mortality. There appears to be a positive association of serum levels of ALP/phosphate with total mortality in people with normal or preserved renal function, while the relationship between ALP and CVD is still ambiguous.

84908099412	Association of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) with subclinical atherosclerosis: A systemic review and meta-analysis	Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is increasingly used as a noninvasive marker for subclinical atherosclerosis. Whether there is a direct correlation between GDM and elevated cIMT is still controversial.Methods: PubMed, Embase and reference lists of relevant papers were reviewed. Studies assessing the relationship between GDM and cIMT were included. Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) of cIMT was calculated using random-effect models. Results: Fifteen studies with a total of 2247 subjects were included in our analysis, giving a pooled WMD of 0.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 -0.07). Furthermore, meta regression and subgroup analysis found that the association between GDM and larger cIMT already existed during pregnancy, and this relation was stronger in obese GDM patients. Conclusions: GDM in and after pregnancy is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Weight control may be helpful to prevent cardiovascular diseases for GDM patients.

84911955006	Serum phosphate concentration and incidence of stroke: a systemic review and meta-analysis	Elevated serum phosphate is associated with cardiovascular and total mortality in patients with kidney diseases and healthy individuals. But whether serum phosphate is associated with stroke is controversial. We searched PubMed and Embase from January 1, 1970 to May 9, 2014 with keywords such as âserum phosphateâ, âserum phosphorusâ, and âstrokeâ. Doseâresponse meta-analysis was conducted. A restricted cubic spline model was used, and then we estimated pooled RR using generalized least square regression taking into account the correlation among categories of each study. Five studies with a total of 32,608 patients were included. We identified a linear relationship between serum phosphate and risk of stroke (P for non-linearity = 0.5258). The RR of phosphate (1 mg/dL) for stroke was 1.00 (95 % CI 0.97â1.05), similar results were observed in subgroup analysis. A linear relationship between serum phosphate and risk of stroke is identified. There is no association between serum level of phosphate and stroke.
