20344392203	Physi-ecoological responses of Avicennia marina to oil treatment	Avicennia marina simulated wetland system was set up in a greenhouse, consisting of one-year-old Avicennia marina-soil-water system. The Iran light crude oil with four various doses: 150mg (II), 300mg (III), 600mg (IV), 1200m(V) and water (CL) (I) have been discharged into wetlands twice a week for one year. The main achievements were described as follows: Treatment of oil dose of 150mg caused no harmful impact on nutrition and growth of Avicennia marina as well as bourgeon and growth of seedlings. Treatment of oil dose of 300mg and 600mg promoted significantly breed and growth of Avicennia marina. Oil Treatment of 1200mg dose restrained the breed and growth of Avicennia marina and the death rate was near 30%. Oil treatment of 150mg dose had little effect on the physi-ecoological indexes, such as vigor of root system, water content, catalase activity, free prolin content, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate of Avicennia marina. Oil treatment of 300mg and 600mg caused some changes on relative electric conductivity and free prolin content of leaves at initial stage. But the value of them gradually came back to the level of CL afterwards. Oil treatment of 300mg and 600mg dose made the chlorophyll content of leaves higher than that of CL, whereas vigor of root system, water content of leaves and catalase activity of leaves showed no obvious changes compared with those of CL. When treated with the dose of 1200mg, the physi-ecoological values above-mentioned had significant or very significant changes. At last, the conclusion was that oil treatment of 150mg dose for one year had no harmful impact on Avicennia marina. And 300mg and 600mg oil treatment can stimulated growth of these Avicennia marina. But the dose group of 1200mg can inhibited significantly growth of Avicennia marina, and many individuals died. In view of above study, it can be said that Avicennia marina had a strong resistance to oil.

0030666843	Response of Aegiceras corniculatum to synthetic sewage under simulated tidal conditions	Young plants of Aegiceras corniculatum, a dominant mangrove species, were collected from Futian Mangrove Swamp in Shenzhen, The People's Republic of China, and grown in simulated tide tanks containing mangrove sediments. After acclimatisation in the greenhouse for 6 months, the plants were irrigated with either synthetic sewage of various strengths (NW, FW and TW) or artificial seawater (as control). NW had the characteristics and strength equivalent to municipal wastewater, while FW and TW contained 5 and 10 times the nutrient and heavy metal concentrations of the NW, respectively. Results showed that the young plants of A. corniculatum were able to tolerate the wastewater (TW) with highest concentration of nutrients and heavy metals after one year treatment. The growth of TW treated plants, measured in terms of stem height, basal diameter and biomass, was comparable to that found in the control. The plants treated with NW and FW had significantly greater growth than the control, indicating that the nutrients contained in sewage are beneficial to mangrove plants. Physiological parameters such as chlorophyll content, the ratio of chlorophyll a and b, proline concentration and root activity did not show any significant changes among plants treated with wastewater of various strengths and the control, suggesting that sewage addition did not cause any apparent physiological impact on growth of A. corniculatum. Nevertheless, the plants which received sewage with highest levels of heavy metals (TW treatment) appeared to have lower content of free water but higher amount of bound water than FW, NW and the control. Higher electric conductance was also found in plants treated with TW.

0030801901	Benthic macrofauna of the mangrove swamp treated with municipal wastewater	Benthic macrofauna and possible effects on community structure of discharging municipal wastewater to Futian National Mangrove Reserve, the People's Republic of China, were investigated. Eighty-four species of ground-dwelling fauna belonging to 7 Phyla, 9 Classes, 46 Families and 65 Genera were identified. Abundant families were Assimineidae, Melanidae, Potamididae, Ocypodidae, Grapsidae and Periophthalmidae. Between April 1991 to January 1993, no obvious seasonal fluctuation in species composition occurred. Total biomass also remained unchanged. However, total density showed peaks in January and July (both in section A and B), probably due to the molluscs. A selected site of the mangroves was treated with municipal wastewater (60 m

23244456275	Studies of eco-physiological characteristics of three mangrove species in constructed wetland sewage treatment system	Mangroves are diverse communities of tropical to subtropical trees and shrubs growing in the intertidal zone. Pollution eco-physiology and purifying effect of mangrove under seawater condition have been widely investigated. Only few studies related to mangrove wetlands under freshwater condition have been conducted. The objective of this study is to investigate the eco-physiological characteristics of three mangrove species, i. e. Sonneratia caseolaris (Sc), Aegiceras corniculatum (Ac) and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (Bg) in subsurface flow constructed wetland sewage treatment system under freshwater condition. The experiment was conducted in South China Normal University, Guangdong Province of China, from January to December 2004. One-year seedlings of mangroves were obtained from Futian Nature Reserve, Shenzhen Bay. The constructed wetland, with 2 m in length, 2 m in width and 0.6 m in depth, was planted with mangrove at a density of 30 plants per wetland bed. Wetland systems received sewage once a week. Plant height, basal diameter, biomass, SOD activity were measured once a month, while chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, electrolyte leakage were measured once a week. The results showed that growth rate of the three species are different. Stem height increment of Sc, Ac and Bg were 134, 32 and 21 cm, respectively. Basal diameter increment was 18.2, 14.3, 12.9 mm, respectively. Biomass increment were 747, 113, 55 g/plant, respectively. The growth rate of three species was in the order of Sc > Ac > Bg. Average value of physiological characteristics of the three mangrove species were obtain according to the values of all treatment months. Total chlorophyll content of Sc, Ac and Bg were 1.91, 1.26, 0.91 mg/gFW, respectively. Chlorophyll a content were 1.44, 0.93, 0.64 mg/gFW, while chlorophyll b content were 0.5, 0.34, 0.17 mg/gFW, respectively. Net photosynthetic rate were 9.67, 6.39, 3.57 μmolCO

27744596350	Net primary productivity of several mangrove species under controlled habitats	Three mangrove species Sonneratia caseolaris, Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculatum were planted in different fishponds in April 2002 with three planting - breeding area proportions of 45:55, 30:70 and 15:85, respectively, and the growth of test mangrove plants were surveyed during 2 years after planting. The results showed that S. caseolaris and A. comiculatum could grow well in the coupling system, while K. candel could not. The survival percentage of S. caseolaris, K. candel and A. corniculatum was 92.9%, 93.9% and 44.7%, respectively. During the 2 years, the height of S. caseolaris increased 457.0 cm, and its basal diameter increased from 12.6 mm to 98.7 mm. A. corniculatum had an increment of 26.1 cm in height and 36.5 mm in basal diameter, while K. candel only had an increment of 20.4 cm in height and 26.4 mm in basal diameter. Based on the height, basal diameter, and biomass of trunk, branch, leaf and root, regressive equations of the four organs' biomass were obtained, and the whole biomass of standing trees in the coupling system was calculated. The average biomass of S. caseolaris was 5 597.8 g·m

30044444391	Fractions of additive nickel and relationship with enzymatic activities in soil	By cultural experiment method, fractions of additive nickel in soil andimpacts under different concentration on five kinds of soil enzymes were studied. The percentages of inhibition (PI) of alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase were 15.0%-67.3%, 13.9%-85.3%, respectively with the added nickel from 100 to 1600 mg/kg, their activities were strongly inhibited by additive nickel. The PI of urease was from -1.6% to 21.3%, its activity was stimulated under low added nickel concentration, but deactivated under high concentration. The polyphenol oxidase activity was obviously inhibited, while the catalase activity was changed lightly under different nickel levels. The results indicated that acid phosphatase activity, alkaline phosphatase activity and urease activity can be used as primary biochemical indexes in soil quality assessment. According to the results of the correlation analysis and connection degree analysis between forms of nickel and soil enzymatic activities, it was proved that DTPA extracted nickel form had significant correlation and maximal connection degree coefficient with soil enzymes. Therefore, it was feasible to use the DTPA extracted nickel to evaluate the bioavailability of soil nickel contamination.

33745159615	Effect of soil inoculation with Pseudomonas vesicularis on biological properties of three nickel-contaminated soils and on Ni accumulation by the hyperaccumulator Alyssum corsicum	In recent years, phytoremediation using metal hyperaccumulators has been proposed as a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution to the problem of heavy metal contaminated soils. Despite their ability to accumulate high levels of metals in the shoot, however, most hyperaccumulators are of limited usefulness for commercial-scale soil remediation because of their small size and slow growth. Finding ways to improve the phytoremediation performance of hyperaccumulators will contribute to the development of phytoremediation as a commercial technology. We studied phytoremediation by the Ni hyperaccumulator Alyssum corsicum in three soils (a paddy soil, Yuangjing soil, and Mojing soil) with and without inoculation of the soil with the plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) Pseudomonas vesicularis. After 70 days of incubation, several plant and soil indices, including soil nickel concentration, soil bacteria, soil fungus, soil actinomyces, soil microbial biomass and soil enzyme activity, were studied. DTPA-extractable Ni concentration in the paddy soil with added P. vesicularis was significantly lower than it was in the control treatment, and there was some reduction of DTPA-Ni in the inoculated Yuanjiang and Mojiang soils. In all three soil types, microorganism population and microbial biomass were elevated in the inoculated treatments, suggesting that P. vesicularis had colonized the tested soils successfully. Amplification of microbial DNA from the tested soils with five primers showed that the Shannon-Weaver index of microbial DNA sequence diversity was higher in control soils than that in treated soils. Activities of soil enzymes, including urease, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase and catalase, were generally higher in treated soils than in control soils. In the inoculated treatments, the biomass of A. corsicum was increased by 29% in the paddy soil, 309% in Yuanjiang soil and 43% in Mojiang soil compared to the control treatments. Phytoremediation efficiency was also improved, by 54% in the paddy soil, 306% in Yuanjiang soil and 32% in Mojiang soil. The nickel concentration in A. corsicum shoots, however, was not significantly affected by inoculation with P. vesicularis. In conclusion, the PGPR P. vesicularis promoted the growth of the Ni hyperaccumulator A. corsicum and increased its phytoremediation efficiency.

33750388417	Resistant physiology of three mangrove species in a constructed wetland sewage treatment system	This paper studied the resistant physiology of three mangroves species, Sonneratia caseolaris, Aegiceras cornicultum and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza in a subsurface flow-constructed wetland sewage treatment system under freshwater condition. The results showed that in a year period, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase, (CAT) activities of three mangrove species increased gradually and maintained at a high level, the proline content reached the maximum from July to September, while the plasma membrane permeability did not show any obvious change. In comparing with those grown in the Futian Nature Reserve of Shenzhen, three mangrove species in the test sewage treatment system had lower SOD, POD and CAT activities and higher proline content, while no significant difference was observed in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and plasma membrane permeability. It was suggested that three mangrove species could adapt to the subsurface flow-constructed wetland sewage treatment system under freshwater condition.

33847399765	Partitioning and removal of Cd and Mn using a simulated mangrove wastewater treatment system	A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the partitioning and removal of Cd and Mn from wastewater using constructed mangrove (Kandelia candel) wetland treatment system. Three different strengths of artificial wastewater passed through the system in fixed quantities. Artificial seawater was used as a control. Three different compositions were natural wastewater concentration (C1), medium wastewater concentration (C5) and concentrated wastewater concentrations (C10). C1 had the characteristics and strength similar to natural municipal wastewater while C5 and C10 contained five and ten times of the nutrients and heavy metals in C1, respectively. Results showed that the major portion of the Cd and Mn entering the simulated wastewater treatment system entered the sediment pool where approximately 88% to 95% of the Cd, and between 63% and 89% of Mn, was retained. The amount of added Cd and Mn in the wastewater found in plants were between 0.16% to 1.1%, and 1.7% to 13.9%, respectively. Within the total plant pool, roots accounted for between 30% and 39% of Cd, and from 0.65% to 7.3% of Mn; leaves contained between 19.9% to 30.5% of Cd, and from 7.8% to 41.0% of Mn; litterfall contained 12.3% to 20.6% of Cd, and from 15.2% to 70.3% of Mn, respectively. The averaged accumulative coefficients concentration in plant tissues/concentration in sediment in plant for Cd and Mn were 1.22 to 2.40 and 0.02 to 0.08, respectively. Assimilated Cd and Mn were stored in non-activity plant zones such as cell wall, supplimentary cells of the lenticel, stone cells, cell gaps in root and stem, etc. Kandelia candel seedlings had a relative high toxicity resistance to the two heavy metals.

34548057023	Response of microbial communities to phytoremediation of nickel contaminated soils	Through pot experiment, effects of phytoremediation on microbial communities in soils at different nickel treatment levels were studied. Two Ni hyperaccumulating and one Ni tolerant species were planted in paddy soils different in Ni concentration, ranging from 100 to 1 600 mg/kg. After 110 days of incubation, soil microbial activities were analyzed. Results showed that populations of bacteria, fungus, and actinomycetes and biomass of the microorganisms were stimulated when nickel was added at a rate of 100 mg/kg in non-rhizospheric soil. When the rate was over 100 mg/kg in the soil, adverse effects on the soil microbial communities were observed. The plantation of Ni hyperaccumulating species could increase both the population and biomass of soil microorganisms, because, by absorbing nickel from the soil and excreting root exudates, the plants reduced nickel toxicity and improved the living environment of the microbes. However, different plant species had different effects on microorganisms in soil. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with five primers was used in this study in 25 soil samples of four types of soils. A total of 947 amplified bands were obtained, including 888 polymorphic bands and 59 non-polymorphic bands. The results indicated that the composition of microbial DNA sequences had changed because of the addition of nickel to the treated soils. Shannon-Weaver index of soil microbial DNA sequences reduced in the nickel contaminated soils with increasing nickel concentration. The changes in Shannon-Weaver index in the four types of soils ranged from 1.65 to 2.32 for Alyssum corsicum, 1.37 to 2.27 for Alyssum murale, 1.37 to 1.96 for Brassica juncea, and 1.19 to 1.85 for nonrhizospheric soil. With the same amount of nickel added to soils, the Shannon-Weaver index in rhizospheric soil with plants was higher than that in non-rhizospheric soil. © 2007 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag.

35548992007	Review on influence of salinity on mangrove	Salinity is one of the most important environmental factors to mangroves and is a limiting factor for the survival rate of mangrove seedlings. To adapt seawater in the intertidal zones, mangroves have developed a set of mechanisms of salt tolerance. They avoid heavy salt hurt through combination of selective accmnulation of ions, ion compartmentalization, salt excretion and sah exelusion, accumulation or synthesis compatible solutes which are mainly pinitol and matmitol for maintaining osmotic balance, and promotion of antioxidative to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Salinity influences tissue structure and caloric value by which affects growth of mangroves. Under salt stress, activities of antioxidative enzymes and synthesis of compatible solutes are all strengthened, the absorption of differention to be changed too. 6 aspects of salinity influence on mangroves were reviewed in the paper , which arer growth, tissue structure, ion level, activities of antioxidative enzymes, changes of caloric value, synthesis of compatible solutes. A few advanced research fields salinity influence on mangroves were listed.

37849188291	Degradation and conservation of coastal wetlands in South China Sea	The South China Sea represents an area of globally significant marine shallow - water, tropical biodiversity and supports a significant world fishery of importance to the food Security. 45 mangrove species out of a global total of 51 ; 50 of 70 coral genera ; 20 of 50 seagrasses species ; and 7 of 9 giant clam species, are found in the nearshore areas of the South China Sea. Recent estimates suggest that approximately 2 million hectares of mangrove forest or 12% of the world total are located in the countries bordering the South China Sea. This represents only 31% of the estimated total found in these countries at the start of this century. This richness in flora and fauna is accompanied by the area's high natural productivity. Capture fisheries from the South China Sea contribute 10% of the world's landed catch. Despite the importance of wetlands of high biodiversity in the South China Sea, the richness and productivity of the South China Sea and associated environments are, however, seriously threatened by high population growth, pollution, overharvest and habitat modification, resulting in high rates of loss and degradation of coastal wetlands. These socio - economic causes are manifested in overexploitation of resources, human and industrial waste dumping and destruction of habitat during development. Estimated rates of loss of the mangrove each country range from around 0.5% to 3.5% of the total area per year which could result in total loss of this habitat in the region by around 2030. 82% of the coral reefs surveyed in the South China Sea display evidence of degradation, 20% to 50% of seagrass areas are damaged in each country bordering the South China. Actions are urgently needed to halt the degradation of coastal wetlands around the South China Sea. The countries bordering the South China Sea have implemented some programmes of environmental conservation, but the lack of a regionally co - ordinated approach to remedial actions significantly reduces their effectiveness. The present use pattern and the main causes of the wetlands degradation in the South China Sea was conducted. The main threats for the coastal wetlands along the South China Sea are the following: Circled digit one unplanned reclamation and conversion of wetlands; Circled digit two overuse of biological wetland resources; Circled digit three wetland pollution worsening, which caused the serious loss and degradation of the coastal wetlands along the South China Sea. For solution of those problems, some counter-measures are suggested: to establish the strategic action plan of the South China Sea; to strengthen the research of fishery responsibility and fishery trade; to control over the pollution , to increase public awareness and to encourage the community participation; to establish the information system of coastal wetland resources, environment and management of the South China Sea; to establish the demonstration sites for reversing the environmental degradation trend, which are the basis for implementing appropriate approach to reverse the environmental degradation trends both at the national and regional levels.

38849141655	Distribution and migration of zinc in Avicennia marina plant-soil system	Zinc is a major anthropogenic contaminant in estuarine ecosystem, and has potential ecotoxicological consequences for aquatic animals and plants. An artificial mangrove wetland was set up in greenhouse to study the distribution and migration of zinc in synthetic wastewater in Avicennia marina plant-soil system. Different concentration synthetic wastewater and 1.5% salinity artificial seawater (control) were discharged into the system in fixed quantity twice a week for a year. The results showed that most part (> 67%) of zinc in the artificial wastewater discharged into the system was remained in the soil, and only a small portion (1.24%-10.4%) of it was entered into plant and litter, indicating that this artificial plant-soil system had a stronger purifying effect on the zinc in synthetic wastewater. The calculation with matter balance model indicated that soil subsystem had a higher environmental capacity of bearing zinc.

33645742992	Research advances in phytoremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)	This paper reviewed the research advance in PCBs phytoremediation, with the focus on the roles and mechanisms of plants in the removal of PCBs from the environment. In the process of PCBs removal, plants acted not only as a supporter of biodegradation, but also as an active participator in metabolism. Plants could absorb and accumulate PCBs from the environment, and store the non-toxic metabolic products in their tissues. Root exudates could degrade PCBs directly by the contained ectoenzymes, or indirectly through stimulating the activity of rhizospheric microbes. The internal and external factors affecting the phytoremediation of PCBs, including plant species, their culture types and biomass, as well as the initial concentration of PCBs and their physical and chemical characters, were also discussed.

58149498375	Effect of light intensity on growth and photosynthetic properties of Sonnerratia apetala seedling	Growth and photosynthetic properties of Sonnerratia apetala seedlings were studied under different light intensity environments according to light intensity of Sonnerratia apetala in field. The results indicated that with the light intensity lessening, the trend of growth and photosynthetic properties of Sonnerratia apetala seedlings decreased. The difference of different treatments was significant. When the light intensity was 80% and 40% of full light, the growth of seedlings became worse, they grow worse than that of full light. The weak light environment was beneficial to stem height, leaf area and ratio of length to width of lamina only in initial shading stage (2 to 4 months), but with the shading time prolonging, the growth of seedlings appeared to the trend of decline. The growth of seedlings were restricted seriously in initial shading stage when the light intensity was 20%. The death rate of seedlings of Sa80, Sa40 and Sa20 in shading treatment 180 days were 42%, 70% and 100%, respectively. Biomass of root, stem and leaf were decreased by about 90%, 80% and 91% in weak light intensity environment. With the light intensity lessening, the trends of physiology parameters such as chlorophyll contents, net photosynthetic rate decreased, the difference among them was significant. Therefore, weak light intensity environment was the main reason for lower growth rate, lower photosynthetic rate and higher death rate of Sonnerratia apetala seedlings. In addition, the natural regeneration and diffusion and the artificial forestation technique of Sonnerratia apetala seedlings were discussed.

79952692135	Responses of aerenchyma in five mangrove species on artificial-non-tidal habitats	In nature, Mangroves grow at estuarines and coastal intertidal area. They have adaptive mechanism of physiological, morphological and structural characters to the water-logging conditions induced by the tidal effects. The development of mangrove aerenchyma was proved to be highly related to their adaptability to inundation, and also considered as the major factor to evaluate the mangrove tolerance to inundation. The root aerenchyma developments were compared between natural and artificial habitats by porosity measurement and paraffin section for Avicennia marina (Am), Rhizophora stylosa (Rs), Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (Bg), Kandelia candel (Kc) and Aegiceras corniculatum (Ac), five dominant mangrove species in southern China. The leaf and stem aerenchyma of these five mangrove species were also studied by paraffin section. Results indicated that the measurements of two methods were statistically significantly correlative (P < 0. 05) for root aerenchyma. The most of aerenchyma resulted from the roots for these five mangrove trees. The roots aerenchyma accounted for more than 50% except that root aerenchyma of Am in tidal habitats was 48. 16%, and Ac in non-tidal habitats was 43. 81% of the sum (in root, stem, and leaf). The aerenchyma of Ac, Bg, Am, Kc, and Rs was (14.98 ±3.34)%, (27.83 ±2. 3)%, (29. 64 ± 3. 17)%, (30.09 ± 4. 12)%, and (42. 12 ± 3. 14)% in natural intertidal habitats, respectively. This distribution of aerenchyma was accordant to the mangrove tidal zonation and vegetation successional sequence in the southern China coast. The root aerenchyma of Rs, Bg, Kc, Am, and Ac increased in non-tidal artificial habitats compared to natural tidal habitats, indicating adaptability to non-tidal conditions flooding for these mangrove species in some degree. The increase of root arenchyma development was least in Ac, while most in Rs. It was inferred that those species of less adaptive to inundation, i. e. Bg and Rs, increased their root arenchyma more to tolerate steady water level condition. They could be considered as more sensitive to water level change. By contrast, the species of more adaptive to inundation, i. e. Ac and Am, increased their root arenchyma less. This could be considered as a less sensitive phenomenon to water level change. Under non-tidal conditions, the aerenchyma of Ac, Am, Kc, Bg and Rs was (56.38 ±2.41)%, (40.88 ±1.03)%, (39. 18 ± 1. 21)%, (35. 70 ±0. 57)% and (19. 28 ±0. 63)%, respectively. Judging from root aerenchyma developments in non-tidal habitats, their adaptabilities to the steady inundation condition were as following sequence: Ac > Am > Kc > Bg > Rs. The adaptability of mangrove to non-tidal inundation condition increased the feasibility. The result was important to enhance the survival rate of mangrove planting, and expand planting area for improving coast ecological services.

79952711604	Composition of mixed-species flocks and shifts in foraging location of flocking species on Hainan Island, China	A total of 134 bird species were recorded at Jianfengling, Hainan Island, in China from May 2000 to September 2004, of which 44 participated in one or more of 134 mixed-species flocks. These flocks averaged 3.8±0.2 species and 20.3±1.2 individuals. Flocking propensity in a given species ranged from 1.5 to 100%. For flocking species, frequency of flocking and number of individuals in flocks was positively correlated with frequency and number in point counts. Among all species pairs with flocking frequency above 5%, cluster and correlation analysis indicated there were two principal groups of flocking birds - canopy species and understorey species: associations were positive within a group, but negative between groups. Canopy birds had a higher flocking propensity than understorey birds. They also made significantly less use of inner branches and trunks and greater use of middle branches, and foraged at a significantly greater height when in mixed-species flocks than when solitary. For understorey bird species, there were no significant differences in foraging locations between solitary and mixed-species flocks. Higher flocking frequency occurred in the wet season for canopy birds, but in the dry season for understorey birds. Overall patterns were consistent with the explanation that flocking enables an expansion of foraging niche by reducing the risk of predation. © 2011 The Authors.

80052238684	Effects of salinity on purification efficiency of constructed wetland with mangrove plant Rhizophora stylosa for eutrophic wastewater treatment	There is obvious effect for eutrophic wastewater treatment by constructing mangrove wetland, but mangrove plants grow under circumstances of a certain salinity, so this may influence the wastewater purification efficiency. Rhizophora stylosa, one of dominant mangrove species in South China, was used to construct simulated wetlands for eutrophic wastewater treatment. After 9 months irrigation to 8 groups of wetlands with wastewater at salinities of 0‰, 5‰, 10‰, 15‰, 20‰, 30‰, 40‰ and 50‰, respectively, the growth, photosynthesis, amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) assimilated by plant, and the treatment efficiency were surveyed. The optimum salinity for Rhizophora stylosa growth was 15-20‰. The net photosynthesis rate, stomata conductance and transpiration rate of leaves increased with the elevation of salinity, reached the highest between 10‰ and 20‰, and then decreased. At salinities of 15‰ and 20‰, the content of N in leaves and stems was the highest, but in roots it decreased with the salinity increase. The content change of P in leaves and roots was similar with N, while at low salinity the content of P in stems was higher than that at high salinity. The removal rate of N in wastewater was above 80% for all treatments of different salinities, but at salinities of 10-30‰ there was the highest treatment efficiency with removal rate of 84.1-85.2%; the removal rate of P in wastewater was 98.11-98.82% for all treatments, and at salinities of 10‰ and 20‰ it was a little higher than at other treatments. The amounts of N and P removed by plant assimilation accounted for 5.9-11.2% of total N and 1.3-3.3% of total P removed from wastewater, respectively, and most of them transferred into sediment. At the optimum salinity for the plant growth, there was the highest purification efficiency for eutrophic wastewater treatment by constructed wetland with Rhizophora stylosa. © 2011 IEEE.

Four hundred and eighty five DNA bands were amplified, among which 481 bands (99.18%) were polymorphic. The average number of DNA bands amplified by each primer was 44. Similarity coefficients were calculated and a dendrogram was constructed by using UPGMA algorithm. The six Sonneratia species were divided into two major groups. Group I consisted of Sonneratia caseolaris, Sonneratia × gulngai, Sonneratia alba, and Group II included Sonneratia × hainanensis, Sonneratia ovata and Sonneratia apetala. In Group I, S. × gulngai was close to S. alba, and in Group II, S. × hainanensis was close to S. ovata. The genetic relationships estimated by the polymorphism of ISSR markers are basically in agreement with those previously inferred by morphological data. Thus, ISSR approach is a reliable marker system that can be used to study genetic relationship in the genus Sonneratia. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

4344601601	Bacteria ecology in planting-culturing system	Planting-culturing system in inter-tidal zone is a new type eco-culturing model. The survey on bacteria biomass and water quality in the designed planting-culturing system in inter-tidal zone showed that the mangrove planted in the system improved water quality and made water quality to II ∼ III type, better than the IV and V type in the control pond. Designed ponds made heterotrophic bacteria, vibrio, phosphorus bacteria and enzyme-producing bacteria populations 1 ∼ 2 order lower than the control pond without mongrove planting. Correlation analyses with CORREL software showed that the biomass of these bacteria was positively related with the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water of the system, and the correlation coefficient for heterogeneous bacteria and vibrio was up to 0.9205. Heterotrophic bacteria and vibrio could be used as the water-quality monitoring organisms.

42949154325	Avian communities on Qi'ao Island of Zhuhai City in wintertime	Seven transects were set up on the mangrove wetland of Qi' ao Island to study the characteristics of avian communities in January, 2005-2007. 63 species of birds were recorded, which belonged to 12 orders and 23 families. Passerine was most abundant in species. Among 63 species, the proportions of resident, winter migratory, and summer migratory birds were 66.7%, 31.7% and 1.6%, and waterfowls and terrestrial birds occupied 28.6% and 71.4%, respectively. The overall a diversity index (H) and evenness (J) of the avian communities were 3.171 and 0.765, with a variation of 0.602-2.853 and 0.336-0.919, respectively. Among the 7 habitats tested, mudflat and mangrove had the lowest H and J. The β diversity showed that there was a greater difference in the avian communities among mudflat, mangrove-pond wetland, and villages. Based on hierarchical clustering analysis, the avian communities on Qi' ao Island in winter-time were grouped into three types, i. e., mudflat waterfowls, mangrove-pond wetland birds, and farmland-forest birds.

5044229964	Genetic diversity of Sonneratia alba in China detected by inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) analysis	Sonneratia alba J. Smith. is a widely distributed mangrove species. Leaf samples of one hundred individuals from four natural and one introduced populations in Hainan Island, China, were collected. Genetic variation among the five populations was evaluated using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. Eleven ISSR primers gave rise to 133 discernible DNA fragments of which 103 (77.44%) were polymorphic, indicating a considerable genetic variation at the species level. However, the polymorphism at the population level was relatively low, with the percentage of polymorphic bands from 51.88% to 65.41 %. The mean expected heterozygosity and Shannon's information index were 0.227 1 and 0.348 9 respectively at the species level, 0.183 7 and 0.277 5 at the population level. Based on Nei's Gst value, a large proportion of genetic variance (81.02%) was resided among individuals within populations, however, only 18.98% genetic variance was resided among populations. AMOVA analysis also indicated a similar genetic structure. The genetic identity between populations was 0.934 2 on average. UPGMA cluster analysis based on Nei's genetic distance divided the populations into two main groups: Linshui population (LS) and Sanya population (SY) formed one group, Qionghai population (QH), Wenchang population (WC) and Dongzhai Harbor population (DZ) were in the other group. The Mantel test showed that genetic distance was significantly correlated with geographical distance.

62349131007	Wastewater treatment with constructed mangrove wetland system: A review	Mangroves are the diverse communities of tropical to subtropical trees and shrubs growing in inter-tidal zone. This particular zone endows the mangrove plants the capability of resisting and reducing contamination. However, there are still controversies about whether natural mangrove forests can be utilized to treat wastewater. According to the types of constructed mangrove wetlands, they are classified into three groups, i. e., simulated tide wetland system, constructed wetland wastewater treatment system, and integrated mangrove-aquiculture system. The first one simulates the tidal situation of true seashore; the second one resembles most of ordinary constructed wetlands; while the third one is the aquiculture pond planted with mangrove to remove organic matter and nutrients. Different types of the constructed wetlands are the evidences of the progress in research work, showing the gradual process from theory to practice. It is feasible and promising to use constructed mangrove wetlands for wastewater treatment.

Results showed that concentrations of PAHs absorbed and accumulated by sediments of a natural mangrove forest wetland were higher than that of artificially restored mangrove forest wetlands. However, PAH compositions in sediments were similar in the three mangrove wetlands. Total PAHs concentrations in inner mangrove sediment were higher than sediment at mangrove edges. Mangrove edge sediment had higher PAH levels than low tidal mudflat sediment except for the Yifeng estuarine mangrove wetland. The high molecular weight PAHs (HPAHs) were strongly absorbed by organic carbon and black carbon. The low molecular weight PAHs (LPAHs) were not as strongly adsorbed as the HPAH's. Sorption by BC was greater than sorption by OC.

67649446147	Determination of trace PCBs in mangrove sediments	As polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in mangrove ecosystem may cause ecological risk, monitoring of PCBs in sediments is of great importance. This work presents the determination of trace PCBs in mangrove sediment samples, under the condition of quality assurance/quality control(QA/QC). In this study, both ultrasonic extraction(USE) and microwave-assisted extraction(MAE) are tried. According to properties of the samples, PCBs are cleaned up with copper, sulfuric acid and alumina-silica chromatography column. Then, PCBs are detected by the apparatus of GC/MS. The results show that both USE and MAE have high recoveries. The recoveries of the whole analysis range from 47.45% to 100.76% by USE and from 77.04% to 98.00% by MAE, respectively, and MAE has higher accuracy. The method detection limits for PCBs range from 0.30 to 1.74 ng/g by USE and from 0.30 to 0.47 ng/g by MAE. So MAE is a better choice.

72449155970	The restoration of mangrove wetland: A review	Mangroves are the unique intertidal plant formations growing in sheltered tropical and subtropical coastal areas. Due to increasing population and economic development, they had been severely damaged in the last several decades, facing degradation and loss. In recent years, many measures were undertaken to rehabilitate mangroves in different countries. However, followed by anthropologic disturbance and natural disasters, the lacking of technical support for afforestation, lower survival rate of afforestation, and careless managementled to slow enhancementof mangrove area. Then lower survival rate was the primary threshold to mangrove restoration. The recent advances of mangrove restoration within four processes were reviewed, namely; (1) site-species matching, which includes temperature, substrates and hydrological factors of afforestation sites; (2) selection and introduction of mangrove species, that includes status of native specie's selection and exotic one's introduction; (3) applicationof silviculture techniques, including planting, seedling and sapling nursing techniques, and afforestation cost's comparison; and (4) post-cultivated management and monitoring, including the sapling's watching, diseases and pest's prevention and resistance, and ecological monitoring. Coupled with the field survey's results, some basic principles and appliedcases were generalized. Finally, based on the current status of mangrove restoration in China, there is a discussion on the future emphasis of mangrove restoration researches, which is (1) undertaking mangrove rehabilitation in the abandonedaquaculture ponds; (2) monitoring on the restoration of biodiversity in the mangrove ecosystem; (3) researching on allelopathy in mangrove ecosystem more elaborately; (4) afforesting mixed stands with different mangrove species; and at last but not the least (5) implementing ecological restoration of mangrove wetlands.

76649092381	Accumulation of heavy metals in rice growing around mining area and its human health risk analysis	Accumulation of Cu, Zn, Pb, As and Cd in rice of 21 cultivars, including hybrid, conventional and glutinous rice, was studied through a field experiment laid out in the paddy fields around the Dabaoshan Mining Area in Guangdong Province and its human health risks are analyzed. Results show that in accordance with the criteria in the China National Hygienic Standard for Food, the over-limit rate of Cd and Pb in rice was very high, being 100% and 71. 43 % , respectively, whereas that of Cu and As was only 4. 76% and 14. 29% higher, respectively, and that of Zn negative. Among the cultivars, conventional and glutinous rices were more capable of accumulating Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd, while hybrid rice more of accumulating As. Negative relationships were observed between the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, As and Cd in rice grains and the biomass of the whole plant. In terms of plant accumulation of the five metals by the rice cultivare in the experiment, they followed the the sequence of Cd>Zn>Cu>As>Pb. The findings of the research indicate that Cd and Pb in the soil of the experiment posed serious potential health risks, where Cu, Zn and As minor ones. It is, therefore, essential to pay high attention to the issue of Cd and Pb pollution of rice produced in the Dabaoshan Mining Area and its associated potential risk to human health of the rice consumers.

76749126623	Vertical distribution patterns of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Shantou mangrove wetland sediments	Sediment samples at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths were collected from Shantou mangrove wetland, and their particle sizes and the contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) , organic carbon, and black carbon were determined by the methods of ultrasonic solvent extraction and GC-MS. The two sediment layers were dominated by 4-ring PAHs, followed by moderate molecular weight PAHs, and lower or molecular weight PAHs. The contents of PAHs, organic carbon, and black carbon, and the percentages of silt and clay were higher in 0-10 cm than in 10-20 cm layer, but the pH value had no difference between the two layers. Correlation analysis showed that in the two layers, PAHs content had no correlation with organic carbon content but significantly correlated with black carbon content (P < 0. 01) , and significant correlations were observed among the contents of silt, black carbon, and PAHs ( P < 0. 05 ) , suggesting that silt content was the main factor affecting the PAHs distribution in Shantou mangrove sediments, and black carbon could be the essential factor for the stratification of PAHs in different sediment layers.

76149137287	Effect of an integrated mangrove-aquaculture system on aquacultural health	Mangroves are unique intertidal halophyte formations growing in sheltered tropical and subtropical coastal areas. Due to the increasing population and economic development, mangroves have faced degradation and loss, which has been mainly caused by land conversion into aquaculture ponds in Asia. In the past several decades, the rapid growth of aquaculture has induced water pollution. Using mangroves for effluent treatment from coastal aquaculture ponds could be a suitable approach for wastewater treatment and healthy aquaculture development. An Integrated Mangrove-Aquaculture System (IMAS) was established to test whether the idea of a mangrove in situ treatment for aquaculture wastewater is feasible. The monocultures of three mangroves, Sonneratia caseolaris, Kandelia obovata, and Aegiceras corniculatum were established with area proportions of 45%, 30%, or 15%, respectively. One control pond without mangroves was also set up. The results indicated that the mangroves had different tolerabilities to long-term inundation. The aquaculture ponds had different fishery yields, considering the mangrove species and area proportions. The water quality of most of the experimental ponds was better than the control pond, except for the planted Sonneratia. It is concluded that mangroves can reduce the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate, buffer the pH value and increase the concertration of dissolved oxygen in aquaculture water bodies effectively. It is suggested to use 15% of the Aegiceras corniculatum area to conduct in situ purification of aquaculture wastewater and to enhance aquaculture production. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2009.

In 2008, the overall health index of this ecosystem was 0. 6580, health level was of grade II (healthy), and the pressure, state, and response indices were 0.3469, 0.8718, and 0. 7754, respectively, suggesting that this ecosystem was good in state and response, but still had definite pressure. As a provincial nature reserve, this ecosystem was to be further improved in its health level. However, the research on the health assessment of mangrove wetland ecosystem was still young. Further studies should be made on the selection of assessment indices, long-term oriented monitoring of these indices, and quantification of the relations between ecosystem health level and ecosystem services.

77949913664	The role of radial oxygen loss and root anatomy on zinc uptake and tolerance in mangrove seedlings	Root anatomy, radial oxygen loss (ROL) and zinc (Zn) uptake and tolerance in mangrove plants were investigated using seedlings of Aegiceras corniculatum, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Rhizophora stylosa. The results revealed that B. gymnorrhiza, which possessed the 'tightest barrier' in ROL spatial patterns among the three species studied, took up the least Zn and showed the highest Zn tolerance. Furthermore, zinc significantly decreased the ROL of all three plants by inhibition of root permeability, which included an obvious thickening of outer cortex and significant increases of lignification in cell walls. The results of SEM X-ray microanalysis further confirmed that such an inducible, low permeability of roots was likely an adaptive strategy to metal stress by direct prevention of excessive Zn entering into the root. The present study proposes new evidence of structural adaptive strategy on metal tolerance by mangrove seedlings. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The contents of the six experimental metals were higher in underground parts (root system) than in overground parts. Metal concentrations in different parts of rice showed significant differences among various rice cultivars (P<0.01). Conventional and glutinous rice had stronger ability to accumulate Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd than hybrid rice. Hybrid rice had stronger ability to accumulate As than the other two cultivars. Hybrid rice was more applicable to Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd polluted soils. Glutinous rice was more applicable to As polluted soils. The accumulation factors of Zn, Pb and As followed the order of root system>straw>rice hull>rice core. The accumulation factors of Fe, Cu and Cd followed the order of root system>straw>rice core>rice hull. The values of accumulation factors of Fe, Zn, Pb, As and Cd are higher in iron plaque than in root, with the exception of Cu. The ability to accumulate different metals by iron plaque was different, with the rank of Cd>As>Fe>Zn>Pb>Cu.

The seed germination rate and the seedling' s eco-physiological parameters of S. apetala all decreased with the increasing level of shading. At 80% and 40% of full light, the stem height, basal diameter, node number, and lamina number of seedlings decreased to some extent; while at 20% of full light, the seedling's growth was seriously restricted. At weak light intensity, the germination rate was very low, and the eco-physiological parameters such as chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, soluble sugar contents, and nitrate reductase activity decreased, with significant differences to those at strong light intensity. Therefore, low light intensity could be the main reason for the low level eco-physiological parameters and high death rate of S. apetala seedlings. The natural regeneration and dispersal of S. apetala and the techniques for S. apetala forestation were also discussed.

77955429107	Influence of mangrove reforestation on heavy metal accumulation and speciation in intertidal sediments	To investigate the influence of mangrove reforestation on heavy metal accumulation and speciation in intertidal sediments, core sediments from a restored mangrove forest and adjacent mud flat in Yifeng Estuary (southeastern China) were analyzed. The chemical speciation of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni) was determined according to a sequential extraction procedure. Special attention was paid to the upper 20. cm of sediment, in which metal accumulation was enhanced and speciation was obviously modified. Mangrove reforestation decreased the concentrations of all metals in the acid-soluble fraction and increased metal concentrations in the oxidizable fraction. Increased Pb, Zn and Cu concentrations and decreased Ni and Cr concentrations were observed in the reducible fraction. These results suggest that mangrove reforestation facilitated the accumulation of heavy metals in the upper sediment layers but decreased their bioavailability and mobility. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79952643441	The effects of roots and crabs' bioturbation on AVS, migration and transformation of heavy metals in mangrove sediments	Mangrove wetlands are extremely important in South China's coastal eco-environment systems. The current domestic researches focus mainly on mangrove wetland's ecosystem function and the bioavailability of heavy metals in mangrove's sediments, while there are few researches about the bioturbation of mangrove plants and crabs which are important to habitat transformation in mangrove ecosystem. This article summed up the effects of mangrove roots and crabs' bioturbation on the physical and chemical properties of sediments, AVS, migration and transformation of heavy metals in sediments. We have introduced the mangrove roots and crabs' bioturbation on sediment structure, oxygen content, organic matter, AVS, heavy metals and Fe/S' geochemical behavior in details. Basing on the effects of roots and crabs' bioturbation on AVS which is considered one of the most significant binding states of heavy metals in sediments, the linkages between these factors are preliminarily discussed. This article could be seen as a theoretical reference for further scientific research about bioturbation, AVS and heavy metals' geochemical behavior in mangrove sediments.

After treated for 360 d, the annual increment of height growth at the same water salinities increased significantly with increasing light intensity, and had significant differences among the three light intensity treatments. On the contrary, the annual increment of stem diameter decreased significantly. The average branch number, leaf number, leaf area, and leaf thickness all existed significant differences among the treatments. At the same water salinities, the leaf chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll contents had no significant differences under 25% and 45% sunlight but were significantly higher than those under full sunlight, while the chlorophyll a/ b ratio had less difference among all the treatments. The net photosynthetic rate, soluble sugar content, nitrate reductase activity, and root vigor at same water salinities decreased significantly with the reduction of light intensity. Under the same light intensities, the seedlings irrigated with fresh water had lower soluble sugar content, nitrate reductase activity, and root vigor, compared with those irrigated with sea water. Our results indicated that shading had significant effects on the eco-physiology of pot-planted A. corniculatum.

79960845757	Source Apportionment of PAHs Using Two Mathematical Models for Mangrove Sediments in Shantou Coastal Zone, China	Thirty-five surface sediment samples collected from three mangroves in Shantou coastal zone, China in 2007 were analyzed for a suite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Two mathematical models were used to determine the profiles and relative contributions of PAH sources to the mangroves. The two models are principal component analyses (PCA) with multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). Both models identified five factors and gave excellent correlation coefficients between predicted and measured levels of 16 PAH compounds, but the results had some differences. The PAH contribution rate attributed to vehicular emission sources identified by PCA-MLR was 37. 20%, but the rate identified by PMF was only 12. 37%. The main sources identified by PCA-MLR were combination of biomass/coal combustion and vehicular emissions, whereas the main source identified by PMF was only biomass/coal combustion. The PMF analysis was the preferred model for the paper data set. © 2011 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

80052785798	Accumulation and partitioning of heavy metals in mangrove rhizosphere sediments	A field study was conducted to clarify the effect of rhizosphere processes on the accumulation and partitioning of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd and Ni) in mangrove sediments. Metals were fractionated by a sequential extraction procedure into three chemically distinct fractions: water soluble, exchangeable and carbonate bound (B1), Fe-Mn oxide bound (B2), and organic and sulfide bound (B3). Results indicate that rhizosphere processes tend to increase the metal concentrations in the rhizosphere sediments. However, plant uptake may result in the decrease of the metal concentrations in the rhizosphere sediments when the metal concentrations are relatively low in the bulk sediments. Compared with the bulk sediments, the rhizosphere sediments have low concentrations of heavy metals in the B1 and B2 fractions and high concentrations in the B3 fraction. Either an increase or decrease in the residual fraction of heavy metals in the rhizosphere sediments may appear, depending on whether the formation of the refractory metal-organic compounds or the activation of the residual fractions dominates. Results also indicate that mangrove plants absorb and store non-essential metals in the perennial tissues, thus reducing the export of non-essential metals via leaf litter transport. Mangrove plants are excellent candidates for phytostabilization of heavy metals in intertidal substrates. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84863869471	Bird species richness along an elevational gradient in a forest at Jianfengling, Hainan Island, China	The avian communities of Hainan I., China are poorly known and under considerable threat. In our studies at Jianfengling, Hainan I. between May 2000 and Sept. 2004, 117 bird species were recorded using fixed-radius point counts and mist-netting at 3 elevations (200, 500, and 1000 m). Numbers of bird species recorded at the 3 elevations were 67 (200 m), 67 (500 m), and 89 (1000 m), of which 15 species were recorded exclusively at 200 m, 11 at 500 m, and 24 at 1000 m. The highest bird species richness occurred at the highest elevation (1000 m). The pattern of bird species richness differed from those of continental China and the island of Taiwan. Each elevation hosted a unique assemblage of special conservation concern. Species which require mature, full-canopy forest, and are often associated with mixed-species flocks were mainly distributed at 1000 m. The remnant forest at this elevation is clearly of high conservation importance. Illegal logging and hunting continue mainly at lower elevations (200 and 500 m). Frugivores, notably the pigeons Ducula spp. and Treron spp., are among bird species targeted by illegal hunters. We recommend that the Hainan Jianfengling National Nature Reserve be expanded to include this area of semi-deciduous monsoon forest at 200 m. Other coherent management strategies are training staff, increasing public awareness, providing incentives for conservation, and implementing conservation guidelines.

84866483548	Effects of copper on growth, radial oxygen loss and root permeability of seedlings of the mangroves Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Rhizophora stylosa	Purpose: Mangrove wetlands have experienced significant contaminant input such as copper (Cu), aggravated by rapid urban development. This study aimed to investigate the possible function of root permeability in metal detoxification. Methods: Pot trials were conducted to evaluate the responses of root permeability in relation to metal (Cu) exposure in seedlings of two mangroves: Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Rhizophora stylosa. Results: Copper inhibited plant growth and root permeability of the two species significantly (due to decreases in root porosity, thickening of exodermis and increases in lignification), leading to a significant reduction in radial oxygen loss (ROL). A negative correlation between soil Cu and ROL from root tip was also observed. The observed metal uptake by excised roots further indicated that increased lignification would directly prevent excessive Cu from further entering into the roots. Conclusions: In summary, the two mangroves reacted to Cu by producing an impermeable barrier in roots. Such an inducible barrier to ROL is likely to be an adaptive strategy against Cu toxicity. This study reveals new evidence of a structural adaptive strategy for metal tolerance by mangrove plants. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

0242667902	Application of mist net in studies of forest bird communities	It had been more than twenty years for using mist net to study forest avian community. Mist net was very useful for studying cryptic, less vocal or non-vocal, and non-territorial birds, particularly understory birds in forest. The accuracy of mist net was relatively independent of observer biases and skills. It allowed identical and simultaneous sampling of numerous sites and straightforward comparisons among studies done at different sites by different people. So, a lot of ornithologists considered it as a necessary way for studying forest bird communities. Few studies had been reported on bird communities by using mist nets in China. In this paper, some examples on studying forest bird community by using mist nets were introduced, and studies on forest bird community with mist net should be used widely in China in the future.

84889560979	Use of degraded coastal wetland in an integrated mangrove-aquaculture system: A case study from the South China Sea	The coastal wetlands of the South China Sea are highly productive and, in 2004, the capture fishery and aquaculture of this area contributed around 8% and 54% of world production, respectively. However, the coastal zone is characterized by high population density and rapid development such that mangrove conversion and reclamation is one of the main threats to coastal wetlands. Globally, about 26% of the mangrove has disappeared since the 1980s much of it being converted to aquaculture ponds. In an attempt to achieve the target of combining mangrove conservation and aquaculture, the Integrated Mangrove Aquaculture System (IMAS) was established in 2002 in southern China. This system was directed towards three goals: mangrove replanting; water purification; and more ecologically friendly aquaculture. Different aquaculture ponds were planted with one of four mangrove species and the aquaculture production, water quality and mangrove growth and survival were compared with control ponds.It has been found that the mangrove species Aegiceras corniculatum is the best for planting in aquaculture ponds given its high tolerance of long-term inundation and its effectiveness in purifying the aquaculture water body in both laboratory and in situ experiments. Following planting with mangrove, the aquaculture ponds can become self-purifying through nutrient uptake by the mangrove.Aquaculture harvests of some mangrove-dependent species, such as red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and oyster (Crassostrea rivularis), were increased by over 10% in the presence of mangroves. The food chain, traced by stable isotope analyses, indicates that mangrove litterfall contributes between 1 and 26% of the diet of cultured fishes. The two replicated trials implemented in Shantou and Shenzhen displayed similar results of water purification.

84903905580	Effects of drought stress on the growth and physiological characteristics of Aegiceras corniculatum	Taking 3-year-old Aegiceras corniculatum as test material, and 4 gradients of simulated soil drought (soil moisture 100%, 70%-80%, 40%-50% and 20%-30%) were set to study the effect of drought stress on the growth and physiological characteristics of A. corniculatum. The results indicated that as the severity of drought increased, the number of fallen leaves increased significantly while the survival rate of A. corniculatum decreased significantly; the activity of nitrate reductase declined gradually, the contents of free proline, soluble protein, malondialdehyde and membrane permeability in leaf all showed a trend of rise with the increase of drought stress severity, whereas the chlorophyll content, SOD activity, POD activity and root activity showed a trend of rising first then declining. In conclusion, A. corniculatum is able to grow well on freshwater land with a range of soil moisture of 70%-80%, but its growth and physiological characteristics will be significantly impaired by drought stress when soil moisture is below 50%.
