9944244540	Predicting daylight illuminance on inclined surfaces using sky luminance data	Daylight illuminance, particularly on vertical surfaces, plays a major role in determining and evaluating the daylighting performance of a building. In many parts of the world, however, the basic daylight illuminance data for various vertical planes are not always readily available. The usual method to obtain diffuse illuminance on tilted planes would be based on inclined surfaces models using data from the horizontal measurements. Alternatively, the diffuse illuminance on a sloping plane can be computed by integrating the luminance distribution of the sky 'seen' by the plane. This paper presents an approach to estimate the vertical outdoor illuminance from sky luminance data and solar geometry. Sky luminance data recorded from January 1999 to December 2001 in Hong Kong and generated by two well-known sky luminance models (Kittler and Perez) were used to compute the outdoor illuminance for the four principal vertical planes (N, E, S and W). The performance of this approach was evaluated against data measured in the same period. Statistical analysis indicated that using sky luminance distributions to predict outdoor illuminance can give reasonably good agreement with measured data for all vertical surfaces. The findings provide an accurate alternative to determine the amount of daylight on vertical as well as other inclined surfaces when sky luminance data are available. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

8644265265	External obstructions and daylighting in high-rise residential buildings	The extent of sky obstruction due to neighbouring buildings was investigated for high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. A total of 275 residential buildings completed during the month of June between 1985 and 1995 were selected for the study. The percentages of sky obstruction for different floor levels were estimated through site surveys and subsequent analysis. It has been found that sky obstruction due to neighbouring buildings can be severe for residential flats on the lower floors. The smallest and the largest sky obstructions are 10 and 80%, respectively. Most (about 65%) of the buildings have average sky obstructions between 30 and 60%. Impacts of external obstruction on the indoor daylighting levels were examined. It has been found that residential flats with 50% or more sky obstruction tend to have inadequate natural daylight and would have to rely on supplementary artificial lighting for areas away from the windows.

1542749087	Predicting solar irradiance on inclined surfaces using sky radiance data	The availability of more comprehensive solar irradiance data is invaluable for the reduction of cooling load in buildings and for the evaluation of the performance of photovoltaic plants. In many parts of the world, however, the basic solar irradiance data are not always readily available. This paper presents an approach to calculate the solar irradiance on sloped planes by integrating the sky radiance distribution. Sky radiance data recorded from January 1999 to December 2001 in Hong Kong were used to estimate the solar irradiance for the horizontal and four principal vertical surfaces (N, E, S and W). The performance of this approach was assessed against data measured in the same period. Statistical results showed that using sky radiance distributions to predict solar irradiance can give reasonably good agreement with measured data for both horizontal and vertical planes. The prediction approach was also employed to compute the solar irradiance of a 22.3° (latitude angle of Hong Kong) inclined south oriented surface. The findings indicated that the method can provide an accurate alternative to determine the amount of solar irradiance on inclined surfaces facing various orientations when sky radiance data are available. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

20844457991	Bioclimatic building designs for different climates in China	This paper presents the work on developing simple bioclimatic building design charts for five major climatic zones in mainland China. These zones include severe cold, cold, hot summer & cold winter, mild, and hot summer & warm winter. Five cities, namely Changchun, Beijing Shanghai, Kunming and Guangzhou were selected to represent the five major climates. Six basic design strategies such as conventional heating, passive solar heating, natural ventilation, thermal mass with/without overnight ventilation, evaporative cooling and air-conditioning were considered. Their respective regions were shown on the psychrometric chart. Twelve monthly climatic lines were determined and assessed in relation to the comfort zone and the six design strategy regions. The comfort zone was based on the acceptable range of operative temperatures and humidity for spaces specified in the latest ASHRAE standard 55-2004. Using the bioclimatic charts, discomfort indices were determined and the appropriate climatic control design strategies investigated. It is hope that these basic climate analyses could give architects and engineers a feel for the appropriate design strategies during the initial conceptual design stage when different building schemes are being considered.

0000042981	Luminous efficacy of daylight under different sky conditions	Daylighting is recognised as an important and useful strategy in terms of energy-efficient building design in hot climates. However, daylighting is always accompanied by unwanted solar heat gain, particularly during the cooling season. To achieve and evaluate daylighting design, solar radiation and outdoor illuminance data are needed. In 1991, a measuring station was installed at the City University of Hong Kong to measure global and diffuse solar radiation and outdoor illuminance. The measured data are analysed, and empirical models to determine luminous efficacy under different sky conditions are developed and presented. Implications for energy efficiency in building designs are discussed. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0000549040	A statistical approach to the development of a typical meteorological year for Hong Kong	Measured hourly weather data for the 16-year period from 1979 to 1994 were analysed. Statistics techniques were used to develop a typical meteorological year (TMY) for building energy simulation. We used the Finkelstein-Schafer (FS) and the Kolmogrov-Smirnov (KS) two-sample statistics to analyse and select representative weather data for the formulation of a TMYfor Hong Kong. Building energy computer simulations using DOE-2 were carried out. It was found that the monthly electricity consumption profile from the TMY was close to that from the 16-year long-term weather data. The root-mean-square error was 27.7MWh, 3.9% of the long-term mean monthly consumption. On an annual basis, TMY predicted 1.5% more consumption than the long-term.

The thermal performance (in terms of the overall thermal transfer values) of this building stock was surveyed and analysed. General design features, such as appearances and orientations of the buildings, building materials used for the facades, the overall fenestration area and solar shading provisions were investigated. Attempts were made to find out the general techniques used by designers to minimiseolar beat passing through the building envelopes. The internal facilities for lighting, air-conditioning, electrical equipment and lift services were also studied to establish the power bad density and electricity consumption index. A general description of the economic influences on the building industry during that time span is also presented.

Basic principles of sensitivity methods for the study of building energy performance are explained. The DOE-2 building energy simulation program is used on a generic model of an office building to generate data for the study. Important input design parameters are identified and analysed from points of view of annual building energy consumption, peak design loads and building load profiles. It is believed that sensitivity techniques are useful for assessing thermal responses of buildings and data variability in building energy simulation. However, the results should be interpreted in context with clear understanding of the implications and limitations.

0002201456	Predicting vertical luminous efficacy using horizontal solar data	Daylighting is recognized as an important and useful strategy in the design of energy-efficient buildings. Daylight illuminance, particularly on vertical surfaces, plays a major role in determining and evaluating the daylighting performance of a building. Luminous efficacy approach is considered as a versatile and easily applied way to calculate outdoor illuminance. This paper presents an approach to estimate the vertical outdoor illuminance from computed vertical luminous efficacy based on the measured horizontal solar irradiance and illuminance data. Hourly data recorded from January 1996 to December 1998 in Hong Kong were used for the model development. The performance of the proposed model and two well-known anisotropic inclined surface models (Muneer and Perez) was evaluated against data measured in 1999. Statistical analysis indicated that the proposed model gives reasonably good agreement with measured data for all vertical planes. The proposed model can provide an alternative to building designers in estimating the vertical solar illuminance and irradiance where only the horizontal measurements are available. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2001.

0031221313	Regression analysis of high-rise fully air-conditioned office buildings	The building energy simulation computer program DOE-2 was used to carry out a parametric study of a generic high-rise air-conditioned office building in Hong Kong. A total of 28 design parameters related to the building load, the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system and the HVAC refrigeration plant were found to correlate well with the predicted annual electricity consumption. Both linear and non-linear multiple regression techniques were used to develop regression models and energy equations for the prediction of annual electricity use. Twelve input design parameters (six from building load, four from HVAC system and two from HVAC refrigeration plant) were considered to be the most significant design variables and were used in the energy prediction equations. It is hoped that the resulting models and energy equations can be used as a simplified design tool for comparing the relative thermal and energy performance of different design schemes during the early design stage. This paper presents the methodology and the development work, and discusses the findings. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

0032008015	Daylighting and energy analysis for air-conditioned office buildings	We propose a simple method for estimating the likely energy savings in electric lighting due to daylighting and the possible cooling penalty. Fractions of the working year and cooling season when daylighting alone is adequate to provide the indoor design illuminance are presented for on-off and top-up controls. Based on the simple average daylight factor method, energy savings in electric lighting have been estimated for a generic office building using measured outdoor illuminance data in Hong Kong. The daylight-induced cooling penalty is estimated using average solar heat gain factors. Our case study suggests that daylighting schemes can result in substantial energy savings in air-conditioned office buildings in Hong Kong.

0032182510	Correlation analysis of solar radiation and cloud cover	Measured hourly solar radiation and cloud cover data were analysed. Regression analysis techniques were used to correlate the monthly-average-daily and monthly-average-hourly global and diffuse radiation with the corresponding cloud cover data. The mean bias error (MBE) is very small, representing less than 1% of the mean measured values. This indicates the regression models developed do not exhibit any long-term persistence in under- or over-estimation of solar radiation from cloud cover data. However, on an individual year basis, the MBE can be as high as 20% of the mean measured values for the hourly data prediction. It has also been found that using multiple regression techniques to correlate solar radiation with both the cloud cover data and the solar altitude can improve the prediction by about 5% as compared with the simple Ångstrom-Prescott linear regression equation. This paper describes the analysis and presents the findings.

A total of 18 cities representing the five major climatic types, namely severe cold, cold, hot summer and cold winter, mild and hot summer and warm winter were selected for climatic analysis. Measured weather data were gathered and analysed. A bioclimatic approach was adopted in which the comfort zone and 12 monthly climatic lines were determined and plotted on the psychrometric chart for each city. From these bioclimatic charts, the potential use of passive design strategies such as solar heating, natural ventilation, thermal mass with/without night ventilation and evaporative cooling was assessed.

27744533684	Environmental Accounting of Municipal Solid Waste Originating from Rooms and Restaurants in the Hong Kong Hotel Industry	This article focuses on the estimation and the environmental accounting of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced by the hotel industry in Hong Kong. Five models to estimate the amount of the hotel industry's MSW were developed. It was revealed that plastic toiletries in the industry ranked highest, and newspapers ranked second. Also, the research found that the minimum amount of MSW produced for each occupied room was 1.978 kg, and the quantity of MSW created by the Hong Kong hotel industry reached at least 53,070 tons in 1996, with an estimated environmental cost of 3.02 million Hong Kong dollars. The model predicted that local hotels would produce 53,607 tons of MSW by the year 2000. On average, the hotel industry's share in the overall MSW was 1.5% in the 1986 to 2000 period. Based on the methodologies and findings, suggestions concerning green accounting at three levels are made. © 2001 International Council on Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education.

3142675681	Predicting daylight illuminance by computer simulation techniques	The first step in evaluating the visual performance and energy efficiency provided by daylight requires an accurate estimation of the amount of daylight entering a building. Traditionally, the daylight performance of a building is often evaluated in terms of daylight factors with the calculations being based on the CIE overcast sky. In general, the daylight factor approach is quite simple to use but it cannot predict the dynamic variations in interior illuminance as sky conditions and the sun's position change. The recently introduced concept of the daylight coefficient, which needs sky luminance data, provides an alternative approach. With the advances in computer technology, the computation of daylight illuminance using the two prediction methods can be conducted by a simulation program. This paper presents a study of the daylight factor and daylight coefficient approaches. The interior daylight illuminance data measured in a scale model and a classroom were compared with the simulated results using RADIANCE computer simulation software. It was found that, in general, the daylight coefficient approach performs better than daylight factor approach. Both methods tend to estimate the daylight illuminance less accurately when the measurement points in the classroom are far away from the window façade. It seems that the parameters for inter-reflection calculations including the furniture layout and external obstructions cannot be input into the RADIANCE program with sufficient detail for accurate simulation. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2004.

33645391993	Impacts of lighting density on heating and cooling loads in different climates in China	Changes in lighting load density affect not only energy use for electric lighting but also energy requirements for space heating and cooling. In general, a reduction in electric energy use would tend to increase space heating during the winter months and lower the cooling requirement in the summer. The implications for total building energy use, however, would vary, depending on the building and building services designs, its operation and the prevailing climates.

Long term (1971-2000) measured weather data such as dry bulb and dew point temperatures, wind speed and global solar radiation were gathered and analysed. A total of seven climatic indices were used to select the 12 typical meteorological months (TMMs) that made up the TMY for each city. In general, the cumulative distribution functions of the TMMs selected tended to follow their long term counterparts quite well. There was no persistent trend in any particular years being more representative than the others, though 1978 and 1982 tended to be picked most often. This paper presents the work and its findings.

35848937340	Building energy simulation using multi-years and typical meteorological years in different climates	Detailed hourly energy simulation was conducted for office buildings in the five major climate zones - severe cold, cold, hot summer and cold winter, mild and hot summer and warm winter - in China using multi-year (1971-2000) weather databases as well as typical meteorological years (TMY). The primary aim was to compare the energy simulation results from the TMY with those from individual years and their long term means. A total of 154 simulation runs were performed. Building heating and cooling loads, their components and energy use for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning were analysed. Predicted monthly load and energy consumption profiles from the TMY tended to follow the long term mean quite closely. Mean bias errors ranged from -4.3% in Guangzhou to 0% in Beijing and root-mean-square errors from 3% in Harbin to 5.4% in Guangzhou. These percentages were not always the smallest compared with the 30 individual years, however, they are at the lower end of the percentage error ranges.

The simplified circumsolar (α = 25°) and point source versions using the local coefficients and those given by Perez have been assessed. A statistical analysis of the Perez models has shown that predictions for solar irradiance provide more accurate results than daylight illuminance. All versions tend to have less statistical errors for shaded vertical surfaces. For both vertical solar irradiance and daylight illuminance estimations, the circumsolar ((α = 25°) version produces the largest errors when using coefficients proposed by Perez but it shows the best performance when local coefficients are fitted. It may suggest that the large number of empirical coefficients used in the Perez models make them site-specific.

The simulation tool was DOE-2.1E. The thermal and energy performance of daylighting schemes were analysed in terms of the reduction in electric lighting requirement and the cooling penalty due to solar heat. Regression analysis was conducted to correlate the peak electricity demand and annual incremental electricity use with two fenestration variables, namely the solar aperture and the daylighting aperture. Contours of equal annual incremental electricity use were shown to be a function of the solar and daylighting apertures. It is envisaged that these simple charts can be a useful design tool for architects and engineers to assess the relative energy performance of different fenestration designs, particularly during the initial design stage when different building design schemes and concepts are being considered and developed.

Air conditioning accounts for about one-third of total electricity use in this sector. Computer simulations evaluated the likely energy savings from use of tinted glass to reduce solar heat and the application of thermal insulation to external walls to reduce heat conduction. Electricity savings are predicted to be small during 1997-2007, equivalent to 0.2% of total electricity use in the residential sector in 1997. Energy savings will be greater in the longer term as older buildings are replaced with more energy efficient structures.

0034179806	Shading effects due to nearby buildings and energy implications	This paper investigates the shading effects due to neighbouring buildings in seven main business districts in Hong Kong. A total of 120 commercial buildings have been selected in the survey. It has been found that the degree of shading at the local peak design condition (i.e. 15:00 July) ranges from 25 to 31%. The older and more established districts tend to have slightly higher degrees of shading. Computer simulation techniques using the DOE-2.1E building energy program and a generic office building have been employed to analyze the amounts of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant oversizing (as a result of solar heat overestimation) and to assess the likely energy penalty. It has been found that the total building cooling load is overestimated by about 2%. The corresponding plant oversizing seems to be marginal, and the impacts on the total building energy budget are not significant. Implications for energy efficiency in the design of commercial buildings are discussed and further research and development work is suggested.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using daylight to save energy in buildings. Lighting control integrated with daylighting is recognised as an important and useful strategy in terms of energy-efficient building design. It is believed that proper daylighting schemes can help reduce the electrical demand and contribute to achieving environmentally sustainable building developments. This paper presents a simple method for estimating the likely energy savings in electric lighting due to daylighting and the possible cooling penalty.

A statistical analysis of the three models has shown that predictions for solar irradiance tend to be more accurate than daylight illuminance. All three models produce large errors for north-facing surfaces. Predictions for south-facing surfaces show reasonably good agreement with measured data, indicating good estimations of anisotropic diffuse component at sunlit surfaces. In general, Perez's model shows the best predictions for vertical solar irradiance and daylight illuminance followed by, Hay's, then Klucher's models. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

38749131178	Seasonal variations in residential and commercial sector electricity consumption in Hong Kong	We present the energy use situation in Hong Kong from 1979 to 2006. The primary energy requirement (PER) nearly tripled during the 28-year period, rising from 195,405 to 566,685 TJ, about two-third of which was used for electricity generation. The residential and commercial sectors are the two largest electricity end-users with an average annual growth rate of 5.9% and 7.4%, respectively. The monthly consumption in these two sectors shows distinct seasonal variations mainly due to changes in the air-conditioning requirements, which are affected by the prevailing weather conditions. Principal component analysis of five major climatic variables-dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, global solar radiation, clearness index and wind speed-was conducted. Measured sector-wide electricity consumption was correlated with the corresponding two principal components determined using multiple regression technique. The regression models could give a very good indication of the annual electricity use (largely within a few percents), but individual monthly estimation could differ by up to 24%. It was also found that the climatic indicators determined appeared to show a slight increasing trend during the 28-year period indicating a subtle, but gradual change of climatic conditions that might affect future air-conditioning requirements. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

58849125257	Simple method for determining daylight illuminance in a heavily obstructed environment	Daylighting has long been recognized as an important issue in architecture. In Hong Kong many buildings are constructed close to each other and hence the external environment plays a significant role in building designs. Recently, vertical daylight factor (VDF) has been used as a criterion to justify the provision of natural lighting in buildings. This paper studies the calculation approach of VDF in a heavily obstructed environment. The techniques for determining the sky component and the reflected daylight from surrounding buildings and ground surfaces are described. Calculation tools in the form of simple equations and diagrams through computer-simulation analysis were established. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated against the daylight illuminance obtained by other independent computer simulations. It was found that predictions from the proposed approach were in good agreements with those produced by simulated results. The findings provide architects and building designers with a simple method for estimating the daylight illuminance at early design and planning stage. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For low forcing, the estimated increase in cooling energy use was 18.5% in Harbin, 20.4% in Beijing, 11.4% in Shanghai, 24.2% in Kunming and 14.1% in Hong Kong; and the reduction in heating 22.3% in Harbin, 26.6% in Beijing, 55.7% in Shanghai, 13.8% in Kunming and 23.6% in Hong Kong. Space heating is usually provided by oil- or gas-fired boiler plants, whereas space cooling mainly relies on electricity. There would certainly be a shift towards electrical power demand. More energy use in buildings would lead to larger emissions, which in turn would exacerbate climate change and global warming. Energy conservation measures were considered to mitigate the impact of climate change on building energy use. These included building envelope, indoor condition, lighting load density and chiller coefficient of performance. It was found that raising the summer indoor design condition by 1-2. °C could result in significant energy savings and have great mitigation potential. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A major city within each climate zone was selected. These were Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Hong Kong. Generic building envelopes were developed based on data gathered from building surveys, local energy codes and the ASHRAE Standard. The overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) method and the heating degree-days technique were adopted in the analysis. Cooling and heating requirements due to heat gain/loss through the building envelopes were determined based on the respective OTTV parameters and building load coefficients. Different shape coefficients were also considered. For a typical floor, chiller load due to heat gain through the building envelope varied from 1.0 kW h/m

4444368728	A simplified procedure using daylight coefficient concept for sky component prediction	The amount of daylight illuminance at a point inside a building is mainly influenced by the luminance levels and patterns of the sky in the direction of views of the surface at that time. The daylight coefficient approach, which considers changes in the luminance of the sky elements, offers a more effective way for computing indoor daylight illuminances. Recently, Kittler et al. have proposed a new range of 15 standard skies including the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) standard clear sky. This paper presents a graphical method to calculate interior illuminance for the CIE standard clear sky based on daylight coefficient concept. The simplified techniques in the form of a nomograph and Waldram diagram were developed and described. The performance of the graphical method was assessed against the results determined using daylight factor method and a lighting simulation program. It was shown that the sky components predicted by the nomograph were in reasonably good agreement with those produced from the other two approaches. The findings provide architects and building designers a reliable and simple alternative that incorporates daylight coefficient concept to estimate the interior daylight illuminance.

The building peak monthly heating load varied from 142 MW h (1033 MW h cooling) in Hong Kong to 447 MW h (832 MW h cooling) in Harbin. It was also found that passive solar designs could have large energy savings potential in the severe cold and cold climates. In Harbin, the window solar component helped lower the annual building heating load by 650 MW h. Internal loads (lighting and office equipment) and part load operations of fans and pumps also played a significant role in the overall building energy efficiency. This paper presents the work, its findings and energy efficiency implications. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

4744351372	Long-term wind speed statistics and implications for outside surface thermal resistance	The 30-year long-term (1968-97) wind speeds were analysed, and a long-tenn hourly wind speed database developed. Based on the statistical analysis, the outdoor design wind speeds at different significant levels (0.1%-10%) were determined for the summer and winter periods in Hong Kong. It was found that, at the 2.5% significant level, the summer and winter design wind speed were 7.5 and 7.0 m/s, respectively. The implications of these design wind speeds for the convective heat transfer coefficient and the corresponding outside surface resistance were investigated following the CIBSE Guide and the ASHRAE Handbook, which are commonly used in the local design practices. This paper presents the work and discusses its findings.

4744358463	Household energy use and comfort cooling in Hong Kong	An overview of the energy use in the residential sector in Hong Kong during a 24-year period from 1975 to 1998 was carried out. There was a marked increase in the electricity use, particularly for comfort cooling. Air-conditioning was by far the single largest electricity end-user counting for about 40% of the total household energy use. To get some idea about the thermal condition and comfort cooling in the housing sector, a preliminary survey and site measurement of four households was conducted. An indoor climate analyser was used to measure the room air temperature, its corresponding relative humidity and air movement. This paper presents the findings and discusses its energy implications.

4744375349	Weather data analysis and design implications for different climatic zones in China	Measured long-term hourly and daily weather data for five cities in China, namely Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kuming and Hong Kong were gathered and analysed. These cities were selected to represent the five main architectural climates-severe cold, cold, hot summer and cold winter, mild, and hot summer and warm winter. Statistical techniques and graphical methods were used to study the long-term weather characteristics of these five climatic zones. Three common climatic variables, namely temperature (dry-bulb and wet-bulb), solar radiation (global, direct and diffuse) and wind conditions (wind speed and wind direction), were investigated. The frequency of occurrence and cumulative frequency distributions were determined and presented, and implications for building and building services designs were discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

54149093706	A new variable for climate change study and implications for the built environment	This short technical note presents an attempt to develop a new climatic variable Z for assessing climate change (global warming) with respect to the built environment. Principal component analysis of long-term (30-year) dry-bulb temperature (DBT), wet-bulb temperature and global solar radiation data was conducted in the 5 major climate zones in China. It was found that while the long-term trend was increasing for the DBT in all 5 major climates, hot summer and warm winter climate zone showed a decreasing trend (though slightly) in the annual and seasonal average Z values. This suggests that climate change might not necessarily result in higher cooling loads in buildings. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

58649124955	Impact of modelled global solar radiation on simulated building heating and cooling loads	Two-parameter regression models were used to predict global solar radiation (GSR) for the nine major thermal zones and sub-zones - severe cold (I, II and III), cold (I, II and III), hot summer and cold winter, mild, and hot summer and warm winter - across China. The impact of using modelled GSR on building energy simulation was investigated. A total of nine cities were selected, one for each thermal zone. Generic office buildings were developed for each of the nine cities according the local design/energy codes. Two sets of energy simulation were conducted for each city, one with the measured GSR and the other the modelled data. The computed results were analysed in four aspects - solar heat through the windows, building heating loads, building cooling loads and the corresponding building energy consumption. It was found that simulated annual heating/cooling loads could differ by 0.1-6.2% and total building energy consumption 0.1-1.2%. These differences were also compared with the mean bias error and root-mean-squared error of the modelled GSR. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0034745038	CFD analysis and energy simulation of a gymnasium	A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program EXACT3 has been applied to investigate the temperature distribution and air movement within an air-conditioned gymnasium with four different, but commonly found, exhaust positions in Hong Kong. In this numerical study, the effects of thermal stratification on the energy performance (in terms of cooling load and electricity consumption) are examined with respect to the HVAC plant oversizing issue. It has been found that significant thermal stratification occurs in the gymnasium. The annual cooling load can be overestimated by 45.4% for the best exhaust position when the effect of thermal stratification is not considered. The corresponding peak cooling load and, hence, chiller plant size, will increase from 59.9 to 77.6 kW. The low energy efficiency of the oversized chiller at part-load operation results in a 7% increase in the annual energy use for the HVAC plant. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Life cycle cost technique was used in the analysis of replacing general lighting service (GLS) lamps with energy saving light bulbs in hotel corridors. Discounting approach was adopted to compute the net present value of electricity cost over a life cycle of five years. Two city hotels in Hong Kong were selected for the case studies. It was found that the simple payback period was about one year, and the reduction in electricity consumption and hence running cost could be up to 70% over the life cycle taken in this study.

0035400980	Life cycle energy cost analysis of heat pump application for hotel swimming pools	This paper presents the work on evaluating the thermal performance and life cycle energy cost of using heat pumps for hotel swimming pools in subtropical climates. A roof top pool in a city hotel was investigated. The energy requirement for maintaining the pool water temperature was analysed in terms of the energy loss through four major processes, namely evaporation, radiation, convection and water refill. The governing equations for these four heat loss processes were developed based on a review of the literature. It was found that substantial energy savings could be achieved. Compared with conventional electric boilers and condensing/non-condensing gas fired boilers, the total energy savings during a 6 1/2 month (mid-October to April) heating season ranged from 39.9 to 46.3 MW h. A life cycle of 10 years was used to calculate the net present value of the energy cost. Over a 10 year life cycle, the energy cost could be reduced by HK$ 275,700 if a heat pump (with a mean seasonal coefficient of performance of 3.5) were used instead of a conventional electric boiler or condensing boiler. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035443099	Preliminary measurements of thermal and visual conditions in shopping malls in Hong Kong	We present electricity use in the commercial sector in Hong Kong during the 30-year period from 1970 to 1999. The average annual growth rate was 9.1% during the past three decades. Commercial buildings, especially shopping centres, are major electricity end-users. A survey often fully air-conditioned shopping centres built during the 1980s and 1990s was conducted to establish the typical indoor thermal and visual conditions. The measured conditions were compared with established international thermal comfort and lighting standards. Two aspects were found to have energy saving potential, namely inside air temperature and daylighting. Although about 90% of the measured thermal conditions complied with the ASHRAE comfort zones, it was found that the summer conditions tended to be 1-2°C lower that the 25.5°C/55% relative humidity recommended for local air-conditioned commercial premises. This paper presents the findings and discusses the energy implications.

This paper presents the study of these climatic parameters and their applications in the classification of sky condition.

It is believed that proper daylighting schemes can help reduce the electrical demand and contribute to achieving environmentally sustainable building development. This paper presents field measurements on daylighting for a fully air-conditioned office building in Hong Kong. Electricity consumption by the fluorescent luminaires, indoor illuminance levels and the room parameters affecting daylighting designs were recorded and analysed. The measurements covered several cellular offices facing opposite orientations with and without daylighting controls. The findings suggest that daylighting schemes can result in substantial energy savings in air-conditioned office buildings in Hong Kong.

74149090373	An analysis of the bioclimates in different climates and implications for the built environment in China	Underlying trends of long-term summer and winter discomfort in terms of heat and cold stresses in the nine major thermal climate zones and sub-zones across China were investigated using 102-year (1901-2002) weather data. In severe cold climates, winter discomfort dominated (about 66%) and the comfort index (CI) varied from -5 (extremely cold) to +2 (hot). A gradual shift from predominantly negative CI to positive CI was observed as one moved across the climate zones from the north to warmer climates in the south. Temperature rise resulted in less discomfort in the winter and more discomfort in the summer. Though the reduction in cold stress and increase in heat stress were moderate during the 102-year period, the last two decades tended to exhibit the largest changes. It is envisaged that if these trends continue, changes in cold and heat stresses in the 21st century would be much greater than those experienced during the 20th century. This could have significant implications for building designs and energy use in the built environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

74149092143	Long-term trends of heat stress and energy use implications in subtropical climates	Past and future trends of human comfort in terms of heat and cold stresses under the local subtropical climates using measured meteorological data as well as predictions from general climate models were investigated. Summer discomfort showed an increasing trend (and winter discomfort a decreasing trend) over the past 41 years from 1968 to 2008. Monthly mean minimum and maximum temperatures and moisture content predictions from a general climate model (MIROC3.2-H) were used to determine summer and winter discomfort for future years (2009-2100) based on two emissions scenarios B1 and A1B (low and medium forcing). The 92-year (2009-2100) mean cold stress would be reduced from the 41-year (1968-2008) mean value of 8.7 to about three for both emissions scenarios. The 92-year mean heat stress would be 115.9 and 120.6 for B1 and A1B, respectively, representing 31.6% and 36.9% increase over the 1968-2008 long-term average of 88.1. These suggest that the already small winter heating requirement in subtropical Hong Kong would become even more insignificant in future years, whereas the increasing trend of summer discomfort would result in more cooling demand in the built environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

74249100855	Principal component analysis and long-term building energy simulation correlation	The objective was to investigate whether energy use in buildings from simulation could be correlated with a new composite climatic index, which would account for the influences of major climatic variables such as temperature, humidity and solar radiation. Principal component analysis of prevailing weather conditions in sub-tropical Hong Kong was conducted, and a new climatic index Z determined. Multi-year (1979-2007) building energy simulations were carried out for a generic office building. It was found that Z exhibited daily and seasonal variations similar to the simulated cooling load and building energy use. Regression models were developed to correlate the simulated daily cooling load and building energy use with the corresponding daily Z. Error analysis indicated that annual building energy use from the regression models were very close to the simulated values; the difference was less than 2%. Difference in individual daily energy use, however, could be up to 6%. It was also found that both the simulated annual building energy use and the new climatic variable Z appeared to show an increasing trend during the 29-year period, indicating a subtle, but gradual change of climatic conditions that might affect energy use in buildings in future years. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

74049114190	Evaluation of a simple method for determining the vertical daylight factor against full-scale measured data	Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Its buildings are largely high-rise blocks constructed close to each other and, hence outdoor obstructions play significant roles in daylighting designs. The light reflected from the ground and surrounding buildings can be important sources of interior lighting and detailed computations are required. We currently propose a calculation procedure in terms of a number of regression equations to determine the daylight illuminance on vertical surfaces. This paper presents the work to assess this approach via full-scale measurements under real sky conditions. The mean surface reflectance for external obstructions was estimated using lighting simulation techniques. It was shown that daylight illuminance obtained by the proposed method were in reasonably good agreement with measured readings. The simple nature of the proposed approach offers building professionals and students a reliable and convenient alternative to predict daylight illuminance particularly when different daylighting schemes and concepts are being considered. © 2009 SAGE Publications.

The primary energy requirement (PER) nearly tripled during the 23-year period, rising from 195,405 TJ to 572,684 TJ. Most of the PER was used for electricity generation, and the electricity use in residential buildings rose from 7556 TJ (2099 GWh) to 32,799 TJ (9111 GWh), an increase of 334%. Air-conditioning accounted for about 40% of the total residential sector electricity consumption. A total of 144 buildings completed in the month of June during 1992-2001 were surveyed. Energy performance of the building envelopes was investigated in terms of the overall thermal transfer value (OTTV). To develop the appropriated parameters used in OTTV calculation, long-term measured weather data such as ambient temperature (1960-2001), horizontal global solar radiation (1992-2001) and global solar radiation on vertical surfaces (1996-2001) were examined.

Multi-year (1979-2008) building energy simulations were carried out for a generic office building. It was found that Z exhibited monthly and seasonal variations similar to the simulated cooling/heating loads and building energy use. Regression models were developed to correlate the simulated monthly building cooling loads and total energy use with the corresponding Z. Error analysis indicated that annual building energy use from the regression models were very close to the simulated values; the difference was about 1%. Difference in individual monthly cooling load and energy use, however, could be up to 4%. It was also found that both the DOE-simulated results during 1979-2008 and the regression-predicted data during 2009-2100 indicated an increasing trend in annual cooling load and energy use and a gradual reduction in the already insignificant heating requirement in cooling-dominated office buildings in subtropical climates. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Air conditioning consumption showed an increasing trend over the past 30 years from 1979 to 2008. Principal component analysis (PCA) of measured and predicted monthly mean dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature and global solar radiation was conducted to determine a new climatic index Z for 1979-2008 and future 92 years (2009-2100) based on two emissions scenarios B1 and A1B (low and medium forcing). Through regression analysis, electricity use in air conditioning for the 92-year period was estimated. For low forcing, average consumption in 2009-2038, 2039-2068 and 2069-2100 would be, respectively, 5.7%, 12.8% and 18.4% more than the 1979-2008 average, with a mean 12.5% increase for the entire 92-year period. Medium forcing showed a similar increasing trend, but 1-4% more. Standard deviations of the monthly air conditioning consumption were found to be smaller suggesting possible reduction in seasonal variations in future years. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77956172237	Impact of climate change on residential building envelope cooling loads in subtropical climates	Future trends of cooling load due to heat gain through the building envelopes in the residential sector in subtropical Hong Kong under different emissions scenarios in the 21st century were investigated. Predicted monthly weather data from five general circulation models were gathered and analysed. An increasing trend of building envelope cooling load was observed. The average annual cooling load during the 2009-2100 period would be 6.1% and 9.8% more than that during 1979-2008 for low and medium forcing, respectively. If only the last 30 years (2071-2100) were considered, the percentage increase would be much larger at 12.3% and 21.6%. Four mitigation or energy conservation measures - raising the indoor temperature, thermal insulation, double glazing and tinted glass - were considered. Among them, raising the indoor temperature has the best mitigation potential because there is a growing awareness and recognition of adaptive thermal comfort and it can be readily applied to both existing and new buildings at no extra cost. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Potential mitigation measures concerning the building envelope, internal condition, lighting load density (LLD) and chiller plant were considered. Thermal insulation to the external wall would not be effective to mitigate the expected increase in building energy use due to climate change.

For the six severe cold and cold climate zones in the north, reductions in cumulative cold stress outweighed the increase in cumulative heat stress resulting in an overall decreasing trend in the annual cumulative stress, and vice versa for the other three warmer climate zones in the south. Compared with the 20th century, significant reduction in the cumulative cold stress was observed across the six zones in severe cold and cold climates, ranging from 15.8 in cold-III to 42.3 in severe cold-II. There were modest increases in the cumulative heat stress from 0.3 in cold-II to 12.3 in cold-III. For the warmer climates in the south, reduction in cumulative cold stress ranged from 7.6 in hot summer and warm winter (HSWW) to 10.3 in hot summer and cold winter, while cumulative heat stress increased from 9.9 in the mild zone to 30.6 in HSWW. A reduction in cold stress would result in less winter heating and an increase in heat stress more cooling requirement. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

0036078854	A study on pollutant emission through gas consumption in the Hong Kong hotel industry	A survey of 11 hotels in Hong Kong was carried out to collect three years' energy consumption data. Regression analysis indicated that gross floor area was a major and statistically acceptable factor in explaining the gas consumption in new hotels. Based on past consumption data and some established pollutant emission factors, the amount of sulphur dioxides, nitrogen dioxides, carbon dioxides and particulate created by the Hong Kong hotel industry's gas usage during a 10-year period from 1989-1998 was estimated. The study predicts the increase in these amounts in 1999-2003 accompanying the rise in the number of hotels. The findings indicate that emissions will rise by nearly 40% in the next few years, requiring urgent discussions. The study also finds that a heat pump running on coal-fired electricity and with a coefficient of performance (COP) greater than 3 could produce lower level emissions than a gas-fired boiler. It is further suggested that an effective method to reduce the emissions is to substitute naptha with natural gas as the fuel for generating town gas and electricity. We believe the hotel industry should adopt a more proactive approach to reduce gas usage and propose the inclusion of environmental reporting in trade journals.

0036532627	A new approach for predicting vertical global solar irradiance	Solar irradiance, particularly on vertical surfaces, plays a major role in determining the thermal and energy performance of a building. It is important to the design and analysis of both active solar systems and passive solar buildings. Many mathematical models are mainly developed to predict the sky-diffuse irradiance on inclined surfaces from the measured horizontal diffuse component. This paper presents an approach to estimate the vertical global irradiance based on direct beam and ground-reflected components which can be accurately determined. Hourly data recorded from January 1996 to December 1998 in Hong Kong were used for the model development. The performance of the proposed model and two well-known anisotropic inclined surface models (Muneer and Perez) was evaluated against data measured in 1999. Statistical analysis indicated that the proposed model gives reasonably good agreement with measured data for all vertical planes. Although the new model has been found less effective than the Perez model, its simplicity nature provides buildings designers a convenient and reliable alternative in the estimation of vertical solar irradiance. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

80051979485	Sensitivity analysis of building energy use in different climates	Key design parameters (in terms of their influences on building energy consumption) through sensitivity analysis for fully air-conditioned office buildings in five cities (Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Hong Kong) representing the five major climate zones (severe cold, cold, hot summer and cold winter, mild, and hot summer and warm winter) across China have been identified. These include: i) building envelope - window shading coefficient, window U-value and window-to-wall ratio; ii) internal load - equipment, lighting and occupancy; iii) HVAC system - outdoor fresh air, summer and winter thermostat set points, fan efficiency and fan static pressure; and iv) HVAC plant - chiller COP and boiler efficiency. The influence coefficient (IC, a ratio of the percentage change in computed output (building energy use) to the percentage change in input design parameter was used to indicate likely energy savings. For instance, Hong Kong has a lighting load IC of 0.359, suggesting that a 20% reduction (e.g. from 18 to 14.4 W/m2) in lighting load could result in more than 7% reduction in the total building energy use. Furthermore, Hong Kong also has a summer thermostat set point IC of -1.131, suggesting that a 5% increase in the indoor temperature during the summer (e.g. from 26 to 27.3°C) could result in about 6% energy savings. Given the growing awareness of adaptive thermal comfort, this could be a no-cost energy-efficient measure with great energy saving potential.

80053455985	A new method to develop typical weather years in different climates for building energy use studies	Principal component analysis of 30-year long-term meteorological variables was conducted. Typical principal component years (TPCYs) were determined for Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Hong Kong representing the five major architectural climates across China: severe cold, cold, hot summer and cold winter, mild, and hot summer and warm winter. In each climate zone, the TPCY was compared with the 30 individual years and the widely used typical meteorological year (TMY). The monthly principal component and the predicted total building energy consumption based on the TPCY and TMY were very close to the 30-year long-term mean estimation. TPCY for the 21st century in each of the five cities was also identified using predictions from general climate models. The TPCY approach is a good alternative to the TMY method. Firstly, predicted building energy use from TPCY is closer to the long-term estimation than that from the TMY in different climates. Secondly, because only monthly data are considered, the development of TPCY is much simpler and less time-consuming. This would have important applications in the regular updating of typical weather years for building energy studies and in the assessment of the impact of climate change on energy use in the built environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84857329249	Building energy simulation using measured and modeled hourly solar radiation data	Building energy simulation has proved useful in the development of building energy codes (especially performance-based) and subsequent code compliance checking. A weather year is required for the hourly computation of heating/cooling loads and corresponding energy consumption. Many locations have measured daily solar radiation data, but not hourly. Attempts were made to model hourly global solar radiation (GSR) data from measured daily values using the Liu and Jordan method for Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Hong Kong. These cities are in the five major climate zones of China, namely, severe cold, cold, hot summer and cold winter, mild, and hot summer and warm winter. Statistical analysis of the measured and modeled hourly solar radiation was carried out. The root-mean-squared error ranges from 7 to 13%. Two weather years - one with measured hourly solar radiation and the other modeled data were developed for each city. Generic office buildings were also developed based on the local energy codes. Hourly simulations were conducted to assess the impact of using modeled solar radiation data on the heating/cooling loads. Building heating and cooling loads using modeled hourly GSR tend to be slight higher (on average, 2 to 3%) than those with the measured data.

84860837569	Impact of climate change on energy use in the built environment in different climate zones - A review	Studies on the impact of climate change on energy use in buildings in the different parts of the world were reviewed. Potential mitigation and adaptation measures were discussed and further research work suggested. In severe cold climates reduction in heating requirement would outweigh the modest increase in summer cooling. In the hot summer and cold winter climate zones where both winter heating and summer cooling requirements are important, the magnitude of reduction in heating and the magnitude of increase in cooling could be comparable. The most significant impact on energy use in the built environment would occur in the hot summer and warm winter climates where building energy use is dominated by cooling requirement. Raising the summer set point temperature and reducing the lighting load density would have great energy savings and hence mitigation potential. Space heating is provided largely by oil- or gas-fired boiler plants whereas space cooling mainly relies on electricity. This would result in a shift towards more electrical demand and could have important implications for the nationwide energy and environmental policy for the built environment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84860217038	Generation of typical weather years with identified standard skies for Hong Kong	In subtropical Hong Kong, buildings consume the most of the electricity use. Computer simulation technique is a useful tool for predicting building thermal and energy performance. Simulation computer programs require weather data input to drive the mathematical models within the simulation tools for comparative studies and annual energy estimation. Typical weather year data representing the long-term climatic conditions are often used. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in incorporating daylight in the architectural and building designs to reduce building energy consumption. However, daylight parameters are not always available. In 2003, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) adopted a range of 15 standard skies covering probably the whole spectrum of the usual skies in the world. Once the skies have been identified, the basic solar irradiance and daylight illuminance at various inclined planes can be obtained. This paper presents the work on the development and evaluation of two typical weather datasets, namely Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) and Test Reference Year (TRY). Measured hourly weather data for the 30-year period from 1979 to 2008 were analysed. Building energy simulations were conducted to evaluate the two weather datasets. Daylight parameters were derived using luminous efficacy approach and the sky conditions were categorized based on common climatic variables. © 2012.

Decreasing trends of cumulative cold stress and increasing trends of cumulative heat stress were observed in all the major climate types and sub-types. This could have significant implications for building designs and energy use in the built environment. A reduction in cold stress would lead to less heating requirement and an increase in heat stress more cooling. Analysis was also conducted for the world climates in eight regions - North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia (Far East), Asia (Southeast), Asia (Middle East), and Australia and Pacific Islands. It was found that South America, Africa and Asia (Southeast) showed an increasing trend in the annual cumulative stress suggesting that the increase in cumulative heat stress outweighed the reduction in cumulative cold stress. Expected increases in the demand for electricity with greater carbon emissions present a challenge to building researchers and energy and environmental policy makers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0036842390	Daylighting and its implications to overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) determinations	The overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) and daylighting are two approaches controlling building energy use. In Hong Kong, although OTTV calculations are mandatory in the submission of building plans for approval, daylighting credits are not included in building envelope designs. To promote energy-efficient building designs we use the computer simulation tool, DOE-2, to illustrate the energy performance of a generic commercial building due to various daylighting schemes and OTTV designs. The year-round energy expenditures and loads are determined from the simulation results. Analysis is carried out in terms of the reduction in electric lighting requirement and the cooling penalty due to solar heat. Regression techniques are conducted to correlate the annual incremental electricity use with OTTV and daylighting aperture (DA) (product of window-to-wall ratio (WWR) and light transmittance (LT)). Contours of equal annual incremental electricity use for different building envelope parameters are developed. Important features for daylighting schemes are highlighted and implications for OTTV designs are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0037332940	An analysis of electricity end-use in air-conditioned office buildings in Hong Kong	There has been a growing interest in the electrical end-use patterns in air-conditioned commercial buildings in Hong Kong. A total of four high-rise fully air-conditioned office buildings were selected as case studies. The total building electrical load was broken down into four major electricity end-users, namely heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), lighting, small power and lift/escalator. The hourly load profiles of these electricity end-users were monitored during the hot summer months of July and August. It was found that HVAC was the single largest electricity end-user, accounting for 30-60% of the total building electrical demand during office hours. Electric lighting was second with 20-35% and small power third with 15-25%. Lift/escalator accounted for a few percentage of the total building load. An analysis of the peak load revealed that chiller load was a major component. It was found that chiller load shifting using thermal chilled store could reduce the peak building load by about 20%. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0037400673	An analysis of all-sky zenith luminance data for Hong Kong	Sky luminance distribution data are of great importance to estimate internal daylight illuminance for building energy modelling. Sky luminance of a particular sky patch is always expressed as a ratio of the corresponding zenith luminance. For places where measured zenith luminance is not available, generating the required data from conversion models would be an appropriate alternative. This paper describes the sky luminance measurements made in 1999 at the City University of Hong Kong and reports the findings. A simple model relating zenith luminance and horizontal diffuse illuminance has been proposed. An evaluation of the proposed model and the Perez zenith luminance model has been carried out. It has been found that the proposed model gives reasonably good agreement with the measured data and outperforms the Perez model. The simplicity nature of the proposed model provides a convenient and reliable approach for building designers in estimating the zenith luminance as well as the whole sky luminance distribution. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0037402020	An investigation of daylighting performance and energy saving in a daylit corridor	Daylighting has often been recognised as a useful source of energy savings in buildings. For daylit spaces, daylight-linked automatic lighting control can give excellent energy savings. The evaluation of energy efficiency due to daylighting is best demonstrated by case studies. This paper presents field measurements on daylighting for a fully air-conditioned daylit corridor. Electric lighting load, brightness of the fluorescent luminaires, daylight illuminance levels and the room parameters affecting daylighting designs were recorded and analysed. Traditional daylighting theories have been applied to illustrate how well daylighting measures can perform in reality. It has been found that energy savings in electric lighting was about 70% using dimming control system. The results from this study provide some operational and energy performance data, which would be useful and applicable to other interior spaces with similar architectural designs. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037409093	Electricity consumption characteristics in shopping malls in subtropical climates	We present the electricity use in the commercial sector in subtropical Hong Kong during the 31 year period from 1970 to 2000. The average annual growth rate was 7.4% during the past three decades. Commercial buildings, especially shopping centres, are major electricity end uses. A survey of four fully air conditioned shopping centres built during the 1990s was conducted to establish some energy use characteristics pertinent to shopping centres in subtropical climates. It was found that air conditioning and electric lighting were the major electricity end uses, accounting for about 85% of the total building energy use. Electricity use per unit gross floor area ranged from 391 to 454 kWh/m

0037410196	Energy performance of air-to-water and water-to-water heat pumps in hotel applications	We present work on measurement of the energy performance of heat pumps for hotel operations in subtropical climates. Two city hotels in Hong Kong were investigated. The first case was an application of an air-to-water heat pump to provide heating for an outdoor swimming pool during the heating season. The second case was the installation of three water-to-water heat pumps to complement an existing boiler system for hot water supply. The heating energy output and corresponding electricity use were measured. The heat pump energy efficiency was evaluated in terms of the coefficient of performance (COP), defined as the heating energy output to the electrical energy use. The air-to-water heat pump provided 49.1 MWh heating while consuming 24.6 MWh electricity during the 612-month heating season from mid-October to April. For the water-to-water heat pumps, the estimated annual heating output and the electricity use were 952 and 544 MWh, respectively. It was found that the heat pumps generally operated in a COP range of 1.5-2.4, and the payback period was about two years, which was considered financially attractive. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0037411416	Climatic effects on cooling load determination in subtropical regions	The prevailing local climatic conditions affect the building loads and the heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment sizing and performance. This paper presents work on the determination of outdoor design conditions for cooling load calculation. The computer package DOE-2.1E was used to simulate the hourly cooling load of a generic commercial office building in Hong Kong. Totally, 22 weather data sets, from 1979 to 2000, were used for the analysis. The findings indicate that the outdoor climatic conditions developed for cooling load estimation via the simulations are less stringent than the current outdoor design data and approaches adopted by local architectural and engineering practices. Building designers should select and evaluate critically the outdoor design conditions in order to achieve optimum air conditioning equipment sizing. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights resrved.

84875872405	Residential thermal environment in cold climates at high altitudes and building energy use implications	Field studies of the thermal comfort conditions in residential buildings were conducted in high-latitude regions with sub-atmospheric pressure in China. In the summer study, 33 individuals took part in 25 residential units and 43 individuals in 20 residential units in winter. Both subjective questionnaire survey in terms of thermal sensation votes (TSVs) and objective on-site measurements were carried out. In winter about 68% of the occupants felt slightly cool, cool or cold; only one-quarter of the people felt neutral. The summer situation was much better; 96% indicted comfortable. Results from the TSVs indicated that the neutral temperature for winter and summer was 18.9 °C and 23.3 °C, respectively. The winter neutral temperature was 7.6 °C higher than the mean indoor air temperature of 11.3 °C. Reasons for such large difference were suggested. An adaptive comfort model was developed using linear regression, and the indoor temperature limit was 16.4-29.7 °C based on 90% acceptability. These findings were compared with other field studies and the implications for energy use in buildings were discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84876971423	Zero energy buildings and sustainable development implications - A review	Buildings account for a significant proportion of the total energy and carbon emissions worldwide, and play an important role in formulating sustainable development strategies. There is a growing interest in ZEBs (zero energy buildings) in recent years. Several countries have adopted or considering establishing ZEBs as their future building energy targets to help alleviate the problems concerning the depletion of energy resources and the deterioration of the environment. Broadly speaking, ZEBs involve two design strategies - minimizing the need for energy use in buildings (especially for heating and cooling) through EEMs (energy-efficient measures) and adopting RETs (renewable energy and other technologies) to meet the remaining energy needs. This paper reviews the works related to these two strategies. EEMs include building envelopes, internal conditions, and building services systems; RETs cover photovoltaic/building-integrated photovoltaic, wind turbines, solar thermal (solar water heaters), heat pumps, and district heating and cooling. Issues pertaining to sustainable development implications and further research work required are also highlighted. These include life-cycle cost and environmental impacts, climate change and social policy issues. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84884286443	Analysis and prediction of daylighting and energy performance in atrium spaces using daylight-linked lighting controls	In subtropical Hong Kong, a certain amount of electricity is used to create visually comfortable interior spaces through electric lighting, which is the second major electricity-consuming item in commercial buildings, accounting for 20-30% of total electricity use. The burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation has many adverse effects on the environment. Daylighting is an important and useful strategy for enhancing visual comfort and reducing the need for the electricity consumed by light fittings. The rational use of daylight through tools such as photoelectric lighting controls can effectively reduce buildings' electricity consumption and the related pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Daylighting design techniques are often best demonstrated via field measurements that provide reliable operational and energy performance data for establishing design guidelines. An atrium provides an environmentally controlled indoor public space that introduces daylight into the hearts of large buildings. In circulation areas such as corridors, people expect the way ahead to be sufficiently lit and daylight-linked lighting controls can deliver excellent energy savings. This paper presents the daylighting and energy performance of an atrium space using daylight-linked lighting controls. The cost, energy and environmental issues related to various daylight illuminances are estimated and design implications are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0042068853	Daylighting performance in residential buildings	The amount of daylight entering a building and its distribution depend on both interior and exterior factors. In Hong Kong, most buildings are built close to each other and hence the external environment plays a significant role in the daylighting designs. A study of the local and overseas Building Regulation indicates that the existing statutory documents in Hong Kong and Britain may not be conductive to effective daylighting. Key building parameters affecting daylighting performance in Hong Kong are presented. The quality and quantity of daylight for typical interior rooms have been assessed in terms of room depth, no-sky line and average day light factor. It has been found that the daylight level of residential flats can be severely reduced due to neighbouring buildings. Without any sky obstruction, the average daylight factor ranges from 0.5% for kitchen to 3.5% for bedroom. Sky blockage would be critical for obstruction angles greater than 60°. These imply that many residential flats in Hong Kong would have to rely on supplementary electric lighting.

0141708687	An analysis of lighting energy savings and switching frequency for a daylit corridor under various indoor design illuminance levels	Visual comfort and electric lighting energy issues are essential criteria to justify daylighting schemes. The evaluation of energy efficiency due to daylight linked lighting control systems is best demonstrated by case studies. This paper presents field measurements on daylighting for a fully air-conditioned daylit corridor. Artificial lighting load, brightness of the fluorescent luminaires, daylight availability for various switching illuminance levels were systematically recorded and analyzed. The general features and characteristics of the findings including the number of switching operations and electric-lighting energy savings are presented and discussed. Daylighting theories, using cumulative frequency distribution of outdoor illuminance and regression models based on brightness of light output, outdoor illuminance and electric light power to estimate daylight-linked lighting control savings, have been developed and assessed. It has been found that data from both approaches show reasonably good agreements with measured results. The findings from this study provide some operational and energy information, which would be useful and applicable to other interior spaces with similar architectural designs. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

0042834104	Daylighting in residential districts undergoing urban renewal	The quality and quantity of natural light entering a building depends on both internal and external factors. In Hong Kong, many buildings are high-rise blocks constructed close to each other and hence the external factor plays a significant role in daylighting designs. The situation is particularly acute in "old" districts, where existing low-rise buildings (usually 5-storey) are overshadowed by new high-rise (20-storey or more) apartment blocks. This study examines the effect of external obstruction on the indoor illuminance in existing low-rise buildings. The indoor daylighting levels for different floors were investigated in terms of daylight factors. It has been found that the daylight level of residential flats can be severely reduced due to neighbouring buildings. With severe external obstruction, the daylight factors for rooms on the ground floor can be as low as 0.1%.

0041698262	Energy-saving supporting tourism sustainability: A case study of hotel swimming pool heat pump	Based on energy-related measurements, this article evaluates the thermal performance, energy-saving, indirect emissions and financial feasibility of using heat pumps for hotel out-door swimming pools in subtropical climates. A rooftop pool of a city-centre hotel was investigated. It was found that the average coefficient of performance (COP) was around 2.0. The measured electricity consumption was 24.6 MWh and the total heat output was 49.1 MWh for the heating season studied (mid-December to the late April). Compared with conventional electric boilers and gas-fired condensing/non-condensing boilers, the total energy savings during the heating season ranged from 26.5 to 32.5 MWh. Greenhouse and noxious emissions can also be indirectly reduced by about 12,000 kg. A discounting approach was adopted to compute the net present value of fuel costs over a lifecycle of 10 years. It was found that, over a 10-year lifecycle, the energy cost could be reduced by HK$226,400 when a heat pump with an average COP of 2.0 was used instead of a conventional electric boiler. Derived from the energy cost saving over other conventional type of water heating equipment, the simple pay-back period can be about 2 years and the lowest internal rate of return can be 39%.

0141887711	Energy analysis of commercial buildings in subtropical climates	The overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) concept has been extended to correlate the OTTV of building envelope designs with other key building design parameters through DOE-2 computer simulations. A survey of 146 commercial buildings completed between 1975 and 1995 provides the information on the prevailing architectural designs and construction practices in Hong Kong. This information forms a basis for the development of a generic office building used in the computer analysis. Four major design aspects have been considered, namely the building envelope, indoor design conditions, internal loads and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC). Implications for energy efficiency in the commercial sector energy use are discussed.

0142043478	Long term ambient temperature analysis and energy use implications in Hong Kong	Climate change issues and building energy use implications in subtropical Hong Kong were examined. A total of 40 years (1961-2000) of measured hourly temperature data were gathered and analysed. Three different parameters were examined, namely mean temperature, cumulative frequency of occurrence and cooling degree days (CDD). It was found that there was an underlying trend of temperature rise in recent years. Such temperature increase tended to occur more frequently during the winter period and mid-season than the summer months. The slight increase in CDD during the last 20 years suggested that cooling requirements and, hence, energy use for air conditioning might be affected if the trend persisted. The frequency of occurrence analysis, however, revealed no significant changes in the outdoor design conditions, and peak building cooling loads were expected to remain unchanged. This paper presents the work and discusses the energy use implications. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0242306115	Overcast sky conditions and luminance distribution in Hong Kong	In studying solar energy and daylight availability, particularly the sky luminance distributions, the required data are always analysed under various sky types which are categorised by some climatic parameters. Overcast days are important because they are used in more general sky models and appear quite frequent in some places. This paper studies some common climatic parameters including cloud cover, sunshine hour, solar irradiance, daylight illuminance and sky luminance and their applications in the classification of sky conditions. Frequency of occurrence of each parameter under overcast skies in Hong Kong has been established. It has been found that no single parameter can effectively describe the fully overcast skies and hybrid indices should be adopted. The general luminance distribution formula for the overcast sky with various luminance distribution parameter values has been used to test the selected sky luminance databases. The analysis indicates that the CIE standard overcast sky shows a good agreement with the overcast sky luminance distributions obtained in Hong Kong. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0342861073	An analysis of daylighting energy performance using computer simulation techniques	The computer program DOE-2. 1E was used as an analysis tool for investigating the thermal and energy performance of a generic air-conditioned office building in Hong Kong. Air-conditioning and electric lighting were the two key electricity end-users. It was found that both the peak cooling load and the electricity use could be reduced if daylighting schemes were incorporated in the building design and operation strategy. For the base-case reference building, the annual electricity use and the peak cooling load could be reduced by 12.8 and 11%, respectively. Parametric analysis was also conducted to correlate the peak electricity demand (PED) and the incremental electricity use (ΔEU) with two fenestration variables, namely the solar aperture and the day lighting aperture. It was found that PED and ΔEU could be correlated linearly with the solar aperture, and exponentially with the daylighting aperture.

0342979827	A study of Weibull parameters using long-term wind observations	The two parameters of a Weibull density distribution function were calculated for three different locations; a city area, an extremely exposed area in a city centre and an open sea area in Hong Kong. A long-term data source, consisting of thirty years (1968-1997) of hourly mean wind data, was adopted and analyzed. Based on these data, it was found that the numerical values of the shape and scale parameters for these weather stations varied over a wide range. The shape parameter varied from 1.63 to 2.03 and the scale parameter ranged from 2.76 to 8.92. The yearly Weibull probability density function distribution for the city area indicated that the wind data could be grouped into two distinct periods, 1968-1981 and 1982-1997. Seasonal Weibull distribution for the three locations were compared and wider distributions were observed in the more open areas.

0343395855	Development of solar heat gain factors database using meteorological data	In tropical and subtropical regions, solar heat gain via fenestration, particularly on vertical surfaces, plays an important role in determining the thermal performance of a building. For sizing air-conditioning equipment, maximum solar heat gain factors (SHGFs) are used for estimating the design peak load. Recently, the SHGF data representing the prevailing weather conditions have become essential and more practical for part load performance designs and daylighting schemes evaluation. In the absence of measured solar radiation data for the determination of SHGFs, meteorological radiation models may be used. This paper presents the validation of SHGFs prediction models based on sunshine hours and horizontal solar data. Statistical assessments for the models have shown that using sunshine hours to predict the hourly SHGFs may not be appropriate for dynamic building simulation studies. For the average SHGFs computation, all models present acceptable results. In determining the SHGFs for horizontal and vertical surfaces at the peak and other significant levels, all prediction models perform better than the ASHRAE clear sky approach, particularly at high significant levels. This finding also provides information for the estimation of total air-conditioning plant capacity at both the peak load operation and the multiple equipment sizing under part load condition. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

84896096829	A comparison of global bioclimates in the 20th and 21st centuries and building energy consumption implications	Summer and winter thermal discomforts in the major climate zones and sub-zones of the Köppen-Geiger world climate classifications during the 21st century were investigated and compared with those in the 20th century. Compared with the 20th century, frequency of distribution of the comfort index for the 21st century shows a distinct decrease in winter thermal discomfort and increase in summer thermal discomfort under the low and medium forcing emissions scenarios. Based on zone-average analysis, decreasing trends of cumulative cold stress and increasing trends of cumulative heat stress have been observed in all the major climate zones and sub-zones. There is an overall increase in energy use for space conditioning for all the sub-zones in equatorial climates, and an overall reduction in all the snow and polar climates sub-zones. In arid and warm temperate climates, the hot sub-zones have an increase in the overall energy requirements whereas the cold/warm sub-zones have a reduction. Locations within the hot summer sub-zones in warm temperate climates will become much more cooling-dominated, and there are significant increases in cumulative heat and proportional stresses in the hot summer sub-zones in snow climates. Implications for energy use and carbon emissions are discussed and mitigation/adaptation measures suggested. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84907222215	An analysis of potential applications of wide-scale solar energy in Hong Kong	Renewable energy plays a crucial role in replacing major part of fossil fuels to generate sustainable, inexhaustible, clean, and safe energy. In Hong Kong, solar energy has been identified suitable for wide-scale applications. Photovoltaic (PV) and solar water heating (SWH) facilities are the two promising solar-based conversion technologies. Electricity and hot water generations via solar energy means fossil fuel saved together with the likely pollutants and greenhouse gases reductions. However, there are a number of barriers including high initial cost and large installation space required. This paper studies the cost, energy, and environmental issues when PV and SWH systems are widely used in Hong Kong. The energy expenditures in the forms of electricity, gas, and hot water, and the global solar radiation in Hong Kong were analyzed. The total required land areas, the financial implications, and the environmental benefits for such solar energy applications were estimated and reported.Practical application: Solar energy plays an important role in replacing fossil fuels to generate electricity without emitting pollutants and requiring no fuel. This paper analyzes the energy, financial, and environmental aspects for solar thermal and solar electric installations. The findings in this study provide the information when active solar energy systems are widely applied in Hong Kong.

0442280802	Lighting and energy performance of solar film coating in air-conditioned cellular offices	In subtropical Hong Kong, the principal objectives of fenestration design include eliminating direct sunlight and decreasing cooling loads. To avoid the problems of glare, excessive brightness and thermal discomfort, occupants may block the windows with internal shading devices, resulting in poor daylighting performance and very small amount of electric lighting energy savings. Recently, the advances in thin film coatings for window glass products provide a means of substantially reducing heat gain without proportionally reducing daylight transmittance. It has been suggested that film coatings together with photoelectric lighting control systems could minimise the electric lighting and cooling requirements without causing undue visual and thermal discomfort to the occupants. This paper presents field measurements on solar control film coatings in fully air-conditioned offices in Hong Kong. Solar heat gains, indoor illuminance levels and the electricity consumption by the fluorescent luminaires were systematically recorded and analysed. Measurements were made for two cellular offices, one with solar control film coating on the window glass and the other without. The findings showed that the solar film coating could cut down energy expenditures for air-conditioned buildings, especially for spaces with large glazing areas subject to substantial amount of direct sunlight. Results are presented and the design implications discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10844246299	Analysis of the operational performance and efficiency characteristic for photovoltaic system in Hong Kong	The applications of photovoltaic (PV) systems have become more widespread in both developed and developing countries. The most critical exercise in designing a PV system is the determination of the optimum size of the solar panel and the battery capacity to meet the load demand with acceptable reliability. The amount of power generated by a PV system strongly depends on the availability of solar insolation at the required location. Also, the efficiency of a PV system is influenced considerably by a number of climatic variables, such as solar irradiance availability and ambient temperature. The technical information is provided for standard test conditions that may never occur in practice. Reliable knowledge of the performance of PV systems under actual operating conditions is essential for correct product selection and accurate performance prediction. This paper investigates the operational performance and efficiency characteristic of a small PV system installed at the City University of Hong Kong. The solar data and the power generated by the PV system are systematically recorded and analysed. The findings provide technical data in different months for designers and engineers to assess and size PV systems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

12444309295	Daylighting and its effects on peak load determination	Daylighting is an important issue in modern architecture that has been characterized by the use of curtain walls in commercial buildings. In Hong Kong, the overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) calculations are mandatory requirements in the submission of building plans to control the building energy use, but daylighting credits are not included in calculating the OTTV of building envelope designs. Natural daylight helps reduce the electricity use and the associated sensible cooling load due to artificial lighting. Hence, proper daylighting designs can contribute to smaller air-conditioning system and lower the peak power demand of buildings. We use the computer simulation tool, DOE-2, to demonstrate the energy performance of a generic commercial building with different OTTV designs in terms of peak cooling plant requirement and peak building power demand due to various daylighting systems. The peak loads are determined from the simulation results, Regression techniques are conducted to correlate the incremental peak electricity use and incremental peak cooling capacity with OTTV and daylighting aperture (DA) (window-to-wall ratio (WWR) times light transmittance (LT)). Contours of equal incremental peak electricity use and incremental peak cooling plant demand for different building envelope parameters are developed. Important features for daylighting schemes are highlighted and implications for OTTV designs discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

12344249703	Standard skies classification using common climatic parameters	A good understanding of the sky luminance distribution is essential for efficient daylighting designs and developments. Sky luminance patterns are always modeled under various sky conditions using climatic parameters as weighting factors to indicate the degree of sky clearness. This paper presents the work on the identification of sky luminance patterns using three common climatic elements, namely cloud cover (CLD), sunshine hour (SH) and clearness index (Kt). Three sky types representing overcast, partly cloudy and clear were selected from the Kittler et al. 15 standard skies. It has been shown that sky conditions classified by individual sky indicators produced acceptable agreements with the measured data. In general, CLD shows the best results, followed by Kt then SH. Better results in terms of the frequency of occurrence and root mean square errors can be found when CLD and SH are jointly utilised to describe the sky conditions.
