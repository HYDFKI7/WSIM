21044432585	Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci from forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii)	This study reported the isolation and characterization of eight polymorphic microsatellite loci in endangered forest musk deer Moschus berezovskii. An improved enrichment protocol was used to isolate microsatellites, and polymorphism was explored with samples from wild musk deer population collected in Miyalo of Sichuan Province in China. Approximately 70% of clones from the genomic library constructed in current study contained dinucleotide (AC) repeats. Eight microsatellite loci amplified were highly polymorphic within forest musk deer population. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 14, and the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.41-1.0 and from 0.8-0.9, respectively. The average polymorphic information content (PIC) value for these markers was 0.82. This demonstrated that the eight microsatellite loci developed here are highly polymorphic, and can be used as genetic markers for further investigation of musk deer. Also, the results showed that the musk deer distributed in Miyalo had a relatively higher level of genetic variation. © 2005 Zoological Society of Japan.

0030484837	Development, survivorship, and reproduction of Amblyseius largoensis (Acari: Phytoseiidae) on selected plant pollens and temperatures	Effects of temperature and 4 plant pollens on the development, survivorship, and reproduction of Amblyseius largoensis (Muma) were evaluated. The average egg incubation period at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35°C was 6.02, 3.26, 2.01, 1.45, and 1.95 d, respectively. The combined larval and nymphal developmental time (mean ± SD) decreased from 11.18 ± 0.55 to 3.21 ± 0.41 d and adult longevity from 39.45 ± 6.24 to 11.91 ± 5.33 d as temperature was increased from 15 to 35°C, respectively. No significant difference in adult longevity was observed when pollens from live oak, Quercus virginiana Miller, castor bean, Ricinus communis L., cattail, Typha domingensis Persoon, and pygmy date palm, Phoenix roebelenii O'Brien, were provided as food at 25°C. Survivorship was >90% when this predator was reared at 5 constant temperatures on 4 plant pollens as food, with the exception of egg hatch at 35°C. The highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m) = 0.265) and net reproductive rate (R(o) = 19.27) were obtained at 25°C compared with life table parameters derived from the other 4 constant temperatures. When pollens of live oak, castor bean, cattail, and pygmy data palm were provided as single food sources at 25°C, life table parameters indicated that live oak pollen is the most suitable food source, followed by castor bean and cattail pollens.

33745616791	Otolith microstructure of larval Gymnocypris potanini Herzenstein from the Minjiang River in China	Otolith microstructure of about 120 Gymnocypris potanini larvae from the Minjiang River in China was examined and analyzed. Larvae had multiple primordia in most lapilli and sagittae, while had only one primordium in a few specimens. There had only one nucleus in otoliths of the larvae, except for some few specimens with 2 nuclei. The transparence of many otoliths differed from center to edge, and part of them could be divided into inner low optically dense zone (LODZ) and outer optically dense zone (ODZ). Based on increment clarity, otoliths of this species could be classified into three types, which were otolith with subtile increments, otolith with almost identified increments, and otolith with fairly clear increments characterized by high contrast. The last two types of otolith accounted for 87.07% in lapilli and 94.46% in sagittae, respectively. Increment clarity of sagitta was higher than that of lapillus. Natural checks were identified in 32.50% lapilli and 48.33% sagittae. These checks primarily located in the first to sixth increment. According to the number of increments in otoliths, the age of this batch larvae was 14 - 22 days, birth date was on June 17 - 25, and average growth rate of body length was 0.8936 ± 0.08769 mm/d. © Springer 2006.

33747102124	Assessing genetic diversity of wild populations of Prenant's schizothoracin, Schizothorax prenanti, using AFLP markers	Prenant's schizothoracin, Schizothorax prenanti, an endemic fish to China, has undergone a dramatic decline in numbers due to human impacts. We studied its genetic diversity in three tributaries of the Yangtze River: the Qingyi River, which has many hydropower dams, and the Dadu River and Muli River where many hydropower dams are being proposed. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), 621 loci were amplified with seven AFLP primer combinations in 45 individuals. The loci were highly polymorphic and heterozygous (87% polymorphism, 30% heterozygosity). The genetic distances within populations were large. The analysis of molecular variance demonstrated that most variation occurred within populations. The estimated fixation index (Φ

33750317899	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of interferon-gamma and interleukin-6 from Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana)	The cloning and sequence analysis of Tibetan macaque IFN-(gamma) and the IL-6 cDNAs are described. The Tibetan macaque IFN-γ and IL-6 cDNAs were found to be 498 and 639 bp in length, with open reading frames encoding 165 and 212 amino acids, respectively. Homology analyses indicated that the identity levels of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of IFN-γ among primates ranged from 93.4 to 99.2%, and 87.3 to 99.4%, respectively, and that of IL-6 ranged from 92.6 to 99.8%, and 85.4 to 99.5%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences showed that the Tibetan macaque is most closely related to Old World monkeys, as compared to Hominoidea and New World monkeys. These findings provide insights into the evolution of primate IFN-γ and IL-6 and additional valuable information regarding amino acid residues essential for their biological activity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33750503201	Highly conserved D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequences (Numts) in tiger (Panthera tigris)	Using oligonucleotide primers designed to match hypervariable segments I (HVS-1) of Panthera tigris mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we amplified two different PCR products (500 bp and 287 bp) in the tiger (Panthera tigris), but got only one PCR product (287 bp) in the leopard (Panthera pardus). Sequence analyses indicated that the sequence of 287 bp was a D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequence (Numts), indicating a nuclear transfer that occurred approximately 4.8-17 million years ago in the tiger and 4.6-16 million years ago in the leopard. Although the mtDNA D-loop sequence has a rapid rate of evolution, the 287-bp Numts are highly conserved; they are nearly identical in tiger subspecies and only 1.742% different between tiger and leopard. Thus, such sequences represent molecular 'fossils' that can shed light on evolution of the mitochondrial genome and may be the most appropriate outgroup for phylogenetic analysis. This is also proved by comparing the phylogenetic trees reconstructed using the D-loop sequence of snow leopard and the 287-bp Numts as outgroup. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

34250835861	The complete mitochondrial genome and phylogenetic analysis of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, was determined by the long and accurate polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR) with conserved primers and primer walking sequence methods. The complete mitochondrial DNA is 16,805 nucleotides in length and contains two ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and one control region. The total length of the 13 protein-coding genes is longer than the American black bear, brown bear and polar bear by 3 amino acids at the end of ND5 gene. The codon usage also followed the typical vertebrate pattern except for an unusual ATT start codon, which initiates the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene. The molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed on the sequences of 12 concatenated heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes, and suggested that the giant panda is most closely related to bears. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

34547293309	A rapid sex-identification test for the forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) based on the ZFX/ZFY gene	We describe a rapid sex-identification method for the forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) using PCR based on zinc-finger protein-encoding genes (ZFX/ZFY) located on the X and Y chromosomes. Fragments of the ZFX and ZFY genes were amplified and sequenced. The ZFX and ZFY fragments were identical in length and 94% similar in nucleotide sequence. Specific primers for forest musk deer sex identification were designed on the basis of sequence differences between ZFX and ZFY. All the primers were multiplexed in single-tube PCR. Both male and female forest musk deer showed amplification bands of 447 bp and 212 bp separated in agarose gels. A sex-specific 278-bp band was amplified only from males. These results show that testing by PCR for the presence of the 278-bp sequence is a rapid and reliable method for sex identification. © 2007 Zoological Society of Japan.

Among these microsatellite loci, one locus was monomorphic; among the remaining 10 loci, the number of observed alleles for each locus in 57 individual tigers ranged from four to nine, the expected and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.366 to 0.805 and 0.400 to 0.837, respectively, and the mean polymorphic information content (PIC) was 0.609. Moreover, two loci (F41 and FCA391) were compared between the domestic cat and the south China tiger and differences in their flanking regions were found (5.9% for F41 and 4.8% for FCA391). These 10 polymorphic tri- and tetra-nucleotide microsatellite markers would be very useful in the evaluation of tiger population structure and the genetic relationships among the individual tigers. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

34547670466	Taxonomic implications from phylogenetic relationships of subspecies of Schizopygopsis malacanthus (Pisces: Cyprinidae) based on sequence analysis of cytochrome b and mitochondrial DNA control region	Phylogenetic relationships of three subspecies of Schizopygopsis malacanthus, S. m. malacanthus, S. m. chengi, and S. m. baoxingensis, were investigated based on the mitochondrial DNA control region and the cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three subspecies did not cluster as one monophyletic group; S. m. malacanthus clustered into one clade, while S. m. chengi and S. m. baoxingensis clustered into another. Genetic distances between S. m. malacanthus and the other two subspecies were either very close to or larger than those between S. m. malacanthus and some other species of Schizopygopsis. There was very small genetic distance between S. m. chengi and S. m. baoxingensis. The results suggested S. m. chengi should be split from S. malacanthus into a separate species, Schizopygopsis chengi (Fang); S. m. baoxingensis should be regarded as a subspecies, S. c. baoxingensis (Fu, Ding et Ye), of Schizopygopsis chengi. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

Although numbers of alate L. erysimi on different varieties varied generally, more alate adults and nymphs were observed on green than on red varieties on day 3; whereas, these differences were not so significant on day 15. There were no significant differences in alate adults on all six varieties on day 15. Numbers of nymphs and apterous adults of L. erysimi varied among the varieties. When mean numbers of those aphids on green varieties were compared with those on red varieties, the green varieties had more nymphs and apterous adults than those on the red varieties. Developmental durations of L. erysimi nymphs also varied among all varieties, and the nymphs fed on green varieties developed longer than those fed on red varieties. Adult longevities on these cabbage varieties were not significantly different; whereas, the adult fecundities were. Survival rates of L. erysimi varied greatly among all varieties, but there are no significant differences between the green and red varieties. Factors that might affect aphid host selection, growth, longevity, fecundity, and survivorship were discussed. © 2000 Entomological Society of America.

38349071843	A novel method for sex determination of giant panda	A fast, inexpensive, and reliable method for sex determination of giant panda was developed using amplification of giant panda zinc finger alleles (ZFX/ZFY). Two sets of primers targeted a conserved region in the exon of the ZFX/ZFY genes worked in a single PCR process, and provided positive results for both males and females. Sexes of individuals were revealed by sex-specific banding patterns (females: 447 bp, 146 bp; males: 447 bp, 350 bp, 146 bp). This method was successfully tested on blood sample from pandas of known sex. Non-invasive tests revealed that this method can also be applied to non-invasive samples such as hair or feces. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2007.

Genetic variation and population structure were examined based on analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Nucleotide sequence analysis defined 30 haplotypes in 41 individuals. The nucleotide and haplotype diversities were very high, and genetic distances between the Dadu and Qingyi populations were much smaller than between either of them and the Muli population. The analysis of molecular variance demonstrated that most variation occurred within samples, and the differentiation between Muli and Dadu or Qingyi was significant. Estimates of gene flow indicated reproductive isolation between Muli and the other populations, and this divergence might be related to geographical location. The results are mostly consistent with the findings from AFLP analysis and also suggested considerable genetic diversity of the populations in the Muli, Dadu, and Qingyi rivers. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

A second series of tests was conducted on hard winter wheat using S. oryzae (L.), the rice weevil, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), the lesser grain borer, and T. castaneum. Mortality of all species on both commodities generally increased with insecticide concentration, exposure interval, and temperature, and data were described by linear and non-linear regressions with concentration as the independent variable. Mortality of S. zeamais ranged from 58% to 90% on maize treated with 0.5ppm thiamethoxam, and approached 95-100% as concentration increased to 4ppm. Oryzaephilus surinamensis appeared to be slightly less susceptible than S. zeamais; mortality ranged from about 18% to 80% at 5ppm and there was a more gradual increase in mortality as concentration increased. Mortality of T. castaneum generally did not exceed 40% at any concentration unless the beetles were exposed for 6d. Mortality of R. dominica and S. oryzae was less than 60% when exposed on treated wheat for 1 and 2d, but increased to nearly 100% when exposed for 6d at 27°C and 32°C. Mortality of T. castaneum did not exceed 20% at the 1- and 2-d exposures, and approached 100% only when beetles were exposed for 6d at 32°C. Few F

58249088340	The effect of temperature and other factors on roosting times of Szechenyi Monal Partidges Tetraophasis szechenyii during the breeding season	In response to low temperatues, birds can choose between reducing their activity to minimize heat loss and increasing it in the hope of higher heat production. In this study, these aspects were evaluated in the rare Szechenyi Monal Partridges Tetraophasis szechenyii by examining the timing of breeding-season roosting. The partridges arrived at roost sites 54.7 3.0 min before sunset (n = 78), perched on branches 22.9 1.8 min before sunset (n = 78), and departed 7.3 0.1 min after sunrise (n = 91). Generalized linear mixed modelling with temperature and several other environmental variables (e.g. day length, cloud cover and precipitation) included as factors, showed that - all other things being equal - the partridges perched earlier and departed later on cold days. This result suggests that Szechenyi Monal Partridges reduce their activity to minimize heat loss in low temperatures. However, the partridges did not arrive early at roost sites on cold days, and the effects of low temperature on departure times were less than those on perching times: temperature had a partial coefficient of -0.89 for departure times versus -1.29 for perching times. Thus, we argue that the amplitude of these temperature effects may depend on food availability, or the birds level of hunger.

59449110921	Effects of temperature, starvation and photoperiod on otolith increments in larval Chinese sucker, Myxocyprinus asiaticus	Effects of water temperature, starvation and photoperiod on otolith increment formation in larval Chinese sucker, Myxocyprinus asiaticus, were examined in this study. The results demonstrated that otolith increments of larvae reared under diel temperature fluctuations were very clear and appeared with a high contrast, while those of larvae raised under constant water temperatures were vague or hard to identify. The increment deposition rates were less than 1.0/day in later stage of starvation period. Also, increment deposition was affected by cyclic regimes of water temperature fluctuations, the number of increments corresponded to the cycle times rather than the exact days larvae experienced. However, varying of feeding frequency and photoperiod did not result in any alterations of daily increment formation. Increment width increased obviously with higher rearing temperatures till several days after yolk absorption. However, the width presented an ontogenetic decline during period of endogenous nutrition and the first several days of exogenous nutrition stage. Starvation decoupled the relationship between somatic growth and otolith growth; otolith kept growing, and increment width of starved larvae was similar to those in fed individuals before 9-20 days old; the divergence of increment width from the fed larvae occurred in later stage of starvation period. It can be concluded that temperature regimes and food levels are the major factors affecting increment formation in terms of clarity, deposition rate and width, while photoperiod and feeding frequency have less influence on it. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77954482406	Phylogeography of the large white-bellied rat niviventer excelsior suggests the influence of pleistocene glaciations in the hengduan mountains	The Hengduan Mountains, situated in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, have undergone dramatic geological and climatic changes over the Pleistocene epoch. Several studies have revealed that the mountains served as a refugium during the ice age. The large white-bellied rat Niviventer excelsior is a rodent endemic to the Hengduan Mountains, which makes it an appropriate species for investigating the influence of glacial movements on the genetic structure of mammals. In this study, we sequenced the partial mitochondrial DNA control region from 72 N. excelsior specimens collected from 20 localities. The results revealed very high levels of haplotype diversity (h = 0.947) and nucleotide diversity ( = 0.101) in this species. No common haplotype was found to be shared in samples from all geographic regions. Demographic analyses suggested that N. excelsior populations had not been subject to either expansion or bottleneck. The phylogenetic relationships among the haplotypes have no correlation with their geographical origins, while topology revealed two major clades. We speculate that the populations of N. excelsior may have been restricted to two separate refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (0.600.17 Mya), with one west and one east of the Shaluli Mountains. Between the two major refugia, there existed a more widely distributed network subrefugia, which conserved genetic variations in N. excelsior. These results indicated that complex topographic configuration in the Hengduan Mountains provided a network of refugia to maintain the high level of genetic diversity in Pleistocene glaciations. © 2010 Zoological Society of Japan.

Szechenyi's Monal-Partridge used both ground and tree nests. Ground nests were scrapes in the soil, positioned at the base of a tree or scrub, and occurred in all habitats except Sichuan kobresia (Kobresia setchwanensis) meadow. Tree nests were cup shaped and placed 1.9-12.0 m above ground level, distributed proportionally in all habitats except scrub hollyleaf-like oak (Quercus aquifolioides) and Sichuan kobresia meadow habitats. The proportion of nest types between first and re-nesting attempts did not vary significantly. Only 54% of ground nests and 33% of tree nests survived until hatching with predation being the principal cause of ground nest failure. Hatching success was 97%. We recorded six re-nesting attempts, four of which were tree nests, but all were unsuccessful. Preserving a mosaic of treeline habitats that include ground vegetation, and fir/oak woodland habitat will be essential for maintaining suitable nesting habitats for Szechenyi's Monal-Partridge in the Pamuling Mountains. © 2011 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

The entire mtDNA sequence was found to be 16,957 bp and 17,001 bp long for P25 and P27 respectively, and this difference in length between P25 and P27 occurred in the number of tandem repeats in the RS-3 segment of the control region. The structural characteristics of complete P. t. amoyensis mitochondrial genomes were also highly similar to those of P. uncia. Additionally, the rate of point mutation was only 0.3% and a total of 59 variable sites between P25 and P27 were found. Out of the 59 variable sites, 6 were located in 6 different tRNA genes, 6 in the 2 rRNA genes, 7 in non-coding regions (one located between tRNA-Asn and tRNA-Tyr and six in the D-loop), and 40 in 10 protein-coding genes. COI held the largest amount of variable sites (9 sites) and Cytb contained the highest variable rate (0.7%) in the complete sequences. Moreover, out of the 40 variable sites located in 10 protein-coding genes, 12 sites were nonsynonymous. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84861626951	Phylogeography of the South China field mouse (Apodemus draco) on the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau reveals high genetic diversity and Glacial Refugia	The southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (SEMTP) is a particularly interesting region due to its topographic complexity and unique geologic history, but phylogeographic studies that focus on this region are rare. In this study, we investigated the phylogeography of the South China field mouse, Apodemus draco, in order to assess the role of geologic and climatic events on the Tibetan Plateau in shaping its genetic structure. We sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) sequences in 103 individuals from 47 sampling sites. In addition, 23 cyt b sequences were collected from GenBank for analyses. Phylogenetic, demographic and landscape genetic methods were conducted. Seventy-six cyt b haplotypes were found and the genetic diversity was extremely high (π = 0.0368; h = 0.989). Five major evolutionary clades, based on geographic locations, were identified. Demographic analyses implied subclade 1A and subclade 1B experienced population expansions at about 0.052-0.013 Mya and 0.014-0.004 Mya, respectively. The divergence time analysis showed that the split between clade 1 and clade 2 occurred 0.26 Mya, which fell into the extensive glacial period (EGP, 0.5-0.17 Mya). The divergence times of other main clades (2.20-0.55 Mya) were congruent with the periods of the Qingzang Movement (3.6-1.7 Mya) and the Kun-Huang Movement (1.2-0.6 Mya), which were known as the most intense uplift events in the Tibetan Plateau. Our study supported the hypothesis that the SEMTP was a large late Pleistocene refugium, and further inferred that the Gongga Mountain Region and Hongya County were glacial refugia for A. draco in clade 1. We hypothesize that the evolutionary history of A. draco in the SEMTP primarily occurred in two stages. First, an initial divergence would have been shaped by uplift events of the Tibetan Plateau. Then, major glaciations in the Pleistocene added complexity to its demographic history and genetic structure. © 2012 Fan et al.

The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.170 to 0.800 and from 0.217 to 0.898, with an average of 0.583 and 0.675, respectively. 5 loci significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found between 9 pairs of loci. The newly identified polymorphic markers would facilitate the study of M. thibetana on the population structure and genetic diversity.

42549089676	Validation of daily otolith increments in larval and juvenile Chinese sucker, Myxocyprinus asiaticus	Otolith development was observed and the formation of daily growth increments in otoliths of Chinese sucker, Myxocyprinus asiaticus, was validated by monitoring known-age larvae and juveniles in the laboratory from 2003 to 2005. Otolith shape changed with larval and juvenile development, and there was an exponential relationship until a body length of 16 mm or so, and a linear relationship after a body length of 16 mm between otolith size and fish size. The first increment was identified in larvae 1 day after hatching. The regressed equations between daily age (D) and increment number in otoliths (N) were N = -0.64 + 0.96D in lapillus, and N = -0.31 + 0.98D in sagitta. The slopes were not significantly different than 1.0. This demonstrated that otolith increments in this species were formed daily and can be used for daily age determination. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

42549116631	A reliable, non-invasive PCR method for giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) sex identification	We developed an inexpensive, fast and reliable PCR method for sex identification of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) by using one pair of primers to co-amplify homologous fragments with size polymorphism that located at amelogenin (AMEL) exon 5. In giant panda, a 63 bp deletion in exon 5 of Y-linked allele provides a significant discrimination between AMELX and AMELY, thus the amplification products can be distinguished simply by agarose gel electrophoresis, exhibiting sex-specific banding patterns (male: 237 bp, 174 bp; female: 237 bp). Both blood and feces samples from known-sex giant pandas were successfully amplified. Cross species test also revealed that this method could be applied to other Ursidae species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

42549146992	Identification and characterization of ten polymorphic microsatellite loci in the red panda Ailurus fulgens	Ten polymorphic microsatellite loci were characterized from two genomic DNA-enriched libraries of the red panda (Ailurus fulgens). The number of observed alleles among 35 samples of red pandas ranged from five to 12. Observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.286-0.971 and 0.443-0.894, and the mean polymorphic information content was 0.712. All loci followed Hardy-Weinberg expectations except Aifu-14 and Aifu-16, which may due to the presence of inbreeding or null alleles. Three pairs of loci exhibited significant linkage disequilibrium after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. These microsatellites would be useful to strengthen population management, genetic diversity exploration, and demographic history speculation of this species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

47249104707	Phylogenetic position of the genus Tetraophasis (Aves, Galliformes, Phasianidae) as inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear sequences	The genus Tetraophasis is endemic to China and the systematic relationships of the genus in Phasianidae based solely on their morphology are not clear. The phylogenetic position of this genus and other genera in Phasianidae was investigated in this study using the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (CYT B), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) and nuclear ovomucoid intron G (OVO-G). Maximum parsimony, Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses were employed. Comparison between the mitochondrial and nuclear findings suggested that our final combined data had higher resolving power than the separate data. Both separate data and combined data yielded a sister relationship between Tetraophasis and Lophophorus with strong support, which provided new evidence that pheasants and partridges were not monophyletic. In addition, our results indicated a basal position of Ithaginis, but the position of Perdix and Pucrasia were still unresolved. The result of this study provided a phylogenetic background for a revised classification of Galliformes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

47749086226	Molecular phylogeography and genetic differentiation of blue sheep Pseudois nayaur szechuanensis and Pseudois schaeferi in China	Within the genus Pseudois (Bovidae, Artiodactyla), two challenges are faced by taxonomists. First, the designation of the two subspecies of blue sheep, Pseudois nayaur nayaur and Pseudois nayaur szechuanensis, tends to be questionable with the accumulation of morphological and molecular data. Second, the taxonomic status of the dwarf blue sheep (Pseudois schaeferi) has been controversial since its discovery, and molecular analyses with relatively small sample sizes have not painted a clear picture. We collected samples and DNA sequence data from a broad geographic range in China to investigate the population structure of Pseudois nayaur szechuanensis and its phylogenetic relationship with Pseudois schaeferi. Employing mitochondrial cytochrome b and control region sequences, as well as the nuclear gene zona pellucida glycoprotein 3, further investigation was performed to extend upon previous studies. We found that the population of Helan Mountain of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has significantly differentiated from the populations in Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan provinces, and may be classified as a new subspecies according to the 75% rule. The dwarf blue sheep was found to be some individuals of Pseudois nayaur szechuanensis with morphological variations and is not a species or subspecies, since they did not fall into a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic analyses with blue sheep. Gene flow between dwarf blue sheep and common blue sheep might have occurred in different areas of western Sichuan, which would result in the paraphyly of dwarf blue sheep. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

52949121719	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding interleukin-6 of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	In the present study, the cloning and sequence analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) were described. Sequencing revealed that IL-6 complementary DNA contains a 636 base-pair open reading frame encoding 211 amino acids. Homology analyses indicated that the identity levels of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of IL-6 between the giant panda and other species in Carnivora ranged from 90.5% to 85.6% and from 82.9% to 76.5%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed that the harbour seal shared a closer relationship with the giant panda than other carnivores (ursids not included). The functionally important domains and sites that have previously been recognized in other carnivores were all observed in the IL-6 sequence of the giant panda. These findings suggest that the complementary DNA fragment cloned is indeed the IL-6 molecule with biological activity and can be used in immunological studies of the giant panda. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

Genetic diversities based on a 476-bp fragment at the 5'-end of the mitochondrial DNA control region HVSI were assessed. Haplotype diversity is high (0.8521), but nucleotide diversity among all haplotypes is only 0.0574. No haplotype was shared between Sichuan (SC) and Huangshan Mountain (HS) populations. Phylogenetic trees, analysis of molecular variance and network analysis consistently indicated that the SC and HS populations are significantly different. They should therefore be conserved as different units, with priority and more attention given to the HS populations. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

58549084201	Genetic diversity of captive forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) inferred from the mitochondrial DNA control region	Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) were once distributed widely in China. However, wild populations have declined dramatically because of poaching and habitat loss. Captive breeding populations have been established for several decades, but the genetic backgrounds of most captive populations were unclear and the population sizes increased very slowly. To provide useful information for conservation and management of this species, we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of forest musk deer by analysing a 582-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) in three captive breeding populations in Sichuan Province, China. Ninety-four variable sites and 27 haplotypes were observed in 109 individuals, and the nucleotide and haplotype diversities were relatively high compared with those of other endangered mammals. Of the three investigated populations, the Maerkang population had the highest nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0568), haplotype diversity (h = 0.836) and average intra-population genetic distance (0.062). The analysis of molecular variance demonstrated that most variation occurred within samples and that there was significant differentiation of the three populations. Estimates of gene flow indicated that there were few genetic exchanges among the three populations. Building pedigree records and increasing gene flow between populations will be helpful for conserving these populations and this species. © 2008 The Authors.

Twenty-five microsatellite markers from chicken and Japanese quail were tested on buff-throated partridge DNA by means of cross-amplification. Twenty (80%) primers yielded specific products and polymorphisms were tested in a wild population of buff-throated partridge. Twelve (48%) proved to be polymorphic with an average of two alleles per locus. Current results of buff-throated partridge microsatellites loci could be employed in population genetic studies and on other endangered pheasant species. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

60249085156	A new method for DNA extraction from feces and hair shafts of the South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis)	It is commonly known that tigers (Panthera tigris) groom themselves by licking their coats, which leads to an abundance of hairs in their feces. These hairs are designated specially as "fecal hairs". In our study, in order to explore fecal hairs potential as a DNA source for genetic analysis, 55 fecal hair samples were collected from 23 captive South China tigers (P. t. amoyensis). According to the amplification of mitochondrial primers loop F and loop R, DNA quality of noninvasive samples were grouped into three grades: grade I - the highest-quality DNA, grade II - high-quality DNA, and grade III - poor-quality DNA. No failed amplifications on microsatellite primers and only 0.27% genotyping errors occurred with grade I fecal hair DNA, as compared with 9.4% failed amplifications on microsatellite primers and 9.5% genotyping errors with grade II fecal hair DNA. It was found that 25.45% of fecal hair DNA was grade I and 65.45 and 10.00% of fecal hair DNA were grades II and III, respectively, as compared with 4.35% grade I fecal DNA and 34.78 and 60.87% grades II and III fecal DNA, respectively. Thus, higher-quality DNA can be extracted from fecal hairs than feces. In addition, DNA could be extracted from hair shafts of tigers and a minimum of 2000 hair shafts were required for visible DNA bands on a 1% agarose gel. These findings demonstrate that fecal hairs may serve as a convenient and reliable genomic DNA source for genotype analysis. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

61649098005	Microsatellite variability reveals the necessity for genetic input from wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) into the captive population	Recent success in breeding giant pandas in captivity has encouraged panda conservationists to believe that the ex situ population is ready to serve as a source for supporting the wild population. In this study, we used 11 microsatellite DNA markers to assess the amount and distribution of genetic variability present in the two largest captive populations (Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, Sichuan Province and the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda at Wolong, Sichuan Province). The data were compared with those samples from wild pandas living in two key giant panda nature reserves (Baoxing Nature Reserve and Wanglang Nature Reserve). The results show that the captive populations have retained lower levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity compared to isolated wild populations. However, low inbreeding coefficients indicate that captive populations are under careful genetic management. Excessive heterozygosity suggests that the two captive populations have experienced a genetic bottleneck, presumably caused by founder effects. Moreover, evidence of increased genetic divergence demonstrates restricted breeding options within facilities. Based on these results, we conclude that the genetic diversity in the captive populations is not optimal. Introduction of genetic materials from wild pandas and improved exchange of genetic materials among institutions will be necessary for the captive pandas to be representative of the wild populations. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The genome is 16728 bp in size, containing 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and one control region, demonstrating a structure very similar to that of other phasianids. In order to investigate the phylogenetic position of Arborophila within Phasianidae, the sequences of 12 concatenated heavy-strand encoded protein coding genes were used for phylogenetic analysis employing a Bayesian inference method, Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses and Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis. With the exception of a few nodes, most internal branches were supported by high Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) and bootstrap probabilities (BSP). Using the 12 mitochondrial protein-coding genes sequence, we performed the likelihood tests of competing tree topologies, and also tried to estimate the divergence time within Phasianidae by the global rate minimum deformation method (GRMD), both with the previously constructed ML tree using Treefinder (Jobb, G., 2008. TREEFINDER version of February 2007. Munich(Germany).) The combined strict consensus tree demonstrated that Arborophila rufipectus possessed a basal phylogenetic position within Phasianidae. Our results also showed that the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) had a close relationship with the gallopheasant group, which may suggest that the turkey should be classified into the Phasianidae. In addition, Phasianus was found to share a closer relationship with Lophura than Syrmaticus with robust support. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study the MHC class II DRB genes were investigated in the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) by using a cloning-sequencing method. Analysis in 16 individuals from typical distribution areas in China indicated a relatively high level of allelic diversity: 13 alleles with high sequence polymorphism at 46 variable sites (19.33% of the 238 nucleotides). An overall purifying selection was detected, with one strongly positively selected site located within antigen-binding sites. The main driving force that led to this allelic diversity pattern is discussed. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

63949085036	The complete mitochondrial genome of rock carp Procypris rabaudi (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) and phylogenetic implications	Rock carp, Procypris rabaudi (Tchang), is an endemic fish species in China. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of it by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction with conserved primers and primer walking sequencing method. The complete mitochondrial genome of rock carp is 16595 bp in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and one control region, with an identical order to that of most other vertebrates. The origin of L-strand replication (OL) in rock carp mitochondrion is located in a cluster of five tRNA genes (WANCY region) with 35 nucleotides in length. The control region is located between the tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Phe genes and is 943 bp in length. Three conserved sequence blocks (CSB), an extended termination associated sequence (ETAS), an AT-repeat microsatellite sequence and a putative promoter sequence for H-strand transcription (HSP) were identified within this region. The microsatellite sequence has a very low variation, with only one repeat alteration in 50 checked individuals (from 12 to 13 repeats). The phylogenetic analysis for rock carp was performed with Bayesian and Maximum likelihood (ML) methods based on the concatenated nucleotide sequence of 12 protein-coding genes on the heavy strand. The result suggested that traditional taxonomic barbines possibly originated more early than cyprininaes; rock carp was placed at the position between barbines and cyprininaes, while has a closer relationship with cyprininaes than barbines. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

67349126884	Molecular phylogeny and taxonomic reconsideration of the subfamily Zapodinae (Rodentia: Dipodidae), with an emphasis on Chinese species	Although the subfamily Zapodinae (Rodentia, Dipodidae) contains only five species, the phylogeny and taxonomy of these species are still being disputed. First, whether Eozapus and Napaeozapus should be treated as independent genera or subgenera of Zapus has been argued for a long period. Second, the subspecific genetic differentiation of Chinese jumping mouse (Eozapus setchuanus) has not been studied in detail, neither from morphological nor molecular aspects. In this study, the phylogenetic relationship among all the five species of Zapodinae was reconstructed using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein gene. Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses were conducted. The results showed that two major clades could be recognized within Zapodinae. Eozapus setchuanus, is the species endemic to China, strongly formed a monophyletic clade. In the other clade, genus Zapus received significant support in all analyses to be the sister group of the genus Napaeozapus. By comparing genetic distances among these three genera, we conclude that both Eozapus and Napaeozapus should be considered as valid genera rather than subgenera of Zapus. Furthermore, we observed that the two subspecies of E. setchuanus did not form reciprocally monophyletic groups, thus the traditional taxonomy which divided E. setchuanus into two subspecies based on only one morphological character was questionable. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67349177482	Microsatellite analysis of the genetic structure of captive forest musk deer populations and its implication for conservation	Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) are rare as a result of poaching for musk and habitat loss. Some captive populations of forest musk deer have been established for decades in China. However, little genetic information is available for conservation management. In this paper, genetic variations, population structures, and the genetic bottleneck hypothesis were examined using 11 microsatellite loci from captive populations in Miyalo, Jinfeng and Maerkang in Sichuan Province, China. Estimates of genetic variability revealed substantial genetic variation in the three populations.

70349980262	Limited genetic diversity of an endemic subspecies Schizopygopsis chengi baoxingensis as inferred from the mitochondrial DNA control region	As a subspecies of Schizopygopsis chengi (Fang), Schizopygopsis chengi baoxingensis (Fu, Ding et Ye) occurs as a single population endemic to the Baoxing River in China. The influences from the construction of hydropower dams in its distribution area might result in its extinction in the future due to its very narrow habitat and small population size. In this study, we sequenced the mitochondrial DNA control region of 81 individuals to analyze the genetic variability of the subspecies, hoping to acquire basic genetic information. The results revealed a limited genetic diversity of the population. Total samples could only be defined as seven haplotypes based on nucleotide variations. The nucleotide diversity (0.0008), haplotype diversity (0.534), and overall mean genetic distance among individuals (0.00080 ± 0.00053) were very low. Therefore, it is very necessary and urgent to conserve the population of this subspecies, avoiding further genetic loss, or even extinction. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

70350212446	Phylogeny of the macaques (Cercopithecidae: Macaca) based on Alu elements	Genus Macaca (Cercopithecidae: Papionini) is one of the most successful primate radiations. Despite previous studies on morphology and mitochondrial DNA analysis, a number of issues regarding the details of macaque evolution remain unsolved. Alu elements are a class of non-autonomous retroposons belonging to short interspersed elements that are specific to the primate lineage. Because retroposon insertions show very little homoplasy, and because the ancestral state (absence of the SINE) is known, Alu elements are useful genetic markers and have been utilized for analyzing primate phylogenentic relationships and human population genetic relationships. Using PCR display methodology, 298 new Alu insertions have been identified from ten species of macaques. Together with 60 loci reported previously, a total of 358 loci are used to infer the phylogenetic relationships of genus Macaca. With regard to earlier unresolved issues on the macaque evolution, the topology of our tree suggests that: 1) genus Macaca contains four monophyletic species groups; 2) within the Asian macaques, the silenus group diverged first, and members of the sinica and fascicularis groups share a common ancestor; 3) Macaca arctoides are classified in the sinica group. Our results provide a robust molecular phylogeny for genus Macaca with stronger statistical support than previous studies. The present study also illustrates that SINE-based approaches are a powerful tool in primate phylogenetic studies and can be used to successfully resolve evolutionary relationships between taxa at scales from the ordinal level to closely related species within one genus. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Herein we report the cloning, expression, and sequence analysis of IFN-γ from the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The open reading frame of this gene is 501 base pair in length and encodes a polypeptide consisting of 166 amino acids. All conserved N-linked glycosylation sites and cysteine residues among carnivores were found in the predicted amino acid sequence of the giant panda. Recombinant giant panda IFN-γ with a V5 epitope and polyhistidine tag was expressed in HEK293 host cells and confirmed by Western blotting. Phylogenetic analysis of mammalian IFN-γ-coding sequences indicated that the giant panda IFN-γ was closest to that of carnivores, then to ungulates and dolphin, and shared a distant relationship with mouse and human. These results represent a first step into the study of IFN-γ in giant panda. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Here, we investigated the molecular signatures of natural selection at exon-2 of MHC class II DRB gene which includes a part of the peptide-binding region (PBR) in seven of eight putative extant Felidae lineages. The DRB alleles in felids can be mainly divided into five lineages. Signatures of trans-species polymorphism among major allelic lineages indicate that balancing selection has maintained the MHC polymorphism for a long evolutionary time. Analysis based on maximum likelihood models of codon substitution revealed overall purifying selection acting on the feline DRB. Sites that have undergone positive selection and those that are under divergent selective pressure among lineages were detected and found to fall within the putative PBR. This study increased our understanding of the nature of selective forces acting on DRB during feline radiation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77951873924	A mitogenomic perspective on the ancient, rapid radiation in the Galliformes with an emphasis on the Phasianidae	Background: The Galliformes is a well-known and widely distributed Order in Aves. The phylogenetic relationships of galliform birds, especially the turkeys, grouse, chickens, quails, and pheasants, have been studied intensively, likely because of their close association with humans. Despite extensive studies, convergent morphological evolution and rapid radiation have resulted in conflicting hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships. Many internal nodes have remained ambiguous. Results: We analyzed the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes from 34 galliform species, including 14 new mt genomes and 20 published mt genomes, and obtained a single, robust tree. Most of the internal branches were relatively short and the terminal branches long suggesting an ancient, rapid radiation. The Megapodiidae formed the sister group to all other galliforms, followed in sequence by the Cracidae, Odontophoridae and Numididae. The remaining clade included the Phasianidae, Tetraonidae and Meleagrididae. The genus Arborophila was the sister group of the remaining taxa followed by Polyplectron. This was followed by two major clades: ((((Gallus, Bambusicola) Francolinus) (Coturnix, Alectoris)) Pavo) and (((((((Chrysolophus, Phasianus) Lophura) Syrmaticus) Perdix) Pucrasia) (Meleagris, Bonasa)) ((Lophophorus, Tetraophasis) Tragopan))). Conclusions: The traditional hypothesis of monophyletic lineages of pheasants, partridges, peafowls and tragopans was not supported in this study. Mitogenomic analyses recovered robust phylogenetic relationships and suggested that the Galliformes formed a model group for the study of morphological and behavioral evolution. © 2010 Shen et al.

77953994074	Phylogenetic position of the takin (Budorcas taxicolor) and the yak (Bos grunniens) within the family Bovidae	The takin (Budorcas taxicolor) is a rare mammal endemic to the Asian Continent, with differing opinions regarding its taxonomic status. In order to clarify its evolutionary position within Bovidae, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of a takin (B.t. bedfordi) sampled from Tangjiahe Nature Reserve in Sichuan Province, China, and reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of eleven species within Bovidae based on 12 heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes. The results indicated that (a) the takin shared a close relationship with the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) and sheep (Ovis aries), and was most closely related to caprines; (b) the Bos genus did not exhibit a monophyletic structure, in which the yak (Bos grunniens) was closely linked to American bison (Bison bison). Combined with other DNA data, morphological evidence and paleontological data, we strongly support the designation of Poephagus for the yak, and yak should be nominated as Poephagus mutus or Poephagus grunniens.

77954907991	Roosting behavior and roost selection by Buff-throated partridges tetraophasis szechenyii during the breeding season	Studying roosting behavior and roost selection is very important for Galliformes conservation. The breeding season roosting behavior and roost selection by Buff-throated Partridges Tetraophasis szechenyii, a rare galliform species endemic to western China, were studied by radio tracking and direct sighting in 2006-2008. Partridges roosted in family groups, and group members almost always huddled together within roosts except in the incubation period and the 1st 2 wks after the eggs hatched, when males remained separate from females. The vegetation they selected for roosts was almost exclusively fir forests with high tree density, good canopy cover, and plenty of trees with large diameter at breast height (DBH). Trees typically used were large-DBH (27.3 ± 1.1 cm S.E., n = 58) Abies squamata or Larix potaninii situated on sites with large degree of slope, long distance to the nearest trail, and close proximity to other large-DBH trees. Branches occupied were frequently (47.2%, n = 74) easterly oriented, and 7.4 ± 0.1 m S.E. (n = 95) in height and 4.2 ± 0.1 cm S.E. (n = 95) in diameter. This suggests that the roosting behavior and patterns of roost selection by Buffthroated Partridges are principally to maximize thermoregulatory benefits and avoid predation. The relevance for management of this species is mainly discussed in terms of forestry practices and exploitation restraints.

77956072741	DNA barcoding on subsets of three families in Aves	Background and aims. Previous studies carried out with DNA barcoding, based on regional groups, have shown that a standard mitochondrial gene could be used to identify birds. In the present study, we present an additional DNA barcoding survey of birds, using taxonomic groups instead of regional groups to verify the effectiveness of DNA barcoding on distinguishing species and to test whether the intraspecific clusters of species are associated with geographical discontinuities.Materials and methods. Taxonomic groups of three avian familiesPhasianidae, Accipitridae, and Strigidaewere included in the study. The cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences of 49 individuals were determined. Together with 122 sequences from previous studies, a total of 171 sequences from 66 bird species were analyzed.Results and conclusion. Results showed that all 66 species investigated had unique COI sequences and no sequences were shared between the species. Our results were congruent with previous studies suggesting that the COI barcode permits distinguishing most of the closely related species. Furthermore, by using geographically distinct clusters, diagnostic characters, and threshold levels, deep genetic splits (>1.5%) were observed in three species, and we therefore suggest treating them as evolutionary significant units. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

77956135689	Origin, evolution and functional diversity of bHLH gene family: Insights from comparative genomics and interactomics	The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins make up of a complex multigene family of transcription factors that play the important roles in many biological processes. Although much effort has been made on their functional roles, their evolutionary origin and functional diversity remain to be clarified. In this study, we compared genomes and interactomes of bHLH gene families from model organisms such as human, fly, worm, yeast and Arabidopsis to shed light on origin, evolution and functional diversity of this gene family, inferring that bHLHs might origin in prokaryotes and undergo divergence in different linage because of distinct evolutionary force. © 2010 IEEE.

77956153451	Development of new tetranucleotide microsatellite loci and assessment of genetic variation of giant panda in two largest giant panda captive breeding populations	The giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca is a critically endangered species endemic to China. In order to carry out effective genetic management for the giant panda population, sufficient and reliable polymorphic genetic markers are required to provide essential information on the genetic diversity survey of this species. Seven new tetranucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized in this study and presented here as a tool for evaluating the genetic variation of giant pandas in the world's two largest captive populations (Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, Sichuan Province and the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province). A total of 45 alleles were identified from these seven new microsatellite loci on the basis of 48 giant panda individuals, including 19 private alleles (six from the Chengdu population, 13 from the Wolong population) and 26 shared alleles. The average number of alleles, the average allelic richness the and mean observed heterozygosity were 4.6, 4.367 and 0.649, respectively in the Chengdu population and 5.6, 5.697 and 0.675 in the Wolong population, suggesting that the Chengdu population has a much lower allelic diversity than the Wolong population. Thus, we proposed a better strategy for the captive breeding of giant pandas. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 The Zoological Society of London.

77956937538	Zinc-finger intron 7: A new locus for sex identification of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	We developed a single-reaction test for identifying the sex of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) targeted to co-amplify homologous fragments with size polymorphism that located at zinc-finger (ZF) intron 7 by using one pair of primers. This assay produced one sex-specific fragment in females (XX genotypes) whereas two fragments were produced in males (XY genotypes). Indels (insertion/ deletion) in intron 7 of Y-linked allele provide a significant discrimination between ZFX and ZFY, thus the amplification products can be simply distinguished by agarose gel electrophoresis, exhibiting sex-specific banding patterns (female, 354 bp; male, 354 bp, 135 bp). The new primer set was successfully tested on known-sex giant pandas by using template DNA extracted from both blood and fecal samples. Cross-species test was also performed, revealing that this assay could be applied to other Ursidae species. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77958609039	Mitochondrial DNA genetic variation and phylogeography of the recently described vole species Proedromys liangshanensis Liu, Sun, Zeng and Zhao, 2007 (Rodentia: Arvicolinae)	A vole species, Proedromys liangshanensis Liu, Sun, Zeng and Zhao, 2007 (Rodentia: Arvicolinae), which is endemic to the Liangshan Mountains, Sichuan, China, was reported in 2007. The species is restricted to a narrow range because of its weak dispersal ability and habitat specificity, and only lives in fir and spruce forests with abundant grass. In this study, the genetic diversity and phylogeographical structure of 42 P. liangshanensis were examined based on analysis of a partial mitochondrial DNA control region. The results revealed low genetic diversity in the P. liangshanensis populations. Twelve nucleotide haplotypes were defined in the 42 collected individuals, and were divided into two major phylogenetic clades, which were obviously related to geographic pattern. Estimates of gene flow (Nm = 0.09) also revealed a genetic divergence between the Jinyang and Meigu populations. Species-specific traits, habitat specificity and geographic events contributed to the genetic divergence of the new vole. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

78549273402	Complete mitochondrial genome of Tetraophasis szechenyii Madarász, 1885 (Aves: Galliformes: Phasianidae), and its genetic variation as inferred from the mitochondrial DNA control region	The buff-throated partridge, Tetraophasis szechenyii Madarász, 1885, is a species endemic to west China. The complete mitochondrial genome of this species was sequenced. It was 16,706 base pairs (bp) in length and contained 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and a control region (CR). The phylogenetic relationships of the buff-throated partridge and 19 other Phasianidae species were inferred by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses based on 12 protein-coding genes. With the exception of a few nodes, most internal branches were supported by a high Bayesian posterior probability (BPP = 1.0). The resulting trees clarified the phylogenetic position of T. szechenyii within Phasianidae. The genetic diversity and population structure of the Pamulin population of T. szechenyii were examined based on the mitochondrial DNA CR. Nucleotide sequence analysis defined 18 haplotypes in 24 individuals. Haplotype diversity (h) was 0.953 and nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.0044. The results revealed that the genetic diversity of this population was not particularly low. Combined with the field work conducted by our lab, we found that members of the Pamuling population are cooperative breeders and the population may contain individuals from neighbouring groups. Our work provided genetic background information for the conservation and management of this species. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

78651465137	Structural characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the sugarcane borer, diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)	The sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.), is an economically important pest of several major crops in North and South America. There is great concern over potential resistance development to the valuable transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis corn. Cost-effective monitoring methods, especially regarding molecular markers that could detect early changes in resistance allele frequency in field populations of D. saccharalis, are needed. This article reports the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of D. saccharalis (GenBank: FJ240227). The mitochondrial genome sequence of D. saccharalis has the typical metazoan mitogenome structure including 13 protein-coding genes, 2?rRNA genes, and 22?tRNA genes, with a total size of 15,490?bp. The A+T content of the full mitogenome is 80.1% and the significant A+T bias is at the control region (94.9%), as compared to the extremely low G content (0.6%). In all 13 protein coding genes, 9 start with the common Met initiator codon (ATA or ATG) and 3 use ATT (Ile), whereas CGA (Arg) is used as a start codon in COI. Eleven of the 13 protein coding genes use complete termination codon (TAA), whereas COI and COII use incomplete ones, which terminated with a single T-nucleotide abutting on tRNA. There are seven major noncoding spacers (628?bp), including six intergenic spacers and an A+T-rich region, which are scattered in the mitogenome. Several microsatellite-like elements were observed in these noncoding regions. The complete mitochondrial sequences of D. saccharalis reported in this study can provide useful data in analyzing divergence of lepidopteran insects and in developing DNA-based diagnoses and genetic makers. ©2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.

78751523528	DNA barcoding of 18 species of Bovidae	Genetic divergences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I genes, known as DNA barcodes, have been used in species identification in the animal kingdom. Barcodes can assist field workers and taxonomists to determine groups in need of taxa analysis, and facilitate the recognition of appropriate populations and scales for conservation planning. In this study, 18 species of Bovidae were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for species differentiation. The results showed that all but 2 species had unique DNA barcodes. The mean intraspecific variation was 0.63%, yielding a threshold of 6.3% for flagging putative species. The results supported the inference that barcode variation within species of mammals is somewhat higher than within other animal groups. The present study validated the effectiveness of barcoding for the identification of bovid species. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79751491771	An ARMS-based technique for sex determination of red panda (Ailurus fulgens)	Molecular sexing is a key component in the investigation of wild populations. In this study, we developed a fast, accurate and reliable amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) technique for sex determination of red panda based on the exon 4 of the ZFX/ZFY gene. The amplicons were distinguished simply by agarose gel electrophoresis, exhibiting one fragment in females (X: 300bp) and two in males (X: 300bp, Y: 166bp). Robustness of this ARMS system was confirmed by testing both 43 captive red pandas using DNA samples with known-sex and 10 wild red pandas using faecal DNA samples with unknown sex. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

79952746124	How Quaternary geologic and climatic events in the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau influence the genetic structure of small mammals: Inferences from phylogeography of two rodents, Neodon irene and Apodemus latronum	Phylogeographical studies that focus on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau are limited. The complex terrain and unique geological history make it a particularly unusual region of the Tibetan Plateau. We carried out a phylogeographical study of two rodent species Neodon irene and Apodemus latronum using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences. High genetic diversities and deep phylogenetic splits were detected in both rodents. Some haplotypes from one sampling region fell into different evolutionary clades, but most haplotypes from the same sampling regions were clustered together with each other. The results of isolation by distance analysis further substantiated that their genetic diversities were structured along geography. Thus, there were high levels of geographical structure for both rodents. Demographic analyses implied a relatively constant population size for all samples of N. irene and A. latronum in history. However, clade B of N. irene and clade 3 of A. latronum experienced population expansions at 105-32 and 156-47 Kya, respectively. Through comparison with previous studies, we suggest the high mitochondrial DNA diversities in them are probably not a species-specific feature, but a common pattern for small mammals in this unique area. Details of the historical demography of these rodents revealed in this study could provide new insights into how rodents and possibly other small mammals in this region responded to the geological and climatic events. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79958771493	Cooperative breeding by Buff-throated Partridge Tetraophasis szechenyii: A case in the Galliformes	Cooperative breeding is rarely found in the Galliformes. We report a case in Buff-throated Partridge Tetraophasis szechenyii, a sexually monochromatic Galliform species endemic to western China. A total of 68 groups were detected in the 2006-2009 breeding seasons, and cooperative breeding was observed to be facultative, with 64.7% (44/68) of pairs having up to three helpers of either sex (but predominantly male). Groups usually remained stable within the breeding season. Sampling revealed that all adult members exhibited behavioral efforts in terms of brooding, vigilance, and territorial display (including calling and fighting), with helpers especially focusing on territorial fighting. No evidence was found to suggest that the presence of helpers significantly enhanced a group's breeding success and productivity compared to unaided pairs. Further studies, particularly intraspecific comparative analyses (for example, between populations or between sites) and those measuring the relatedness between helpers and other group members, are needed to understand the occurrence of cooperative breeding in this species. © 2011 Dt.

79959566824	Complex topographic configuration in the hengduan mountains shaped the phylogeographic structure of chinese white-bellied rats	Several studies indicated that the Hengduan Mountains acted as refugia during the Pleistocene. Complex topographic configuration in this area might have played an important role in shaping the genetic divergence. Here, we investigated the phylogeography of the Chinese white-bellied rats, Niviventer confucianus, to test the role of mountain ranges in the Hengduan Mountains. Our results revealed that N. confucianus populations were clustered into three geographic lineages, which were consistent with the geographic origin, where, the Daxueshan Mountains but not the Daocheng Ice Cap regions contributed to the genetic divergence of N. confucianus populations. The Daxueshan Mountains separated N. confucianus populations into two distinct evolutionary lineages (clade A and clade B) and Motuo population formed monophyletic group (clade C). Results from the mismatch distribution and neutrality test analysis suggested a range expansion of the two clades (clade A and clade B). Divergence time estimation indicated that all splits within each clade occurred after the mid-Pleistocene. All results revealed that the complex topographic configuration in the Hengduan Mountains contributed to the genetic divergence of N. confucianus. © 2011 The Authors.

79960245465	Complete mitochondrial genome of a new vole Proedromys liangshanensis (Rodentia: Cricetidae) and phylogenetic analysis with related species: Are there implications for the validity of the genus Proedromys?	Aim. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a newly discovered vole, Proedromys liangshanensis (Rodentia: Cricetidae: Arvicolinae), was determined. Results. The mitogenome of P. liangshanensis is 16,296 Â bp in length. As with most other mammals, it contains the same gene order and an identical number of genes or regions, including 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one putative control region. The A+T content of the control region is 58.2%, the lowest proportion detected so far in Myomorpha. To confirm the phylogenetic position of P. liangshanensis, we carried out phylogenetic analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomic data using Bayesian, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. Conclusion. All results revealed that P. liangshanenis is sister to Microtus. Although the results do not bear light on the validity of the genus Proedromys, based on the morphological characters, we suggest that Proedromys is an independent genus of equal rank to the genus Microtus. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

79960941214	Abundant variations of MC4R gene revealed by Phylogenies of Yak (Bos grunniens) and other mammals	MC4R gene was proved to play important roles in body weight regulation in many mammals and exhibit higher homology among different species. The mutations MC4R significantly correlated to the restricted feeding weight, fat deposition and energy balance. In this work, ORF sequences of MC4R gene of Bos grunniens were cloned and phylogenetic relationships of yak and other mammals were analyzed on the basis of MC4R genes. Totally 290 variable sites were examined in 25 sequences from 22 different mammals, and 23 haplotypes were defined with a haplotype diversity of 0.9900. All the sequences were clustered into phylogenetic clades representing different orders or families. The individuals of Bos grunniens, Bos taurus and Ovis aries which belonged to the family of Bovidae were more divergent from the other orders or families and bovid animals may have branched out from the phylogenetic tree earlier than other mammals analyzed during 450 million years of vertebrate evolution. Amino acid sequences inferred from MC4R genes exhibited 54 variable sites, while high conservation of MC4R was observed within the same order or family. We concluded that coding region of MC4R gene displayed abundant variations among different mammal phylogenetic clades, whereas, the conservation of MC4R within order or family could be explained that MC4R gene may have been subjected to substantial constraints or strong purifying selection during several million years of mammal evolution. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

79960342152	Extraction from soil of apterous Pemphigus populitransversus (Hemiptera: Pemphigidae) feeding on cruciferous vegetable roots	The poplar petiolegall aphid, Pemphigus populitransversus Riley (Hemiptera: Pemphigidae), is a gall-forming aphid attacking leaf petioles of Populus spp., its primary hosts. Rs secondary hosts are the roots of cruciferous (Brassicaceae) plants, where it is also commonly known as the "cabbage root aphid." The apterous forms are destructive pests of cruciferous vegetables in many parts of the world. In our experiments, the root-feeding apterous forms were extracted from the soil using a Berlese funnel, which drives the aphids downward by using light and heat. The results show that a majority of apterous aphids (96.9%) were extracted from the soil in 2 h by using a 15-W light bulb in the Berlese funnels, whereas only 18.2% of aphids were extracted using a 25-W light bulb in a similar time period. The 25-W light bulb in the funnel generated too much heat (40-44°C), which dried the soil too fast so that the aphids were unable to crawl downward to the collecting jars or killed the aphids directly. The advantages of using a Berlese funnel equipped with a 15-W light bulb as the light and heat source for sampling and extraction of the root feeding aphids include a uniform handling of each sample, less time spent, extraction of many samples at the same time, and storage of the aphids in containers for later counting in the laboratory. This technique seems to also be useful for extracting other mobile, small soil-dwelling arthropods. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.

In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of N. irene. It was determined to be 16,367 bases. The nucleotide sequence data of 12 heavy-strand protein-coding genes of N. irene and other 22 rodents were used for phylogenetic analysis. Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) were used. Both the BI and ML trees demonstrated that Microtus rossiaemeridionalis and Microtus kikuchii did not cluster together with each other. On the contrary, M. rossiaemeridionalis showed close relationship with N. irene. In the present study, only one sequence from Neodon and two sequences from Microtus were included in the phylogenetic analysis which should contribute to the unusual relationship. Therefore, in order to better understand the phylogenetic relationship within Rodentia, more rodents' complete mitochondrial genomes are required. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

80051696237	The reproductive performance of female Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) in captivity	Reproductive performance of 750 adult female Forest musk deer (FMD, Moschus berezovskii) was monitored (from 2005 to 2009) on two Forest musk deer farms in Sichuan province, China. The mean (± SEM) lengths of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and consecutive fawning intervals were 17.5 ± 0.8 d (n = 64), 182.9 ± 0.8 d (n =190), and 363.2 ± 2.4 d (n = 120), respectively. Copulation occurred from the end of October to early March, with the majority (84.1 ± 1.9%) during November and December (P < 0.05). The fawning rate was 68.7 ± 2.2% in yearling hinds and 73.3 ± 1.3% in adult hinds. Fawning occurred from the end of April to early September, with the majority (88. 9 ± 2.2%) during May and June (P < 0.005), including a peak in May (52.0 ± 1.0%). Yearling hinds fawned later (7.3 ± 1.8 d) than adult hinds. Rates of premature delivery and dystocia were 2.7 ± 0.4 and 2.0 ± 0.3%, respectively. There was a 1.07:1 female-to-male ratio at birth (P > 0.05), with 67.7% twins, but only two cases of triplets and one set of quadruplets among 537 fawns. Birth weight averaged 518.7 ± 10.3 g, ranging from 304 to 775 g (n = 240), with male fawns slightly heavier than females (521.1 ± 14.8 vs 516.9 ± 14.3 g). Postnatal and pre-weaning mortality rates were 25.0 ± 1.2 and 17.9 ± 3.1%, respectively. Postnatal mortality and urinary calculus were much more common in male fawns (P < 0.01). The mortality rate due to suppuration and dyspepsia were different (P < 0.001) between postnatal and pre-weaning periods. Due to higher mortality of male fawns, the adult sex ratio was significantly female-biased. In conclusion, captive FMD had similar seasonal patterns of copulation and fawning as wild FMD and other musk deer species. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The genetic diversities of the populations from L. Wuxu and R. Jiulong were investigated according to analysis of mtDNA control region and compared against three other reported river populations. The L. Wuxu population showed lower haplotype (h = 0.74) and nucleotide (π = 0.001) diversities compared to the R. Jiulong population (h = 0.87; π = 0.012); the lake population had suffered from a bottleneck, which might contribute to its low genetic diversity; the lake population significantly differentiated from the river populations, and significant gene flow was hardly found between river populations and L. Wuxu population, suggesting that there is a strong population structure between the lake and river populations. The L. Wuxu population was ecologically isolated from the R. Jiulong population, while the relatively low genetic variability had not affected its viability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-eight strains of A. pyogenes isolated from forest musk deer suppurative samples wereidentified by their 16S rRNA gene sequences, and confirmed by amplification of the pyolysinencodinggene (plo) in all isolates. The MICs of 14 commonly used antibiotics were determined byan agar dilution method. Class 1 and 2 intI genes were amplified to determine whether integronswere present in the A. pyogenes genome. Class 1 gene cassettes were detected by specificprimers and analysed by sequencing. All of the strains were susceptible to most fluoroquinoloneantibiotics; however, high resistance rates were observed for β-lactams and trimethoprim. A totalof 18 of the isolates (64.3%) were positive for the class 1 intI gene, and 16 (57.1%) containedclass 1 gene cassettes with the aacC, aadA1, aadA2, blaP1 and dfr2a genes. Most were presentin the multi-resistant isolates, indicating a general concordance between the presence of genecassettes and antibiotic resistance, and that the integrons have played an important role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in this species. © 2011 SGM.

84856736224	A triple-primer PCR approach for the sex identification of endangered Phasianidae birds	To manage and conserve endangered Phasianidae species and to study their ecology, behavior, and population structure, sex identification is necessary. A search for the pheasant sex-linked marker (PSL) was carried out by comparing the sequences of chicken sex chromosomes. A triple-primer PCR approach was established in the present study based on a novel PSL for the sex identification of Phasianidae birds. The triple-primer system amplified a 202-bp PSL-W-specific fragment in female Phasianidae birds, whereas there is a 107-bp PSL-Z-specific fragment in the both sexes, thus making the female distinct. We also found a 102-bp AT-rich repeat sequence inserted into the PSL-W-specific region in Tetraophasis szechenyii generating a ~300-bp PSL-W fragment in females. The sex of 11 Phasianidae species was distinguished clearly by the triple-primer PCR approach indicating that this method is both quick and reliable and can be easily applied to a wider range of Phasianidae species. Due to the relatively small size of the amplification products, the triple-primer PCR approach can also be applied to noninvasive samples such as feathers. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84857371125	High intra-population genetic variability and inter-population differentiation in a plateau specialized fish, Triplophysa orientalis	Triplophysa orientalis (Herzenstein) is one of the Nemacheilinae (Cypriniformes: Balitoridae) fish species distributed in the Tibetan Plateau area. In order to understand the impact of plateau uplift on population history and the isolation effect of plateau lakes on T. orientalis, we examined its genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships. A total of 98 individuals from five wild populations, three from plateau lakes and two from branch rivers in upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in the eastern peripheral of the Tibetan Plateau were sampled. An 848 base pair fragment from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was sequenced for analyses. Overall, very high intra-population genetic variability was found in all populations except for one lake population (Rannicuo); nucleotide diversity ranged from 0. 0025 to 0. 0159 and haplotype diversity ranged from 0. 641 to 0. 879. Furthermore, the genetic distance between river populations (0. 0326) was much higher than that among lake populations (Rannicuo and Barencuo 0. 0035, Bannicuo and Yibicuo 0. 0038, Rannicuo and Yibicuo 0. 0049). Additionally, the analysis of molecular variance demonstrated that most of the observed genetic variability occurred among populations, accompanied with significant Fst values except for that between the Yibicuo and Barencuo populations. This evidence suggested a strong population structure of the species and a lack of inter-population connection. Lastly, the rate of migration indicated there were large historic gene flows among lake populations. Demographic analysis also indicated there were bottlenecks or expansions in three lake populations, suggesting a potential isolation effect of plateau lakes on population differentiation. Molecular dating of intra-specific divergence showed the plateau uplift has shaped the genetic structure of T. orientalis. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84859253651	Molecular phylogeny of Asiatic Short-Tailed Shrews, genus Blarinella Thomas, 1911 (Mammalia: Soricomorpha: Soricidae) and its taxonomic implications	The classification and phylogenetic relationships of the genus Blarinella have been traditionally based on morphological characteristics, and there have been no studies published about the molecular phylogenetic relationships and biogeography for this genus. Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Blarinella based on one nuclear (ApoB) and two mitochondrial (cyt-b, 16S rRNA) genes. Our results supported the monophyly of the genus Blarinella and the valid species status of Blarinella wardi. Nevertheless, two morphologically defined Blarinella species, B. quadraticauda and B. griselda, were poorly differentiated by molecular data; B. quadraticauda was found embedded within B. griselda making the latter a paraphyletic group. These results indicate that B. quadraticauda might be under a budding speciation scenario or is a restricted geographical subspecies of B. griselda. Phylogeographic analyses suggest that diversification and speciation of Blarinella might have been promoted by vicariance events associated to the complex topography of Southwest China. Further morphological, genetic and ecological studies are necessary to examine these hypotheses. Copyright © 2012 Magnolia Press.

84859977277	Isolation and characterization of twenty dinucleotide microsatellite loci in the buff-throated partridge, tetraophasis szechenyii	Twenty dinucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated from AC-enriched libraries of the buff-throated partridge, Tetraophasis szechenyii. These loci were tested on 25 individuals of T. szechenyii, and most loci are proved to be highly polymorphic. The number of alleles per locus ranged from three to eight. Polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.552 to 0.838. Observed and expected heterozygosities (Ho, He) were varied 0.480-0.792 and 0.633-0.872, respectively. The newly identified polymorphic markers will facilitate the study of T. szechenyii on the population genetics and genetic linkage map construction. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

84861341358	CR1 retroposons provide a new insight into the phylogeny of Phasianidae species (Aves: Galliformes)	Chicken repeat 1 (CR1) elements, a class of retroposons belonging to non-long-terminal repeats, have been recognized as powerful tools for phylogenetic studies. Here we examine the phylogenetic relationships of 11 Phasianidae species based on CR1 retroposons. Together with 19 loci reported previously, a total of 99 CR1 loci were identified from chicken genome and turkey BAC clone sequences. 75 insertion events were used to address the branching order of 11 species in Phasianidae. The topology of our tree suggests that: 1) . Gallus gallus possessed a basal phylogenetic position within Phasianidae and was related to . Bambusicola thoracica (BSP. =. 100%); 2) After the split of . G. gallus and . B. thoracica, . Arborophila rufipectus diverged from Phasianidae (BSP. =. 100%). Nine unambiguous insertion events supported a phylogenetic position of . A. rufipectus different to previous mitochondrial data suggesting a hybrid origin or an ancient introgression of . A. rufipectus; and 3) 22 CR1 insertion events strongly supported the eight phasianids under investigation sharing a common ancestor. Our study has revisited the phylogenetic position of . G. gallus and . A. rufipectus and provided a new insight into the phylogeny of Phasianidae birds. It showed that a CR1-based methodology has a great potential to be informative within Phasianidae in resolving relationships of closely related species whose radiation and speciation have occurred very recently. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84862802711	Phylogenetic position of the genus Proedromys (Arvicolinae, Rodentia): Evidence from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA	The issue of whether . Proedromys should be included in the genus . Micritus or considered a valid genus has been a controversial issue, since it was established that the genus . Proedromys contained only a single species (. Proedromys bedfordi). In 2007, a vole species of . Proedromys (. Proedromys liangshanensis) was identified. In order to elaborate the phylogenetic positions of the genus . Proedromys and the vole species, we determined mitochondrial (cyt . b) and two unclear (GHR and IRBP) DNA fragments. Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood analyses based on a combined matrix indicated that . Proedromys is not monophyletic as it is currently recognized. . P. bedfordi was separated from the genus . Microtus, forming a well-supported clade and was a sister taxon to . Volemys musseri. The position of . P. liangshanensis, however, was unstable due to low/moderately supported value. Molecular dating analyses using BEAST suggested an early Pleistocene origin for the genus. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863177386	Molecular phylogeny of major lineages of the avian family Phasianidae inferred from complete mitochondrial genome sequences	Phasianidae is a large family of birds which contains most of the gallinaceous birds of the world. So far, the taxonomic status of many genera within Phasianidae has been controversial. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the white-eared pheasant (Crossoption crossoptilon) was determined in this study. Combining this with other previously published mitochondrial genome sequences, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of Phasianidae and related species using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. All analyses yielded a similar and well-supported topology, in which Crossoptilon grouped with Lophura. Perdix dauurica was sister taxon to the gallopheasants with high support, and Pucrasia was sister to this clade and separate from the other tragopans. Tetraophasis and Lophophorus grouped together, with Tragopan as the sister taxon. In addition, our results indicated that Meleagris clustered with Bonasa forming a monophyletic clade embedded in the pheasant-partridge clade and the turkey-grouse lineage should be considered a part of the pheasant-partridge radiation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84863319970	The complete mitochondrial genome of the Chinese Sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838), and phylogenetic analysis among Cervidae, Moschidae and Bovidae	The complete mitochondrial genomes of the Sichuan Sika deer (Cervus nippon sichuanicus) and the South China Sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi) were determined. Their sizes were 16,429 and 16,428 base pairs, respectively. The similarity of the mitochondrial DNA genome among subspecies of the Chinese Sika deer was calculated, and the values estimated from complete nucleotide sequences and entire amino-acid sequences were 98.4-99.9% and 99.7-99.9%, respectively. Molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods based on the sequences of 12 concatenated heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes. The consensus of phylogenetic trees supported the monophyly of Moschidae, Cervidae and Bovidae, and placed Moschidae as a sister group to Cervidae/Bovidae. The relationships among Chinese Sika deer inferred from the phylogenetic analysis were inconsistent with subspecies designations and the present geographic distribution. Our complete mitochondrial genomes will be available as important and basic data for phylogenetics, breeding, genetics and conservation in Cervidae. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84863770079	Alarm signals of the Sichuan sika deer cervus nippon sichuanicus	Sichuan sika deer (Cervus nippon sichuanicus) is an endangered and endemic subspecies of sika deer to Sichuan Province, China. According to our observations in the wild, the Sichuan sika deer makes alarm signals in the presence of actual or potential predators. In order to test the variation of the rhythmic alarm calls in some sex/age classes and different risk contexts, we recorded alarm calls of Sichuan sika deer from 2 October to 30 November 2008 and from 4 April to 5 September 2009 in the Tiebu Nature Reserve, Zoige County, Sichuan Province, China, and made acoustic analysis of these alarm calls. The results showed that the fundamental frequencies of alarm signals of Sichuan sika deer tended to decrease with age, and were significantly higher for females than for males. Duration tended to increase with age, and was significantly longer for males than for females. The fundamental frequencies and duration of alarm calls in adults were significantly higher and shorter respectively in high-risk than in moderate-risk contexts. © 2012 Zoological Society of Japan.

84863852565	Polymorphism of CAG repeats in androgen receptor of carnivores	Androgen effect is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR). The polymorphism of CAG triplet repeat (polyCAG), in the N-terminal transactivation domain of the AR protein, has been involved either in endocrine or neurological disorders in human. We obtained partial sequence of AR exon 1 in 10 carnivore species. In most carnivore species, polyglutamine length polymorphism presented in all three CAG repeat regions of AR, in contrast, only CAG-I site polymorphism presented in primate species, and CAG-I and CAG-III sites polymorphism presented in Canidae. Therefore, studies focusing on diseaseassociated polymorphism of poly(CAG) in carnivore species AR should investigate all three CAG repeats sites, and should not only consider CAG-I sites as the human disease studies. The trinucleotide repeat length in carnivore AR exon 1 had undergone from expansions to contractions during carnivores evolution, unlike a linear increase in primate species. Furthermore, the polymorphisms of the triplet-repeats in the same tissue (somatic mosaicism) were demonstrated in Moutain weasel, Eurasian lynx, Clouded leopard, Chinese tiger, Black leopard and Leopard AR. And, the abnormal stop codon was found in the exon 1 of three carnivore species AR (Moutain weasel, Eurasian lynx and Black leopard). It seemed to have a high frequency presence of tissue-specific somatic in carnivores AR genes. Thus the in vivo mechanism leading to such highly variable phenotypes of the described mutations, and their impact on these animals, are worthwhile to be further elucidated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

84864329576	Complete mitochondrial genome of the Chinese oriental vole Eothenomys chinensis (Rodentia: Arvicolinae)	The Chinese oriental vole (Eothenomys chinensis) belongs to subfamily Arvicolinae, which is endemic to the mountains in southwest China. E. chinensis and other Arvicoline species display a number of features that make them ideal for evolutionary studies of speciation and the role of Quaternary glacial cycles on diversification. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of E. chinensis was sequenced. It was determined to be 16,362 bases. The nucleotide sequence data of 12 heavy-strand protein-coding genes of E. chinensis and other 19 rodents were used for phylogenetic analyses. Trees constructed using three different phylogenetic methods (Bayesian, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood) showed a similar topology demonstrating that E. chinensis was clustered in subfamily arvicolinae formed a solid monophyletic group being sister to the subfamily Cricetinae. And the trees also suggested that E. chinensis is a sister to the genus Microtus and Proedromys. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd..

84864406330	Determination of Baylisascaris schroederi infection in wild giant pandas by an accurate and sensitive PCR/CE-SSCP method	It has been recognized that other than habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, the infection of the roundworm Baylisascaris schroederi (B. schroederi) is one of the major causes of death in wild giant pandas. However, the prevalence and intensity of the parasite infection has been inconsistently reported through a method that uses sedimentation-floatation followed by a microscope examination. This method fails to accurately determine infection because there are many bamboo residues and/or few B. schroederi eggs in the examined fecal samples. In the present study, we adopted a method that uses PCR and capillary electrophoresis combined with a single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR/CE-SSCP) to detect B. schroederi infection in wild giant pandas at a nature reserve, and compared it to the traditional microscope approach. The PCR specifically amplified a single band of 279-bp from both fecal samples and positive controls, which was confirmed by sequence analysis to correspond to the mitochondrial COII gene of B. schroederi. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the amount of genomic DNA was linearly correlated with the peak area of the CE-SSCP analysis. Thus, our adopted method can reliably detect the infectious prevalence and intensity of B. schroederi in wild giant pandas. The prevalence of B. schroederi was found to be 54% in the 91 fecal samples examined, and 48% in the fecal samples of 31 identified individual giant pandas. Infectious intensities of the 91 fecal samples were detected to range from 2.8 to 959.2 units/gram, and from 4.8 to 959.2 units/gram in the fecal samples of the 31 identified giant pandas. For comparison, by using the traditional microscope method, the prevalence of B. schroederi was found to be only 33% in the 91 fecal samples, 32% in the fecal samples of the 31 identified giant pandas, and no reliable infectious intensity was observed. © 2012 Zhang et al.

84865740752	Modeling spring habitat requirements of the endangered brown eared pheasant Crossoptilon mantchuricum in the Huanglong Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China	A detailed understanding of the habitat needs of brown eared pheasants (Crossoptilon mantchuricum) is essential for conserving the species. We carried out field surveys in the Huanglong Mountains of Shaanxi Province, China, from March to June in 2007 and 2008. We arrayed a total of 206 grid plots (200 × 200 m) along transects in 2007 and 2008 and quantified a suite of environmental variables for each one. In the optimal logistic regression model, the most important variables for brown eared pheasants were slope degree, tree cover, distance to nearest water, cover and depth of fallen leaves. Hosmer and Leweshow goodness-of-fit tests explained that logistic models for the species were good fits. The model suggested that spring habitat selection of the brown eared pheasant was negatively related to distance to nearest water and slope degree, and positively to cover of trees and cover and depth of fallen leaves. In addition, the observed detected and undetected grids in 2007 did not show significant differences with predictions based on the model. These results showed that the model could well predict the habitat selection of brown eared pheasants. Based on these predictive models, we suggest that habitat management plans incorporating this new information can now focus more effectively on restrictions on the number of tourists entering the nature reserve, prohibition of firewood collection, livestock grazing, and medicinal plant harvesting by local residents in the core areas, protection of mixed forest and sources of the permanent water in the reserve, and use of alternatives to firewood. © 2012 Zoological Society of Japan.

84866438023	Specifying and sustaining pigmentation patterns in domestic and wild cats	Color markings among felid species display both a remarkable diversity and a common underlying periodicity. A similar range of patterns in domestic cats suggests a conserved mechanism whose appearance can be altered by selection. We identified the gene responsible for tabby pattern variation in domestic cats as Transmembrane aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep), which encodes a membrane-bound metalloprotease. Analyzing 31 other felid species, we identified Taqpep as the cause of the rare king cheetah phenotype, in which spots coalesce into blotches and stripes. Histologic, genomic expression, and transgenic mouse studies indicate that paracrine expression of Endothelin3 (Edn3) coordinates localized color differences. We propose a two-stage model in which Taqpep helps to establish a periodic pre-pattern during skin development that is later implemented by differential expression of Edn3.

The mitochondrial genome sequence (16,298 bp) of N. excelsior contains 13 protein-coding, 2 rRNA and 22 tRNA genes as well as 1 typical control region (D-Loop), which are shared by other mammalian mitochondrial genomes. The codon usage also followed the typical vertebrate pattern except for an unusual CCA stop codon, which was termination codon of Cyt b. The 16 nucleotide insertion was detected in the central conserved domain of d-Loop. The 12 heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships by the Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. Topologies revealed that N. excelsior clustered together with the species in genus Rattus, indicating their closer phylogenetic relationship. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

84870626838	Fauna and species diversity of small mammals in Jiajin Mountains, Sichuan Province, China	The Jiajin Mountains, locating in the mountainous southwest of China, has been a hotbed of biodiversity research for the past several decades. We conducted a species diversity survey of small mammals at different elevation bands and in various habitat types. A total of 927 individuals were captured. These animals belonged to 4 orders, 8 families, and 35 species including 16 rodents, 16 insectivores, and 3 pikas. Analysis of these data indicated that: 1) species number on south slopes (31) was higher than that on the north slopes (20) because of north-south climate differences; 2) among the 35 species, 15 species were endemic to China, and high diversity of insectivore species was obtained in this unique region; 3) Palearctic composition on north slopes is significantly higher than on the opposite slopes which might be due to north-south migration restrictions of Oriental and Palearctic species from Jiajin Mountains; 4) the highest species diversity was in the mid-altitudes (2400-3000 m) in the southern part because of serious human disturbance in low altitude regions and simple vegetation types in high altitude regions, while the elevations exhibiting the highest species diversity on north slopes was higher (3000-3600 m), which might be due to dry climate at low altitude regions on north slopes; The complex topographic configurations in the Jiajin Mountains contributed to species divergence and provided diversified habitats for small mammals, thus high species diversity and abundant endemic species were observed in this region. High diversity of insectivore species might be related to more evolutionary advantages in the unique area.

84870769891	Genetic quality of the Miyaluo captive forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) population as assessed by microsatellite loci	The Miyaluo captive forest musk deer population (Sichuan Province, China) is one of the largest captive breeding populations in the world. In order to evaluate the genetic quality and provide available genetic management strategy, seven polymorphism microsatellite loci were applied to assess the genetic variation of the Miyaluo forest musk deer. The results indicated that a total of 168 alleles were detected from these seven microsatellite loci in 361 individuals, and the number of the alleles per locus ranged from 12 to 41 with a mean of 24. The average observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity, and PIC were 0.782, 0.854, and 0.837, respectively. Considering the results of the loci Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test, the comparison of the common allele frequency as well as the private allele between the adults and juveniles, we concluded that the heterozygosity and the genetic diversity of the Miyaluo captive breeding population are increasing due to the input of new individuals from other populations. However, the frequency of some alleles declined sharply, and some were even lost indicating that there is a risk for diversity loss. Thus, we proposed an improved management and breeding strategy for the captive breeding population of the forest musk deer. © 2012.

84871980316	In silico analysis of molecular mechanisms of legume lectin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells	Objectives: The legume lectin family, one of the most extensively studied plant lectin families, has received increasing attention for the remarkable anti-tumor activities of its members for binding specific cancer cell surface glycoconjugates. MicroRNAs, a class of small, non-coding RNAs, control translation and stability of mRNAs at post-transcriptional and translational levels. To date, accumulating evidence has revealed that microRNAs are involved in progression of a number of human diseases, especially cancers. However, the molecular manners of microRNA-modulated apoptosis in legume lectin-treated cancer cells are still under investigation. Materials and methods: We performed in silico analyses to study the interactions between three typical legume lectins (ConA, SFL and SAL) and some specific sugar-containing receptors (for example, EGFR, TNFR1, HSP70 and HSP90). Additionally, we predicted some relevant microRNAs which could significantly regulate these aforementioned targetreceptors and thus inhibiting down-stream cancer-related signaling pathways. Results: The results showed that these three legume lectins could competitively bind sugar-containing receptors such as EGFR, TNFR1, HSP70 and HSP90 in two ways, via anti-apoptotic or survival pathways. On the one hand, the legume lectins could induce cancer cell death through triggering receptor-mediated signaling pathways, which resulted from indirect binding between legume lectins and mannoses resided in receptors. On the other hand, direct binding between legume lectins and receptors could lead to steric hindrance, which would disturb efficient interactions between them, and thus, the legume lectins would induce cancer cell death by triggering receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, we identified several relevant microRNAs that regulated these targeted receptors, thereby ultimately causing cancer cell apoptosis. Conclusions: These findings provide new perspectives for exploring microRNA-modulated cell death in legume lectin-treated cancer cells, which could be utilized in combination therapy for future cancer drug development. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84872504725	Phylogenetic analyses and improved resolution of the family Bovidae based on complete mitochondrial genomes	Efforts have been made to investigate the phylogeny of the family Bovidae; however, the relationships within this group still remain controversial. To further our understanding of the relationships, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the Himalayan goral, Naemorhedus goral, an IUCN Redlist near threatened conservation dependent species. Then we conducted molecular phylogenetic relationships of the Bovidae based on Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. The results indicate that the basal divergence within the Bovidae is between the Bovinae and a strongly supported clade of the remaining Bovidae species. The two Neotragus species (the suni and pygmy antelope) clustered with the impala, Aepyceros melampus (Aepycerotinae), and together they formed the most basal of the non-Bovinae. All the genera of the Antilopinae clustered together except Neotragus, which suggested that the Antilopinae was a paraphyletic subfamily. The present study confirmed a close relationship between the genera Capricornis and Naemorhedus while supporting their designation as separate genera and suggested that the Capricornis- Naemorhedus-Ovibos clade (serows, gorals, and the muskox) should be placed in the Caprinae. Bison, Bos, and Tragelaphus (bison & cattle and kudus and nyalas) were paraphyletic. The very close relationship between Bison and Bos suggested that Bos and Bison should be integrated into a single Bos genus. Saiga and Pantholops (the Chiru or Tibetan Antelope), unique genera which have sometimes been lumped together, were placed in different groups: Saiga within the Antilopinae and Pantholops at the base of the Caprinae. Our results also supported a new taxonomy which places the three species of Hemitragus into three monospecific genera: the genus Hemitragus is restricted to the Himalayan tahr, and two new genera are created: Arabitragus for the Arabian tahr and Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri tahr. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84872660959	Phylogenetic lineages of Monopterus albus (Synbranchiformes: Synbranchidae) in China inferred from mitochondrial control region	Phylogenetic inference of mitochondrial control region (501 bp) of 167 individuals from 12 regional populations revealed that Chinese swamp eels fell into five genetic lineages, Lineage A, B, C, D and E. Lineage A was speculated to share the same mitochondrial ancestors with the populations from Taiwan Island. Lineage C harboured most of the haplotypes (39/60) of populations and may have experienced population expansion. The distribution pattern of Lineage C from east to west regions may have resulted from the occurrence of the major glaciation and inter-regional introduction. Lineage A, B and E inhabiting coastline regions were immune from the expansion of Lineage C due to isolation from inland areas blocking gene flow between inland and coastal populations. On the other hand, Chinese swamp eels were revealed to be maintaining substantially differentiated population structures, while three populations from the Sichuan basin (MY, LC and YA) were genetically closely related. This was attributed to the geographical isolation of Sichuan populations from other populations, facilitating gene flow among the three populations from the Sichuan basin. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

84873541420	Ecological Genetics of Chinese Rhesus Macaque in Response to Mountain Building: All Things Are Not Equal	Background: Pliocene uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and Quaternary glaciation may have impacted the Asian biota more than any other events. Little is documented with respect to how the geological and climatological events influenced speciation as well as spatial and genetic structuring, especially in vertebrate endotherms. Macaca mulatta is the most widely distributed non-human primate. It may be the most suitable model to test hypotheses regarding the genetic consequences of orogenesis on an endotherm. Methodology and Principal Findings: Using a large dataset of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA gene sequences and nuclear microsatellite DNA data, we discovered two maternal super-haplogroups exist, one in western China and the other in eastern China. M. mulatta formed around 2.31 Ma (1.51-3.15, 95%), and divergence of the two major matrilines was estimated at 1.15 Ma (0.78-1.55, 95%). The western super-haplogroup exhibits significant geographic structure. In contrast, the eastern super-haplogroup has far greater haplotypic variability with little structure based on analyses of six variable microsatellite loci using STRUCTURE and GENELAND. Analysis using MIGRATE detected greater gene flow from WEST to EAST than vice versa. We did not detect signals of bottlenecking in most populations. Conclusions: Analyses of the nuclear and mitochondrial datasets obtained large differences in genetic patterns for M. mulatta. The difference likely reflects inheritance mechanisms of the maternally inherited mtDNA genome versus nuclear biparentally inherited STRs and male-mediated gene flow. Dramatic environmental changes may be responsible for shaping the matrilineal history of macaques. The timing of events, the formation of M. mulatta, and the divergence of the super-haplogroups, corresponds to both the uplifting of the QTP and Quaternary climatic oscillations. Orogenesis likely drove divergence of western populations in China, and Pleistocene glaciations are likely responsible for genetic structuring in the eastern super-haplogroup via geographic isolation and secondary contact. © 2013 Wu et al.

84875398429	In vitro and in vivo expression of virulence genes in Trueperella pyogenes based on a mouse model	Trueperella pyogenes is an important opportunistic pathogen causing a number of pyogenic infections in ruminants and other animals. This microorganism expresses several extracellular virulence proteins that contribute to its pathogenic potential. To investigate the expression levels of haemolytic exotoxin pyolysin, neuraminidases, collagen-binding protein and fimbriae of T. pyogenes in routine culture and infection process, 10 T. pyogenes isolates which simultaneously harbored ftsY, plo, cbpA, fimA, fimC, nanP, and nanH genes were injected into 10/group Kunming (KM) mice to determine their virulence. In vitro expressions of these genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Subsequently, three typical isolates including an avirulent, a moderately virulent and a strongly virulent isolate were respectively injected into mouse model to determine the in vivo expression of these genes. Finally, significant correlation was observed between collagen-binding protein, neuraminidases, and fimbriae. The expression level of pyolysin was negatively correlated with the survival of injected mice. The time course of virulence gene expression was monitored based on the expression of virulence genes in mouse model. In conclusion, the in vitro and in vivo gene expression study showed a clear difference in virulence gene expression between virulent and non-virulent isolates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84875827960	Virulence determinants and biofilm production among Trueperella pyogenes recovered from abscesses of captive forest musk deer	Trueperella pyogenes (formerly Arcanobacterium) is commonly isolated from domesticated or wild ruminants as an opportunistic pathogen. To investigate the role of virulence determinants (VDs) and biofilm production in T. pyogenes isolates, a total of 36 T. pyogenes were collected from abscesses of forest musk deer in Miyaluo Farm (Sichuan Province, China). The prevalence of VDs and associations with clonal types, antibiotic resistance and biofilm production were analyzed by PCR and bioassay. Finally, T. pyogenes isolates were separated into three clonal types based on the DNA fingerprinting of BOX-PCR. Isolates with less VDs obtained from sick forest musk deer were mainly belonged to Type 1, and the isolates with robust VD repertoire obtained from dead forest musk deer were included in Type 3. Accordingly, resistant isolates exhibited significant lower virulence than susceptible ones. Majority of T. pyogenes isolates of this study were capable of producing a biofilm. However, no VDs presence and antibiotic resistance were statistically associated with biofilm production. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that T. pyogenes was probably the primary pathogen of abscesses in the forest musk deer. Moreover, as an animal origin pathogen, the increasing resistance of T. pyogenes isolates could also associate with a decreased virulence. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84877576157	Targeting bax interaction sites reveals that only homo-oligomerization sites are essential for its activation	Bax is a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that has a central role in the initiation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, the mechanism of Bax activation during apoptosis remains unsettled. It is believed that the activation of Bax is mediated by either dissociation from prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, or direct association with BH3-only members. Several interaction sites on Bax that mediate its interactions with other Bcl-2 family members, as well as its proapoptotic activity, have been identified in previous studies by other groups. To rigorously investigate the functional role of these interaction sites, we knocked in their respective mutants using HCT116 colon cancer cells, in which apoptosis induced by several stimuli is strictly Bax-dependent. Bax-mediated apoptosis was intact upon knock-in (KI) of K21E and D33A, which were shown to block the interaction of Bax with BH3-only activators. Apoptosis was partially reduced by KI of D68R, which impairs the interaction of Bax with prosurvival members, and S184V, a constitutively mitochondria-targeting mutant. In contrast, apoptosis was largely suppressed by KI of L70A/D71A, which blocks homo-oligomerization of Bax and its binding to prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins. Collectively, our results suggest that the activation of endogenous Bax in HCT116 cells is dependent on its homo-oligomerization sites, but not those previously shown to interact with BH3-only activators or prosurvival proteins only. We therefore postulate that critical interaction sites yet to be identified, or mechanisms other than protein-protein interactions, need to be pursued to delineate the mechanism of Bax activation during apoptosis. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84878026779	The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Shrew Gymnure, Neotetracus sinensis	The Shrew Gymnure Neotetracus sinensis belongs to family Erinaceidae, and distributes in China, Myanmar, and northern Vietnam. In this study, the whole mitochondrial genome of N. sinensis was first sequenced and characterized. The genome is 16,982 bases in length. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods were used to construct phylogenetic trees based on 12 concatenated protein-coding genes on the heavy strand. Phylogenetic analyses further confirm the subfamily Galericinae diverged prior to the subfamily Erinaceinae, support the species N. sinensis was in distinct genus Neotetracus rather than Hylomys, and N. sinensis diverged later than Echinosorex gymnura. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

84880511331	A systems biology analysis of autophagy in cancer therapy	Autophagy, which degrades redundant or damaged cellular constituents, is intricately relevant to a variety of human diseases, most notably cancer. Autophagy exerts distinct effects on cancer initiation and progression, due to the intrinsic overlapping of autophagic and cancer signalling pathways. However, due to the complexity of cancer as a systemic disease, the fate of cancer cells is not decided by any one signalling pathway. Numerous autophagic inter-connectivity and cross-talk pathways need to be further clarified at a systems level. In this review, we propose a systems biology perspective for the comprehensive analysis of the autophagy-cancer network, focusing on systems biology analysis in autophagy and cancer therapy. Together, these analyses may not only improve our understanding on autophagy-cancer relationships, but also facilitate cancer drug discovery. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84880192000	Taxonomic position of Eothenomys wardi (Arvicolinae: Cricetidae) based on morphological and molecular analyses with a detailed description of the species	Ward's Red-backed Vole (Eothenomys wardi) is a rodent from the family Cricetidae. This endemic species occurs only in extreme northwestern Yunnan province, China in the Mekong and Salween river divide. It occupies steep cliffs at 2,800 to 4,250 m above sea level on the remote Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The validity of E. wardi is controversial and no specimens exist apart from the nominal series. In 2010, we collected 38 topotypes of E. wardi from Meri Snow Mountain. The results of our phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (cytb) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit one (COI) suggest that E. wardi is the sister group of E. custos, against its previously presumed sister species or conspecific species E. chinensis. In addition, seven out of 34 morphological characters differentiate E. wardi from other members of the genus Eothenomys. Therefore, we consider E. wardi to be a valid species and we provide its detailed morphological description. Copyright © 2013 Magnolia Press.

84880888122	Modeling, docking and dynamics simulations of a non-specific lipid transfer protein from Peganum harmala L.	Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (ns-LTPs), ubiquitously found in various types of plants, have been well-known to transfer amphiphilic lipids and promote the lipid exchange between mitochondria and microbody. In this study, an in silico analysis was proposed to study ns-LTP in Peganum harmala L., which may belong to ns-LTP1 family, aiming at constructing its three-dimensional structure. Moreover, we adopted MEGA to analyze ns-LTPs and other species phylogenetically, which brought out an initial sequence alignment of ns-LTPs. In addition, we used molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to further investigate the affinities and stabilities of ns-LTP with several ligands complexes. Taken together, our results about ns-LTPs and their ligand-binding activities can provide a better understanding of the lipid-protein interactions, indicating some future applications of ns-LTP-mediated transport. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84881317410	Social ordering of roosting by cooperative breeding buff-throated partridges Tetraophasis szechenyii	The benefits of communal roosting are unlikely to be acquired equally by all roosting birds, and it has been suggested that individual ordering during roost formation can be determined by factors such as social status. However, to date there have been no published data on this issue among precocial, cooperative breeders. We examined social ordering of roosting by buff-throated partridges Tetraophasis szechenyii, a typical cooperative breeding Galliform species newly found where group members roost in a linear huddle. We revealed that the breeding male was normally the first to enter roosting trees and a helper entered last, regardless of whether groups had young or not (n = 50 observations from seven groups). In a linear huddle, a helper frequently occupied the outermost position, especially in groups with young, and young birds were often squeezed into the center (n = 48 observations from seven groups). For buff-throated partridges, we suggest that while structuring of communal roosts confers the greatest energy benefits and protection from predators to young birds, helpers, rather than the breeding male, may face higher costs in terms of lookout and thermoregulation. To further understand social ordering of roosting by buff-throated partridges, future studies need to examine quantitatively the relative value of predation risk and/or thermoregulatory costs among roosting members placed in certain ordering, and determine the relatedness indices among group members. © 2013 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

84884275065	The complete mitochondrial genome of the Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster)	Though extensive efforts have been made to investigate the phylogeny of the Cetartiodactyla, the relationships within the Cetartiodactyla, especially the position of the family Moschidae among Ruminantia families, still remain controversial. To further clarify these relationships, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), which is an endemic endangered species from China. Then, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Alpine musk deer and 49 other species on the basis of Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. The results show that the Moschidae is the sister group of the Bovidae, both of which form a clade that clusters with the Cervidae. The cetaceans are nested within the Artiodactyla as the sister group of the Hippopotamidae. Among the musk deer, M. chrysogaster and M. berezovskii are more closely related to each other than to M. moschiferus. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

84890159252	Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles modulate host immune responses by targeting the toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway	Bacteria can naturally secrete outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as pathogenic factors, while these vesicles may also serve as immunologic regulators if appropriately prepared. However, it is largely unknown whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMVs can activate inflammatory responses and whether immunization with OMVs can provide immune protection against subsequent infection. We purified and identified OMVs, which were then used to infect lung epithelial cells in vitro as well as C57BL/6J mice to investigate the immune response and the underlying signaling pathway. The results showed that OMVs generated from P. aeruginosa wild-type strain PAO1 were more cytotoxic to alveolar epithelial cells than those from quorum-sensing (QS)-deficient strain PAO1-ΔlasR. The levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and IL-6, increased following OMV infection. Compared with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysed OMVs in which the membrane structures were broken induced a weak immune response. Furthermore, expression levels of TLR4-mediated responders (i.e., cytokines) were markedly downregulated by the TLR4 inhibitor E5564. Active immunization with OMVs or passive transfer of sera with a high cytokine quantity acquired from OMV-immunized mice could protect healthy mice against subsequent lethal PAO1 challenges (1.5×10

84895724692	Mitochondrial genetic diversity and population structure of a vulnerable freshwater fish, rock carp (Procypris rabaudi) in upper Yangtze River drainage	Rock carp (Procypris rabaudi (Tchang)) is an endemic species in the upper Yangtze River drainage. The genetic variability and population structure of eight populations (Mudong (MD), Hejiang (HJ), Wanzhou (WZ), Xishui (XS), Nantan (NT), Cangxi (CX), Tongjiang (TJ) and Wulong (WL)) were investigated based on mitochondrial DNA control region. According to the river dimensions, MD, HJ, WZ, WL and CX were defined as large river populations, while TJ, XS and NT were defined as small. The total genetic diversity level of rock carp was moderate (h=0.858, π=0.0079). Genetic differentiations among populations in small rivers were greater than those among populations in large rivers, and small rivers showed significant differentiation from large rivers. Analysis from the coalescent-based method showed that there were asymmetric gene flows among four large river populations (CX, HJ, MD and WZ). Demographic analyses suggested that the species as a whole and the WZ population experienced population expansion, while the HJ, NT, and MD populations experienced bottlenecks. The analysis of genetic diversity and population structure suggested that the WL, TJ, CX, NT and XS populations should be protected and managed separately, and that the HJ, MD and WZ populations should be considered as a genetic management unit. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84896770522	Taxonomic status of tetraophasis obscurus and tetraophasis szechenyii (Aves: Galliformes: Phasianidae) based on the complete mitochondrial genome	Tetraophasis szechenyii and T. obscurus are endangered phasianid birds endemic to China. Historically, the question of whether T. obscurus and T. szechenyii are valid species or subspecies has been controversial. In order to clarify their phylogenetic relationship, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of T. obscurus and, using the complete mitochondrial genome of T. szechenyii, which our lab had already sequenced, conducted Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of 12 concatenated heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes. Genetic distance and divergence time between the two species were also calculated. The complete mitochondrial genome of T. obscurus was 16,707 bases (accession no.: NC-018034), and its structure was similar to mitochondrial genomes reported for other phasianids. The genetic distance between T. obscurus and T. szechenyii was 0.028, and the divergence time of T. obscurus and T. szechenyii was 1.75 Myr. Considering the genetic distance and divergence time, as well as geographical distribution and morphological differences, we suggest that T. obscurus and T. szechenyii are two valid species. The Pleistocene glacial events in the Hengduan Mountains region may have played an important role in the speciation of T. obscurus and T. szechenyii. © 2014 Zoological Society of Japan.

84899740668	Complete mitogenome of Chinese shrew mole Uropsilus soricipes (Milne-Edwards, 1871) (Mammalia: Talpidae) and genetic structure of the species in the Jiajin Mountains (China)	The complete mitochondrial genome of the Chinese shrew mole, Uropsilus soricipes (Soricomorpha: Talpidae) was determined (GenBank accession no. JQ658979). The mitogenome is 16,575 base pairs and contains 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and one control region. Phylogenetic relationship analysis based on 12 concatenated protein-coding genes revealed that Uropsilus occupies a basal position within Talpidae, which is consistent with previous studies. Additionally, low nucleotide diversity (0.0028) and high haplotype diversity (0.936) of U. soricipes in the Jiajin Mountains and the neutrality test statistics (D=-1.59491, p=0.045; Fs=-4.171, p=0.016) suggest that this population experienced a demographic expansion at about 46,600 years ago. The phylogenetic analysis of the combined data (cytochrome b and D-loop) revealed two clades. Divergence of these clades occurred in the middle Pleistocene 0.986 million years ago. Mountains played a substantial role in shaping the geographical populations of this species. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

84899427293	Structural characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the rice leafroller, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)	The rice leafroller, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, is one of the most important pests on rice and possesses striking flight ability. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the 15,377 bp of a C. medinalis mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The mtDNA encodes 37 genes and shows a unique lepidopteran CR-M-I-Q arrangement. Three possible substructures were detected in C. medinalis and some other lepidopteran insects' control region. The findings might be relevant to the regulation of mtDNA replication and transcription. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed among 19 families in Lepidoptera so far. Cnaphalocrocis medinalis forms a reciprocal monophyletic group with Ostrinia in clade Crambidae instead of Pyralidae. The topology between Papilionoidea and other superfamilies showed an apparent contradiction with traditional Lepidopteran classification. As a well-known migratory insect, the molecular information contained in C. medinalis mtDNA may provide a further insight into the evolution of mitochondria genes and insect species, and may help to better understanding the energy metabolism of invertebrates. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

84901413625	Whole-genome sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (Macaca thibetana) provides new insight into the Macaque evolutionary history	Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus macaque (M. fascicularis, CE), both of which belong to the fascicularis group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (M. thibetana; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the sinica group. On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we identified approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further detected unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to detect putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were identified. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data. © 2014 The Author.

84902544526	Analysis of the phenolic compounds in root exudates produced by a subalpine coniferous species as responses to experimental warming and nitrogen fertilisation	In terrestrial ecosystems, plant root exudates clearly play a crucial role in the belowground ecosystem. However, there have been few reports on root exudates from field-grown plants or mature trees in situ, especially when exposed to experimental warming. In this study, we adopted and modified a culture-based cuvette system developed especially for root exudation collection in the field to collect soluble root exudates of a subalpine coniferous species, Abies faxoniana, under experimental warming and nitrogen fertilisation treatments. We then analysed the chemical composition and relative abundance of root exudates using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major chemical constituents of root exudates were phenols and their derivatives of all the different treatments, such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. Experimental warming had significant effects on the relative contents of major compounds and an increase effect on the total phenolic acid compounds. By contrast, there were small significant effects of N fertilisation on root exudation and no significant effects of the warming×N fertilisation interaction. Meanwhile, warming also markedly increased soil polyphenol oxidase activity and it may be soil ecological adjustment response to changes of root exudation under global climate warming. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

84904052302	Genes as early responders regulate quorum-sensing and control bacterial cooperation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Quorum-sensing (QS) allows bacterial communication to coordinate the production of extracellular products essential for population fitness at higher cell densities. It has been generally accepted that a significant time duration is required to reach appropriate cell density to activate the relevant quiescent genes encoding these costly but beneficial public goods. Which regulatory genes are involved and how these genes control bacterial communication at the early phases are largely unexplored. By determining time-dependent expression of QS-related genes of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aerugionsa, we show that the induction of social cooperation could be critically influenced by environmental factors to optimize the density of population. In particular, small regulatory RNAs (RsmY and RsmZ) serving as early responders, can promote the expression of dependent genes (e.g. lasR ) to boost the synthesis of intracellular enzymes and coordinate instant cooperative behavior in bacterial cells. These early responders, acting as a rheostat to finely modulate bacterial cooperation, which may be quickly activated under environment threats, but peter off when critical QS dependent genes are fully functional for cooperation. Our findings suggest that RsmY and RsmZ critically control the timing and levels of public goods production, which may have implications in sociomicrobiology and infection control. © 2014 Zhao et al.

84905457937	Hypoxia Adaptations in the Grey Wolf (Canis lupus chanco) from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	The Tibetan grey wolf (Canis lupus chanco) occupies habitats on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a high altitude (>3000 m) environment where low oxygen tension exerts unique selection pressure on individuals to adapt to hypoxic conditions. To identify genes involved in hypoxia adaptation, we generated complete genome sequences of nine Chinese wolves from high and low altitude populations at an average coverage of 25× coverage. We found that, beginning about 55,000 years ago, the highland Tibetan grey wolf suffered a more substantial population decline than lowland wolves. Positively selected hypoxia-related genes in highland wolves are enriched in the HIF signaling pathway (P = 1.57E-6), ATP binding (P = 5.62E-5), and response to an oxygen-containing compound (P≤5.30E-4). Of these positively selected hypoxia-related genes, three genes (EPAS1, ANGPT1, and RYR2) had at least one specific fixed non-synonymous SNP in highland wolves based on the nine genome data. Our re-sequencing studies on a large panel of individuals showed a frequency difference greater than 58% between highland and lowland wolves for these specific fixed non-synonymous SNPs and a high degree of LD surrounding the three genes, which imply strong selection. Past studies have shown that EPAS1 and ANGPT1 are important in the response to hypoxic stress, and RYR2 is involved in heart function. These three genes also exhibited significant signals of natural selection in high altitude human populations, which suggest similar evolutionary constraints on natural selection in wolves and humans of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. © 2014 Zhang et al.

84905463795	Dynamic change in spring habitat use by the brown eared pheasant (crossptilon mantchuricum) in the huanglong mountains, Yanan City, Shaanxi Province, China	Characterization of foraging-site preferences of threatened and endangered species is a key component of effective habitat conservation. We studied foraging-site selection by the brown eared pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum) in the Huanglongshan Nature Reserve, Yanan City, Shaanxi Province, China, from early February to end of May 2011. We identified feeding sites by locating tracks and scratches characteristic of the birds, and compared habitat characteristics at these sites to those at randomly selected sites across the study area. During the pre-breeding season, the birds tended to be found in the areas characterized by gullies within mixed forests with intermediate sun exposure on gentle slopes (< 10°), and close to water and footpaths. The sites utilized by the birds also featured greater tree diameter, lower shrub density, lower grass cover, and lower altitude than random sites. During the breeding season, the birds tended to be found in the areas of slightly higher altitude, more shrubs, moderately steep slopes (10°-20°), and farther from water and paths. These patterns were consistent with seasonal changes in vegetation and food-resource availability in the study area. Management of brown eared pheasants' populations for conservation must account for these seasonal shifts in habitat requirements. © 2014 Zoological Society of Japan.

84907310385	Habitat use of sichuan sika deer in forest, bush and meadows in the Tiebu Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China	Sichuan sika deer, Cervus nippon sichuanicus, is a threatened subspecies of sika deer distributed in the northern Minshan mountains on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Compared with other subspecies, Sichuan sika deer lives in a special environment which is composed of a mosaic of forest, bush, and meadow located between plateau meadows and alpine valleys. In order to get strategic information about the relationship of Sichuan sika deer and the environment, we conducted our study on habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in the Tiebu Nature Reserve from March to November 2011. Generalized Linear Mixed Models and an information-theoretic approach were used in our data analysis. Our results indicated that all three types of vegetation were necessary for Sichuan sika deer. In forest, Sichuan sika deer preferred the sites with a high density of herbs. In bush, Sichuan sika deer's occurrence was significantly correlated with greater distances from habitations and shorter distances to water. In meadows, Sichuan sika deer preferred the sites with gradual slopes and proximity to water. Water and disturbance could be treated as key factors that influence the habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in meadow and bush habitat. Food availability may affect the habitat use of Sichuan sika deer in forest and bush. Thus, protecting all three vegetation types is one of the important objectives for the conservation of the endangered Sichuan sika deer. Building some wooden water tanks in meadows and bush and controlling areas of human and livestock activity could increase the suitability of areas Sichuan sika deer need.
