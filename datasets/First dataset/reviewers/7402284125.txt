19544364153	High-efficiency protein expression mediated by enterovirus 71 internal ribosome entry site	An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has been used to facilitate the expression of more than one protein in a single transcript. In this study, we examined the translational activities of several IRES elements derived from different RNA viruses. The protein expression of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES is similar to that of hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES in mammalian cells. Notably, the protein expression of enterovirus 71 (EV71) IRES was 23-fold higher than the efficiency of EMCV IRES following normalization of mRNA transcriptional level. Thus, expression of the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter protein in mammalian cells may be controlled at desirable levels by using appropriate IRES in the expression vector. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

23044490251	Papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV): Expression, purification, characterization, and inhibition	Viral proteases are essential for pathogenesis and virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Little information is available on SARS-CoV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2), and development of inhibitors against PLP2 is attractive for antiviral therapy. Here, we report the characterization of SARS-CoV PLP2 (from residues 1414 to 1858) purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV PLP2 by itself differentially cleaves between the amino acids Gly180 and Ala181, Gly818 and Ala819, and Gly2740 and Lys2741 of the viral polypeptide pp1a, as determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis coupled with mass spectrometry. This protease is especially selective for the P1, P4, and P6 sites of the substrate. The study demonstrates, for the first time among coronaviral PLPs, that the reaction mechanism of SARS-CoV PLP2 is characteristic of papain and compatible with the involvement of the catalytic dyad (Cys)-S

HCV-positive serum was used to infect Huh-7 and 293 cells stably expressing Sip-L. Using the culture medium of the infected cells as an infection source, sequential viral passages were carried out in both cell lines.

25844448779	Inhibition of hepatitis C virus replication by antimonial compounds	Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a worldwide health problem causing serious complications, such as liver cirrhosis and hepatoma. Alpha interferon (IFN-α) or its polyethylene glycol-modified form combined with ribavirin is the only recommended therapy. However, an alternative therapy is needed due to the unsatisfactory cure rate of the IFN-based therapy. Using a modified reporter assay based on the HCV subgenomic-replicon system, we found that sodium stibogluconate (SSG), a compound used for leishmania treatment, suppressed HCV replication. We have previously reported that SSG is effective at inhibiting HCV replication in a cell line permissive for HCV infection/replication and in an ex vivo assay using fresh human liver slices obtained from patients infected with HCV (26). In this study, we show that the SSG 50% inhibitory dose for HCV replication is 0.2 to 0.3 mg/ml (equivalent to 345 to 517 μM of Sb) in the HCV subgenomic-replicon system. We also found that SSG and IFN-α exert a strong synergistic anti-HCV effect in both the traditional isobologram analysis and the median effect principle (CalcuSyn analysis). The combination of SSG and IFN-α could sustain the antiviral response better than SSG or IFN-α alone. The results suggest that SSG may be a good drug candidate for use in combination with other therapeutics, such as IFN-á and ribavirin, to treat HCV infection.

27144467123	High-throughput cell-based screening for hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease inhibitors	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes a viral protease, nonstructural (NS)3/4A, that is critical for virus maturation. Although NS3/4A has emerged as a promising target for anti-HCV drug discovery, no anti-HCV therapy has succeeded yet based on inhibition of NS3/4A. We have previously shown that EG(Δ4AB)SEAP, a reporter consisting of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EG), the NS3-NS4A protease decapeptide recognition sequence (Δ4AB), and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), is an efficient reporter for reflecting NS3/4A proteolytic activity inside cells. In this study, we describe the generation and characterization of a stable cell line, 293EEG(Δ4AB)SEAP-NS3/4A, which constitutively expresses EG(Δ4AB)SEAP reporter protein and NS3/4A protease. The reporter assay is validated with the compound BILN 2061, a specific and potent peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HCV NS3 protease. Additionally, we show here that this cell line allows screening for NS3/4A protease activity of living cells in 96-well plate format, with a Ζ factor >0.6. Thus, this cell-based assay may be used for high-throughput screening of chemical libraries. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

33646449916	Structure-based drug design of a novel family of PPARγ partial agonists: Virtual screening, X-ray crystallography, and in vitro/in vivo biological activities	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is well-known as the receptor of thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drugs. In this paper, we present a successful example of employing structure-based virtual screening, a method that combines shape-based database search with a docking study and analogue search, to discover a novel family of PPARγ agonists based upon pyrazol-5-ylbenzenesulfonamide. Two analogues in the family show high affinity for, and specificity to, PPARγ and act as partial agonists. They also demonstrate glucose-lowering efficacy in vivo. A structural biology study reveals that they both adopt a distinct binding mode and have no H-bonding interactions with PPARγ. The absence of H-bonding interaction with the protein provides an explanation why both function as partial agonists since most full agonists form conserved H-bonds with the activation function helix (AF-2 helix) which, in turn, enhances the recruitment of coactivators. Moreover, the structural biology and computer docking studies reveal the specificity of the compounds for PPARγ could be due to the restricted access to the binding pocket of other PPAR subtypes, i.e., PPARα and PPARδ, and steric hindrance upon the ligand binding. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33745775497	Antiviral drug discovery against SARS-CoV	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV. In the 2003 outbreak, it infected more than 8,000 people worldwide and claimed the lives of more than 900 victims. The high mortality rate resulted, at least in part, from the absence of definitive treatment protocols or therapeutic agents. Although the virus spreading has been contained, due preparedness and planning, including the successful development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV, is necessary for possible reappearance of SARS. In this review, we have discussed currently available strategies for antiviral drug discovery and how these technologies have been utilized to identify potential antiviral agents for the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. Moreover, progress in the drug development based on different molecular targets is also summarized, including 1) Compounds that block the S protein-ACE2-mediated viral entry; 2) Compounds targeting SARS-CoV M

In the present study, we repressed the expression of Sf-caspase-1 in Sf9 (S. frugiperda 9) cells using constitutive RNA interference, and evaluated the effects of stress responses and the production of proteins in recombinant baculovirus-infected cells. The Sf-caspase-1-repressed stable cells, Sf9/p1BdsCasp-1 and Sf9/p1BdsCasp-2, showed a significant increase in resistance to UV- and baculovirus-induced apoptosis. These cells produced higher levels of both intracellular (luciferase) and extracellular [SEAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase)] recombinant proteins than the parental cells when infected with recombinant baculovirus. Thus Sf-caspase-1-repressed stable cells have a greater ability to adapt to various culture conditions, and also to provide the benefits of high-level protein production. © 2007 Portland Press Ltd.

36949001617	Strategies of development of antiviral agents directed against influenza virus replication	In this review, we will discuss drug design based on proven and potential anti-influenza drug targets including viral hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), M2 ion channel, 3P polymerase complex, and host factors such as kinases. We have summarized influenza inhibitors based on their mode of actions. For instance, included are descriptions of (1) inhibitors of HA cleavage, such as nafamostat, camostat, gabexate, epsilon-aminocapronic acid and aprotinin, (2) inhibitors of fusion and entry, such as benzoquinones and hydroquinones, CL 385319, BMY-27709, stachyflin, and their analogues, (3) inhibitors of viral RNPs/ polymerase/endonuclease, such as T-705, L-735,822, flutimide and their analogues, (4) inhibitors of MEK, such as PD 0325901, CI-1040 and ARRY-142886, and (5) inhibitors of NA such as DANA, FANA, zanamivir, and oseltamivir, etc. Although amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended for treating influenza virus infections because of drug resistance problem, these viral M2 ion channel blockers established a proof-of-concept that the endocytosis of virion into host cells can be a valid drug target because M2 protein is involved in the endocytosis process. The influenza polymerase complex not only catalyzes RNA polymerization but also encodes the "cap snatching" activity. After being exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the newly synthesized vRNPs are assembled into virions at the plasma membrane. The progeny virions will then leave the host cells through the action of NA. The strategies for discovery of small molecule inhibitors of influenza virus replication based on each particular mechanism will be discussed. Finally, the lessons learned from the design of NA inhibitors (NAI) are also included. Many exciting opportunities await the cadre of virologists, medicinal chemists, and pharmacologists to design novel influenza drugs with favorable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties to combat this threatening infectious disease. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

On the basis of structural biology observations, the hit 1a was modified to better fit the back pocket, producing the potent Aurora inhibitor 3 with submicromolar antiproliferative activity in HCT-116 colon cancer cell line. On the basis of docking studies with EGFR hit 1s, introduction of acrylamide Michael acceptor group led to 8, which inhibited both the wild and mutant EGFR kinase and also showed antiproliferative activity in HCC827 lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, the X-ray cocrystal study of 3 and 8 in complex with Aurora and EGFR, respectively, confirmed their hypothesized binding modes. Library construction, in situ screening, and structure-based drug design (SBDD) strategy described here could be applied for the lead identification of other kinases. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

84877811521	Discovery of 3-phenyl-1H-5-pyrazolylamine derivatives containing a urea pharmacophore as potent and efficacious inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)	Preclinical investigations and early clinical trials suggest that FLT3 inhibitors are a viable therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. However, early clinical data have been underwhelming due to incomplete inhibition of FLT3. We have developed 3-phenyl-1H-5-pyrazolylamine as an efficient template for kinase inhibitors. Structure-activity relationships led to the discovery of sulfonamide, carbamate and urea series of FLT3 inhibitors. Previous studies showed that the sulfonamide 4 and carbamate 5 series were potent and selective FLT3 inhibitors with good in vivo efficacy. Herein, we describe the urea series, which we found to be potent inhibitors of FLT3 and VEGFR2. Some inhibited growth of FLT3-mutated MOLM-13 cells more strongly than the FLT3 inhibitors sorafenib (2) and ABT-869 (3). In preliminary in vivo toxicity studies of the four most active compounds, 10f was found to be the least toxic. A further in vivo efficacy study demonstrated that 10f achieved complete tumor regression in a higher proportion of MOLM-13 xenograft mice than 4 and 5 (70% vs 10% and 40%). These results show that compound 10f possesses improved pharmacologic and selectivity profiles and could be more effective than previously disclosed FLT3 inhibitors in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84877317722	Aurora kinase inhibitors reveal mechanisms of HURP in nucleation of centrosomal and kinetochore microtubules	The overexpression of Aurora kinases in multiple tumors makes these kinases appealing targets for the development of anticancer therapies. This study identified two small molecules with a furanopyrimidine core, IBPR001 and IBPR002, that target Aurora kinases and induce a DFG conformation change at the ATP site of Aurora A. Our results demonstrate the high potency of the IBPR compounds in reducing tumorigenesis in a colorectal cancer xenograft model in athymic nude mice. Human hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP) is a substrate of Aurora kinase A, which plays a crucial role in the stabilization of kinetochore fibers. This study used the IBPR compounds as well as MLN8237, a proven Aurora A inhibitor, as chemical probes to investigate the molecular role of HURP in mitotic spindle formation. These compounds effectively eliminated HURP phosphorylation, thereby revealing the coexistence and continuous cycling of HURP between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms that are associated, respectively, with microtubules emanating from centrosomes and kinetochores. Furthermore, these compounds demonstrate a spatial hierarchical preference for HURP in the attachment of microtubules extending from the mother to the daughter centrosome. The finding of inequality in the centrosomal microtubules revealed by these small molecules provides a versatile tool for the discovery of new cell-division molecules for the development of antitumor drugs.

43049098940	A cell-based high-throughput screen for epidermal growth factor receptor pathway inhibitors	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a valid drug target for development of target-based therapeutics against non-small-cell lung cancer. In this study, we established a high-throughput cell-based assay to screen for compounds that may inhibit EGFR activation and/or EGFR-mediated downstream signaling pathway. This drug screening platform is based on the characterization of an EGFR-transfected 32D cell line (32D-EGFR). The expression of EGFR in 32D cells allowed cell proliferation in the presence of either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or interleukin 3 (IL-3) and provided a system for both screening and counterscreening of EGFR pathway-inhibitory compounds. After the completion of primary and secondary screenings in which 32D-EGFR cells were grown under the stimulation of either EGF or IL-3, 9 of 20,000 compounds were found to selectively inhibit the EGF-dependent proliferation, but not the IL-3-dependent proliferation, of 32D-EGFR cells. Subsequent analysis showed that 3 compounds of the 9 initial hits directly inhibited the kinase activity of recombinant EGFR in vitro and the phosphorylation of EGFR in H1299 cells transfected with EGFR. Thus, this 32D-EGFR assay system provides a promising approach for identifying novel EGFR and EGFR signaling pathway inhibitors with potential antitumor activity. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

PPARs are widely recognized as the molecular drug targets for many diseases including hyperglycemia, diabetes, obesity and cancer. Two independent bioassays were developed. The first is the scintillation proximity assay, a ligand binding assay. The other is the cell-based transcriptional activation assay which uses the Dual-Luciferase® reporter system as the reporter gene under the control of the PPAR response element. Using these two assays, a PPARγ-active fraction, CE 3-3, was obtained from C. sorokiniana extracts, which was also able to activate PPARα-mediated gene expression. To elucidate the active ingredients in the CE 3-3 fraction, GC-MS analysis was employed. The results showed that the CE 3-3 fraction consisted of at least ten fatty acids (FAs). The bioactivities of several of the individual FAs were evaluated for their PPARγ activity and the results showed that linolenic acid and linoleic acid were the most potent FAs tested. Our studies indicate that Chlorella sorokiniana could have potential health benefits through the dual activation of PPARα/γ via its unique FA constituents. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

48649105986	Design, synthesis, and evaluation of 3C protease inhibitors as anti-enterovirus 71 agents	Human enterovirus (EV) belongs to the picornavirus family, which consists of over 200 medically relevant viruses. A peptidomimetic inhibitor AG7088 was developed to inhibit the 3C protease of rhinovirus (a member of the family), a chymotrypsin-like protease required for viral replication, by forming a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue. In this study, we have prepared the recombinant 3C protease from EV71 (TW/2231/98), a particular strain which causes severe outbreaks in Asia, and developed inhibitors against the protease and the viral replication. For inhibitor design, the P3 group of AG7088, which is not interacting with the rhinovirus protease, was replaced with a series of cinnamoyl derivatives directly linked to P2 group through an amide bond to simplify the synthesis. While the replacement caused decreased potency, the activity can be largely improved by substituting the α,β-unsaturated ester with an aldehyde at the P1′ position. The best inhibitor 10b showed EC

Mana-Hox is a synthetic derivative of β-carboline, a structure relevant to marine sponge component, manzamine. In this study, Mana-Hox induced an inhibition of cell proliferation in several types of human cancer cell lines, including androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 and DU-145, hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B and HepG2, and colorectal cancer HT-29 cells. The p53-null PC-3 cells were used for to anticancer mechanisms. Mana-Hox stimulated an increase of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylation on Ser-1981, indicating the induction of DNA double-strand breaks. It also displayed an inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization using tubulin turbidity assay and immunofluorescence identification. However, it only showed a minor inhibition on the activity of Aurora kinase and histone deacetylase. Mana-Hox induced mitotic arrest of the cell cycle identified by downregulation of cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and an increase of MPM-2 expression. Next, it caused Bcl-2 phosphorylation on Ser-70, downregulation of Mcl-1 expression, and activation of caspase-3, leading to apoptotic cell death. Notably, Mana-Hox was not a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate and showed equipotent activity against P-gp-rich cancer cells. We conclude that Mana-Hox induces dual effects on DNA damage and tubulin depolymerization, leading to mitotic arrest and activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways. Data provide evidence that the anticancer strategy of dual-action targets could be a potential anticancer approach. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

67649997343	Novel antiviral agent DTriP-22 targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of enterovirus 71	Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as an important virulent neurotropic enterovirus in young children. DTriP-22 (4{4-[(2-bromo-phenyl)-(3-methyl- thiophen-2-yl)-methyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-1-pheny-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) was found to be a novel and potent inhibitor of EV71. The molecular target of this compound was identified by analyzing DTriP-22-resistant viruses. A substitution of lysine for Arg163 in EV71 3D polymerase rendered the virus drug resistant. DTriP-22 exhibited the ability to inhibit viral replication by reducing viral RNA accumulation. The compound suppressed the accumulated levels of both positive- and negative-stranded viral RNA during virus infection. An in vitro polymerase assay indicated that DTriP-22 inhibited the poly(U) elongation activity, but not the VPg uridylylation activity, of EV71 polymerase. These findings demonstrate that the nonnucleoside analogue DTriP-22 acts as a novel inhibitor of EV71 polymerase. DTriP-22 also exhibited a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against other picornaviruses, which highlights its potential in the development of antiviral agents.

70350315082	Development of NS3/4A protease-based reporter assay suitable for efficiently assessing hepatitis C virus infection	A cell culture system for the production of hepatitis C virus (HCV) whole virions has greatly accelerated studies of the virus life cycle and the discovery of anti-HCV agents. However, the quantification of the HCV titers in a whole-virus infection/replication system currently relies mostly on reverse transcription-PCR or immunofluorescence assay, which would be cumbersome for high-throughput drug screening. To overcome this problem, this study has generated a novel cell line, Huh7.5-EG(Δ4B5A)SEAP, that carries a dual reporter, EG(Δ4B5A)SEAP. The EG(Δ4B5A)SEAP reporter is a viral protease-cleavable fusion protein in which the enhanced green fluorescence protein is linked to secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) in frame via Δ4B5A, a short peptide cleavage substrate for NS3/4A viral protease. This study demonstrates that virus replication/infection in the Huh7.5- EG(Δ4B5A)SEAP cells can be quantitatively indicated by measuring the SEAP activity in cell culture medium. The levels of SEAP released from HCV-infected Huh7.5-EG(Δ4B5A)SEAP cells correlated closely with the amounts of HCV in the inocula. The Huh7.5-EG(Δ4B5A)SEAP cells were also shown to be a suitable host for the discovery of anti-HCV inhibitors by using known compounds that target multiple stages of the HCV life cycle. The Z′-factor of this assay ranged from 0.64 to 0.74 in 96-well plates, indicating that this reporter system is suitable for high-throughput screening of prospective anti-HCV agents.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) on EV71 replication and to explore the underlying mechanism. Methods: To measure the activity of ATA in inhibiting the cytopathic effect (CPE) of EV71, a cell-based neutralization (inhibition of virus-induced CPE) assay was performed. The effect of ATA was further confirmed using plaque reduction and viral yield reduction assays. A time of addition assay was performed to identify the mechanisms of ATA's anti-EV71 activity. We examined the effects of ATA on the following key steps involved in virus replication: (i) translation of the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated viral polyprotein; (ii) the proteolytic activity of viral proteases 2A and/or 3C; and (iii) the viral 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. Results: In this study, ATA was found to be a potent inhibitor of the replication of EV71. In the antiviral neutralization assay, ATA exhibited inhibitory activity against EV71 (TW/4643/98) and EV71 (TW/2231/98). Plaque assay further demonstrated that ATA inhibited EV71 replication with an EC.

79955592737	Suppression of Stat3 activity sensitizes gefitinib-resistant non small cell lung cancer cells	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a proven therapeutic target to treat a small subset of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating mutations within the EGFR gene. However, many NSCLC patients are not sensitive to EGFR inhibitors, suggesting that other factors are implicated in survival of NSCLC cells. Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) function as transcription factor to mediate cell survival and differentiation and the dysregulation of Stat3 has been discovered in a number of cancers. In this study, we found that a small molecule, reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis (RITA), showed anti-cancer activity against gefitinib-resistant H1650 cells through a p53-independent pathway. Stat3 suppression by RITA attracted our attention to investigate the role of Stat3 in sustaining survival of H1650 cells. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were employed to down-regulate Stat3 in H1650 cells. WP1066, a known Stat3 inhibitor, was shown to exhibit inhibitory effect on the growth of H1650 cells. Meanwhile, apoptosis activation by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Stat3 in H1650 cells provides more direct evidence for the involvement of Stat3 in viability maintenance of H1650 cells. Moreover, as a novel identified Stat3 inhibitor, RITA increased doxorubicin sensitivity of H1650 cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that doxorubicin accompanied with Stat3 inhibitors may be considered as an alternative strategy to treat NSCLC patients who have inherent resistance to doxorubicin. Overall, our observations reveal that targeting Stat3 may be an effective treatment for certain NSCLC cells with oncogenic addition to Stat3. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

79959956358	Discovery and evaluation of 3-phenyl-1H-5-pyrazolylamine-based derivatives as potent, selective and efficacious inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)	Preclinical investigations and early clinical trial studies suggest that FLT3 inhibitors offer a viable therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. However, early clinical data for direct FLT3 inhibitors provided only modest results because of the failure to fully inhibit FLT3. We have designed and synthesized a novel class of 3-phenyl-1H-5-pyrazolylamine-derived compounds as FLT3 inhibitors which exhibit potent FLT3 inhibition and high selectivity toward different receptor tyrosine kinases. The structure-activity relationships led to the discovery of two series of FLT3 inhibitors, and some potent compounds within these two series exhibited comparable potency to FLT3 inhibitors sorafenib (3) and ABT-869 (4) in both wt-FLT3 enzyme inhibition and FLT3-ITD inhibition on cell growth (MOLM-13 and MV4;11 cells). In particular, the selected compound 12a exhibited the ability to regress tumors in mouse xenograft models using MOLM-13 and MV4;11 cells. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

80054029537	Development of a whole-cell screening system for evaluation of the human CYP1A2-mediated metabolism	Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is an important member of cytochrome P450 involved in drug metabolism. In this study, a cell line, Huh7-1A2-I-E, with high expression level of CYP1A2 is established based on Huh7 cells. To achieve this, we constructed a recombinant lentiviral vector, pLenti-1A2-I-E, containing a single promoter encoding CYP1A2 followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to permit the translation of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). Such a design has greatly facilitated the selection of stable cell lines because the translations of CYP1A2 and EGFP proteins would be based on a single bi-cistronic mRNA. The Huh7-1A2-I-E cells were evaluated as a cell-based model for identification of CYP1A2 inhibitors and for studies of cytotoxicity resulted from CYP-mediated drug metabolism. Treatment of Huh7-1A2-I-E cells and the Huh7-E control cells with aflatoxin B1 showed that cells with CYP1A2 expression are much more sensitive to aflatoxin B1 and the cellular toxicity of aflatoxin B1 in Huh7-1A2-I-E cells could be prevented by furafylline, a CYP1A2 inhibitor. A collection of approximately 200 drugs were screened using this system and results indicate that for most drugs the metabolism by CYP1A2 is unlikely to have made a major contribution to the in vitro cytotoxicity except for thimerosal and evoxine. Several previously unidentified CYP1A2 inhibitors such as evoxine and berberine were also identified in this study. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84856409052	BPR1J-097, a novel FLT3 kinase inhibitor, exerts potent inhibitory activity against AML	Background: Activating mutations of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) constitute a major driver in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Hence, pharmacological inhibitors of FLT3 are of therapeutic interest for AML.Methods: The effects of inhibition of FLT3 activity by a novel potent FLT3 inhibitor, BPR1J-097, were investigated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of BPR1J-097 required to inhibit FLT3 kinase activity ranged from 1 to 10 nM, and the 50% growth inhibition concentrations (GC 50 s) were 217 and 4614 nM for MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cells, respectively. BPR1J-097 inhibited FLT3/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 phosphorylation and triggered apoptosis in FLT3-driven AML cells. BPR1J-097 also showed favourable pharmacokinetic property and pronounced dose-dependent tumour growth inhibition and regression in FLT3-driven AML murine xenograft models. Conclusion: These results indicate that BPR1J-097 is a novel small molecule FLT-3 inhibitor with promising in vivo anti-tumour activities and suggest that BPR1J-097 may be further developed in preclinical and clinical studies as therapeutics in AML treatments. © 2012 Cancer Research UK.

84862780685	EGFR and myosin II inhibitors cooperate to suppress EGFR-T790M-mutant NSCLC cells	An acquired mutation (T790M) in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) accounts for half of all relapses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who initially respond to EGFR kinase inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that EGFR-T790M interacts with the cytoskeletal components, myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) and β-actin, in the nucleus of H1975 cells carrying the T790M-mutant EGFR. The interactions of EGFR with MYH9 and β-actin were reduced in the presence of blebbistatin, a specific inhibitor for the MYH9-β-actin interaction, suggesting that the EGFR interaction with MYH9 and β-actin is affected by the integrity of the cytoskeleton. These physical interactions among MYH9, β-actin, and EGFR were also impaired by CL-387,785, a kinase inhibitor for EGFR-T790M. Furthermore, CL-387,785 and blebbistatin interacted in a synergistic fashion to suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in H1975 cells. The combination of CL-387,785 and blebbistatin enhanced the down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (. COX-2), a transcriptional target of nuclear EGFR. Overall, our findings demonstrate that disrupting EGFR interactions with the cytoskeletal components enhanced the anti-cancer effects of CL-387,785 against H1975 cells, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for NSCLC cells that express the drug-resistant EGFR-T790M. © 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

84862908885	Identification of BPR3P0128 as an inhibitor of cap-snatching activities of influenza virus	The aim of this study was to identify the antiviral mechanism of a novel compound, BPR3P0128. From a large-scale screening of a library of small compounds, BPR3P compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of influenza viral replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. BPR3P0128 exhibited inhibitory activity against both influenza A and B viruses. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were in the range of 51 to 190 nM in MDCK cells, as measured by inhibition-of-cytopathic-effect assays. BPR3P0128 appeared to target the viral replication cycle but had no effect on viral adsorption. The inhibition of capdependent mRNA transcription by BPR3P0128 was more prominent with a concurrent increase in cap-independent cRNA replication in a primer extension assay, suggesting a role of BPR3P0128 in switching transcription to replication. This reduction in mRNA expression resulted from the BPR3P-mediated inhibition of the cap-dependent endoribonuclease (cap-snatching) activities of nuclear extracts containing the influenza virus polymerase complex. No inhibition of binding of 5′ viral RNA to the viral polymerase complex by this compound was detected. BPR3P0128 also effectively inhibited other RNA viruses, such as enterovirus 71 and human rhinovirus, but not DNA viruses, suggesting that BPR3P0128 targets a cellular factor(s) associated with viral PB2 cap-snatching activity. The identification of this factor(s) could help redefine the regulation of viral transcription and replication and thereby provide a potential target for antiviral chemotherapeutics.

84862937281	A high-throughput cell-based screening for L858R/T790M mutant epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors	A high-throughput 32D(L858R/T790M) cell-based assay to identify inhibitors of the L858R/T790M mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway was established. After screening, ten hits from among 60,000 compounds in our in-house compound library were initially identified. In the secondary assays, one hit, 1-[2-(decyloxy)-2-oxoethyl]-3-methyl-2-[(4-methylphenoxy) methyl]-1H-benzimidazol-3-ium, was confirmed to directly inhibit the kinase activity of recombinant L858RIT790M EGFR and the phosphorylation of EGFR-L858R/T790M in gefitinib-resistant H1975 cells. Thus, this high-throughput assay system may be useful for identifying novel inhibitors which suppress mutant EGFR-T790M signalling and for overcoming T790M-mediated acquired resistance for future anticancer drug discovery.

84864614780	Development of an anti-influenza drug screening assay targeting nucleoproteins with tryptophan fluorescence quenching	Recent studies have shown that NP (nucleoprotein), which possesses multiple functions in the viral life cycle, is a new potential anti-influenza drug target. NP inhibitors reliably induce conformational changes in NPs, and these changes may confer inhibition of the influenza virus. The six conserved tryptophan residues in NP can be used as an intrinsic probe to monitor the change in fluorescence of the tryptophan residues in the protein upon binding to an NP inhibitor. In the present study, we found that the fluorescence of recombinant NP proteins was quenched following the binding of available NP inhibitors (such as nucleozin) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which suggests that the inhibitor induced conformational changes in the NPs. The minimal fluorescence-quenching effect and weak binding constant of nucleozin to the swine-origin influenza virus H1N1pdm09 (SOIV) NP revealed that the SOIV is resistant to nucleozin. We have used the fluorescence-quenching property of tryptophans in NPs that were bound to ligands in a 96-well-plate-based drug screen to assess the ability of promising small molecules to interact with NPs and have identified one new anti-influenza drug, CSV0C001018, with a high SI value. This convenient method for drug screening may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs that target viruses other than the influenza virus, such as HIV and HBV. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

0037447831	Development of a cell-based assay for monitoring specific hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease activity in mammalian cells	The hepatitis C virus (HCV) contains a positive-sense RNA genome that encodes a unique polyprotein precursor, which must be processed by proteases to enable viral maturation. Virally encoded NS3/4A protease has thus become an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. To establish an assay system for monitoring NS3/4A protease activity in mammalian cells, this study describes a substrate vector, pEG(Δ4AB)SEAP, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused to secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) through the NS3/4A protease decapeptide recognition sequence, Δ4AB, which spans the NS4A and NS4B junction region. Secretion of SEAP into the culture medium was demonstrated to depend on the cleavage of Δ4AB by HCV NS3/4A protease. We demonstrated that the accumulation of SEAP activity in the culture medium depends on time up to 60h with the coexpression of active NS3/4A protease. The amount of SEAP in the culture medium was around 10 times greater than that of cells with coexpression of inactive NS3/4A mutant protease. This strategy has made it possible to monitor NS3/4A activity inside mammalian cells. Moreover, by using cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicon, the EG(Δ4AB)SEAP reporter can be used to detect the anti-HCV activity of interferon-α (IFN-α). Consequently, this EG(Δ4AB)SEAP reporter can be used to screen for NS3/4A protease inhibitors in the cellular environment and for anti-HCV drugs in replicon cells. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

84868324450	Enhanced recombinant protein production and differential expression of molecular chaperones in sf-caspase-1-repressed stable cells after baculovirus infection	Background: There are few studies that have examined the potential of RNA inference (RNAi) to increase protein production in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) (Sf)-caspase-1-repressed stable cells exhibit resistance to apoptosis and enhancement of recombinant protein production. However, the mechanism of recombinant protein augmentation in baculovirus-infected Caspase-repressed insect cells has not been elucidated.Results: In the current study, we utilized RNAi-mediated Sf-caspase-1-repressed stable cells to clarify how the resistance to apoptosis can enhance both intracellular (firefly luciferase) and extracellular (secreted alkaline phosphatase [SEAP]) recombinant protein production in BEVS. Since the expression of molecular chaperones is strongly associated with the maximal production of exogenous proteins in BEVS, the differential expression of molecular chaperones in baculovirus-infected stable cells was also analyzed in this study.Conclusion: The data indicated that the retention of expression of molecular chaperones in baculovirus-infected Sf-caspase-1-repressed stable cells give the higher recombinant protein accumulation. © 2012 Lai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84874225444	Parallel Screening of Wild-Type and Drug-Resistant Targets for Anti-Resistance Neuraminidase Inhibitors	Infection with influenza virus is a major public health problem, causing serious illness and death each year. Emergence of drug-resistant influenza virus strains limits the effectiveness of drug treatment. Importantly, a dual H275Y/I223R mutation detected in the pandemic influenza A 2009 virus strain results in multidrug resistance to current neuraminidase (NA) drugs. Therefore, discovery of new agents for treating multiple drug-resistant (MDR) influenza virus infections is important. Here, we propose a parallel screening strategy that simultaneously screens wild-type (WT) and MDR NAs, and identifies inhibitors matching the subsite characteristics of both NA-binding sites. These may maintain their potency when drug-resistant mutations arise. Initially, we analyzed the subsite of the dual H275Y/I223R NA mutant. Analysis of the site-moiety maps of NA protein structures show that the mutant subsite has a relatively small volume and is highly polar compared with the WT subsite. Moreover, the mutant subsite has a high preference for forming hydrogen-bonding interactions with polar moieties. These changes may drive multidrug resistance. Using this strategy, we identified a new inhibitor, Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RB19, an anthraquinone dye), which inhibited WT NA and MDR NA with IC

84876981036	A novel Aurora-A inhibitor, BPR1K0609S1, sensitizes colorectal tumor cells to 5-fluorofracil (5-FU) treatment	Small synthetic compounds have been implicated in treatment of human cancers. We have synthesized a small compound, BPR1K0609S1 (hereafter, BP), which inhibits Aurora-A kinase. In the present study, we studied the mechanism of BP suppression of tumorigenesis induced by Aurora-A. Given our previous results that inactivation of p53 accelerates MMTV-Aurora-A-mediated tumorigenesis in vivo, we studied the roles of p53 pathway using the isogenic human colon carcinoma cell lines of HCT116, in which p53, Puma, Bax, p21 or Chk2 is deleted. When these isogenic cell lines are treated with BP for 48 h, accumulation of G2M phase and aneuploidy are commonly observed, and HCT116 p21(-) cells show increase in apoptosis. In xenograft assay, s.c. injection of BP efficiently inhibits tumorigenesis of HCT116 deficient for Chk2 or p21. Re-transplantation of BP-resistant tumors indicates that these resistant cells do not acquire advanced tumor growth. Significantly, 5-FU (5-fluorouracil) treatment further induces apoptosis of BP-resistant HCT116 deficient for Chk2 or Puma. These results demonstrate that p21 deficiency enhances BP-mediated suppression of tumor growth, and that BP and 5-FU can collaborate for tumor regression. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84878095831	Protein kinase inhibitor design by targeting the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif: The role of the DFG motif in the design of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors	The Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif plays an important role in the regulation of kinase activity. Structure-based drug design was performed to design compounds able to interact with the DFG motif; epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was selected as an example. Structural insights obtained from the EGFR/2a complex suggested that an extension from the meta-position on the phenyl group (ring-5) would improve interactions with the DFG motif. Indeed, introduction of an N,N-dimethylamino tail resulted in 4b, which showed almost 50-fold improvement in inhibition compared to 2a. Structural studies confirmed this N,N-dimethylamino tail moved toward the DFG motif to form a salt bridge with the side chain of Asp831. That the interactions with the DFG motif greatly contribute to the potency of 4b is strongly evidenced by synthesizing and testing compounds 2a, 3g, and 4f: when the charge interactions are absent, the inhibitory activity decreased significantly. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84880175303	Optimization of ligand and lipophilic efficiency to identify an in vivo active furano-pyrimidine aurora kinase inhibitor	Ligand efficiency (LE) and lipophilic efficiency (LipE) are two important indicators of "drug-likeness", which are dependent on the molecule's activity and physicochemical properties. We recently reported a furano-pyrimidine Aurora kinase inhibitor 4 (LE = 0.25; LipE = 1.75), with potent activity in vitro; however, 4 was inactive in vivo. On the basis of insights obtained from the X-ray co-crystal structure of the lead 4, various solubilizing functional groups were introduced to optimize both the activity and physicochemical properties. Emphasis was placed on identifying potential leads with improved activity as well as better LE and LipE by exercising tight control over the molecular weight and lipophilicity of the molecules. Rational optimization has led to the identification of Aurora kinase inhibitor 27 (IBPR001; LE = 0.26; LipE = 4.78), with improved in vitro potency and physicochemical properties, resulting in an in vivo active (HCT-116 colon cancer xenograft mouse model) anticancer agent. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84884309937	Evolutionarily conserved residues at an oligomerization interface of the influenza A virus neuraminidase are essential for viral survival	Neuraminidase (NA) is a homotetramer viral surface glycoprotein that is essential for virus release during influenza virus infections. Previous studies have not explored why influenza NA forms a tetramer when the bacterial monomer NA already exhibits excellent NA enzymatic activity levels. In this study, we focused on 28 highly conserved residues among all NA subtypes, identifying 21 of 28 positions as crucial residues for viral survival by using reverse genetics. Maintaining NA enzymatic activity levels is critical and numerous conserved residues were located at the oligomerization interface; however, these mutations did not affect NA enzymatic activity levels or NA cellular localization, but rather affected the stability of NA oligomerization, suggesting that the oligomerization of NA is essential for viral viability. An increased understanding of the biological functions of NA, in particular NA oligomerization, could facilitate an alternative design for antivirals to combat influenza virus infections. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

0141682001	Inhibition of authentic hepatitis C virus replication by sodium stibogluconate	Using a hepatitis C virus (HCV) subgenomic RNA replicon system, drugs currently being used to treat other human diseases were examined for their antiviral activities against HCV. Several drugs including sodium stibogluconate, a compound used to treat leishmaniasis, were capable of suppressing replication of HCV replicon. The antiviral effect of sodium stibogluconate was subsequently verified using a cell line (293EBNA-Sip-L) previously proved to be permissive for HCV infection/replication. An ex vivo assay using fresh human liver slices established and a panel of human liver slices was obtained from biopsy samples of patients infected with HCV was used to examine the antiviral activity of this drug. A nearly complete suppression effect was achieved in four of six human liver slices at the drug concentration of 100μg/ml, lower than what was required to treat leishmaniasis. A human trial is mandatory to understand its clinical value in treating chronic hepatitis C. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0346096567	A reporter-based assay for identifying hepatitis C virus inhibitors based on subgenomic replicon cells	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes a polyprotein that needs to be processed proteolytically by cellular and viral proteases into mature functional proteins. One of the viral proteins, NS3/4A, has serine protease activity that is critical for virus maturation. The generation and characterization of an engineered HCV replicon cell line (Ava5) is described which constitutively expresses EG(Δ4AB)SEAP reporter protein and the cell line was designated as Ava5-EG(Δ4AB)SEAP. EG(Δ4AB)SEAP is a fusion protein in which Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) was fused to SEcreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) through the NS3/4A protease decapeptide recognition sequence, Δ4AB, which spans the NS4A and NS4B junction region. The secretion of SEAP into culture medium has been shown to depend on the cleavage of Δ4AB by HCV NS3/4A protease. It is demonstrated that the amount of NS3/4A in Ava5-EG(Δ4AB)SEAP cells correlated well with the copy numbers of HCV subgenomic RNA. It is also shown that replication of HCV subgenomic RNA inside cells is reflected by the alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) levels in culture medium. SEAP activity in the culture medium of Ava5-EG(Δ4AB)SEAP was approximately 50-fold higher than the parental Ava5 cells. Ava5-EG(Δ4AB) SEAP was validated as a drug screening system since several known HCV inhibitors were shown to reduce SEAP activities in culture media of Ava5-EG(Δ4AB)SEAP cells. In conclusion, Ava5-EG(Δ4AB)SEAP cells can be used to monitor HCV sub-genomic replication and the assay can be readily adapted to high throughput screening format to identify prospective anti-HCV drugs. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

84900950602	RETRACTED ARTICLE: Disulfiram is a novel modulator for PPAR	The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors involved fatty acid metabolism and energy homeostasis. The PPARs also play crucial roles in the control of cellular growth and differentiation. Disulfiram is a clinically employed alcohol deterrent and has been used in the therapy of alcohol abuse for more than 40 years. Several effects of this drug have been reported for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In this study, we found the effects of disulfiram on the transactivation activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Disulfiram strongly influenced the gene reporter expression containing PPAR responsive element (PPRE) in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, by using transient transfection assay we also found disulfiram alone activated PPAR subtypes in a dose-dependent manner. These findings might explain certain aspects of disulfiran toxicity and encourage new further studies to determine the toxicity and underlying working mechanism(s) of disulfiram. In conclusion, our results indicate that disulfiram works as a novel PPAR modulater. © 2011 IEEE.

No effective antiviral therapeutics are available for treating EV-A71 infection and drug discovery efforts are rarely focused to target this disease. Thus, the main goal of this study was to discover existing drugs with novel indications that may effectively inhibit EV-A71 replication and the inflammatory cytokines elevation. In this study, we showed that LiCl, a GSK3b inhibitor, effectively suppressed EV-A71 replication, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines production (Interleukin 6, Interleukin-1b) in infected cells. Furthermore, LiCl and an immunomodular agent were shown to strongly synergize with each other in suppressing EV-A71 replication.

84916599169	Reticulon 3 interacts with NS4B of the hepatitis C virus and negatively regulates viral replication by disrupting NS4B self-interaction	Summary: The non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein comprising two consecutive amphipathic α-helical domains (AH1 and AH2). Its self-oligomerization via the AH2 domain is required for the formation of the membranous web that is necessary for viral replication. Previously, we reported that the host-encoded ER-associated reticulon 3 (RTN3) protein is involved in the formation of the replication-associated membranes of (+)RNA enteroviruses during viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated that the second transmembrane region of RTN3 competed for, and bound to, the AH2 domain of NS4B, thus abolishing NS4B self-interaction and leading to the downregulation of viral replication. This interaction was mediated by two crucial residues, lysine 52 and tyrosine 63, of AH2, and was regulated by the AH1 domain. The silencing of RTN3 in Huh7 and AVA5 cells harbouring an HCV replicon enhanced the replication of HCV, which was counteracted by the overexpression of recombinant RTN3. The synthesis of viral RNA was also increased in siRNA-transfected human primary hepatocytes infected with HCV derived from cell culture. Our results demonstrated that RTN3 acted as a restriction factor to limit the replication of HCV.
