84940256668	Effect of dietary vitamin a on reproductive performance and immune response of broiler breeders	The effects of dietary vitamin A supplementation on reproductive performance, liver function, fat-soluble vitamin retention, and immune response were studied in laying broiler breeders. In the first phase of the experiment, 1,120 Ross-308 broiler breeder hens were fed a diet of corn and soybean meal supplemented with 5,000 to 35,000 IU/kg vitamin A (retinyl acetate) for 20 weeks. In the second phase, 384 Ross-308 broiler breeder hens were fed the same diet supplemented with 5,000 to 135,000 IU/kg vitamin A (retinyl acetate) for 24 weeks. The hens' reproductive performance, the concentrations of vitamins A and E in liver and egg yolk, liver function, mRNA expression of vitamin D receptor in duodenal mucosa, antibody titers against Newcastle disease virus vaccine, and T-cell proliferation responses were evaluated. Supplementation of vitamin A at levels up to and including 35,000 IU/kg did not affect reproductive performance and quadratically affected antibody titer to Newcastle disease virus vaccine (p<0.05). Dietary addition of vitamin A linearly increased vitamin A concentration in liver and yolk and linearly decreased α-, γ-, and total tocopherol concentration in yolk (p<0.01) and α-tocopherol in liver (p< 0.05). Supplementation of vitamin A at doses of 45,000 IU/kg and above significantly decreased egg weight, yolk color, eggshell thickness and strength, and reproductive performance. Dietary vitamin A significantly increased mRNA expression of vitamin D receptor in duodenal mucosa (p<0.05), increased aspartate amino transferase activity, and decreased total bilirubin concentration in serum. Supplementation of vitamin A at 135,000 IU/kg decreased the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (p<0.05). Therefore, the maximum tolerable dose of vitamin A for broiler breeders appears to be 35,000 IU/kg, as excessive supplementation has been shown to impair liver function, reproductive performance, and immune response. © 2014 Yuan et al.

9544227473	An apparent lack of association between Helicobacter pylori infection and risk of gastric cancer in China	Several prospective studies have shown a significant association between Helicobacter pylori seropositivity and the risk of gastric cancer. Only a small proportion of H. pylori-infected individuals will, however, develop gastric cancer, and it is unclear what effects other factors, such as diet, might have on the risk of cancer. Eighty-seven subjects with gastric cancer were identified during the first 6 years of follow-up (mean 2.4 years) of a cohort of middle-aged men from Shanghai, China. They were matched with 261 cancer-free controls, and serum samples from all subjects, obtained at recruitment, were assayed for anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies. Questionnaire data provided information on a wide range of socio-demographic life-style and dietary variables. H. pylori seropositivity rates in the cases and controls were 54% and 56%, respectively. Neither the overall risk of developing gastric cancer nor the risk of developing non-cardia gastric cancer was significantly associated with prior H. pylori seropositivity. Adjustment for any of the other medical, dietary or life-style variables studied had little effect on the risk of developing non-cardia gastric cancer; simultaneous adjustment for all of these factors yielded an odds ratio of 1.17. The results do not support the hypothesis that H. pylori plays a role in the process of gastric carcinogenesis in China. It is possible that this is an artefact resulting from the relatively short follow-up period to date.

0029889205	Morbidity and mortality in relation to cigarette smoking in Shanghai, China: A prospective male cohort study	Objective. - To evaluate prospectively the health risk of cigarette smoking in middle-aged men in Shanghai, China. Design. - Prospective cohort study with annual follow-up. Participants. - A total of 18244 male residents of Shanghai, China, enrolled in the study during January 1, 1986, through September 30, 1989, and actively followed via annual visits. Results. - By September 30, 1993, 852 deaths and 554 incident cancer cases were identified during the follow-up period, which averaged 5.4 years per subject. The overall incidence rate for cancer was 568 per 100 000 man-years, with the 3 leading sites being lung (146/100 000), stomach (116/100 000), and liver (81/100 000). Forty-one percent of all deaths were from cancer. Stroke was the most frequent cause of death unrelated to cancer, with an age-adjusted rate 4.2 times higher than that of US white men (201/100 000 vs 48/100 000), followed by ischemic heart disease, with an age-adjusted rate one-fifth that of US white men (69/100 000 vs 366/100 000). Compared with lifelong nonsmokers, the relative risks in heavy smokers (20 or more cigarettes per day) after adjustment for alcohol consumption were 2.2 for any incident cancer, 9.4 for incident lung cancer, 6.7 for head and neck cancer, and 1.8 for liver cancer. In terms of mortality, heavy smokers were at a 60% greater risk of death relative to lifelong nonsmokers; there was a 2.3-fold excess dsk of death from cancer and 2-fold to 3-fold excess risk of death from heart disease. Conclusions. - Cigarette smoking is an important predictor of risk of cancer and mortality in men in Shanghai. Among the study subjects, 36% of all cases of cancer and 21% of all deaths could be attributed to cigarette smoking.

0030843969	Breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy: Collaborative reanalysis of data from 51 epidemiological studies of 52,705 women with breast cancer and 108,411 women without breast cancer	Background. The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer has brought together and reanalysed about 90% of the worldwide epidemiological evidence on the relation between risk of breast cancer and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Methods. Individual data on 52,705 women with breast cancer and 108,411 women without breast cancer from 51 studies in 21 countries were collected, checked, and analysed centrally. The main analyses are based on 53,865 postmenopausal women with a known age at menopause, of whom 17,830 (33%) had used HRT at some time. The median age at first use was 48 years, and 34% of ever-users had used HRT for 5 years or longer. Estimates of the relative risk of breast cancer associated with the use of HRT were obtained after stratification of all analyses by study, age at diagnosis, time since menopause, body-mass index, parity, and the age a woman was when her first child was born. Findings. Among current users of HRT or those who ceased use 1-4 years previously, the relative risk of having breast cancer diagnosed increased by a factor of 1.023 (95% CI 1.011-1.036; 2p = 0.0002) for each year of use; the relative risk was 1.35 (1.21-1.49; 2p = 0.00001) for women who had used HRT for 5 years or longer (average duration of use in this group 11 years). This increase is comparable with the effect on breast cancer of delaying menopause, since among never-users of HRT the relative risk of breast cancer increases by a factor of 1.028 (95% CI 1.021-1.034) for each year older at menopause. 5 or more years after cessation of HRT use, there was no significant excess of breast cancer overall or in relation to duration of use. These main findings did not vary between individual studies. Of the many factors examined that might affect the relation between breast cancer risk and use of HRT, only a woman's weight and body-mass index had a material effect: the increase in the relative risk of breast dancer associated with long durations of use in current and recent users was greater for women of lower than of higher weight or body-mass index. There was no marked variation in the results according to hormonal type or dose but little information was available about long durations of use of any specific preparation. Cancers diagnosed in women who had ever used HRT tended to be less advanced clinically than those diagnosed in never-users. In North America and Europe the cumulative incidence of breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 70 in never-users of HRT is about 45 per 1000 women. The cumulative excess numbers of breast cancers diagnosed between these ages per 1000 women who began use of HRT at age 50 and used it for 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, are estimated to be 2 (95% CI 1-3), 6 (3-9), and 12 (5-20). Whether HRT affects mortality from breast cancer is not known. Interpretation. The risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is increased in women using HRT and increases with increasing duration of use. This effect is reduced after cessation of use of HRT and has largely, if not wholly, disappeared after about 5 years. These findings should be considered in the context of the benefits and other risks associated with the use of HRT.

0031762510	Body weight and mortality: A prospective evaluation in a cohort of middle-aged men in Shanghai, China	Background. The relationship between relative body weight and mortality has been well studied in Western populations and remains controversial. Little is known about the weight-mortality association in less well fed people in developing countries. Methods. A cohort of 18,244 Chinese men aged 45-64 years in Shanghai, China enrolled in a prospective study of diet and cancer during January 1986 through September 1989. At recruitment, height and usual body weight were collected through interview. An active, annual follow-up of the cohort was conducted for cancer and death. Proportional hazards regression method was used to examine the relation between body mass index (BMI, weight in kg/height in m

3242684226	Effects of feeding xylose on the growth of broilers and nutrient digestibility as well as absorption of xylose in the portal-drained viscera	Two experiments were conducted to examine the effects of dietary inclusion of xylose on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and xylose absorption in the portal-drained viscera of broiler chicks. In Exp. 1, ninety male 14 day-old broilers were used to study the effects of different inclusion levels (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40%) of D-xylose in the semi-purified diets on the growth and nutrient digestibility of broilers. In Exp. 2, One hundred and eight male broilers, fed by precision feeding at 22 day-old, were used to investigate the absorption and transportation of dietary xylose in the portal-drained viscera of broiler. The results of Exp. 1 indicated that the growth of broilers was gradually decreased as the xylose level increased (p<0.01). With the xylose supplementation increased, the moisture in broiler excreta was gradually elevated (p<0.01), AME and the digestibilities of crude protein and ether extract were significantly reduced and the digestibilities of xylose and arabinose were also decreased (p<0.01). The results of Exp. 2 showed that the concentrations of ribose, xylose and galactose in serum were significantly influenced by different dietary levels of xylose (p<0.01), but there's no apparent difference among rhamnose, glucose and arabinose (p>0.05). The xylose concentration in serum was highest in Vena Cava, middle in Portal Vein and lowest in Ulnar Vein within 6 h after precision feeding. And then the xylose concentration in Portal Vein and Ulnar Vein were higher than that of Vena Cava. The concentration of ribose, xylose and galactose in serum were also significantly changed with time prolongation (p<0.01). The concentration of xylose in serum was highest in the 40% xylose treatment, middle in the 20% xylose group and lowest in the control group. The glycogen contents in liver and muscle were linearly decreased as the level of xylose increased (p<0.01). The higher the dietary level of xylose was, the lower digestibility of dietary xylose was (p<0.10). 40% xylose markedly decreased the digestibility of dietary glucose (p<0.01). In conclusion, high levels of xylose in the diets inhibited the growth and nutrient digestibility of broiler. The outputs of xylose from the hydrolyzation of wheat-based diet by xylanase should have no adverse effects on broiler performance.

In each experiment, 288 day-old Three-Yellow-Chickens were used in a 2 x 3 factorial experimental design. Six groups were arranged randomly to receive three levels of Zn-AA (0, 40, or 80 mg/kg) alone or with salinomycin (60 mg/kg). Additionally an uninfected group was set as negative control.

33745487709	Effects of dietary iodine and selenium on the activities of blood lymphocytes in laying hens	The effect of dietary iodine and selenium supplementation, alone or in combination, on peripheral blood lymphocyte function was determined in laying hens. Eight-hundred-and-sixty-four New-Loman laying hens were randomly allotted into 12 dietary treatments with different inclusion levels of iodine (0, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg), selenium (0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) or their combinations for 24 weeks. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation index, concanavalin A (ConA) stimulation index, peroxide enzyme activity and phagocytosis to neutral red particles were tested. There were significant differences in LPS stimulation index, ConA stimulation index, peroxide enzyme activity and phagocytosis to neutral red particles in different iodine or selenium supplementation levels (p<0.05). The highest iodine and selenium supplementation both resulted in highest LPS-/ConA-stimulation indices (p<0.05). However, when iodine was lower than 0.2 mg/kg, the additional effect of different levels of selenium did not always result in significant differences in these indices. The results indicated that iodine and selenium may affect immunity in laying hens and, when the iodine level in the laying hen is lower than 0.2 mg/kg, a selenium allowance higher than 0.1 mg/kg may be necessary to improve immunity.

33747195261	Antepartum immunoprophylaxis of three doses of hepatitis B immunoglobulin is not effective: A single-centre randomized study	To investigate the efficacy of antepartum administration of three doses of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg), currently being used in China, 250 pregnant women who were seropositive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were randomly divided into study (117 cases) and control groups (133 cases). Subjects in the study group received HBIg 400 IU intramuscularly once a month at the third, second and first month before delivery; subjects in the control group received no antepartum treatment. All neonates received passive-active immunization after birth. The maternal hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) titres and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels were measured at week 28 of gestation (before the antepartum treatment) and at labour; the neonatal serum HBV markers were detected at birth and at 12 months after birth. No side-effects were found in any of the women or their neonates. No statistical differences were seen between the maternal HBsAg and HBV DNA levels of the study and control groups at labour nor the protective efficacy rates of postnatal immunoprophylaxis at 12 months after birth (P > 0.05, respectively). To conclude, antepartum administration of three doses of HBIg for the HBeAg-positive women is inefficacious. © 2006 The Authors.

33845761772	Dietary conjugated linoleic acid enhances spleen PPAR-γ mRNA expression in broiler chicks	The anti-inflammatory effects of dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on broilers repeatedly challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated. Day-old broiler chicks were allotted into three treatment groups and fed on a control diet or diets containing 5·0 or 10·0 g CLA/kg diet. Six chicks from each treatment were injected with LPS (0·25 mg/kg body weight) at 16, 18 and 20 d of age. Splenic cyclooxygenase (COX) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activities, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) production as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) mRNA expression were measured at 21 d of age. Chicks fed 10·0 g CLA/kg diet had lower COX activities and PGE2 production than the controls. Dietary CLA (10·0 g/kg) did not significantly diminish LPS-induced enhancement of COX-2 activity, but inhibited the subsequent increase in PGE2 production. Regulation of COX-1 activity contributed to the difference in PGE2 production. CLA did not markedly attenuate the increase of iNOS activity and NO production caused by LPS challenge. Chicks fed CLA had lower iNOS activity and NO production than the controls. Dietary CLA activated splenic PPAR-γ mRNA expression and increased PPAR-γ mRNA expression after LPS injection. These results suggest that dietary CLA has immunomodulatory effects in the spleen by restricting basal PGE2 and NO to lower levels and enhancing PPAR-γ mRNA expression. During the inflammatory response, dietary CLA did not alleviate the increase in COX-2 and iNOS activities but enhanced PPAR-γ mRNA expression.

33846944655	Urinary biomarkers of tea polyphenols and risk of colorectal cancer in the Shanghai Cohort Study	There have been no studies on specific tea polyphenol biomarkers and risk of colorectal cancer in humans. We prospectively examined the associations between validated biomarkers of specific tea polyphenols and risk of developing colorectal cancer among a cohort of 18,244 men in Shanghai, China, with 16 years of follow-up. Epigallocatechin (EGC), 4′-O-methyl-epigallocatechin (4′-MeEGC) and epicatechin, and their metabolites in baseline urine samples were measured on 162 incident colorectal cancer cases and 806 matched controls. Individuals with high prediagnostic urinary EGC levels had a lower risk of colon cancer. Compared with undetectable EGC, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for colon cancer in the lowest, intermediate and highest tertile of detectable EGC were 0.64 (0.33-1.24), 0.60 (0.30-1.20) and 0.40 (0.19-0.83), respectively (p for trend = 0.02). A similar inverse relation between 4′-MeEGC and colon cancer also was observed. Compared with the lowest quartile, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for colon cancer in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles of urinary 4′-MeEGC were 0.49 (0.25-0.96), 0.32 (0.16-0.67) and 0.41 (0.20-0.84), respectively (p for trend = 0.006). The strongest protective effect was seen for regular tea drinkers who showed high levels of urinary EGC and 4′-MeEGC. No association between urinary levels of epicatechin or its metabolite and colon cancer risk was observed. Urinary levels of tea polyphenols and their metabolites were not associated with rectal cancer risk. The present study supports the notion of tea catechins as chemopreventive agents against the development of colon cancer in humans. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

34447524002	Beta-cryptoxanthin and lung cancer in Shanghai, China - An examination of potential confounding with cigarette smoking using urinary cotinine as a biomarker for true tobacco exposure	Diet may be a modifier of smoking-related cancer risk, with protective effects of intake of fruits and vegetables and associated antioxidants found in many observational studies. We previously reported serum β-cryptoxanthin levels being inversely associated with smoking-related lung cancer incidence in a cohort of Chinese men. We noted, however, that serum β-cryptoxanthin is negatively correlated with smoking. Since self-reports of smoking intensity undoubtedly contain errors, this negative correlation indicates a potential bias in assessing the effects of β-cryptoxanthin, due to confounding with the unmeasured (residual) portion of cigarette exposure. We evaluated cotinine levels in pre-diagnostic spot urine samples to attempt to improve smoking assessment. We noted that urinary cotinine levels correlated significantly with cigarette consumption overall and that cotinine was strongly predictive of lung cancer risk. Urinary cotinine, however, was not as strong a predictor of lung cancer risk in current smokers as were self-reports of cigarette consumption and cotinine remained only a marginally significant predictor of lung cancer risk after adjustment for self-reports. An apparent benefit of β-cryptoxanthin remained evident when including both urinary cotinine and self-reported cigarette consumption and cotinine in the statistical model. However, we conclude that cotinine measured from a single spot urine seems to have only limited value in augmenting self-reports of cigarette consumption so that, at present, the apparent protective effects of β-cryptoxanthin, as seen in our own study, should continue to be regarded as unproven. We believe that future epidemiological evaluation of the association between β-cryptoxanthin (and other antioxidants) and reduced lung cancer risk must utilize improved biomarkers to augment smokers' own self-reports of smoking amount.

34548576901	Characterization of fatty acid digestion of beijing fatty and arbor acres chickens	The aim of this experiment was to compare the characterization of fatty acid digestion of Beijing Fatty (BF) and Arbor Acres (AA) chickens. One-day-old male AA and BF chickens were raised in the same house, and fed with the same diet. We first evaluated utilization of dietary fatty acids in chickens by the total collection procedure, and chickens were then killed to compare the abundance of intestinal mRNA expression of liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and intestinal-fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) by Real-time PCR, and also the pH of intestinal mucosa at 3 and 6 weeks of age. Another group of chickens were sampled at 6 weeks of age to compare the total bile acid concentration in serum, and lipase activity in contents of the small intestine. Results showed that compared to AA chickens, BF chickens had higher lipase activity in the content of the small intestine (p<0.05), greater total bile acid content in portal vein blood (p<0.05) at 6 weeks of age, lower intestinal mucosal pH at both 3 weeks (p<0.05) and 6 weeks (p<0.05) of age, and higher abundance of liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) mRNA expression in intestine tissues at 6 weeks of age (p<0.05), and higher digestibility of fatty acids at both 3 and 6 weeks (p<0.05) of age. There was no difference in I-FABP mRNA expression between AA and BF chickens at either age. Thus, BF chickens had greater fatty acids utilization than AA chickens that was associated with L-FABP, lipase activity, bile acid content and intestinal mucosal pH.

34548804362	Genetic polymorphisms in the Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and Thymidylate synthase genes and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) are known to play a role in DNA methylation, synthesis, and repair. The genetic mutations in MTHFR and TYMS genes may have influences on their respective enzyme activities. Data on the association studies of the MTHFR and TYMS genetic polymorphisms and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are sparse. MTHFR and TYMS genotypes were determined on 365 HCC cases and 457 healthy control subjects among Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites and African-Americans in Los Angeles County, California, and among Chinese in the city of Nanning, Guangxi, China. Relative to the high-activity genotype, each low-activity genotype of MTHFR was associated with a statistically nonsignificant 30% to 50% reduction in risk of HCC. Relative to the TYMS3′ UTR +6/+6 genotype, individuals with 1 or 2 copies of the deletion allele had a statistically significant 50% reduction in risk of HCC. When we examined HCC risk by the total number of mutant alleles in the 3 polymorphic loci of MTHFR/TYMS (range, 0-4), there was a monotonic decrease in risk with increasing number of mutant alleles (P for trend = 0.003). Individuals possessing the maximum number of mutant alleles (i.e., 4) had an odds ratio of 0.46 (95% confidence interval = 0.23-0.93) for HCC compared with those with no or only 1 mutant allele. Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis that reduced MTHFR activity and enhanced TYMS activity, both of which are essential elements in minimizing uracil misincorporation into DNA, may protect against the development of HCC.

0032774143	Helicobacter pylori infection and risk of gastric cancer in Shanghai, China: Updated results based upon a locally developed and validated assay and further follow-up of the cohort	Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in low-risk populations. However, our previous results (P.M. Webb et al., Int. J. Cancer, 67: 603-607, 1996) from an ongoing prospective study in Shanghai, China, a relatively high-risk population, failed to show an association between H. pylori infection and the subsequent risk of gastric cancer. That previous study had a relatively short time period of follow-up and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used was based on strains found in Southern England and without validation among the Chinese. Either one of these two factors could have had an impact on the validity of those earlier observations. An ELISA developed and validated among Shanghai residents was used in the present study to reexamine specific antibodies to H. pylori in 188 gastric cancer patients and 548 control subjects. All of the cases of gastric cancer were identified during the first 12 years of follow-up of a cohort of 18,244 men, ages 45-64 years in Shanghai, from whom blood samples were collected at enrollment during 1986- 1989. For each cancer case, three cancer-free control subjects were randomly selected from the cohort and matched to the index cases by age (within 2 years), month and year of sample collection, and neighborhood of residence. The Shanghai-based ELISA detected a higher prevalence of serum antibodies to H. priori than the English-based assay in both gastric cancer cases (86 versus 53%) and control subjects (85 versus 56%). Virtually all of the subjects (98%) who were H. pylori-seropositive by the English-based assay tested positive by the Shanghai-based assay. On the other hand, 73% of gastric cancer cases and 68% of control subjects who were seronegative according to the English-based assay tested positive by the Shanghai-based assay. Using this alternative assay, combined with increased follow-up, our latest data contradict our earlier findings and show a statistically significant association between H. pylori seropositivity and gastric cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.11). We noted an increasing rate of seropositivity among cases as the time interval between cohort enrollment and cancer diagnosis increased. Among subjects followed for 5 or more years after enrollment, the odds ratio for gastric cancer related to H. pylori seropositivity was 3.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.51-9.30).

0033757074	Decreased luteinizing hormone receptor mRNA expression in human ovarian epithelial cancer	Objectives. The objective of this study was to examine the distribution and cellular localization of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) in ovarian epithelial tumors (OETs) and their presumed precursor lesionsovarian epithelial inclusions (OEIs). The clinicopathologic correlation of the receptor expression in OET was also examined. Methods. Fifteen microdissected samples of ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), 20 OEIs from benign ovaries, and 141 OETs, including 48 cystadenomas, 33 borderline tumors, 60 carcinomas, and 5 metastatic cancers, were examined for LHR expression by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. LHR expression in tumor epithelium and tumor stroma was analyzed separately. The clinicopathologic correlation data were analyzed by standard analysis of variance and contingency table methods. Results. LHR expression was identified in the majority of OSE and OEI samples. In OETs, LHR positivity was found in the epithelial cells in 27% of cases and in the stromal compartment in 37% of cases. LHR-positive stromal cells were mainly luteinized cells. Within the tumor epithelium, LHR expression was detected in 42% of benign, 24% of borderline, and 17% of malignant OETs. LHR expression in tumor stroma showed a similar trend of reduction from benign to malignant OETs. Within the 17 carcinomas, LHR was expressed in the epithelium in 47% of grade 1, 12% of grade 2, and only 5% of grade 3 cancers. The mean age of the LHR-positive group was younger than that of the receptor-negative patients. Compared with mucinous and other types of OETs, serous OETs showed higher LHR expression in the epithelium. Compared with the OETs removed in the different menstrual phases, OETs in the secretory phase showed higher LHR in the tumor stroma than in the proliferative phase. No receptor mRNA was detected in the epithelium of five carcinomas metastatic to the ovary. LHR transcription splicing variants from a single previous report were confirmed in this study. Conclusions. Malignant OETs have significant reduction of LHR expression compared with precursor lesions and benign and borderline OETs. LHR expression shows a steady decline from low-grade to high-grade ovarian cancer. The presence of LHR receptor in tumor epithelium suggests that luteinizing hormone in serum may have direct influence on tumor growth, whereas the receptor in tumor stroma may be indicative of a paracrine function of LH in the development of OETs.

0033986207	Non-dietary risk factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Shanghai, China	A population-based case-control study was conducted in Shanghai, China, to investigate the associations between exposures to various non-dietary variables and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A total of 935 NPC patients and 1,032 community controls were included. Active cigarette smoking was a moderate risk factor for NPC [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.61]. Results were highly consistent-between men and women. It is estimated that 12% of NPC cases in Shanghai, China, can be attributable to cigarette smoking. Among lifelong nonsmokers, there was a strong and statistically significant positive association between NPC risk and exposure to substantial secondhand smoke as a child or as an adult in women. However, the associations among lifelong non-smoking men were weaker and not statistically significant. The gender differences in risk associated with passive smoking were either statistically significant or almost so. There were excess numbers of NPC patients compared with control subjects who had a history of chronic ear and nose disease (OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.56-2.46) and a family history of NPC (OR = 7.47, 95% CI 2.14-12.88).

0033988920	Preserved foods in relation to risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Shanghai, China	A population-based case-control study was conducted in Shanghai, China, to investigate the association between dietary factors and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The study included 935 NPC patients aged 15 to 74 years and 1,032 community controls. Exposures to salted fish and other protein-containing preserved food were associated with increased risk of NPC. Individuals who ate salted fish at least once a week had an 80% increase in risk of NPC relative to those who ate salted fish less than once a month (p = 0.07). Compared with those in the lowest quartile of protein-containing preserved foods, subjects in the highest quartile of intake experienced a statistically significant 78% increase in risk of NPC [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.37-2.31], with a dose-dependent relationship (p for linear trend < 0.001). A similar association between intake of preserved vegetables and NPC risk was observed (OR = 1.39, p for linear trend = 0.003). In contrast, high intake of oranges/tangerines was associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of NPC (OR = 0.55, p for linear trend < 0.001). When we examined the joint effect of preserved food and oranges/tangerines on risk of NPC, subjects in the highest tertile of preserved food and the lowest tertile of orange/tangerine intake had a 3-fold increase in risk (95% CI = 2.08-4.91) compared with those in the lowest tertile of preserved food and the highest tertile of orange/tangerine intake.

32144436785	Effects of conjugated linoleic acids on growth performance, serum lysozyme activity, lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production in broiler chicks	This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) on growth performance and immune responses in broiler chicks. A total of 240 day-old Arbor Acre male broiler chicks were randomly allotted into four dietary treatments with different inclusion levels of CLA (0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 g/kg) for six weeks. Growth performance, peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) proliferation, lysozyme activity, phagocytic activity (carbon clearance) and serum antibody titers against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine were examined. There were no significant differences in growth performance among treatments (p > 0.05). Chicks fed CLA diets produced more lysozyme activity in serum than the control group at 2 and 6 weeks of age (p < 0.05). Dietary CLA enhanced the PBL proliferation in response to concanavalin A (ConA) at the age of 42 d (p < 0.05). Phagocytic ability was also affected by dietary CLA and chicks fed CLA diets had faster carbon clearance rate (p < 0.05), but antibody titers to NDV was not influenced by dietary CLA. The results of the study suggested that dietary CLA could enhance innate and cellular immune response in broiler chicks, and not affect the growth performance. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

33645740759	Prediagnostic level of serum retinol in relation to reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Retinol and its derivatives (retinoids), which have antioxidant activity and promote cell differentiation, may protect against the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by controlling hepatocellular differentiation and reducing inflammatory responses. Methods: We examined prospectively the relationship between prediagnostic serum concentrations of retinol, α-carotene; β-carotene; β-cryptoxanthin; lutein; lycopene; zeaxanthin; α-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols; and selenium and the risk of developing HCC among 213 patients with HCC and 1087 matched control subjects from a cohort of 18244 men in Shanghai, China, who were monitored from 1986 through 2001. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for men by quartile of serum concentrations of micronutrients were estimated by using logistic regression with adjustment for cigarette smoking status, alcohol intake, self-reported history of physician-diagnosed hepatitis or liver cirrhosis at recruitment, and seropositivity for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Men with high prediagnostic serum retinol levels had a lower risk of HCC than men in the lowest quartile (Q2 versus Q1, OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.61; Q3 versus Q1, OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.50; and Q4 versus Q1, OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.06 to 0.26; P trend <.001). A statistically significant interaction was observed between retinol and HBsAg seropositivity on HCC risk; HBsAg-positive men in the lowest tertile of retinol had a greater than 70-fold higher risk (OR = 72.7, 95% CI = 31.6 to 167.4) of HCC than HBsAg-negative men in the highest tertile of retinol (P interaction = .018). No independent effect of serum levels of α-carotene; β-carotene; β-cryptoxanthin; lutein; lycopene; zeaxanthin; α-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols; or selenium on HCC risk were observed. Conclusion: High prediagnostic serum level of retinol is associated with a decreased risk of HCC in this population. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

0034718294	Isothiocyanates, glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 polymorphisms, and lung-cancer risk: A prospective study of men in Shanghai, China	Background: Dietary isothiocyanates inhibit lung carcinogenesis in laboratory animals but human data are limited. Glutathione S-transferases M1 and T1 (GSTM1 and GSTT1) conjugate isothiocyanates leading to more rapid elimination. Common deletion polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 abolish enzyme activity. We hypothesised that chemopreventive effects of isothiocyanates might be heightened when enzymes that enhance their elimination are lacking. Methods: We examined the relation between total isothiocyanate concentrations in urine, collected before diagnosis, and the subsequent risk of lung cancer among 232 incident cases of lung cancer and 710 matched controls from a cohort of 18 244 men in Shanghai, China, followed from 1986 to 1997. Homozygous deletion of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were determined by PCR. Findings: Individuals with detectable isothiocyanates in the urine were at decreased risk of lung cancer (smoking-adjusted relative risk for lung cancer=0.65 [95% Cl 0.43-0.97]). This protective effect of isothiocyanates was seen primarily among individuals with homozygous deletion of GSTM1 (0.36 [0.20-0.63]) and particularly with deletion of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 (0.28 [0.13-0.57]). Interpretation: Isothiocyanates appeared to reduce lung-cancer risk in this cohort of Chinese men. Reduction in risk was strongest among persons genetically deficient in enzymes that rapidly eliminate these chemopreventive compounds.

77954631104	Genetic association between the COMT genotype and urinary levels of tea polyphenols and their metabolites among daily green tea drinkers	Available in vitro and animal studies have shown cancer protective effects of tea polyphenols. Recent study suggests a greater protective effect of green tea intake on breast cancer risk among women possessing the lowactivity associated genotype of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which may modulate the metabolism and excretion of tea polyphenols through urine. To determine the effect of COMT genotype on urinary excretion of tea polyphenol metabolites of daily green tea drinkers, a cross-sectional analysis was performed within the Shanghai Cohort Study, a population-based, prospective investigation of diet and cancer in 18,244 men. In addition to an inperson interview, each participant provided a blood and urine sample at baseline. In the present study, COMT genotype (rs4680) and five urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols were determined in 660 cohort subjects who selfidentified as daily drinkers of green tea. All urinary tea polyphenol measurements were expressed in units of urinary creatinine. Men possessing the homozygous low-activity associated COMT genotype (LL) exhibited statistically significantly lower urinary levels of individual as well as all of the five tea polyphenol metabolites under study relative to individuals possessing the wild type high-activity associated COMT genotype (HH) or the heterozygous variant genotype (HL). Levels of urinary tea polyphenol metabolites were comparable between men possessing the HH and HL genotypes. The present study demonstrated that men carrying low-activity associated COMT genotype excreted less tea polyphenols from urine, which suggests that they may retain more tea polyphenols in their bodies and derive greater health benefits from green tea intake.

79951997878	Association between body-mass index and risk of death in more than 1 million Asians	Background: Most studies that have evaluated the association between the body-mass index (BMI) and the risks of death from any cause and from specific causes have been conducted in populations of European origin. Methods: We performed pooled analyses to evaluate the association between BMI and the risk of death among more than 1.1 million persons recruited in 19 cohorts in Asia. The analyses included approximately 120,700 deaths that occurred during a mean follow-up period of 9.2 years. Cox regression models were used to adjust for confounding factors. Results: In the cohorts of East Asians, including Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans, the lowest risk of death was seen among persons with a BMI (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) in the range of 22.6 to 27.5. The risk was elevated among persons with BMI levels either higher or lower than that range - by a factor of up to 1.5 among those with a BMI of more than 35.0 and by a factor of 2.8 among those with a BMI of 15.0 or less. A similar U-shaped association was seen between BMI and the risks of death from cancer, from cardiovascular diseases, and from other causes. In the cohorts comprising Indians and Bangladeshis, the risks of death from any cause and from causes other than cancer or cardiovascular disease were increased among persons with a BMI of 20.0 or less, as compared with those with a BMI of 22.6 to 25.0, whereas there was no excess risk of either death from any cause or cause-specific death associated with a high BMI. Conclusions: Underweight was associated with a substantially increased risk of death in all Asian populations. The excess risk of death associated with a high BMI, however, was seen among East Asians but not among Indians and Bangladeshis. Copyright © 2011 Massachusetts Medical Society.

84867856476	Zinc prevents Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-induced loss of intestinal mucosal barrier function in broiler chickens	The study was carried out to evaluate the beneficial effects of supplemental zinc (Zn) on the intestinal mucosal barrier function in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-challenged broiler chickens in a 42-day experiment. A total of 336 1-day-old male Arbor Acres broiler chicks were assigned to eight treatment groups. A 4×2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used in a completely randomized experimental design to study the effects of levels of supplemental Zn (0, 40, 80 and 120 mg/kg diet), pathogen challenge (with or without S. Typhimurium challenge), and their interactions. S. Typhimurium infection caused reduction of growth performance (P<0.05) and intestinal injury, as determined by reduced (P<0.05) villus height/crypt depth ratio and sucrase activity in the ileum, increased (P<0.05) plasma endotoxin levels, and reduced (P<0.05) claudin-1, occludin and mucin-2 mRNA expression in the ileum at day 21. Zn pre-treatment tended to improve body weight gain (P=0.072) in the starter period, to increase the activity of ileal sucrase (P=0.077), to reduce plasma endotoxin levels (P=0.080), and to significantly increase (P<0.05) the villus height/crypt depth ratio and mRNA levels of occludin and claudin-1 in the ileum at day 21. The results indicated that dietary Zn supplementation appeared to alleviate the loss of intestinal mucosal barrier function induced by S. Typhimurium challenge and the partial mechanism might be related to the increased expression of occludin and claudin-1 in broiler chickens. © 2012 Copyright Houghton Trust Ltd.

84877818741	Comparisons of egg quality traits, egg weight loss and hatchability between striped and normal duck eggs	1. The egg quality of striped and normal duck eggs was compared to determine why striped eggs show decreased hatchability. A total of 430 eggs, obtained from a Pekin duck breeder flock aged 50-65 wks, were used in three experiments. The eggs were weighed and assigned randomly to measure egg quality traits, egg weight (EW) loss and hatchability during incubation. 2. There were no significant differences between egg types in terms of egg shape index, eggshell strength and thickness, albumen height, Haugh unit, yolk colour, weight of the eggshell with or without membranes, calcium, phosphorus, copper and manganese contents in the eggshell (with the inner and outer membranes or without the inner membrane), albumen weight, dry matter of albumen, crude protein (CP) of thick albumen and pH of the thick albumen. 3. The weight of eggshells with membranes, weight of thick albumen and CP of thin albumen in striped eggs were lower than those in normal eggs. 4. The thin albumen in striped eggs was heavier than that in normal eggs. The pH of the thin albumin in striped egg was significantly higher than that in normal eggs. 5. There were no significant differences in EW loss during incubation or duckling weight between striped and normal eggs. However, the hatchability of striped eggs was lower. 6. The lower weight of the eggshell inner membrane and thick albumen, lower CP content and higher pH in the thin albumen of striped eggs might contribute to lower hatchability. © 2013 Copyright © 2013 British Poultry Science Ltd.

84877875905	Menarche, menopause, and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis, including 118 964 women with breast cancer from 117 epidemiological studies	Background Menarche and menopause mark the onset and cessation, respectively, of ovarian activity associated with reproduction, and affect breast cancer risk. Our aim was to assess the strengths of their effects and determine whether they depend on characteristics of the tumours or the affected women. Methods Individual data from 117 epidemiological studies, including 118 964 women with invasive breast cancer and 306 091 without the disease, none of whom had used menopausal hormone therapy, were included in the analyses. We calculated adjusted relative risks (RRs) associated with menarche and menopause for breast cancer overall, and by tumour histology and by oestrogen receptor expression. Findings Breast cancer risk increased by a factor of 1.050 (95% CI 1.044-1.057; p<0.0001) for every year younger at menarche, and independently by a smaller amount (1.029, 1.025-1.032; p<0.0001), for every year older at menopause. Premenopausal women had a greater risk of breast cancer than postmenopausal women of an identical age (RR at age 45-54 years 1.43, 1.33-1.52, p<0.001). All three of these associations were attenuated by increasing adiposity among postmenopausal women, but did not vary materially by women's year of birth, ethnic origin, childbearing history, smoking, alcohol consumption, or hormonal contraceptive use. All three associations were stronger for lobular than for ductal tumours (p<0.006 for each comparison). The effect of menopause in women of an identical age and trends by age at menopause were stronger for oestrogen receptor-positive disease than for oestrogen receptor-negative disease (p<0.01 for both comparisons). Interpretation The effects of menarche and menopause on breast cancer risk might not be acting merely by lengthening women's total number of reproductive years. Endogenous ovarian hormones are more relevant for oestrogen receptorpositive disease than for oestrogen receptor-negative disease and for lobular than for ductal tumours.

84887899631	Reduced aflatoxin exposure presages decline in liver cancer mortality in an endemic region of China	Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality globally. In endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, PLC largely arises from chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and ingestion of aflatoxins. Although synergistic interactions between these two risk factors have been observed in cohort studies in China, here we determined the impact of agricultural reforms in the 1980s leading to diminished maize consumption and implementation of subsidized universal vaccination against HBV in the 2000s on PLC primary prevention. A population-based cancer registry was used to track PLC mortality in Qidong, China and was compared with the timeline of HBV immunization. Randomly selected serum samples from archived cohort collections from the 1980s to present were analyzed for aflatoxin biomarkers. More than 50% reductions in PLC mortality rates occurred across birth cohorts from the 1960s to the 1980s for Qidongese less than 35 years of age although all were born before universal vaccination of newborns. Median levels of the aflatoxin biomarker decreased from 19.3 pg/mg albumin in 1989 to undetectable (<0.5 pg/mg) by 2009. A population attributable benefit of 65% for reduced PLC mortality was estimated from a government-facilitated switch of dietary staple from maize to rice; 83% of this benefit was in those infected with HBV. Food policy reforms in China resulted in a dramatic decrease in aflatoxin exposure, which, independent of HBV vaccination, reduced liver cancer risk. The extensive HBV vaccine coverage now in place augurs even greater risk reductions in the future. ©2013 AACR.

42649116426	Alcohol, tobacco, and diet in relation to esophageal cancer: The Shanghai cohort study	Prospective data on environmental exposures, especially with respect to alcohol, tobacco, and diet, in relation to the risk of esophageal cancer in high-risk populations are sparse. We analyzed data from a population-based cohort of 18,244 middle-aged and older men in Shanghai to identify risk factors for esophageal cancer in this high-risk population. The cohort was followed through 2006, and 101 incident esophageal cancer cases were identified. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between exposures and esophageal cancer risk. With adjustment for tobacco use and other potential confounders, regular drinkers vs. nondrinkers of alcoholic beverages had a twofold risk of developing esophageal cancer (HR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.31-3.12). With adjustment for alcohol and other potential confounders, long-term smokers (40+ yr) vs. nonsmokers of cigarettes showed a twofold risk of developing esophageal cancer (HR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.11-3.82). Increased consumption of fruits (including oranges/tangerines), seafood, and milk were found to be protective against the development of esophageal cancer; HRs were decreased by 40-60% for high vs. low consumers after adjustment for cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and other confounders.

42149150420	Dietary conjugated linoleic acid improves antioxidant capacity in broiler chicks	The influence of dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the antioxidant status in the absence or presence of endotoxin exposure was studied with male broiler chicks. 2. In experiment 1, a total of 240 1-d-old broilers were allotted into 4 dietary groups (0, 25, 50 or 100 g pure CLA/kg) to study the influence of CLA on growth performance and antioxidant defence systems. The results showed that growth performance was not altered by 42 d of CLA consumption. Increased total superoxide dismutase (TSOD) activities in liver, serum and muscle were observed in chicks given 100 g CLA/kg diet. Dietary CLA at 100 g/kg also markedly elevated liver catalase (CAT) activity. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, decreased in liver, serum and muscle in chicks given 50 and 100 g CLA/kg diet. 3. In experiment 2, a total of 120 1-d-old broilers were fed on a control diet (without CLA) or 100 g CLA/kg diet. Half of the birds fed on each diet were injected intraperitoneally with 025 mg/kg body weight of Salmonella enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 16, 18 and 20 d of age. Decreased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), TSOD activity and increased ceruloplasmin and MDA concentrations were seen in the challenged chicks. Dietary CLA prevented the loss of body weight gain and feed conversion ratio of chicks followed repeated endotoxin exposure. CLA partially inhibited the increase of serum ceruloplasmin and MDA at 17 and 21 d of age and notably suppressed the decrease of serum TSOD activity at 21 d of age. 4. These results suggested that dietary CLA enhances the activity of antioxidant enzymes including TSOD and CAT. Supplementation of CLA has been shown to ameliorate the antioxidant balance and performance of chicks during oxidative stress.

42949094195	Growth performance and immune responses in chickens after challenge with lipopolysaccharide and modulation by dietary different oils	The study was conducted to investigate the effects of different oils on growth performance and immune responses of chickens after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A total of 288 chickens were assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Factors were dietary fat type (4.5% maize oil or 4.5% fish oil) and immunological challenge (LPS or saline). At 20 days and 27 days of age, chickens were injected intraperitoneally with either 1 mg/kg body weight of LPS or sterile saline. LPS decreased feed intake from 21 days to 28 days of age and body-weight gain from 21 days to 42 days of age. Fish oil improved feed-conversion efficiency of chickens after LPS challenge for the first time. Fish oil supplementation decreased lymphocyte proliferation (21 days: P < 0.0001; 28 days: P < 0.0001) and the ratio of CD3

Results showed that laying performance of hens was not influenced by oil source and level. The anti-bovine serum albumin (BSA) antibody production was significantly influenced by oil source (P < 0.05), i.e. the antibody levels on days 10 and 14 post-primary immunization were higher in hens fed oils rich with n-3 PUFAs (fish oil or linseed oil) than in hens fed maize oil rich with n-6 PUFAs. The main effect of oil supplementation level on antibody production was not significant, but numerically highest antibody levels were in hens supplemented with high level (50-60 g/kg) of oils rich with n-3 PUFA. The serum lysozyme activity of hens was influenced only by oil source (P < 0.01), which was higher in hens fed n-3 PUFAs-rich fish oil and linseed oil than in hens fed maize oil rich with n-6 PUFAs. The main effects of oil source, supplementation level and their interaction were all significant on the production of PGE

4544314007	Dietary soy and increased risk of bladder cancer: A prospective cohort study of men in Shanghai, China	To verify our previous finding of a positive association between dietary soy and bladder cancer risk, we examined the association in a second, geographically distinct prospective cohort of Chinese subjects, the Shanghai Cohort Study. Briefly, 18,244 men aged 45-64 years were recruited between January 1986 and September 1989. As of December 31, 2002, 61 incident bladder cancer cases were identified. Information on soy consumption was obtained through inperson interviews at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazard regression methods were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), with adjustment for age (years) at baseline interview, level of education and other potential confounders. Compared to men consuming soy less than once a week, the RR (95% CI) for those who consumed soy I-<3 times per week, 3-<7 times a week and daily were 2.05 (0.80-5.29), 2.45 (0.89-6.76) and 4.61 (1.57-13.51), respectively (p for trend = 0.004), after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking and level of education. The soy-bladder cancer risk associations in smokers and non-smokers were comparable. The soy-bladder cancer relationship became stronger when the analysis was restricted to subjects with 2 or more years of follow-up. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

53349152035	Urinary total isothiocyanates and colorectal cancer: A prospective study of men in Shanghai, China	Laboratory and epidemiologic evidence suggests that dietary isothiocyanates (ITCs) may have a chemopreventive effect on cancer. Humans are exposed to ITCs primarily through ingestion of cruciferous vegetables that contain glucosinolates, the precursors to ITCs. The association between urinary total ITC level and colorectal cancer risk was examined in a cohort of 18,244 men in Shanghai, China, with 16 years of follow-up. Urinary total ITCs were quantified on 225 incident cases of colorectal cancer and 1,119 matched controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using logistic regression models. High levels of urinary total ITCs were associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer 5 years after baseline measurements of ITCs, whereas a statistically nonsignificant increase in the risk of colorectal cancer was observed for cases within 5 years of post-enrollment (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.85-4.39 for the upper three quartiles of urinary ITCs versus the lowest quartile). The inverse ITC-colorectal cancer association became stronger with a longer duration of follow-up. Compared with the first quartile, ORs (95% CIs) for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of total ITCs in urine collected 10 or more years before cancer diagnosis were 0.61 (0.35-1.05), 0.51 (0.29-0.92), and 0.46 (0.25-0.83), respectively, for risk of colorectal cancer (P for trend = 0.006). The present study suggests that dietary ITCs may exert tumor inhibitory effects, especially during earlier stages of the multistage process of carcinogenesis.

55349130685	Enhancement of peripheral blood CD8+ T cells and classical swine fever antibodies by dietary β-1,3/1,6-glucan supplementation in weaned piglets	The experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of β-1,3/1,6-glucan extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae on cellular immune responses and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) antibody production of weaned piglets. Thirty-two (Landrace × Large White; 26 days old; 7.05 ± 0.25 kg body weight) castrated male piglets were randomly allocated to four treatments, eight pigs per treatment. All piglets were vaccinated with live-attenuated Chinese strain cell vaccines at 26 days of age. The results showed that dietary supplementation with β-1,3/1,6-glucan could significantly (P < 0.01) enhance peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation activity in weaned piglets after 14 days administration, whereas no significant effect (P > 0.05) was observed on day 28. Dietary β-1,3/1,6-glucan supplementation could significantly enhance CSFV antibody blocking rate (P < 0.05) on days 14 and 21 after inoculation. Although dietary β-1,3/1,6-glucan supplementation did not significantly influence (P > 0.05) lymphocyte subgroups on day 14, high levels of β-1,3/1,6-glucan (100 and 200 mg/kg) increased the percentage of cytotoxic/suppressor lymphocytes (CD8

NNK and NNAL can induce lung cancer in laboratory animals but human data are limited. The association between prediagnostic levels of urinary total NNAL and risk of lung cancer development was evaluated in two prospective cohorts of Chinese cigarette smokers. We conducted a nested case-control study involving 246 cases of incident lung cancer and 24S cohort controls who were individually matched to the index cases by age, gender, neighborhood of residence at cohort enrollment, and date of urine collection. Urinary levels of total NNAL were significantly associated with risk of lung cancer in a dose-dependent manner. Relative to the lowest tertile, risks associated with the second and third tertiles of total NNAL were 1.43 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.86-2.37] and 2.11 (95% CI, 1.25-3.54), respectively (P for trend = 0.005) after adjustment for self-reported smoking history and urinary total cotinine.Smokers in the highest tertiles of urinary total NNAL and total cotinine exhibited a 8.5-fold (95% CI, 3.7-19.5) increased risk for lung cancer relative to smokers with comparable smoking history but possessing the lowest tertiles of urinary total NNAL and total cotinine.

70149111066	Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, smoking, and bladder cancer risk: Findings from the International Consortium of Bladder Cancer	Tobacco smoking is the most important and well-established bladder cancer risk factor and a rich source of chemical carcinogens and reactive oxygen species that can induce damage to DNA in urothelial cells. Therefore, common variation in DNA repair genes might modify bladder cancer risk. In this study, we present results from meta-analyses and pooled analyses conducted as part of the International Consortium of Bladder Cancer. We included data on 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms corresponding to seven DNA repair genes from 13 studies. Pooled analyses and meta-analyses included 5,282 cases and 5,954 controls of non-Latino white origin. We found evidence for weak but consistent associations with ERCC2 D312N [rs1799793; per-allele odds ratio (OR), 1.10; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.01-1.19; P = 0.021], NBN E185Q (rs1805794; per-allele OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18; P = 0.028), and XPC A499V (rs2228000; per-allele OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21; P = 0.044). The association with NBN E185Q was limited to ever smokers (interaction P = 0.002) and was strongest for the highest levels of smoking dose and smoking duration. Overall, our study provides the strongest evidence to date for a role of common variants in DNA repair genes in bladder carcinogenesis. ©2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) may modify the chemopreventive effect of ITC. The relationship between urinary total ITC and risk of gastric cancer was prospectively examined. Between 1986 and 1989, 18,244 middle-aged men in Shanghai, China were enrolled in a prospective study of diet and cancer and donated baseline urine and blood samples. Urinary ITC was quantified for 307 incident cases of gastric cancer that occurred during the first 16 years of follow-up, and 911 matched control subjects. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression methods. Seropositivity for antibodies to Helicobacter pylori and homozygous deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 were determined. Compared to the first tertile, ORs (95% CIs) of gastric cancer for the second and third tertiles of urinary total ITC were 0.83 (0.61-1.15) and 0.66 (0.47-0.94) (p

72749086356	Sequence variant on 3q28 and urinary bladder cancer risk: Findings from the Los Angeles-Shanghai bladder case-control study	Recently, the first genome-wide association study of bladder cancer identified an association of genomewide significance between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs715021 and urinary bladder cancer risk among European individuals. This SNP is in a haplotype block in linkage disequilibrium with the TP63 gene. We investigated the role of this SNP among 1,042 cases and 1,123 controls among non-Latino whites in Los Angeles County, CA and among Chinese in Shanghai, China. We confirmed an association between the A allele and bladder cancer risk [log-additive per A allele odds ratios (OR), 1.24; and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.02-1.52; P = 0.032] in Los Angeles County and a similar association in Shanghai (log-additive per A allele OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = 0.080). These estimates did not differ by study site, smoking status, or gender. However, the effects were greater in older individuals. Analysis within non-Latino whites, for whom we had histologic results, revealed that this association was restricted to low-risk tumors (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.17-1.92; P = 0.002) and absent among high-risk tumors (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.80-1.33; P = 0.790; heterogeneity, P = 0.019). A positive association (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.93-2.62; P = 0.089) was only observed among high-risk tumors from individuals older than 56 years old (interaction, P = 0.045). Our results suggest that a TP63 gene variant may increase susceptibility for the development of urinary bladder tumors with low risk of progression. © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

77449093071	Exogenous lysozyme influences Clostridium perfringens colonization and intestinal barrier function in broiler chickens	Necrotic enteritis is a worldwide poultry disease caused by the overgrowth of Clostridium perfringens in the small intestine. An experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial design (supplementation with or without 40 mg lysozyme/kg diet for chickens challenged with or without C. perfringens) was conducted to investigate the inhibitory efficacy of exogenous lysozyme against intestinal colonization by C. perfringens in chickens subject to oral inoculation of C. perfringens type A on days 17 to 20. The C. perfringens challenge resulted in significant increase of C. perfringens, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus populations in the ileum, bacteria translocation to the spleen, the intestinal lesion scores. There was significantly lower intestinal lysozyme activity in the duodenum and jejunum and weight gain during days 14 to 28 of the experiment. The addition of exogenous lysozyme significantly reduced the concentration of C. perfringens in the ileum and the intestinal lesion scores, inhibited the overgrowth of E. coli and Lactobacillus in the ileum and intestinal bacteria translocation to the spleen, and improved intestinal lysozyme activity in the duodenum and the feed conversion ratio of chickens. These findings suggest that exogenous lysozyme could decrease C. perfringens colonization and improve intestinal barrier function and growth performance of chickens. © 2010 Houghton Trust Ltd.

77749258095	Effects of different oil sources and vitamin e in breeder diet on egg quality, hatchability and development of the neonatal offspring	Effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and vitamin E (VE) supplementation in the diet of breeder hens on the egg quality and hatchability, lipid peroxides of the egg yolk, and development of the newly-hatched offspring chicks were investigated. A total of 800 Avian 48, 28 wk-old broiler breeders were assigned randomly to 4 groups with 4 replicates of 45 females and 5 males. Each group was fed one of the following four diets with different oil sources and levels of VE: corn oil (CO), fish oil (FO), CO+VE and FO+VE. The results showed that: i) Addition of FO in the breeder diet reduced the whole egg weight, yolk weight, albumen weight, yolk color score and neonatal offspring chick body weight without affecting the hatchability as compared to the CO treatment, ii) Addition of VE efficiently reduced the lipid peroxides of egg yolk from hens fed diets containing FO. iii) VE in the breeder diet significantly promoted the development of liver and heart of the chick offspring.

77956519055	Alcohol and tobacco use in relation to gastric cancer: A prospective study of men in Shanghai, China	Background: Epidemiologic findings of tobacco and alcohol use in relation to gastric cancer are inconsistent. Well-designed prospective studies examining their relationship are sparse. Methods: The association between cigarette smoking/alcohol intake and gastric cancer risk was examined in a population-based prospective cohort of 18,244 middle-aged and older men in Shanghai, China, who were enrolled in the study during 1986-1989. After up to 20 years of follow-up, 391 incident gastric cancer cases were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Ever smokers experienced a statistically significant increased risk of gastric cancer (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.27-1.99) compared with nonsmokers after adjustment for alcohol intake and other confounders. Among nondrinkers, smokers experienced 80% increased risk of gastric cancer (HR, 1.81; 95% CI,1.36, 2.41). Conversely, heavy drinkers experienced a statistically significant increase in risk of gastric cancer (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.05-2.04) among all subjects and a statistically nonsignificant 80% increased risk among never smokers. Further adjustment for Helicobacter pylori serology, serum levels of β-carotene and vitamin C, and urinary level of total isothiocyanates in combination with glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTT1 genotypes did not materially change the associations between smoking/alcohol consumption and gastric cancer risk. Conclusions: These results suggest that cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption may exert independent effects on the development of gastric cancer in this high-risk population. Impact: Modification of these lifestyle choices may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer. ©2010 AACR.

77957682847	Effect of taurine on intestinal morphology and utilisation of soy oil in chickens	The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of taurine on intestinal morphology and utilisation of dietary fatty acids in chicken. One-day-old broilers chickens were fed with a maize- and soybean-based diet containing soy oil, and supplemented with taurine at either 0 or 0.5g/kg. Result showed that the total bile acid in blood and lipase activity in the small intestine were elevated in 3-week-old broilers given the taurine-supplemented diet. No differences were observed for total serum bile acid and lipase activity between the groups of 6-week-old broilers. The development of the jejunum villus and ileum villus was inhibited, and the weight of jejunum and the relative height of intestinal mucosa were decreased in the chickens fed the taurinesupplemented diet.The rate of diet fatty acid utilisation was not different between the groups of 3- and 6-week-old chickens. Our results showed that dietary supplementation with taurine had no beneficial effect on intestinal morphology or utilisation of a soy oil diet in chickens. © 2010 British Poultry Science Ltd.

78650401034	Risk of urinary bladder cancer is associated with 8q24 variant rs9642880[T] in multiple racial/ethnic groups: Results from the Los Angeles-Shanghai case-control study	Background: Multiple chromosome 8q24 genotypic variants are strongly implicated in several cancers. Recent genome-wide association studies of urinary bladder cancer report risk to be associated with the T allele of rs9642880 on 8q24 among individuals of European descent. Methods: We examined associations between bladder cancer risk and genotypes defined by rs9642880 and each of 8 additional 8q24 variants associated with risk of other cancers, in both high-risk non-Hispanic white and low-risk Chinese participants enrolled in a large population-based case-control study conducted in Los Angeles County and Shanghai. Results: We confirmed association of rs9642880 T with bladder cancer risk not only among non-Hispanic whites but also among Chinese participants [overall per-allele relative risk estimate 1.32 (95% CI, 1.16-1.50; P = 0.000024)]. Subgroup analyses suggested that effects of rs9642880 are largely confined to nonsmokers and former smokers, and may be particularly important in the etiology of noninvasive papillary tumors. There was little indication that 8q24 SNPs associated with other cancer types - rs7008482, rs7000448, rs6983561, rs6983267, rs13281615, rs13254738, or rs10090154 - are associated with bladder cancer risk. Conclusions: Bladder cancer risk is associated specifically with variation in the discrete 8q24 region containing rs9642880. Factors other than rs9642880 genotypes seem to underlie differences in bladder cancer risk between non-Hispanic whites and Chinese. Impact: Characterization of functional consequences of genetic variation in the discrete region including rs9642880 is needed to understand biological basis of this bladder cancer-specific 8q24 association in these racial/ethnic groups characterized by both high and low risk of bladder cancer. ©2010 AACR.

78650405521	Tobacco smoke in relation to bladder cancer risk - The Shanghai bladder cancer study	Background: Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) contains tobacco carcinogens. Hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) are important isoenzymes in activation and detoxification, respectively, of tobacco carcinogens. Data on ETS and bladder cancer risk are sparse. Methods: We examined the effects of ETS alone and combined with NAT2/CYP1A2 on bladder cancer risk among lifelong-nonsmokers in a case-control study involving 195 patients and 261 controls in Shanghai, China. A comprehensive history of ETS exposure was determined through in-person interviews while CYP1A2 and NAT2 phenotypes by a caffeine-based urinary assay. Results: ETS exposure was related to an overall statistically nonsignificant 38% increased bladder cancer risk. The risk increased with increasing number of cigarettes smoked by household members or number of hours per day at workplace where coworkers smoked. Compared with no ETS exposure, subjects living with smoking parents during childhood had an OR of 2.43 (95% CI = 0.99-5.96) for bladder cancer. When all ETS sources were combined, the risk increased with increasing total ETS score (P

79251546456	Genetic variations on chromosomes 5p15 and 15q25 and bladder cancer risk: Findings from the Los Angeles-Shanghai bladder case-control study	Genome-wide association studies have associated common variations at chromosomes 5p15 and 15q25 with lung cancer risk. The 5p15 locus has also been associated with increased bladder cancer risk in a recent report. The 15q25 locus has been associated with nicotine dependence and self-reported number of cigarettes smoked per day in some studies and it was proposed that its association with lung cancer may be mediated through differences in smoking behavior. Here, we investigated the roles of variations at 5p15 (rs401681, rs402710, rs2736098 and rs2736100) and 15q25 (rs1051730 and rs8034191) in bladder cancer etiology in two case-control studies conducted separately in Los Angeles County, CA, USA (498 cases and 588 controls) and in Shanghai, China (506 cases and 530 controls). We replicated the association between the 5p15 locus and bladder cancer among non-Hispanic whites (NHW) in Los Angeles [for rs2736100, per C allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.48; P = 0.029] and among Chinese in Shanghai (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.47; P = 0.033). Both rs1051730 and rs8034191 at 15q25 were rare among Chinese. Among NHW, a significant association was found between rs8034191 and bladder cancer which persisted after adjustment for cigarette smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked per day and number of years of smoking (per C allele OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54; P = 0.017). Our results support 5p15 and 15q25 as susceptibility regions for bladder cancer risk. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

0035500421	Fish and shellfish consumption in relation to death from myocardial infarction among men in Shanghai, China	Between 1986 and 1989, 18,244 men aged 45-64 years in Shanghai, China, participated in a prospective study of diet and cancer. All participants completed an in-person, structured interview and provided blood and urine samples. As of September 1, 1998, 113 deaths from acute myocardial infarction were identified. After analyses were adjusted for age, total energy intake, and known cardiovascular disease risk factors, men who consumed ≥200 g of fish/shellfish per week had a relative risk of 0.41 (95% confidence interval: 0.22, 0.78) for fatal acute myocardial infarction compared with men consuming <50 g per week. Similarly, dietary intake of n-3 fatty acids derived from seafood also was significantly associated with reduced mortality from myocardial infarction. Neither dietary seafood nor n-3 fatty acid intake was associated with a reduced risk of death from stroke or ischemic heart disease other than acute myocardial infarction. However, approximately a 20% reduction in total mortality associated with weekly fish/shellfish intake was observed in the study population (relative risk = 0.79, 95% confidence interval: 0.69, 0.91). These prospective data suggest that eating fish and shellfish weekly reduces the risk of fatal myocardial infarction in middle-aged and older men in Shanghai, China.

0035864720	Effects of supplementation with vitamin E on the performance and the tissue peroxidation of broiler chicks and the stability of thigh meat against oxidative deterioration	Two experiments were conducted: Expt 1 determined the optimal allowance of vitamin E in the diet for broiler chicks aged 0-3 weeks; Expt 2 investigated the effects of different dietary levels of vitamin E (α-tocopherol) on the performance and the oxidative stability of thigh meat of broiler chicks during storage. In Expt 1, 1-day-old 900 broiler chicks were allocated to five treatments, each with six replicates (cages) of 22 as-hatched chicks for performance evaluation, and another cage of 45 male chicks for determining plasma and hepatic α-tocopherol and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration in blood and liver. The basal dietary α-tocopherol concentration was 13 mg/kg, and the five α-tocopherol acetate supplementation levels were 0, 5, 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg, For 0-3-week-old broiler chicks fed with maize-soya bean meal-soya oil type diet, supplementation of vitamin E did not influence the feed intake, but tended to improve growth and feed utilization, however there was no significant correlation between performance and vitamin E supplementation level. Significant positive correlations existed between dietary supplemental vitamin E level and plasma or hepatic α-tocopherol concentrations (P < 0.05), and a negative correlation with hepatic TBARS levels no matter at what age (11, 16 and 21 days). In Expt 2, 2200 broiler chicks were randomly allocated to five treatments with four replicates (pens) in each. Chicks were fed ad libitum five pellet diets supplemented with vitamin E at 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg of diet, respectively. The basal dietary α-tocopherol level of grower and finisher diets were 7 and 6 mg/kg, respectively. Supplementation of vitamin E tended to improve growth and feed utilization of birds during 0-3 weeks of age, but the performance from 0 to 6 weeks of age were not influenced. The hepatic α-tocopherol concentrations of 6-week-old chicks linearly increased with the dietary vitamin E levels (R

Between 1986 and 1989 serum samples were collected at baseline from 18 244 men, aged 45-65 years, without a history of cancer and living in Shanghai, China. IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 were measured in the serum of 135 men who developed colorectal cancer over 12 years of follow-up and 661 control subjects drawn from the cohort, who were matched to the index cases by neighbourhood of residence, age, and year and month of sample collection. Serum IGF-1 was not associated with risk of colorectal cancer. IGF-2 and IGFBP-3, on the other hand, exhibited statistically significant, positive associations with colorectal cancer risk when cases were confined to those diagnosed within a relatively short time period after enrolment (within 8 years). After adjustment for body mass index, cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, men in the highest versus the lowest quintile of IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 showed odds ratios of 2.74 (95% Cl = 1.67-4.50; 2-sided P for trend = 0.0008) and 2.85 (95% Cl = 1.69-4.81; 2-sided P for trend = 0.01), respectively. Our data thus suggest that circulating IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 can serve as early indicators of impending colorectal cancer. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.

0036712084	Urinary tea polyphenols in relation to gastric and esophageal cancers: A prospective study of men in Shanghai, China	Experimental studies have shown that tea and tea polyphenols have anticarcinogenic properties. There have been no prospective investigations examining the relationship between tea polyphenols and cancer risk using validated biomarkers. In the present study, a nested case-control study design was used to investigate the association between prediagnostic urinary tea polyphenol markers and subsequent risk of gastric and esophageal cancers. One hundred and ninety incident cases of gastric cancer and 42 cases of esophageal cancer occurring in members of the Shanghai Cohort (18 244 men aged 45-64 years at recruitment with up to 12 years of follow-up) were compared with 772 cohort control subjects. The control subjects were individually matched to the index cases by age, month and year of sample collection, and neighborhood of residence (case-control ratio = 1:3 for gastric cancer, 1:5 for esophageal cancer). Urinary tea polyphenols, including epigallocatechin (EGC and epicatechin (EC), and their respective metabolites 5-(3′,4′,5′-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (M4) and 5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valero-lactone (M6), were measured in all study subjects by means of a validated assay. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from logistic regression models. After exclusion of cases diagnosed under 4 years follow-up, urinary EGC positivity showed a statistically significant inverse association with gastric cancer (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.28-0.97) after adjustment for Helicobactor pylori seropositivity, smoking, alcohol drinking, and level of serum carotenes. The protective effect was primarily seen among subjects with low (below population median) serum carotenes. The odds ratio for EGC positivity was 0.49 (95% CI = 0.26-0.94) among subjects with low serum carotenes while the corresponding odds ratio among subjects with higher levels of serum carotenes was 1.02 (95 % Cl = 0.46-2.28). Similar tea polyphenol-cancer risk associations were observed when the gastric cancer and esophageal cancer sites were combined. The present study provides direct evidence that tea polyphenols may act as chemopreventive agents against gastric and esophageal cancer development.

The shape of the association of overweight and obesity with diabetes risk and its overall impact have not been adequately studied in Asia. Methods and Findings: A pooled cross-sectional analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between baseline body mass index (BMI, measured as weight in kg divided by the square of height in m) and self-reported diabetes status in over 900,000 individuals recruited in 18 cohorts from Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Logistic regression models were fitted to calculate cohort-specific odds ratios (OR) of diabetes for categories of increasing BMI, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. OR were pooled across cohorts using a random-effects meta-analysis.

79960885774	Effect of dietary Mintrex-Zn/Mn on performance, gene expression of Zn transfer proteins, activities of Zn/Mn related enzymes and fecal mineral excretion in broiler chickens	This study was to evaluate dietary Mintrex-Zn/Mn on growth performance, enzyme activities, and trace mineral absorption and utilization in 0-3-wk broilers. One hundred sixty day-old male broiler chickens were allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 5 replicate cages of 8 birds. Broilers were fed maize-soybean basal diets containing zinc (Zn, 100. mg/kg) and manganese (Mn, 120. mg/kg) from sulphate salts, while three other treatments included 100%, 80%, and 60% of the basal dietary mineral (actually 70%, 56% and 42% of sulphate salts based on 70% of sulphates would be available) from Mintrex-Zn/Mn, respectively. At the end of 3 weeks of age, the growth performance, mRNA abundance of Zn/Mn transfer proteins in jejunum mucosa, enzyme activities of liver lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), activities of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and CuZn-SOD and bone mineralization were measured. Total collection procedure in the balance trial of excreta was done from the age of 20 to 23 days. The results showed that supplementation with 100% Mintrex-Zn/Mn significantly improved the average daily gain (ADG) (P<0.01) and decreased fecal mineral excretion (P<0.05) compared to inorganic supplementation, but did not affect Zn/Mn transfer proteins mRNA abundance (P> 0.05). Supplementation with 80% Mintrex-Zn/Mn lowered serum ALP activity (P<0.05), however, it did not affect the growth performance, mRNA abundance of Zn/Mn transfer proteins and bone mineralization in comparison to inorganic supplementation (P> 0.05). The decrease of excretion is mainly due to the reduction of dietary supplemental level of minerals. Supplementation with 80% Mintrex-Zn/Mn decreased Mn and Zn excretion in the feces (mg/kg diet) by 39.79% and 30.13% (P<0.001), respectively. Supplementation with 60% Mintrex-Zn/Mn significantly decreased ADG (P<0.01), the length of metatarsus, serum ALP activities and mRNA expression of Zn transfer proteins but increased mortality and culling rate (P<0.05). There were no differences in activities of serum T-SOD, CuZn-SoD and Mn-SOD, and liver metabolic enzyme (LDH, GOT, and GPT) among inorganic versus Mintrex Zn/Mn supplementations. This study suggested that using approximately 30-40% Mintrex Zn/Mn could not substitute for the inorganic trace mineral. LDH, GOT, GPT may not be sensitive variables to reflect the states of the Zn and Mn in the body. Supplementation with 80% Mintrex-Zn/Mn (56% of inorganic mineral level) had a better effect in reducing the fecal mineral excretion without compromise in the growth performance. Using relative mineral concentration in fecal material may overestimate the values of mineral reduction, and it would be more accurate to use trace mineral concentration per chick day or per kg diet intake. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960694259	Aromatase (CYP19) promoter gene polymorphism and risk of nonviral hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma	BACKGROUND: Experimental studies suggest that sex hormones may induce or promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Androgens are converted to estrogens by the CYP19 gene product, aromatase. Hepatic aromatase level and activity have been shown to be markedly elevated in HCC. Aromatase expression in liver tumors is driven by a promoter upstream of CYP19 exon I.6. METHODS: First, the authors identified an A/C polymorphism in the exon I.6 promoter of the CYP19 gene. To determine whether allelic variants in the CYP19 I.6 promoter differ in their ability to drive gene expression, we carried out an in vitro reporter gene assay. Then, the authors studied the association between this polymorphism and HCC risk in 2 complementary case-control studies: 1 in high-risk southern Guangxi, China, and another in low-risk US non-Asians of Los Angeles County. RESULTS: Transcriptional activity was 60% higher for promoter vectors carrying the rs10459592 C allele compared with those carrying an A allele (P =.007). In both study populations, among subjects negative for at-risk serologic markers of hepatitis B or C, there was a dose-dependent association between number of high activity C allele and risk of HCC (P

80052426180	Urinary levels of the tobacco-specific carcinogen N'-nitrosonornicotine and its glucuronide are strongly associated with esophageal cancer risk in smokers	N'-Nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are tobacco-specific nitrosamines. NNN and NNK can induce cancers of the esophagus and lung, respectively, in laboratory animals, but data on human esophageal cancer are lacking. The association between levels of NNN and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), an NNK metabolite, in urine samples collected before diagnosis and risk of esophageal cancer was examined in 77 patients with esophageal cancer and 223 individually matched controls, all current smokers, from a cohort of 18244 Chinese men in Shanghai, China, followed from 1986 to 2008. Urinary total NNN (free NNN plus NNN-N-glucuronide) was significantly higher, whereas the percentage of its detoxification product NNN-N-glucuronide was significantly lower in cases than controls. Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of esophageal cancer for the second and third tertiles of total NNN were 3.99 (1.25-12.7) and 17.0 (3.99-72.8), respectively, compared with the first tertile after adjustment for urinary total NNAL and total cotinine and smoking intensity and duration (P

In this study, we quantified prediagnostic urinary levels of r-1,t-2,3,c-4-tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene (PheT), a validated biomarker of PAH uptake and metabolism, as well as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1- (3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and its glucuronides (total NNAL), and cotinine and its glucuronides (total cotinine), validated biomarkers of uptake of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, and nicotine, respectively, in relation to lung cancer risk among current smokers in a nested case-control study within a cohort of 18,244 Chinese men in Shanghai, China. Urinary levels of PheT, total NNAL, and total cotinine were significantly higher in cases than controls (N = 476 matched pairs). ORs (95% confidence intervals) for lung cancer in the second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles of PheT were 1.70 (1.00-2.88), 1.07 (0.62-1.84), 1.48 (0.86-2.53), and 2.34 (1.33-4.11), respectively, relative to the lowest quartile (Ptrend = 0.023) after adjustment for self-reported smoking intensity and duration and urinary total NNAL and total cotinine. This study also confirmed that urinary total NNAL and total cotinine are independently related to lung cancer risk. ©2011 AACR.

8344244570	Prediagnostic levels of serum micronutrients in relation to risk of gastric cancer in Shanghai, China	Data on blood levels of specific carotenoids and vitamins in relation to gastric cancer are scarce. Little is known about the relationship between prediagnostic serum levels of carotenoids other than β-carotene and risk of gastric cancer especially in non-Western populations. Prediagnostic serum concentrations of excarotene, β;-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein/ zeaxanthin, retinol, α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, and vitamin C were determined on 191 cases and 570 matched controls within a cohort of 18,244 middle-aged or older men in Shanghai, China, with a follow-up of 12 years. High serum levels of α-carotene, β-carotene, and lycopene were significantly associated with reduced risk of developing gastric cancer (all P s for trend ≤ 0.05); the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the highest versus the lowest quartile of α-carotene, β-carotene, and lycopene were 0.38 (0.13-1.11), 0.54 (0.32-0.89), and 0.55 (0.30-1.00), respectively. Increased serum level of vitamin C was significantly associated with reduced risk of gastric cancer among men who neither smoked cigarettes over lifetime nor consumed ≥3 drinks of alcohol per day; the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the second, third, and fourth quartile categories were 0.69 (0.28-1.70), 0.36 (0.14-0.94), and 0.39 (0.15-0.98), respectively, compared with the lowest quartile of vitamin C (P for trend = 0.02). There were no statistically significant relationships of serum levels of β-cryptox-anthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, retinol, α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol with gastric cancer risk. The present study implicates that dietary carotenes, lycopene, and vitamin C are potential chemopreventive agents for gastric cancer in humans.

84155165669	LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with bladder cancer risk among nonsmoking Chinese	Reduced levels of global DNA methylation, assessed in peripheral blood, have been associated with bladder cancer risk in European and American populations. Similar data are lacking in Asian populations where genetic differences, lifestyle factors and different environmental exposures may affect DNA methylation and its risk relationship with bladder cancer. The association between global DNA methylation measured at long interspersed nuclear element (LINE-1) repeat regions through bisulfite pyrosequencing in lymphocyte DNA and bladder cancer risk was examined in a case-control study of 510 bladder cancer patients and 528 healthy control subjects in Shanghai, China. In an initial analysis restricted to control subjects, LINE-1 methylation was elevated among men, those who frequently consumed cruciferous vegetables and those with a null genotype for either glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) or GSTT1. In contrast, reduced LINE-1 methylation was found in current smokers with a high-cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) phenotype index. In a case-control analysis, there was no significant association of LINE-1 methylation with case status, although reduced LINE-1 methylation was associated with increased risk of bladder cancer among never smokers (p for trend = 0.03); analysis by tertile revealed odds ratios (ORs) of 1.91 (lowest tertile; 95% CI = 1.17-3.13) and 1.34 (middle tertile; 95% CI = 0.79-2.28) when compared with the highest tertile. This association was strongest among nonsmokers null for either the GSTM1 or GSTT1 genotype (p for trend = 0.006). Further research is needed to understand the relationships between methyl group availability and LINE-1 methylation in relation to bladder cancer risk. Copyright © 2011 UICC.

84155167905	Cytochrome P4501A2 phenotype and bladder cancer risk: The Shanghai bladder cancer study	Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is hypothesized to catalyze the activation of arylamines, known human bladder carcinogens present in cigarette smoke. The relationship between CYP1A2 phenotype and bladder cancer risk was examined in a case-control study involving 519 patients and 514 controls in Shanghai, China. Both CYP1A2 and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) phenotypic status were determined by a caffeine-based urinary assay. Our study showed that among smokers at urine collection, patients with bladder cancer had statistically significantly higher CYP1A2 phenotype scores compared to control subjects (p = 0.001). The odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of bladder cancer for the second, third and fourth quartiles of the CYP1A2 score were 1.31 (0.53-3.28), 2.04 (0.90-4.60) and 2.82 (1.32-6.05), respectively, relative to the lowest quartile (p for trend = 0.003). NAT2 slow acetylation phenotype was associated with a statistically significant 40% increased risk of bladder cancer, and the relationship was independent of subjects' smoking status. Subjects possessing the NAT2 slow acetylation phenotype and the highest tertile of CYP1A2 scores showed the highest risk for bladder cancer. Their odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) was 2.13 (1.24-3.68) relative to their counterparts possessing the NAT2 rapid acetylation phenotype and the lowest tertile of CYP1A2 scores. The findings of our study demonstrate that CYP1A2 phenotype may be an important contributing factor in the development of smoking-related bladder cancer in humans. Copyright © 2011 UICC.

84855409443	Modulation of the metabolism of airborne pollutants by glucoraphanin-rich and sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout beverages in Qidong, China	Epidemiological evidence has suggested that consumption of a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables reduces the risk of several types of cancers and chronic degenerative diseases. In particular, broccoli sprouts are a convenient and rich source of the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin, which can release the chemopreventive agent, sulforaphane, an inducer of glutathione S-transferases. Two broccoli sprout-derived beverages, one sulforaphane-rich (SFR) and the other glucoraphanin-rich (GRR), were evaluated for pharmacodynamic action in a crossover clinical trial design. Study participants were recruited from the farming community of He Zuo Township, Qidong, China, previously documented to have a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma with concomitant exposures to aflatoxin and more recently characterized with exposures to substantive levels of airborne pollutants. Fifty healthy participants were randomized into two treatment arms. The study protocol was as follows: a 5 days run-in period, a 7 days administration of beverage, a 5 days washout period and a 7 days administration of the opposite beverage. Urinary excretion of the mercapturic acids of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, ethylene oxide and benzene were measured both pre- and postinterventions using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Statistically significant increases of 20-50% in the levels of excretion of glutathione-derived conjugates of acrolein, crotonaldehyde and benzene were seen in individuals receiving SFR, GRR or both compared with their preintervention baseline values. No significant differences were seen between the effects of SFR versus GRR. Intervention with broccoli sprouts may enhance detoxication of airborne pollutants and attenuate their associated health risks. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

84857359501	Dietary mineral sources altered lipid and antioxidant profiles in broiler breeders and posthatch growth of their offsprings	The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of mineral sources on broiler breeders and their offsprings. Broiler breeding hens were fed with diets containing either organic or inorganic trace minerals at equal levels, i.e., (1) control group was fed with basal diet supplemented with inorganic trace minerals; (2) OZ group was fed with organic Zn instead of sulfate; and (3) OTM group was fed with organic Cu, Mn, Zn, and Se instead of inorganic sources. Results indicated that OTM supplementation decreased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride and increased yolk triglyceride via increasing high-density lipid protein cholesterol and decreasing low-density lipid protein cholesterol and very low-density lipid protein (VLDL) in plasma. OZ diets decreased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride mainly by reducing VLDL concentration. For control group, increased lipid concentrations resulted in increased lipid peroxidation in serum and malondialdehyde retention in yolk. Zn retention was not affected. Otherwise, OZ diet was observed to decrease Cu in yolk and albumen. While for OTM group, albumen Cu, albumen Se, and hepatic Se of hatched chicks were increased, but yolk Cu was decreased. Moreover, organic mineral supplementations improved broilers' growth performance. In conclusion, organic mineral supplementation in breeders' diets protected breeders from lipid peroxidation, increased egg nutrition retention, and benefit for growth of broilers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84859646950	Urinary levels of volatile organic carcinogen and toxicant biomarkers in relation to lung cancer development in smokers	Besides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), which are established lung carcinogens, tobacco smoke also contains relatively large quantities of volatile organic carcinogens and toxicants, including 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, benzene, acrolein and crotonaldehyde. Although animal experiments showed that some of these compounds can induce tumors in multiple organs including the lung, epidemiological studies of their relationship with lung cancer in smokers have not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we quantified urinary mercapturic acid metabolites of 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, benzene, acrolein and crotonaldehyde in addition to urinary biomarkers for PAH, NNK and nicotine in 343 lung cancer cases and 392 matched controls among a cohort of 18 244 Chinese men in Shanghai, China, followed from 1986 to 2006. Compared with the lowest quartiles, highest quartiles of all measured mercapturic acids were associated with statistically significantly ∼2-fold increased risk for lung cancer (all P's for trend <0.01) after adjustment for smoking intensity and duration. The positive associations between biomarkers of ethylene oxide, benzene or acrolein and lung cancer risk remained statistically significant after adjustment for biomarkers of PAH and NNK, whereas urinary total cotinine completely explained the mercapturic acid metabolites and lung cancer associations (all P's for trend ≥0.39). We conclude that mercapturic acid metabolites of 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, benzene, acrolein and crotonaldehyde may not be independent risk predictors of lung cancer among Shanghai smokers, in contrast to biomarkers of PAH, NNK and nicotine exposure. © The Author 2012.

84861057798	The influence of dietary calcium and phosphorus imbalance on intestinal NaPi-IIb and calbindin mRNA expression and tibia parameters of broilers	A 2×2 factorial experiment was conducted to study the effect of dietary calcium and non-phytate phosphorus (nPP) imbalance on calbindin and NaPi-IIb mRNA levels in the small intestine and tibia parameters of broiler chicks. One hundred and forty four 1-d-old Arbor Acres male broiler chicks were divided into four treatments consisted of six replicates with six chicks each. The two dietary calcium levels were 1.10% and 0.60%, and two dietary nPP levels were 0.50% and 0.27%. Results showed that a high Ca/nPP ratio diet (4.07:1) significantly depressed feed intake and weight gain of broilers (p<0.05), but a lower Ca:nPP ratio (1.2:1) had no influence (p>0.05). Low-Ca with low-P diet resulted in low tibia minerals and tibia breaking strength of broilers, and all the tibia parameters were further decreased when the dietary ratio of Ca to P was relative higher. Low dietary Ca or P up-regulated the calbindin and NaPi-IIb mRNA expression levels. Low Ca with normal P diet up-regulated duodenal calbindin mRNA expression level to the greatest extent. Low P with a normal Ca diet significantly enhanced NaPi-IIb mRNA expression level to the highest extent. These results suggest that the calbindin and NaPi-IIb mRNA expression were enhanced by the imbalance between dietary Ca and nPP, and their expression were not only influenced by Ca or nPP level, but also the ratio of Ca:nPP.

84863372257	Dietary magnesium sulfate supplementation protects heat stress-induced oxidative damage by restoring the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes in broilers	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary magnesium sulfate supplementation on heat stress-induced oxidative damage in broilers. One hundred twenty 14-day-old broilers were randomly assigned into four treatment groups with three replicates of ten birds each. The broilers were reared under normal ambient temperature (24±1°C) fed with a basal (control) diet or reared under high ambient temperature (35±1°C between 1000 and 1800 h, 8 h each day) fed with a basal diet supplemented with magnesium sulfate (0, 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg of diet) from 14 to 42 days of age. Growth performance and oxidative damage were evaluated in each treatment group. Our results demonstrated that dietary magnesium sulfate supplementation significantly prevented heat stress-induced oxidative damage and improved growth performance in broilers compared with that of control. Mechanistically, this beneficial effect was mediated, at least partly, by restoring the activity of anti-oxidative enzymes. This finding suggests that magnesium sulfate supplementation might be a potential strategy to attenuate heat stress-induced detrimental effects in broilers raised in summer season or tropical areas. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Subjects and methods: We harmonized the data across 12 cohort studies from mainland China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, comprising over 500 000 subjects followed for an average of 10.6 years. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for BMI and (only among men) tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking. Results: A total of 134 incident cases were observed (49 adenocarcinoma, 11 carcinoid, 46 other histologic types, and 28 of unknown histology). There was a statistically non-significant trend toward increased HR in subjects with high BMI [HR for BMI >27.5 kg/m.

84865658512	Evaluation of herbal methionine source in broiler diets	A study was conducted to evaluate an herbal methionine replacement product in diets for young broiler chicks. A corn-soybean meal diet that was complete in all respects but methionine was prepared and divided into three aliquots. One was supplemented with 0.30% DL methionine and another was supplemented with the herbal methionine replacement product. Each of these was then blended with the unsupplemented basal diet to provide diets with 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30% of either DL methionine or the herbal methionine replacement product. Each diet was fed to twelve pens of five male broiler type chicks each in electrically heated battery brooders. The diets and tap water were provided for ad libitum feeding from day of hatch to 18 d of age. Analysis of the diets indicated that the methionine activity of the diets with DL methionine was close to expected values but no apparent increase in analyzed methionine activity in diets supplemented with the herbal methionine replacement product. Body weight gain and feed conversion of birds fed the diets with DL methionine were significantly superior to that of birds fed the diets with the herbal methionine replacement product. No significant differences were observed between birds fed the two products for weight of digestive or immune organs when expressed as a percentage of body weight. These data suggest that the herbal methionine replacement product is not suitable for use as a methionine source in diets for young broiler chicks. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2012.

0037306683	Effects of microbial phytase replacing partial inorganic phosphorus supplementation and xylanase on the growth performance and nutrient digestibility in broilers fed wheat-based diets	Two experiments were conducted with broilers to investigate the feasibility of microbial phytase replacing partial inorganic phosphorus supplementation and the synergistic effects of xylanase (320 FTU/kg) supplementation alone or in combination with phytase (750 U/kg) replacing 0.08% dietary inorganic phosphorus, on the growth performance and utilization of nutrients in broilers fed wheat-based diets. In Experiment 1, 540 broilers were fed five diets for 6 weeks. Diets C0 and C1 were corn-based diets and 0.08% inorganic P supplementation was replaced with 750 U phytase/kg feed in Diet C1. Diets W0, W1 and W2 were wheat-based diets supplemented with microbial phytase 0, 750, 750 U/kg feed and 0, 0.08% and 0.16% dietary inorganic P were replaced, respectively. In Experiment 2, 432 broilers were divided into four treatments to determine the synergistic effects of supplemental xylanase and phytase replacing 0.08% inorganic P. Four experimental diets were arranged according to a 2x2 factorial design. The results indicated that addition of phytase increased the digestibility of phytic P by 31.0 to 55%, dramatically decreased the excretion of phytic P and total P by 31.6 to 55.0% and 13.8 to 32.9%, respectively (p<0.01). It is feasible to completely replace 0.08% inorganic phosphorus supplementation with microbial phytase 750 U/kg in corn- or wheat-based diets for broilers. Addition of xylanase alone or in combination with phytase replacing 0.08% dietary inorganic P, increased body weight gain and feed utilization efficiency of broilers fed wheat-based diets (p<0.10) and decreased overall mortality (p<0.10). In the groups of birds supplementing xylanase 320 FTU/kg feed, a marked elevation of the dietary AME was observed (p<0.05). Addition of phytase replacing 0.08% dietary inorganic phosphorus, concurrently with xylanase supplementation had additive effects on the apparent digestibility of dietary phytic P and overall feed conversion ratio (p<0.05).

0037094239	Insulin-like growth factor I, IGF-binding protein 3, and lung cancer risk in a prospective study of men in China	Background: Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in the lung and other tissues by interacting with the IGF-I receptor. The major binding protein for IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), modulates the effects of IGF-I but also inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis independent of IGF-I and its receptor. In a prospective study of men in Shanghai, China, we examined the association between serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and the subsequent risk of lung cancer. Methods: From 1986 to 1989, serum was collected from 18 244 men aged 45-64 years living in Shanghai without a history of cancer. We analyzed IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in serum from 230 case patients who developed incident lung cancer during follow-up and from 740 control subjects. Results: Among 230 case patients and 659 matched control subjects, increased IGF-I levels were not associated with increased risk of lung cancer. However, for subjects in the highest quartile relative to the lowest quartile of IGFBP-3, the odds ratio (OR) for lung cancer, adjusted for smoking and IGF-I, was 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 1.02). When the analysis was restricted to ever smokers (184 case patients and 344 matched control subjects), the OR for lung cancer in men in the highest quartile of IGFBP-3 relative to those in the lowest quartile, adjusted for smoking and IGF-I, was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.18 to 0.92). Conclusions: In this prospective study of Chinese men, higher serum levels of IGF-I did not increase the risk of lung cancer. However, subjects with higher serum levels of IGFBP-3 were at reduced risk of lung cancer. This finding is consistent with experimental data that indicate that IGFBP-3 can inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis independent of IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor.

84866481264	Conjugated linoleic acids alleviate the immunosuppression of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in broiler chickens exposed to cyclosporin A	The immunoregulatory actions of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) of relevance immunosuppression were investigated. To test the hypothesis that CLA ameliorate immunosuppression, we developed the immunosuppressive model of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in broiler chickens induced by cyclosporin A. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes of broiler chickens were cultured with media containing various concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 200 μmol/L) of c9, t11-CLA and t10, c12-CLA to investigate the effects of CLA isomers on peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin- 2, the activity of phospholipase C, and protein kinase C production. Results suggested that CLA alleviated the immunosuppression of T lymphocytes in broiler chickens exposed to cyclosporin A through increasing of peripheral blood T lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2. The 2 CLA isomers enhanced T lymphocyte proliferation at low concentration and inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation at high concentration. In addition, the effect of c9, t11-CLA was better than that of t10, c12-CLA. At the cellular level, the effects of CLA on the alleviation of immunosuppression in T lymphocytes are mainly attributable to increasing the signaling molecules, such as phospholipase C and protein kinase C. © 2012 Poultry Science Association Inc.

84869805724	Evaluation of the role of glycine in low-protein amino acid-supplemented diets	A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of adding Gly to broiler starter diets in which the CP was decreased from 24 to 18% by adding essential amino acids. Effects on live performance, development of the digestive organs, and bone and some serum parameters were evaluated. Male broiler chicks were fed from hatch to 18 d on 1 of 14 experimental diets in which amino acids were added in turn as they became limiting. The order of limiting amino acids was Met (TSAA), Lys, Thr, Val, Ile, Arg, Trp, and His. For diets supplemented with Thr through His, aliquots of the diets were supplemented with Gly to provide 2.0% Gly + Ser. Each treatment was fed to 6 pens of 5 male chicks of a commercial strain. The BW and FCR of broilers fed diets in which Arg, Trp, and His became limiting were significantly lower than those of birds fed diets in which Met and Lys were limiting. The addition of Gly significantly improved the BW and FCR of broilers fed the diets in which Arg, Trp, and His became limiting and significantly improved the FCR of diets in which Val became limiting. Significant differences were observed in relative organ weights between chicks fed the diets in which Thr, Val, and Ile became limiting and those fed the diets with Met and Lys added. Addition of Gly to some diets significantly increased or decreased the relative weights of the various intestinal segments, but not in a consistent manner. Significant differences were observed for tibia ash, tibia diameter, and bone-breaking strength of broilers among the broilers fed the diet of limiting amino acids and those fed only Met and Lys. Supplementation with Gly increased bone-breaking strength and the diameter of the tibia. No significant differences were observed for urea nitrogen, ammonia, and blood urea nitrogen levels in the serum of broilers fed the diets with the first 8 limiting amino acids. Supplemental Gly significantly increased the serum urea nitrogen and serum ammonia content. Therefore, Gly may be critical in the use of low-protein amino acidsupplemented diets for broilers. © 2012 Poultry Science Association, Inc.

84877956751	Elevated 4-aminobiphenyl and 2,6-dimethylaniline hemoglobin adducts and increased risk of bladder cancer among lifelong nonsmokers-the shanghai bladder cancer study	Background: 4-Aminobiphenyl (ABP) is an established human bladder carcinogen, with tobacco smoke being a major source of human exposure. Other arylamine compounds, including 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA), have been implicated as possible human bladder carcinogens. Hemoglobin adducts of 4-ABP and 2,6-DMA are validated biomarkers of exposure to those compounds in humans. Methods: The Shanghai Bladder Cancer Study enrolled 581 incident bladder cancer cases and 604 population controls. Each participant was solicited for his/her history of tobacco use and other lifestyle factors and donation of blood and urine specimens. Red blood cell lysates were used to quantify both hemoglobin adducts of 4-ABP and 2,6-DMA. Urine samples were used to quantify total cotinine. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for bladder cancer were estimated using unconditional logistic regression methods. Results: Among lifelong nonsmokers, ORs (95% CIs) of bladder cancer for low (below median of positive values) and high versus undetectable levels of 2,6-DMA hemoglobin adducts were 3.87 (1.39-10.75) and 6.90 (3.17-15.02), respectively (Ptrend < 0.001). Similarly, among lifelong nonsmokers, ORs (95% CIs) of bladder cancer for third and fourth versus first/second quartiles of 4-ABP hemoglobin adducts was 1.30 (0.76-2.22) and 2.29 (1.23-4.24), respectively (Ptrend = 0.009). The two associations were independent of each other. Conclusion: Hemoglobin adducts of 4-ABP and 2,6-DMA were significantly and independently associated with increased bladder cancer risk among lifelong nonsmokers in Shanghai, China. Impact: The findings of the present study in China with previous data in Los Angeles, California strongly implicate arylamines as potential causal agents of human bladder cancer.

84879175653	Interactions between phytase and xylanase enzymes in male broiler chicks fed phosphorus-deficient diets from 1 to 18 days of age	A total of 735 one-day-old male broiler chicks were used to evaluate the interactions between different levels of phytase and xylanase enzymes on performance and bone mineralization. Basal nonphytate P (nPP)-deficient diets (0.15%) were supplemented with different levels of phytase [0X, 1X, 2X, 3X, and 4X of recommended level (X = 500 phytase units per kg of feed)] alone or in combination with 3 levels of a xylanase preparation [0X, 1X, and 2X of recommended level (X = 0.1 g per kg of feed; a mixture with predominantly xylanase activity)]. A standard curve was developed using different levels of nPP (0.15 to 0.45%) to estimate the P equivalency of each enzyme combination. Treatments were replicated with 7 pens of 5 chicks each. The findings indicated that reducing dietary nPP level had a severely negative influence on bird performance and bone ash content. Results also showed that increasing levels of phytase significantly (P < 0.05) improved BW, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, mortality, and toe and tibia bone ash contents in a dose-dependent fashion. The P equivalency of phytase was also dose dependent, with estimates of 0.08, 0.11, 0.15, and 0.19 for 1X, 2X, 3X, and 4X supplementation levels of phytase, respectively. Xylanase preparation at 1X level failed to influence measured criterion; however, increasing the level of xylanase (2X) resulted in deteriorating BW and feed conversion ratio. The P equivalency of xylanase preparation at 1X and 2X was estimated as 0.010 and 0.014%. There were no interactions between phytase and xylanase preparation (P > 0.05). In conclusion, phytase was effective in improving bird performance and bone mineralization; however, xylanase supplementation failed to enhance phytase efficacy. © 2013 Poultry Science Association Inc.

84885235556	Association between body mass index and cardiovascular disease mortality in east Asians and south Asians: Pooled analysis of prospective data from the Asia Cohort Consortium	Objective To evaluate the association between body mass index and mortality from overall cardiovascular disease and specific subtypes of cardiovascular disease in east and south Asians. Design Pooled analyses of 20 prospective cohorts in Asia, including data from 835 082 east Asians and 289 815 south Asians. Cohorts were identified through a systematic search of the literature in early 2008, followed by a survey that was sent to each cohort to assess data availability. Setting General populations in east Asia (China, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and Korea) and south Asia (India and Bangladesh). Participants 1 124 897 men and women (mean age 53.4 years at baseline). Main outcome measures Risk of death from overall cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, and (in east Asians only) stroke subtypes. Results 49 184 cardiovascular deaths (40 791 in east Asians and 8393 in south Asians) were identified during a mean follow-up of 9.7 years. East Asians with a body mass index of 25 or above had a raised risk of death from overall cardiovascular disease, compared with the reference range of body mass index (values 22.5-24.9; hazard ratio 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.15), 1.27 (1.20 to 1.35), 1.59 (1.43 to 1.76), 1.74 (1.47 to 2.06), and 1.97 (1.44 to 2.71) for body mass index ranges 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, 30.0-32.4, 32.5-34.9, and 35.0-50.0, respectively). This association was similar for risk of death from coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke; for haemorrhagic stroke, the risk of death was higher at body mass index values of 27.5 and above. Elevated risk of death from cardiovascular disease was also observed at lower categories of body mass index (hazard ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.39) and 2.16 (1.37 to 3.40) for body mass index ranges 15.0-17.4 and <15.0, respectively), compared with the reference range. In south Asians, the association between body mass index and mortality from cardiovascular disease was less pronounced than that in east Asians. South Asians had an increased risk of death observed for coronary heart disease only in individuals with a body mass index greater than 35 (hazard ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 3.12). Conclusions Body mass index shows a U shaped association with death from overall cardiovascular disease among east Asians: increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease is observed at lower and higher ranges of body mass index. A high body mass index is a risk factor for mortality from overall cardiovascular disease and for specific diseases, including coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, and haemorrhagic stroke in east Asians. Higher body mass index is a weak risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular disease in south Asians.

84886425512	Prediagnostic levels of serum one-carbon metabolites and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Rats fed diets deficient in choline develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor DNA from these animals is characteristically hypomethylated, suggesting that disruption of the one-carbon metabolism pathway is an underlying mechanism for hepatocarcinogenesis. Prospective studies in humans on circulating choline and other one-carbon metabolites and hepatocellular carcinoma risk have been lacking. Methods: We prospectively examined the association between prediagnostic serum concentrations of onecarbon metabolites including betaine, choline, cystathionine, homocysteine, methionine, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP, the bioactive form of vitamin B6) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma based on a nested case-control study of 297 incident cases and 631 matched controls from a cohort of 18,244 men in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression methods were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for established risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: Serum choline and PLP were associated with statistically significant reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas serum cystathionine, methionine, andSAMwere associated with increased hepatocellular carcinoma risk (all Ptrend < 0.05). The inverse associations for hepatocellular carcinoma risk with choline and PLP remained statistically significant after adjusting for all potential confounders. The multivariate-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for the highest versus lowest quintiles of serum choline and PLP were 0.35 (0.16-0.78; P =0.010) and 0.44 (0.25-0.78; P = 0.005), respectively. There were no associations for hepatocellular carcinoma risk with 5-MTHF, betaine, or homocysteine. Conclusion: The inverse associations between choline and vitamin B6 and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development are novel and warrant further investigation. Impact: Identifying new modifiable factors for hepatocellular carcinoma prevention is warranted. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

0242390079	Breast cancer and hormonal contraceptives: Collaborative reanalysis of individual data on 53 297 women with breast cancer and 100 239 women without breast cancer from 54 epidemiological studies	Background: The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer has brought together and reanalysed the worldwide epidemiological evidence on the relation between breast cancer risk and use of hormonal contraceptives. Methods: Individual data on 53 297 women with breast cancer and 100 239 women without breast cancer from 54 studies conducted in 25 countries were collected, checked, and analysed centrally. Estimates of the relative risk for breast cancer were obtained by a modification of the Mantel-Haenszel method. All analyses were stratified by study, age at diagnosis, parity, and, where appropriate, the age a woman was when her first child was born, and the age she was when her risk of conception ceased. Findings: The results provide strong evidence for two main conclusions. First, while women are taking combined oral contraceptives and in the 10 years after stopping there is a small increase in the relative risk of having breast cancer diagnosed (relative risk [95% Cl] in current users 1·24 [1·15-1·33], 2p<0·00001; 1-4 years after stopping 1·6 [1·08-1·23], 2p=0·00001; 5-9 years after stopping 1·07 [1·02-1·13], 2p=0·009). Second, there is no significant excess risk of having breast cancer diagnosed 10 or more years after stopping use (relative risk 1·01 [0·96-1·05], NS). The cancers diagnosed in women who had used combined oral contraceptives were less advanced clinically than those diagnosed in women who had never used these contraceptives: for ever-users compared with never-users, the relative risk for tumours that had spread beyond the breast compared with localised tumours was 0·88 (0·81-0·95; 2p=0·002). There was no pronounced variation in the results for recency of use between women with different background risks of breast cancer, including women from different countries and ethnic groups, women with different reproductive histories, and those with or without a family history of breast cancer. The studies included in this collaboration represent about 90% of the epidemiological information on the topic, and what is known about the other studies suggests that their omission has not materially affected the main conclusions. Other features of hormonal contraceptive use such as duration of use, age at first use, and the dose and type of hormone within the contraceptives had little additional effect on breast cancer risk, once recency of use had been taken into account. Women who began use before age 20 had higher relative risks of having breast cancer diagnosed while they were using combined oral contraceptives and in the 5 years after stopping than women who began use at older ages, but the higher relative risks apply at ages when breast cancer is rare and, for a given duration of use, earlier use does not result in more cancers being diagnosed than use beginning at older ages. Because breast cancer incidence rises steeply with age, the estimated excess number of cancers diagnosed in the period between starting use and 10 years after stopping increases with age at last use: for example, among 10 000 women from Europe or North America who used oral contraceptives from age 16 to 19, from age 20 to 24, and from age 25 to 29, respectively, the estimated excess number of cancers diagnosed up to 10 years after stopping use is 0·5 (95% Cl 0·3-0·7), 1·5 (0·7-2·3), and 4·7 (2·7-6·7). Up to 20 years after cessation of use the difference between ever-users and never-users is not so much in the total number of cancers diagnosed, but in their clinical presentation, with the breast cancers diagnosed in ever-users being less advanced clinically than those diagnosed in never-users. The relation observed between breast cancer risk and hormone exposure is unusual, and it is not possible to infer from these data whether it is due to an earlier diagnosis of breast cancer in ever-users, the biological effects of hormonal contraceptives, or a combination of reasons. Interpretation: Women who are currently using combined oral contraceptives or have used them in the past 10 years are at a slightly increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed, although the additional cancers diagnosed tend to be localised to the breast. There is no evidence of an increase in the risk of having breast cancer diagnosed 10 or more years after cessation of use, and the cancers diagnosed then are less advanced clinically than the cancers diagnosed in never-users.

84890033720	Impact of postdiagnosis smoking on long-term survival of cancer patients: The Shanghai Cohort Study	Background: Cancer is the number one cause of death among men in China. Cigarette smoking is the most preventable cause of cancer. Data on the impact of continued smoking after cancer diagnosis on survival of patients with cancer are sparse. Methods: We studied the association between postdiagnosis smoking and risk of all-cause death among 1,632 incident cancer patients in the Shanghai Cohort Study, a population-based prospective cohort of 18,244 men in Shanghai. The change of smoking status after baseline interview was ascertained through annual inperson interviews. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all-cause mortality associated with change in smoking status. Results: Patients who continued smoking after cancer diagnosis experienced a statistically significant 59% (95% CI, 36-86) increase in risk of death compared with patients with cancer who did not smoke after cancer diagnosis. Among current smokers at cancer diagnosis, HRs (95% CIs) were 1.79 (1.49-2.16) in all patients with cancer, 2.36 (1.63-3.42) in patients with lung cancer, 1.63 (0.98-2.73) in patients with stomach cancer, 2.31 (1.40-3.81) in patients with colorectal cancer, and 2.95 (1.09-7.95) in patients with bladder cancer who continued smoking compared with their counterparts who stopped smoking after cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: Postdiagnosis cigarettes smoking significantly increased the risk of death for male patients with cancer. Impact: These data provide new information about smoking and cancer survival, which should inform future research into the contextual and individual-level barriers that may result in inadequate attention of smoking among patients with cancer in the postdiagnosis setting. © 2013 AACR.

84893408327	Urinary metabolites of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and volatile organic compounds in relation to lung cancer development in lifelong never smokers in the Shanghai Cohort Study	Exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from various environmental and occupational sources are considered a primary risk factor for lung cancer among lifelong never smokers, based largely on results from epidemiologic studies utilizing selfreported exposure information. Prospective, biomarker-based human studies on the role of PAH and other airborne carcinogens in the development of lung cancer among lifelong non-smokers have been lacking. We prospectively investigated levels of urinary metabolites of a PAH and volatile organic compounds in relation to lung cancer risk in a nested case-control study of 82 cases and 83 controls among lifelong never smokers of the Shanghai Cohort Study, a prospective cohort of 18 244 Chinese men aged 45-64 years at enrollment. We quantified three PAH metabolites: r-1,t-2,3,c-4-tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene (PheT), 3-hydroxyphenanthrene (3-OH-Phe) and total hydroxyphenanthrenes (total OH-Phe, the sum of 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-OH-Phe), as well as metabolites of the volatile organic compounds acrolein (3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid), benzene (S-phenyl mercapturic acid), crotonaldehyde (3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic acid) and ethylene oxide (2-hydroxyethyl mercapturic acid). Urinary cotinine was also quantified to confirm non-smoking status. Compared with the lowest quartile, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for lung cancer risk for the highest quartile levels of PheT, 3-OH-Phe and total OH-Phe were 2.98 (1.13-7.87), 3.10 (1.12-7.75) and 2.59 (1.01-6.65) (all P

84893049058	The net energy values of corn, dried distillers grains with solubles and wheat bran for laying hens using indirect calorimetry method	The present study was conducted to estimate the NE values of corn, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and wheat bran (WB) for laying hens based on an indirect calorimetry method and nitrogen balance measurements. A total of 576 twenty-eight-wk-old Dwarf Pink-shell laying hens were randomly assigned to four groups fed a basal diet (BD) or a combination of BD with 50% corn or 20% DDGS or 20% WB, with four replicates each. After a 7-d adaptation period, each replicate with 36 hens were kept in one of the two respiration chambers to measure the heat production (HP) for 6 days during the feeding period and subsequent 3-d fasting. The equilibrium fasting HP (FHP) provided an estimate of NE requirements for maintenance (NEm). The NE values of test feedstuffs was estimated using the difference method. Results showed that the heat increment that contributed 35.34 to 37.85% of ME intake was not influenced by experimental diets (p>0.05) when expressed as Mcal/kg of DM feed intake. Lighting increased the HP in hens in an fed-state. The FHP decreased over time (p<0.05) with the lowest value determined on the third day of starvation. No significant difference between treatments was found on FHP of d 3 (p>0.05). The estimated AME, AMEn, and NE values were 3.46, 3.44 and 2.25 Mcal/kg DM for corn, 3.11, 2.79, and 1.80 Mcal/kg DM for DDGS, 2.14, 2.10, and 1.14 Mcal/kg DM for WB, respectively. The net availability of AME of corn tended to be numerically higher than DDGS and WB (p = 0.096). In conclusion, compared with corn, the energy values of DDGS and WB were overestimated when expressed on an AME basis. © 2014 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.

84894504992	Poultry fat decreased fatty acid transporter protein mRNA expression and affected fatty acid composition in chickens	Background: A study was undertaken to examine the effects of poultry fat (PF) compared with those of soybean oil (SBO) on intestinal development, fatty acid transporter protein (FATP) mRNA expression, and fatty acid composition in broiler chickens. A total of 144 day-old male commercial broilers were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups (6 replicates of 12 chicks for each treatment) and fed isocaloric diets containing 3.0% PF or 2.7% SBO at 0 to 3 wk and 3.8% PF or 3.5% SBO at 4 to 6 wk, respectively.Results: PF had no influence on intestinal morphology, weight, or DNA, RNA, or protein concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 wk of age. However, compared with SBO, PF significantly decreased FATP mRNA abundance at 4 wk (P = 0.009) and 6 wk of age (P < 0.001); decreased liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) mRNA abundance at 6 wk of age (P = 0.039); and decreased C18:2 (P = 0.015), C18:3 (P < 0.001), C20:2 (P = 0.018), Σ-polyunsaturated fatty acids (Σ-PUFA) (P = 0.020), and the proportion of PUFA (P < 0.001) in the intestinal mucosa and decreased C18:2 (P = 0.010), C18:3 (P < 0.001), C20:2 (P < 0.001), Σ-PUFA (P = 0.005), and the proportion of PUFA (P < 0.001) in breast muscle at 6 wk of age.Conclusions: PF decreases FATP and L-FABP mRNA expression and decreased the proportion of PUFA in the intestinal mucosa and breast muscle. © 2012 Yuan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84894438205	Effect of dietary nonphytate phosphorus on laying performance and small intestinal epithelial phosphate transporter expression in Dwarf pink-shell laying hens	This study examined the effects of various levels of dietary nonphytate phosphorus on laying performance and the expression patterns of phosphorus metabolism related genes in Dwarf pink-shell laying hens. A total of 405 28-week-old Dwarf pink-shell laying hens were fed the same corn-soybean basal meals but containing 0.20%, 0.25%, 0.30%, 0.35% or 0.40% nonphytate phosphorus. The results showed that feed intake, egg production, and average egg weights were quadratically correlated with dietary nonphytate phosphorus content (P < 0.05), and the highest egg production, feed intake and average egg weights were achieved when dietary nonphytate phosphorus was at 0.3% (P < 0.05). mRNA expression of intestinal sodium phosphorus co-transporter linearly decreased when dietary nonphytate phosphorus increased. mRNA and protein expression of intestinal calbindin and vitamin D receptor correlated quadratically with dietary nonphytate phosphorus, and the highest expression was found when dietary available phosphorus was at 0.25% to 0.3%. In conclusion, the ideal phosphorus requirement for Dwarf pink-shell layer hens is estimated to be 0.3% in a corn-soybean diet. With this level of phosphorus supplementation, calbindin and vitamin D receptor reached their highest expression. © 2013 Nie et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84895922218	Tobacco-specific N-nitrosamine exposures and cancer risk in the Shanghai cohort study: Remarkable coherence with rat tumor sites	The tobacco-specific nitrosamines N′-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are potent carcinogens for the rat esophagus and lung, respectively. Consistent with the animal carcinogenicity data, we previously reported a remarkably strong association between prospectively measured urinary total NNN, a biomarker of human NNN intake, and the risk of developing esophageal cancer among smokers in the Shanghai Cohort Study. We also demonstrated that urinary total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), a biomarker of exposure to the lung carcinogen NNK, is strongly associated with the risk of lung, but not esophageal cancer in smokers. In this study, we investigated the potential relationship between NNN intake and lung cancer risk in the same cohort. The prospectively collected urine samples from lung cancer cases and matching controls selected for this study, all current smokers, have been previously analyzed for total NNAL, cotinine (a biomarker of nicotine intake) and phenanthrene tetraol (PheT) (a biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Urinary levels of total NNN were not associated with the risk of lung cancer: odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) associated with the second and third tertiles of total NNN, relative to the lowest tertile, were 0.82 (0.36-1.88) and 1.02 (0.39-2.89), respectively (p for trend = 0.959), after adjustment for self-reported smoking history, urinary cotinine and PheT. The results of this study reaffirm the previously reported specificity of urinary total NNN and total NNAL as predictors of esophageal and lung cancer risks, respectively, in smokers, and demonstrate remarkable coherence between rat target tissues of these carcinogens and susceptibility to cancer in smokers. © 2013 UICC.

84900415399	Burden of Total and Cause-Specific Mortality Related to Tobacco Smoking among Adults Aged ≥45 Years in Asia: A Pooled Analysis of 21 Cohorts	Background:Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for many diseases. We sought to quantify the burden of tobacco-smoking-related deaths in Asia, in parts of which men's smoking prevalence is among the world's highest.Methods and Findings:We performed pooled analyses of data from 1,049,929 participants in 21 cohorts in Asia to quantify the risks of total and cause-specific mortality associated with tobacco smoking using adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. We then estimated smoking-related deaths among adults aged ≥45 y in 2004 in Bangladesh, India, mainland China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan-accounting for ∼71% of Asia's total population. An approximately 1.44-fold (95% CI = 1.37-1.51) and 1.48-fold (1.38-1.58) elevated risk of death from any cause was found in male and female ever-smokers, respectively. In 2004, active tobacco smoking accounted for approximately 15.8% (95% CI = 14.3%-17.2%) and 3.3% (2.6%-4.0%) of deaths, respectively, in men and women aged ≥45 y in the seven countries/regions combined, with a total number of estimated deaths of ∼1,575,500 (95% CI = 1,398,000-1,744,700). Among men, approximately 11.4%, 30.5%, and 19.8% of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory diseases, respectively, were attributable to tobacco smoking. Corresponding proportions for East Asian women were 3.7%, 4.6%, and 1.7%, respectively. The strongest association with tobacco smoking was found for lung cancer: A 3- to 4-fold elevated risk, accounting for 60.5% and 16.7% of lung cancer deaths, respectively, in Asian men and East Asian women aged ≥45 y.Conclusions:Tobacco smoking is associated with a substantially elevated risk of mortality, accounting for approximately 2 million deaths in adults aged ≥45 y throughout Asia in 2004. It is likely that smoking-related deaths in Asia will continue to rise over the next few decades if no effective smoking control programs are implemented.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. © 2014 Zheng et al.

84901786610	Dietary taurine impairs intestinal growth and mucosal structure of broiler chickens by increasing toxic bile acid concentrations in the intestine	Three experiments were conducted to determine the effect of taurine on the intestinal development, bile acid concentrations, and hormonal status of chickens. In experiment 1, a total of 250 one-day-old broilers were randomly allocated to 5 treatments and supplemented with 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00 g/kg of taurine, respectively. Growth performance, weight and length of the small intestine, and intestinal morphology were measured on d 7, 22, and 44. The gene expression levels of several hormones, including epidermal growth factor and cholecystokinin, were also evaluated. In experiment 2, 60 one-day-old broilers were supplemented with 0, 1.0, and 5.0 g/kg of taurine to assess cell proliferation in the jenunal crypt. In experiment 3, 100 newly hatched broilers were assigned randomly to 5 treatments (0, 0.10, 0.50, 2.00, 8.00 g/kg of taurine) to evaluate the bile acid concentrations in the jejunal mucosa. Our results indicated that dietary taurine decreased the length and weight of small intestine, the villus width, surface area, and crypt depth in the duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.05). Taurine also increased the expression of cholecystokinin and epidermal growth factor on the jejunal mucosa (P < 0.001). Taurine has little effect on stimulating the proliferation of intestinal crypt cells, except for 5 g/kg of taurine supplementation on d 14 (P < 0.05). Additionally, a linear increase in the jejunal concentrations of taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, and taurolithocholic acid was observed on d 7 in broilers fed increasing levels of taurine. In conclusion, we suggested that taurine impairs intestinal mucosal development partly through generation of toxic bile acids. © 2014 Poultry Science Association Inc.

84916604760	Effect of zinc on growth performance, gut morphometry, and cecal microbial community in broilers challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium	To evaluate the effects of supplemental zinc on growth performance, gut morphometry, and the cecal microbial community in broilers challenged with Salmonella typhimurium, 180, 1-day-old male Cobb 500 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 3 treatments with ten replicates for a 42 day experiment. The 3 treatments were: unchallenged, S. typhimurium-challenged, and S. typhimurium-challenged with 120 mg/kg of zinc supplementation in the diet. Salmonella infection caused a reduction in body-weight gain and feed intake, disrupted the intestinal structure by decreasing the villus-height/crypt-depth ratio of the ileum and increasing the apoptotic index of ileal epithelial cells. Moreover, the cecal microbial community was altered by Salmonella infection, as demonstrated by a reduced number of Lactobacillus and total bacteria. Dietary zinc supplementation improved growth performance by increasing the body-weight gain and feed intake in the challenged broilers. In addition, zinc repaired intestinal injury by reducing the apoptotic index of ileal epithelial cells, enhancing villus height and the villus-height/crypt-depth ratio of the ileum, and the proliferation index of ileal epithelial cells. Finally, zinc regulated the cecal microbial community by increasing the number of total bacteria and beneficial Lactobacillus bacteria, and reducing the number of Salmonella. The results indicated that dietary zinc supplementation improved growth performance, intestinal morphology, and intestinal microbiota in S. typhimurium-challenged broilers.

13444253760	Effect of cytokine genotypes on the hepatitis B virus-hepatocellular carcinoma association	BACKGROUND. In Southern Guangxi, China, chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) acquired during the perinatal period from carrier mothers is a primary cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, only a minority of HBV carriers eventually develop hepatocellular carcinoma. The authors hypothesized that cytokine genotypes may be important codeterminants of the risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS. The authors examined the correlation between polymorphisms in T-helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokine genes among a group of 250 patients with incident hepatocellular carcinoma (cases) and a group of 250 hospital controls who were matched individually to the index case by age, gender, ethnicity, residence, and month of hospital admission in the city of Nanning, Guangxi, China. RESULTS. Relative to the putative high-activity genotypes, each individual low-activity genotype of Interferon γ, interleukin 12 (IL12), and IL18 was associated with a statistically nonsignificant increase (40-60%) in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. This risk increased with increasing numbers of low-activity Th1 genotypes after adjusting for potential confounders (2-sided P value for trend = 0.04). Conversely, individual Th2 (IL4, IL10) low-activity genotypes were associated with a statistically nonsignificant reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. This risk decreased with increasing number of low-activity Th2 genotypes after adjusting for potential confounders (2-sided P value for trend = 0.01). Individuals who had the maximum number (i.e., 3) of low-activity Th1 genes and the minimum number (i.e., 0) of low-activity Th2 genes showed a relative risk of 20.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-235.0). CONCLUSIONS. Diminished cell-mediated immune response, which is controlled genetically, appeared to be an important risk determinant of HBV-related hepato-cellular carcinogenesis. © 2005 American Cancer Society.

In a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, study and two eigenvectors, two new loci achieved genome-wide significance, marked by rs7447927 at 5q31.2 (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.88; P = 7.72 × 10<sup>-20</sup>) and rs1642764 at 17p13.1 (per-allele OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85-0.91; P = 3.10 × 10<sup>-13</sup>). rs7447927 is a synonymous SNP in TMEM173, and rs1642764 is an intronic SNP in ATP1B2, near TP53. Furthermore, a locus in the HLA class II region at 6p21.32 (rs35597309) achieved genome-wide significance in the two populations at highest risk for ESSC (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.22-1.46; P = 1.99 × 10<sup>-10</sup>). Our joint analysis identifies new ESCC susceptibility loci overall as well as a new locus unique to the population in the Taihang Mountain region at high risk of ESCC.
