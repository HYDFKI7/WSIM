16344368851	Full field and microregion deformation measurement of thin films using electronic speckle pattern interferometry and array microindentation marker method	Thin films now are widely used in micro devices and structures, such as MEMS, electronic packaging, micro sensors, and so on. Their performances highly affect the reliability of the devices. Therefore, it is important to investigate the deformation and the failure mechanism of thin films. In this paper, we present two experimental methods to measure the mechanical properties of thin films. In the first method, a double-field-of-view electronic speckle pattern interferometry system (ESPI) and an integrated deformation and load measurement system are employed, which allows in situ and real-time measurements of full-field deformations of the thin films and microforces under uniaxial tensile test. In the second method, the array microindentation markers were indented on the surface of the thin film using a nanoindenter and the microregion deformations of the tested thin films were measured. In the proposed methods, the tested thin films can be made of metals, oxide ceramics, and multi-layer composites of thickness from several tens micrometers to less than a micron, and the tensile loads from 88 μN to 15 N for the first method or up to 100 N to the second one. The underlying principle of the methods and the experimental set-ups are presented. The deformations of Au and Au/Cr multi-layer films, and the pure Ni films are measured. The performance of the methods and the testing systems are also discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1642617643	Matched correlation sequence analysis in temporal speckle pattern interferometry	A technique for measuring dynamic deformation with temporal speckle pattern interferometry is proposed. The technique is based on the introduction of reference phase sequence and matched correlation to obtain the dynamic displacement of an object without sign ambiguity. The reference speckle sequence, producing the reference phase sequence or phase gauge, is obtained by using a calibrated PZT phase shifter. The matched correlation is done between the reference speckle sequence and the temporal speckle sequence caused by time-dependent deformation of the object. We present a description of its theory and experimental setup to generate the reference and the temporal sequence in the measurement. Experiment with testing of the harmonic vibration of a piezoelectric ceramic plate is shown. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

20444411564	Microregion deformation measurement of thin films using array microindentation mark method	The measurement of deformation in microregion or on a microcomponent always faces two problems. One is the rigid displacement caused by the unitary motion of the specimen, and the other the rather small deformation in the microregion. Therefore, it is quite necessary to find a suitable way to determine the microregion deformations and mechanical properties. In this paper, the deformation in the vicinity of a microcavity defect on the film surface is measured by the proposed array microindentation mark method. The array microindentation marks are indented using a nanoindentation machine and the microcavity defect is produced by the electrical discharge machining (EDM) technique. Moreover, deformations in the microregion are measured under a digital microscopic system. Further, the microregion deformation extracting method, the feasibility and the measuring performance of the array microindentation mark method are also discussed.

0002982140	Continual deformation analysis with scanning phase method and time sequence phase method in temporal speckle pattern interferometry	If a laser beam illuminates a continual deformation object surface, it will lead to a temporal speckle pattern on the observation plane. Recording this time-dependent speckle pattern the deformation of the surface of an object can be obtained. Two methods, scanning phase method (SPM) and time sequence phase method (TSPM), have been introduced for measuring the displacement caused by the deformation in temporal speckle pattern interferometry (TSPI). Their principle is that by capturing a series of speckle interference patterns related to the object deformations, the fluctuations in the intensity of the interference patterns can be obtained. Through scanning these fluctuations and estimating both the average intensity and modulation of the temporal speckle interference patterns, the phase maps for whole-field displacements are calculated. In this way one is capable of quantitatively measuring continual displacements simply using a conventional electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) system without phase shifting or a carrier. The elaboration on the new methods is given in this paper and experiments are performed to demonstrate their performance with a conventional ESPI system. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

28444468148	Optical full-field technique for measuring deformation on micromechanical components	The rapid development of microelectromechanical system (MEMS), thin-film and material research in mechanical behaviors has provided new impetus to handle high-precision, full-filed and real-time deformation measurements. Optical methods are very useful in non-contact and full-field measurements of the deformation of an object. However, with the decrease of the dimension of the tested components, the macroscopically testing method and system in existence are not adequate to accurate measurement of the microcomponents. Furthermore, the effect of the small size of view field in the measurement makes the interferometric system hardly producing clear and stable fringe patterns, and then interpretation of the measurement results very difficult. In this paper, a Linnik microinterferometric system has been constructed to measure the full-field deformation of microcomponents. And meanwhile, the phase shifting and temporal speckle pattern interferometry are also introduced to implement the static and dynamic deformation measurements. With the interfermetric system, the characteristic size of the microcomponents can be from sub-millimeters to sever micrometers.

3142705161	Quantitative analysis on parameters of a defect with speckle interferometry and finite element optimization method	Quantitative nondestructive testing (QNDT) is required for the in-service inspection of high-cost structures whose failure could lead tragic consequences. The optical methods are widely used for NDT and NDE. However, most of them base on the qualitative detection of the partial fringes induced by the defects. The defect characteristic parameters (DCPs), such as coordinates and types, are easily obtained, but it is difficult to obtain other parameters, e.g. the defect size and embedded depth due to the non-unique relation between the DCPs and the deformation of detected defects. In this paper, the optical method, design optimization and FEM are combined to accomplish QNDT. Three types of defects are inspected and their DCPs values are obtained quantitatively. Moreover, factors that influence detection accuracy of the DCPs are also discussed.

33747211411	An optical probe stage and its applications in mechanical behavior measurements of micro-objects and thin films	The rapid development of a wide variety of new devices in microelectronics, sensors, MEMS and NEMS has led to new challenges in characterizing their mechanical behavior and assessing their reliability. Static and dynamic mechanical behavior measurement of micro-objects and low-dimension films has become a key issue. In this paper, an optical probe stage has been proposed to test the deformation of micro-objects. The technique is based on optical interferometry and actuator-driven cantilever/plate deformed probes. In the proposed apparatus, a monochromatic object light is used to illuminate the deformed probes and measured micro-objects. The interference fringe pattern related to deformations of deflections of the probes and the micro-objects was analyzed to obtain the loading forces exerted by the probes and the deformations of micro-objects. Properties of static and dynamic deformations of different kinds of probes were investigated and the optical probe stage was applied in deformation measurement, microforce testing and bonded wire fatigue analysis of a metal-oxide semiconductor chip. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The transient deformation of a microcantilever caused by the capillary force was measured and the energy function of the adhesion system was constructed based on the independent parameters of adhesion length and volume fraction of the adhesion medium.

33751509445	Calibration of displacement sensors with high-precision and large measurement range using temporal speckle pattern interferometry	In the present study, a real-time calibration method for micro displacement sensors is introduced, and a calibration system is developed. SPCM, the sequence pulse counting method previously proposed by us, is capable of automatically determining both the larger range displacement and the performance of a sensor, such as the nonlinear error and the displacement sensitivity within a quarter of the light source wavelength. The new calibration system consists of a programmable motor driven platform, an out-of-plane sensitive electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), and a sequence image acquisition system. The platform is used to provide displacement changes of a moving component and its displacement is measured by the ESPI and calibrated sensor synchronously. The calibration accuracy of the proposed method is in the submicrometer level and the displacement range can be from sub-micrometer to millimeters depending on the storage capacity of the computer and the correlation property of the interferometer. Three capacitance-type displacement sensors have been calibrated successfully, whose displacement ranges are -300μm to 300μm, -30μm to 30μm, and -3μm to 3μm, respectively.

36048953858	Numerical analysis of the measuring errors in quantitative detection of defects with shearing speckle pattern interferometry	Recently, quantitatively nondestructive testing (QNDT) is becoming an accepted concept in some industries and scientific research areas. The combination of shearing speckle interferometry (SSI) and mechanical models is employed to quantitatively estimate defect characteristic parameters (DCP), such as coordinates, size, embedding depth, etc. However, quantitative calculation of DCP relies on the actual displacement slope in the mechanical models, but the slope in SSI is represented by the difference of displacements between the two neighboring points with a distance, i.e. the shearing amount. This leads to a deviation in calculating DCP. This paper will investigate the deviation of the relative displacement and derivate displacement introduced by the shearographic approximation in cases of two deformation models, one is a thin circular plate and the other a spherical pressure shell under the pressure loading. Two kinds of defects, a cavity and a crack, are embedded in the structures and their deformations are calculated by FEM.

35448931915	Meniscus-climbing behavior and its minimum free-energy mechanism	Some insects can climb up the top of the meniscus surface generated by a hydrophilic wall by fixing their posture without moving their appendages [Baudoin, R. Bull. Biol. Fr. Belg. 1955, 89, 16. Hu, D. L.; Bush, J. W. M. Nature 2005, 437, 733]. To better understand this interesting phenomenon, we did meniscus-climbing experiments of bent copper sheets. It was found that the sheets do not always climb up the top of the meniscus surface but may stop and stably stay at various positions on the meniscus surface, depending upon their curvatures and masses, and that bent copper sheets can self-assemble into an oriented array (or an anisotropic form) through self-rotating on the water surface. The minimum energy mechanism of meniscus-climbing and self-rotating was then numerically studied. It was further shown that the meniscus-climbing and the rotating behavior is not only a general phenomenon for floating objects with hydrophilic surfaces, even those with fairly large sizes and weights (e.g., a metal bottle cap), but is also conditionally realizable for floating objects with hydrophobic surfaces. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

This paper presents experimental and theoretical results that characterize the capillary adhesion of micro-cantilevers by means of capillary actuation. Micro-cantilever beams were loaded at various locations along the freestanding portion of the beam using the capillary force and the deflections of the beams were real-time and in-situ measured with micro speckle interferometry. The mechanical stability and adhesion of micro-cantilever under capillary forces were examined and the deflecting configurations of the beams and the relationship of the magnitude of the capillary force to the size of the specimen were presented.

33644859632	Real-time and full-field deflection measurement of thin films electroplated on the single crystal silicon wafers	A special speckle microinterferometer has been developed to test the mechanical properties of thin films electroplated on the single crystal silicon wafer. A piezo-actuated micro-loading unit is synchronized with the microinterfermeter to measure thin film deflection in bending with an accuracy of sub-micrometers. All of the film specimens were microfabricated to be the type of microbridge samples. They are made of Cu and NiFe, the sizes from 1102.9μm to 213.7(jin long, 491.0μm to 9.7μm wide. The corresponding thicknesses are 9.4μm and 7.6μin, respectively. Deflections of the microbradge samples can be measured full-field and real-time by using the microinterferometer and no patterning or marking of the specimen surface is needed. The loading force is directly measured using a miniature load cell. The Young's moduli are calculated for both material and sample size from the load-deflection curves. Test techniques, procedures and factors which affect on the deflection measurements are briefly presented along with detailed analyzes of the results.

33644990395	Study on the initiation stage of stress corrosion of an aluminum alloy using the subjective speckle technique	The aim of this paper is to investigate the initiation stage of stress corrosion of an aluminum alloy. Three-point bending experiments are carried out under displacement-controlled mode. The tested specimens are Al2024-T3 alloy with thickness of 2 mm which are immersed in the 3.5% sodium chloride solution in the experiments. The solution temperature was controlled from 20 to 80 °C and the exerted stresses were 0, 174 and 348 MPa, respectively, to study the influences of the temperature and the stress in the stress corrosion process. The subjective speckle method has been employed to observe the processes of the stress corrosion in microregions by means of measuring the local surface roughness of the specimens. Treatments of employing both average intensity and an autocorrelation coefficient of the subject speckle fields confirmed that the subjective speckle method is effective to characterize the stress corrosion initiation process of the tested aluminum alloy. The experimental results show that the temperature influences the rate of corrosion distinctly and meanwhile the rate of the corrosion also depends on the stress state considerably. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

41349093999	Reliability research on the thermal deformation and stress of metal packaging with low-resistance leads	Thermomechanical reliability of the metal packaging with low-resistance and high-electric current was discussed in this paper. Thermal deformations and stresses of packaging structures were studied by both experimental and numerical methods. Laser speckle interferometry was used as the experimental method to test the coefficient of thermal expansion of the metal composite leads and the thermal deformations of the entire packaging structures due to the temperature change from room-temperature to 150 °C. ABAQUS/Standard finite element (FE) code was used to simulate the thermal deformations and stresses of the packaging structures from room temperature to 150 °C. The facts show that the results were in good agreement with those of experiments. It showed that the predicted thermal stresses and deformation in the working condition were qualitatively reliable. Moreover, the technique of elements deactivating and activating was used in FE analysis to simulate the manufacturing process of the packaging structures cooled from 779 °C to room-temperature. Then the residual thermal deformations and stresses during the process were obtained. © 2008 IEEE.

0034295136	Wavelet transform for detection of partial fringe patterns induced by defects in nondestructive testing of holographic interferometry and electronic speckle pattern interferometry	Holographic interferometry (HI) and electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) are widely used in nondestructive testing (NDT). In the HI and ESPI measurement techniques, the deformations are made visible as fringe patterns while an inspected sample is loaded. Defects will lead to typical local deformations deviating from the global deformation. To achieve automatic detection of the defect characteristics, the wavelet transform (WT) method is used. Wavelets can be used to generate a multiresolution analysis of a signal and they are very sensitive to the changes in a transient signal or an abrupt signal if suitable wavelets are chosen. These changes correspond to the partial fringe patterns caused by the local defects in HI and ESPI nondestructive testing. We demonstrate how the Morlet wavelet is used to detect the defect-induced partial fringe patterns from the global fringe pattern in HI and the ESPI nondestructive testing.

In general, the smaller the sample, the smaller the force is in the measurement. But it is difficult to load and measure such small force. We developed a probe-type loading and force sensor system to measure micro/nano samples. The system employs a semiconductor strain gauge of a cantilever type sensor and a micro manipulator. A highly sensitive, stable sensing cantilever beam made of single crystal silicon is ion implanted to form the P-type resistor (strain sensor). A tungsten probe with 100 nm radius of curvature was attached to the end of the cantilever as the micro loading tip. We constructed the measurement system and investigated its properties, such as linearity, dynamic response and stability. We also employed microspeckle interferometry to calibrate the force sensor. In preliminary experiments, we successfully obtained the force resolution 0.7 μN and applied our probe-type microforce sensor to calibrate an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe beam and test a single silkworm filament.

We, therefore, conducted a clinical experiment in this study to prove this method of detection, which will not only provide an objective index to evaluate the clinical significance of spinal disorder. Objective: To evaluate the repeatability of PGP in detecting human back morphology. Design, Time and Setting: Repeated measurement, and one way variance analysis. The experiment was performed at the General Hospital of Air Force between June 2007 and January 2008. Participants: Twenty normal volunteers, 12 males and 8 males, averagely aged 38.15 years (range 21-57 years) were included. The PGP system was made by the Department Engineering Mechanics of Tsinghua University. Methods: Twenty subjects were imaged in neutral position, left bending position at 10° and right lateral bending position at 10° by the PGP system. Each subject was imaged for 3 times. The former twice records were performed in the same day with 2 hours interval and the 3rd image was conducted 20 days later. Main Outcome Measures: Lateral curvature angle, left lateral flexion angle, right lateral flexion angle, the ratio of the ranges of motion between the left and right lateral flexion in left and right lateral flexion position; ratio of the cross section plane between the left and right from middle line of spine also representing a quantified rotation of spinal column, the ratio of the heights at a certain paraspinal point between left and right representing a quantified rotation of spinal column, and hump angle in neutral position. Results: There were no significant differences in terms of lateral curvature angle, the ratio of the ranges of motion between the left and right lateral flexion in left and right lateral flexion position, the ratio of the heights at a certain paraspinal point between left and right representing a quantified rotation of spinal column, and hump angle in neutral position at different time points (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Symmetrical indexes of spinal column collected from the recorded PGP images are statistically proved reproducible, which proves great clinical significance.

67349247068	A novel technique of microforce sensing and loading	With remarkable reduction of the characteristic scales in researches of materials and structures, microforce sensing and loading is becoming an important and challenging issue in mechanical tests. On the one hand, miniaturization of the tested objects leads to serious problems of manipulating, grasping, and loading. On the other hand, the smaller a sample is, the smaller the forces have to be measured. Up to now, it is still a difficult task to measure such small forces. In this paper, a newly developed probe-type microforce sensor is described, which can be combined with a micromanipulator to perform microforce sensing and loading. A strategy call ladder or hierarchy force sensing and loading method is further suggested, by which the above combined system is used as a platform to calibrate other cantilever probes with finer resolutions, which may form a sequence of probe-type sequence microforce sensors to cover a broad range of forces to be measured from mN down to nN and even lower provided that proper spring constants are selected for these force sensors. In the preliminary studies, two probe-type microforce sensors are successfully developed with force sensing sensitivities of 705.4 nN/mV and 37.3 nN/mV, respectively. They are applied to calibrate atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers with various spring constants, and then one of these calibrated cantilevers is used as a more sensitive force sensor to calibrate other even softer cantilevers. Tests of real microscale objects, a single silk filament and a papilla on the lotus leaf surface, demonstrate excellent performance of the developed sensors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

67649556937	Tunable resonant frequencies for determining Young's moduli of nanowires	Measuring the electric-field-induced resonance frequency of nanowires and nanotubes as cantilever beams has become a popular method to derive their elastic modulus. However, this method is sensitive to the experimental uncertainties of the clamp point conditions. In a preceding paper, we found that such uncertainty could lead to 30%-70% errors of the derived elastic modulus and then we proposed a tunable resonance method as a remedy. In this paper, we implement the tunable resonance method in experiment. The fundamental resonant frequencies of a Si nanowire cantilever stimulated in an electrical field are measured with an extra support localized at different positions along the nanowire. Our results show that based on this set of measured frequencies, the uncertainties of the clamp boundary condition can be easily identified and filtered out and thus the deduced Young's modulus is more reliable. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

76249130656	Correlation of the thermal and electrical conductivities of nanoporous gold	We measured the thermal and electrical conductivities of nanoporous Au thin foils in the temperature range 93-300K. Resulting from the nanoscale microstructure, the two types of conductivities are both temperature dependent and significantly lower than those of bulk Au. However, the corresponding Lorenz number is strikingly similar to that of bulk Au, indicating that the Wiedemann-Franz law holds perfectly well for nanoporous metals in this temperature range. Compared to the bulk value, the Debye temperature of nanoporous Au is decreased. We predict the theoretical Debye temperature of nanoporous Au by its relation to the elastic constants. The present results indicate that the nanoporous Au foils should be comprised of macroscopic, single-crystalline porous grains rather than nanocrystals. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

0035552809	Displacement measurements in micro-region with generalized digital speckle correlation method	High magnifying optics is now widely used in micro-region imaging, which leads to the special image structures on the recording plane, such as continue-gray distributions, large granules and spread structures. As a result, the deformation analyses are unreliable and divergent by using the conventional speckle correlation methods and these generalized speckle patterns. A new correlation algorithm, high-order gradient digital correlation method, has been proposed in this paper to measure the displacements in a micro-region. The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using the generalized speckle patterns captured from the micro-regions.

0035554368	Large deformation and mechanical behavior analysis using temporal speckle pattern interferometry	Ballistite and polymer materials are one kind of special composite material possessing the special properties of large deformations under loading. Because they have wide applications in aerospace industry and strong effects on the reliability and stability of the aerostats, experimental measuring the mechanical behaviors of these materials is highly emphasized. However, due to their special properties of the large and time-dependent deformation under loading, it is hard to use conventional optical methods to analyze their mechanical behavior. In this paper, two methods, scanning phase method (SPM) and time sequence phase method (TSPM), have been used to large and time-dependent deformation analysis for ballistite and polymer materials. The deformation and creep behavior of the ballistite material is experimentally measured and analyzed under thermal loading and mechanical loading. Meanwhile, the large deformation of the polymer material is also measured under mechanical loading. The experiment results including the material parameters, the deformation and the creep curves are presented. The applicability and performance of these two methods are also discussed.

0036319641	Deformation Measurement of a Small Component and a Thin Film Using Time Sequence Speckle Pattern Interferometry	The rapid development of microelectromechanical system (MEMS), thin film technology and material research in mechanical behaviors gives new impetus to high-precision and quantitative deformation measurement in sub-micrometer level. Optical method is a versatile, noncontact, full field and height sensitivity technique and has been popularly applied to deformation measurement in numerous fields. However, the well-known optical arrangements have been for a long time focusing on large and medium size samples and view field. The load manner, measurement sensitivity and instruments cannot satisfy well for deformation measurement in micro-region of a component or a low-dimensional structure. In this paper we describe the applications of time sequence speckle pattern interferometry (TSSPI) to measure the deformation of a small cantilever and purity Ni thin film in sub-micrometer level subjected to bending loading. The compact measurement systems including a digital speckle interferometry and a micro loading system have been built and a phase demodulation method has also been proposed.

0036611665	Detection of small cracks and cavities using laser diffraction	A good knowledge of the evolution process of a crack or cavity is necessary for a better understanding the mechanical behavior of the damage and failure of materials and structural components. Before damage begins, the size of the initial or prescribed cracks and cavities are usually very small. These small cracks and cavities can be conveniently used as the diffraction apertures of the coherent light. By analyzing the diffraction fields, the characteristic parameters of these special diffraction apertures can be obtained and, hence, the deformation fields. Experimental tests are conducted to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the laser diffraction technique in detecting the evolution and propagation of a small crack or cavity. The relationships between the coherent diffraction patterns and the crack and cavity geometric parameters are established for the simple shape of the crack or cavity aperture. Moreover, the autocorrelative method and the spectral iterative technique are introduced to retrieve the small crack and cavity apertures for the complex shapes.

0036677484	High-precision large deflection measurements of thin films using time sequence speckle pattern interferometry	The rapid development of microelectromechanical systems, thin-film technology and material research in mechanical behaviours has provided new impetus to handle high-precision and large-amplitude deformation measurements. Optical methods are very useful in making non-contact and full field measurements of the deformation of an object. However, there is a gap between the sensitivity and the measurement range in the existing coherent and incoherent optical methods. In this paper, we propose some approaches to employ time sequence speckle pattern interferometry to measure large deformations of pure Ni thin films subjected to bending with high sensitivity. We introduce a new large deformation measurement system, which includes a digital speckle interferometry and a micro loading system, and we propose two methods of phase demodulation in this paper. The new system is capable of automatically applying micro loading and continously capturing the temporal speckle patterns imaged from the flexural surfaces of the thin film. Forty thousand frames of the time sequence speckle patterns have been recorded and the maximum deflection of about 1400 μm has been measured with sensitivities of λ/2 and λ/4 by the different proposed methods, respectively.

0036534260	Low-frequency harmonic vibration analysis with temporal speckle pattern interferometry	In this paper, the time sequence phase method (TSPM) has been applied to measure the displacement caused by low-frequency vibration in temporal speckle pattern interferometry (TSPI). The principle is that by capturing the temporal speckle patterns related to the object vibration, the whole-field displacement responses (amplitude and phase) of the vibrating object can be calculated through scanning these fluctuations. Thus, quantitative measurement can be carried out using a conventional ESPI system without a camera synchronized to the object vibration or a phase shifting system. The elaboration on the method is given and experimental results are presented. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

79957820027	Surface effects on the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials	Using the theory of surface elasticity, we investigate the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials. The classical theory of porous materials is modified to account for surface effects, which become increasingly important as the characteristic sizes of microstructures shrink to nanometers. First, a refined Timoshenko beam model is presented to predict the effective elastic modulus of nanoporous materials. Then the surface effects on the elastic microstructural buckling behavior of nanoporous materials are examined. In particular, nanoporous gold is taken as an example to illustrate the application of the proposed model. The results reveal that both the elastic modulus and the critical buckling behavior of nanoporous materials exhibit a distinct dependence on the characteristic sizes of microstructures, e.g. the average ligament width. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In the preliminary studies, two kinds of probe-type microforce sensors have been used to load the objects with dry and wetted surfaces. One is a developed piezoresistive cantilever force sensor with sensitivity of 35 ?N/V and the other an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever beam probe with sensitivity of 10.4 nN/V.

Their engineering application requires accurate mechanical characterization, which, in turn, requires novel experimental techniques. In this paper, we report a recently developed multi-probe mechanical testing system and a few of its typical applications in studying mechanical behaviors of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, which include analyzing clamping strength of electron beam induced deposition (EBID) for Si nanowires and the tungsten substrate, retrieving Young's modulus of a Si nanowire using tunable resonance method, and investigating thermal fatigue behavior of nanoscale interconnect lines bearing alternating current.

80655143677	Alternating-current induced thermal fatigue of gold interconnects with nanometer-scale thickness and width	With dramatic reduction in sizes of microelectronic devices, the characteristic width and thickness of interconnects in large-scale integrated circuits have reached nanometer scale. Thermal fatigue damage of so small interconnects has attracted more and more attentions. In this work, thermal fatigue of Au interconnects, 35 nm thick and 0.1-5 μm wide, is investigated by applying various alternating current densities to generate cycling temperature and strain in them. A multi-probe measuring system is installed in a scanning electron microscope and a probe-type temperature sensor is for the first time introduced into the system for real-time measuring the temperatures on the pads of the tested interconnects. A one-dimensional heat conduction equation, which uses measured temperatures on the pads as boundary conditions and includes a term of heat dissipation through the interface between the interconnect and the oxidized silicon substrate, is proposed to calculate the time-resolved temperature distribution along the Au interconnects. The measured fatigue lifetimes are presented versus current density and thermal cyclic strain, and the results show that narrower Au lines are more reliable. The failure mechanism of those Au interconnects differs from what is observed in thick interconnects with relatively larger grain size. Topography change caused by localized plasticity on the less-constrained surfaces of the interconnects have not been observed. Instead, grain growing and reorienting due to local temperature varying appear, and grain boundary migration and mergence take place during high temperature fatigue in such thin and narrow interconnects. These results seem to reflect a strain-induced boundary migration mechanism, and the damage morphology also suggests that fatigue of the interconnects with decreased grain size and film thickness is controlled by diffusive mechanisms and interface properties rather than by dislocation glide. Open circuit eventually took place by melting at a region of severely damage cross-sectional area with the grain growing and reorienting. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Nondestructive testing methods, holographic interferometry, shearing speckle interferometry, and simple mechanical models are combined to quantitatively estimate these defect characteristic parameters (DCPs). Experimental tests were conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of this combined technique for thin-walled spherical vessels that contain the cavities or cracks. Relationships between the DCPs and partial fringe patterns caused by the local defects are presented, and factors that affect the estimative accuracy of DCPs are discussed.

0037392607	Comparison between instantaneous and integral intensities in dynamic speckle pattern interferometry	A new speckle measurement technique called temporal speckle pattern interferometry or time sequential speckle pattern interferometry has been developed recently. Its principle is that by capturing the temporal speckle patterns related to the object deformation or displacement, the whole-field displacement, the amplitude of the vibrating object and the shape of the tested object can be calculated through speckle intensity fluctuation scanning technique or Fourier-transforming method. In this paper, we combine the analytical and numerical methods to simulate the properties of the time demodulation in temporal speckle patterns interferometry techniques. The performance of three kinds of temporal phase sequences, power, exponential and harmonic phase sequences, are studied with the parameters of temporal speckle intensity fluctuation, the value of the spatial phase term, optical integral time of the recording camera and the initial phase of the temporal speckle intensities. The results indicate that the normalized value and period change of the instantaneous intensity are nearly coincident with that of the integral intensity for the harmonic temporal phase sequences and are different for the power and exponential temporal phase sequences. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

84885903685	Therapeutic effects of chinese osteopathy in patients with lumbar disc herniation	A clinical study was conducted in 72 lumbar disc herniation (LDH) patients and 40 asymptomatic subjects to evaluate the efficacy of Feng's spinal manipulation (FSM). FSM was performed twice a week for less than 20 days. Changes in the symmetrical index of spinal column (SISC) and quantified symptom index (QSI) before and after FSM in both groups were collected. The QSI consisted of the visual analogue scale (VAS), score of the Japanese Orthopedic Association, and straight leg raising test, for measurement of pain perception, dysfunction of lower limb extension or flexion, and symptomatic relief. A correlation analysis was conducted to compare the difference in protruded nucleus pulposus size using computerized projection grating profilometry, SISC, and QSI before and after the therapy. The results showed that the SISC and QSI significantly decreased after treatment in the LDH group (p < 0.01). The SISC before and after treatment was closely correlated with the improvement of QSI, although there was no change in protruded nucleus pulposus following the therapy. Among the five components in SISC, the LR was found to be an ideal indicator for evaluation of the real circumstances in LDH patients. Our data suggested that FSM achieved satisfactory therapeutic effects in relieving the symptom of LDH while no effects were observed in asymptomatic subjects. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

0242611524	Study of ballistite material mechanical behaviors using temporal speckle pattern interferometry	The ballistite material is one kind of special composite material. Its mechanical behaviors highly affect the reliability and stability of the rocket operation. Because of its special properties of large deformations under loading and high particle composite in structures, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the ballistite deformations using the conventional speckle methods or the contact methods. Two methods, the Scanning Phase Method (SPM) and Time Sequence Phase Method (TSPM) in Temporal Speckle Pattern Interferometry (TSPI), have been applied to investigate the special mechanical behaviors of the ballistite material under mechanical, thermal, and mechanical-thermal loads, and the creep behaviors of the ballistite material under the loads are analyzed in this paper. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84893674842	Investigation of Near-Surface Mechanical Properties of Materials Using Atomic Force Microscopy	As ultra-thin films or small-scale structures become widely used in electronics and biology, knowledge concerning their near-surface mechanical properties of the materials is increasingly important. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is employed to determine near-surface elastic modulus via force-penetration curves acquired during indentation. Samples include polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), parylene, mica, and single-crystal silicon, and indentations are performed with single-crystal silicon and silicon nitride AFM tips. An analysis algorithm based on the secant modulus method is proposed to extract the true penetration curves from the experimental displacement curves. The penetration data is then analyzed in terms of Hertzian model to estimate the elastic modulus. Three concerns in applying nanoscale AFM indentation to the measurement of the elastic modulus of an ultra-thin material are addressed. First, the effect of the lateral force caused by the inclined angle of the cantilevered probe is investigated theoretically and by numerical simulation. A second concern is local plastic deformation induced by a sharp probe tip. In this case, numerical results show a relatively small effect on the force-penetration curves if the plastic deformation is limited to the central area below the probe tip. The deviation of the elastic-plastic simulation from the elastic estimation depends on the yield strength of the material. Finally, the effect of stiffness matching between the AFM probe and the sample is a key issue that is studied numerically, and appropriate stiffness matching criteria are suggested. © 2013 Society for Experimental Mechanics.

84898812570	Dynamic behavior of tuning fork shear-force structures in a SNOM system	Piezoelectric tuning fork shear-force structures are widely used as a distance control unit in a scanning near-field optical microscopy. However, the complex dynamic behavior among the micro-tuning forks (TFs), optical fiber probes, and the probe-surface interactions is still a crucial issue to achieve high-resolution imaging or near-field interaction inspections. Based on nonlinear beam tension-bending vibration theory, vibration equations in both longitudinal and lateral directions have been established when the TF structure and the optical fiber are treated as deformable structures. The relationship of the probe-surface interaction induced by Van der Waals force has been analyzed and the corresponding numerical results used to describe the vibrational behavior of the probe approaching the sample surface are obtained. Meanwhile, the viscous resistance of the liquid film on the sample surface has also been investigated using linear beam-bending vibration theory. Experiments testing the interaction between the probe and the water film on a single crystal silicon wafer have been carried out and the viscous resistance of the water film was estimated using the established equations. Finally, to use the TF-probe structure as a force sensor, the relation between the dynamic response of the TF-probe system and an external force on the probe tip was obtained. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84901780246	Interferometric dynamic measurement: Techniques based on high-speed imaging or a single photodetector	In recent years, optical interferometry-based techniques have been widely used to perform noncontact measurement of dynamic deformation in different industrial areas. In these applications, various physical quantities need to be measured in any instant and the Nyquist sampling theorem has to be satisfied along the time axis on each measurement point. Two types of techniques were developed for such measurements: one is based on high-speed cameras and the other uses a single photodetector. The limitation of the measurement range along the time axis in camera-based technology is mainly due to the low capturing rate, while the photodetector-based technology can only do the measurement on a single point. In this paper, several aspects of these two technologies are discussed. For the camera-based interferometry, the discussion includes the introduction of the carrier, the processing of the recorded images, the phase extraction algorithms in various domains, and how to increase the temporal measurement range by using multiwavelength techniques. For the detector-based interferometry, the discussion mainly focuses on the single-point and multipoint laser Doppler vibrometers and their applications for measurement under extreme conditions. The results show the effort done by researchers for the improvement of the measurement capabilities using interferometry-based techniques to cover the requirements needed for the industrial applications. © 2014 Yu Fu et al.

84908431469	Characterization of micro-contact resistance between a gold nanocrystalline line and a tungsten electrode probe in interconnect fatigue testing	An electromechanically-coupled micro-contact resistance measurement system is built to mimic the contact process during fatigue testing of nanoscale-thickness interconnects using multiple probe methods. The design combines an optical microscope, high-resolution electronic balance, and micromanipulator-controlled electric probe, and is coupled with electrical measurements to investigate microscale contact physics. Experimental measurements are performed to characterize the contact resistance response of the gold nanocrystalline pad of a 35-nm-thick interconnect under mechanical force applied by a tungsten electrode probe. Location of a stable region for the contact resistance and the critical contact force provides better understanding of micro-contact behavior relative to the effects of the contact force and the nature of the contact surface. Increasing contact temperature leads to reduced contact resistance, softens the pad material, and modifies the contact surface. The stability of both contact resistance and interconnect resistance is studied under increasing contact force. Major fluctuations emerge when the contact force is less than the critical contact force, which shows that temporal contact resistance will affect interconnect resistance measurement accuracy, even when using the four-wire method. This performance is demonstrated experimentally by heating the Au line locally with a laser beam. Finally, the contact resistances are calculated using the LET (Li-Etsion-Talke) model together with combined Holm and Sharvin theory under various contact forces. Good agreement between the results is obtained. This research provides a way to measure change in interconnect line resistance directly under a stable contact resistance regime with a two-wire method that will greatly reduce the experimental costs.

In this paper, we present an experimental method to measure the mechanical properties of thin films. An integrated deformation and load measurement system is also developed, which consists of an electronic speckle interferometry unit, a uniaxial tensile unit and a spring beam deflection unit. The electronic speckle interferometry unit is a double-field-of-view electronic speckle pattern interferometry system, one sensitive to the in-plane displacement to measure the film deformations and the other to the out-of-plane displacement and to measure the spring beam deflections (converted to microloads). The new system allows in situ and real-time measurements of the deformations of the thin films and microforces under uniaxial tensile testing. The tested thin films can be metals, oxide ceramics, and multi-layer composites of thickness from several tens of micrometres to less than a micrometre, and the tensile load from 88 μN to 15 N. We present the underlying principle of the method and the experimental set-up. Experiments were carried out by testing the deformations of pure Ni, Au, and Au/Cr multi-layer films.
