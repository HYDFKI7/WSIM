84934437504	Physiology and pathophysiology of the epithelial barrier of the female reproductive tract role of ion channels	The epithelium lining the female reproductive tract forms a selectively permeable barrier that is responsible for creating an optimal luminal fluid microenvironment essential to the success of various reproductive events. The selective permeability of the epithelial barrier to various ions is provided by the gating of epithelial ion channels, which work together with an array of other ion transporters to drive fluid movement across the epithelium. Thus, the luminal fluid is fine-tuned by the selective barrier with tight regulation of the epithelial ion channels. This chapter discusses the role of epithelial ion channels in regulating the epithelial barrier function and thus the fluid volume and ionic composition of the female reproductive tract; physiological factors regulating the ion channels and the importance of the regulation in various reproductive events such as sperm transport and capacitation, embryo development and implantation. Disturbance of the fluid microenvironment due to defects or abnormal regulation of these ion channels and dysregulated epithelial barrier function in a number of pathological conditions, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, hydrosalpinx and infertility, are also discussed. © 2013 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media.

9144232531	Rescue of defective pancreatic secretion in cystic-fibrosis cells by suppression of a novel isoform of phospholipase C	Background: Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding an ion-transport protein, the cystic-fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defective secretion of anions is the primary cause of many of the clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis, including pancreatic insufficiency. We aimed to identify a molecular mechanism from which a new method to circumvent defective pancreatic secretion could be derived. Methods: Multiple-human-tissue RT-PCR and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses were used to examine gene expression. An antisense technique was used in conjunction with radioimmunoassay, Fura-2 spectrofluorometry, immunohistochemistry, and the short-circuit current technique (Ussing chamber) for elucidation of gene function and its application in rescuing defective pancreatic secretion. Findings: We cloned a newly identified gene, NYD-SP27, which has structural similarity to an isoform of phospholipase C. NYD-SP27 was expressed endogenously in human pancreatic-duct cells and upregulated in cystic fibrosis. Suppression of NYD-SP27, by transfection of its antisense into human cystic-fibrosis pancreatic-duct cells, resulted in augmentation of phospholipase-C-coupled calcium-ion release and protein kinase C activity, improvement in the amount of mutated CFTR reaching the plasma membrane, and restoration of cAMP-activated pancreatic anion secretion. Interpretation: NYD-SP27 exerts an inhibitory effect on phospholipase-C-coupled processes that depend on calcium ions and protein kinase C, including CFTR trafficking and function. Its upregulation in pancreatic-duct cells may reveal a previously unsuspected defect in cystic fibrosis contributing to pancreatic insufficiency, and thus represents a new target for pharmacological intervention in cystic fibrosis.

1542602386	Effect of Bak Foong Pills on enhancing dopamine release from the amygdala of female rats	To investigate whether Bak Foong Pills (BFP), a well-known gynaecological tonic, has a direct effect on the central nervous system, we employed the in vivo electrochemical detection technique, fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), to measure the dopamine release from the mesolimbic structure-amygdala of both male and female rats. The results showed that intracerebroventricular BFP (0.75, 1.5 μg) treatment promoted dopamine release from the amygdala in both female and ovariectomized female rats. The BFP-induced response appeared within 5 min after addition of BFP and lasted for at least 40 min. However, no effect of BFP was observed in male rats for an observed period of up to 60 min. The results suggest that BFP may have gender-specific beneficial effect on dopaminergic functions of the amygdala. © 2003 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

16644385563	Neuroprotective effects of Bak Foong Pill in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahyrdropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease model mice	Neuroprotective effects of estrogen and estrogen-like chemicals on neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease, have been well established. In the present study, we compared the effects of Bak Foong Pill (BFP), a well-known gynaecological tonic in China, and 17β-estradiol, on dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression patterns in ovariectomized, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahyrdropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model mice, using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MPTP, a specific dopaminergic neurotoxin, significantly decreased DAT and TH mRNA levels in the striatum, midbrain and cerebellum, but not the cortex, of C57BL/6 mice. However, MPTP-challenge with BFP pretreatment demonstrated reduced neurotoxicity, with DAT and TH mRNA levels either not affected by MPTP or affected to a significantly lesser extent in the midbrain and striatum as compared to the MPTP treated controls. 17β-estradiol treatment prevented MPTP-induced reduction of DAT expression in striatum and midbrain, but failed to alter TH expression. These results suggest that BFP is able to protect dopaminergic neurons against MPTP-induced neuronal damage in a mechanism that is different from the protective effect of estrogen. © 2004 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

20344374144	Increased cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression in the human hydrosalpinx	Background: Hydrosalpinx (HSP), characterized by abnormal fluid accumulation in the Fallopian tube, is one of the main causes of infertility in women; however, the mechanism underlying the formation of hydrosalpinx fluid (HF) remains elusive. The present study investigated the possible involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent chloride channel, in the pathogenesis of hydrosalpinx. Methods: Masson's trichrome staining was used to characterize epithelial transformation in human HSP; RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were used for CFTR expression and localization. Results: Masson's trichrome staining showed areas of epithelial transformation, focally attenuated and pseudostratified. Immunostaining showed enhanced CFTR immunoreactivity in the focally attenuated and pseudostratified areas of HSP epithelium. RT-PCR revealed that CFTR expression in HSP was significantly greater than that in normal Fallopian tubes. Conclusions: These results indicate that HSP epithelium undergoes epithelial transformation with elevated CFTR expression, which may lead to increased transepithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion resulting in HF formation. The present findings may lead to the development of new treatment strategies for infertile patients with HSP. © The Author 2005.

2142656306	Cardiovascular protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine Bak Foong Pills in spontaneously hypertensive rats	The cardiovascular protective effects of the traditional Chinese medicine Bak Foong Pills (BFP) were investigated. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated (3 g/kg) over a 5-month period and blood pressure measurements periodically tested with a plethysmographic tail cuff. Following treatment, blood samples were analysed for serum electrolyte levels and lipid levels and brain tissue subjected to micro-array analysis, in vitro experiments were also conducted to identify possible direct vasorelaxatory effect. The results showed that BFP was able to significantly reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 30 mmHg in SHR following 5 months of treatment, when compared to untreated animals. Investigation for possible mechanisms of actions revealed that BFP treated rats had elevated blood serum K

0029955236	Localization and distribution of angiotensin II in the rat epididymis	The localization and distribution of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the rat epididymis was studied using immunohistochemical and RIA techniques. The immunohistochemical results showed that Ang II-like immunoreactivity progressively increased along the length of the rat epididymis (cauda> corpus>>caput) and was predominately localized in the basal region of the epididymal epithelium. Occasionally, immunostaining of lighter intensity was also found in the apical region. The concentration of Ang II in cultured rat cauda epididymal epithelial cells was further measured by RIA. In addition to that found in cultured epithelial cells, Ang II activity was also detected in the culture medium, suggesting a secretory role of the epithelium. These findings suggest that Ang II could be derived locally from epididymal epithelium and that it could play a role in local regulation of epithelial transport and, possibly, in the maintenance of sperm function as well, by exerting its paracrine and/or autocrine effect in various regions of the epididymis.

The present paper reviews recent studies presenting evidence the presence of major components of a tissue renin-angiotensin system in the rat epididymis and the regulatory effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on epididymal anion secretion. The mechanisms for local generation of Ang II and its local action are discussed. The importance of paracrine/autocrine roles of Ang II in the maintenance of epididymal functions, as well as sperm functions is also addressed.

0031917498	Regulation of anion secretion by prostaglandin E2 in the use endometrial epithelium	The present study was an investigation of the regulation of anion secretion across cultured mouse endometrial epithelium by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using the short-circuit current (Isc) technique. The cultured endometrial monolayers responded to both apical and basolateral application of PGE2 with a sustained rise in Isc in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the potencies of apical and basolateral addition of PGE2 were different, with apparent EC50 of 200 and 4 nM, respectively. Replacement of CI- or HCO2- in the bathing solution significantly reduced the Isc responses to both apical and basolateral addition of PGE2; however, the apical response exhibited greater dependence on HCO3-. Pretreatment with diphenylamine 2,2'- dicarboxylic acid, a CI- channel blocker, significantly reduced both PGE2- induced Isc responses, while pretreatment with amiloride, a Na+ channel blocker, did not exert any effect. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, and 3-isobutyl-dihydro-testosterone-1-methyl-xanthine, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, mimicked the Isc response to PGE2 while MDL12330A, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, completely abolished the PGE2- induced Isc. The results of the present study indicate that the anion secretion across the mouse endometrial epithelium may be regulated by PGE2 involving a cAMP-dependent mechanism predominantly. The differential responses to apical and basolateral challenge with PGE2 also suggest that PGE2 of different origins may play different roles in uterine function.

0031967888	Immunohistochemical localization of angiotensin II in the mouse pancreas	Previous studies have suggested the presence of a tissue renin- angiotensin II system in the pancreas. These studies were based on the observation of several key components of the renin-angiotensin II system using molecular biological, biochemical and pharmacological approaches. In the present study, angiotensin II was localized immunohistochemically in the mouse pancreas using an indirect immunoperoxidase-staining technique. The results showed that angiotensin II-like immunoreactivity was localized predominantly in the endothelial cells of pancreatic blood vessels and the epithelial cells of pancreatic ducts from a subgroup of the vessels and ducts. Compared with those found in the pancreatic blood vessels and ductal system, a less pronounced immunoreactivity for angiotensin II was also observed in the acinar cells and in the smooth muscle layers overlying the pancreatic ducts as well as the blood vessels. However, no angiotensin IIlike immunoreactivity was detected in the islet cells. Taken together with previous findings, the present results suggest a local angiotensin II- forming system in the mouse pancreas, which may be a significant autocrine or paracrine modulator of diverse pancreatic functions, including regulation of pancreatic blood flow and pancreatic anion secretion.

In the present study sperm ion channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of RNAs of spermatogenic cells isolated from the rat testes.

0032034105	Localization and distribution of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in the rat epididymis	Previous investigation has provided evidence for the control of electrogenic chloride secretion by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) across the rat epididymal epithelium using electrophysiological measurement of transepithelial transport in cultured epididymal system. Hence, it suggests that epididymal and sperm functions are subject to control by a local PACAP system in the rat epididymis. In the present study, localization and distribution of PACAP in the rat epididymal duct was studied by an indirect immunofluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Immunoreactivity for PACAP was found in all regions of the epididymal duct. However, the intensity of immunoreactivity for PACAP was stronger in the caput and corpus regions when compared to that of the cauda epididymidis. Much weaker immunostaining for PACAP, as compared to those found in other regions, was observed in the cauda epididymidal tubules which are in close proximity to the vas deferens. No immunoreactivity for PACAP was found in epididymal spermatozoa. Together with the previous finding, the present results suggest that PACAP may exhibit a regional difference in its expression along the epididymal duct and it may act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion in the regulation of epididymal chloride secretion and hence fluid secretion, thus regulating epididymal and sperm functions along the epididymal duct.

2342666235	An epididymis-specific β-defensin is important for the initiation of sperm maturation	Although the role of the epididymis, a male accessory sex organ, in sperm maturation has been established for nearly four decades, the maturation process itself has not been linked to a specific molecule of epididymal origin. Here we show that Bin1b, a rat epididymis-specific β-defensin with antimicrobial activity, can bind to the sperm head in different regions of the epididymis with varied binding patterns. In addition, Bin1b-expressing cells, either of epididymal origin or from a Bin1b-transfected cell line, can induce progressive sperm motility in immotile immature sperm. This induction of motility is mediated by the Bin1b-induced uptake of Ca

25444441477	Ultrastructural characterization of whole hydrosalpinx from infertile Chinese women	Hydrosalpinx (HSP) has been shown to be detrimental to the outcome of assisted reproduction, but little is known of its pathology. This prospective study examined and detailed ultrastructural characterization of HSP of infertile women presenting for assisted reproductive treatments. Both light and electron microscopies were used to characterize HSP. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of HSP showed areas without epithelial cell lining or with abnormalities such as flattening of the epithelial layer and exfoliation of epithelial cells with occasional normal columnar epithelial lining. HSP muscle fibers were atrophic and occasionally replaced by fibrous tissues, or separated by areas of severe edema. Inflammatory cells could be found in hydrosalpinx fluid (HF) in the lumen in areas with flattened to no epithelial cells, without epithelial lining, as well as in dilated blood vessels and/or lymph vessels. Scanning electron microscopy of the epithelial surface revealed epithelial denudation-severe loss of both cilia and microvilli and stomata exuding globular bodies on eroded ampulla surfaces. Severe chronic inflammation and damage to the epithelial lining and musculature of Fallopian tubes and the presence of inflammatory cells provides an explanation for HF formation, and thus for the detrimental effects of HF on reproductive processes and IVF outcome. © 2005 International Federation for Cell Biology.

25444481045	Anti-apoptotic activity of Bak Foong Pills and its ingredients on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells	Bak Foong Pills (BFP), a traditional Chinese medicine used for centuries for the enhancement of women's health, was shown to display neuro-protective activity in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4,6,-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model in a previous study. In order to elucidate its mechanism of action, we investigated the anti-apoptotic properties of Bak Foong Pills and its main ingredients, including Panax ginseng, Angelica sinensis, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and Ligusticum chuanxiong, in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated PC12 cell model. The addition of the neurotoxin could cause significant cell death and reduction of cell proliferation, as shown in the results determined by MTT assay, nitric oxide (NO) measurement and flow cytometric propidium iodine (PI) staining analysis, while pre-treatment of PC12 cell with either BFP or its main ingredients prevented the toxicity to some degree. In addition, the neurotoxin caused an elevated activation of caspase-3, the key enzyme for activation of the cellular apoptotic cascade, whereas BFP or its main ingredients inhibited the activation of caspase-3. These results strongly indicate that BFP and its main ingredients may provide a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. © 2005 International Federation for Cell Biology.

27644588706	The role of inducible nitric oxide synthase in gamete interaction and fertilization: A comparative study on knockout mice of three NOS isoforms	Nitric oxide (NO), which is produced from L-arginine by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS), has been implicated in reproductive functions. However, the specific role of NOS isoforms in gamete function and fertilization is not clear. Three types of NOS knockout mice were super ovulated and fertilized in vitro and in vivo. The sperm count and motility, in vivo and in vitro fertilization rate as indicated by two-cell embryos and blastocyst rate were examined. The sperm count and motility from all three knockout mice were not significantly different from that of the wild type. Inducible NOS (iNOS) knockout mice were found to have the largest number of two-cell embryos/mouse collected after fertilization in vivo (P < 0.01), but the rate of blastocyst formation from two-cell embryos in vitro was similar for all three knockouts. The rate of in vitro fertilization using either iNOS-deficient sperm or oocytes, but not those deficient in the other two NOS isoforms, was significantly elevated when compared to that in the wild type (P < 0.001). While all three types of NOS do not seem to play a significant role in pre-ejaculated sperm function, iNOS may play an inhibitory role in sperm and oocyte functions affecting the process of fertilization and early embryo development. © 2005 International Federation for Cell Biology.

2942754238	Modulation of human enteric epithelial barrier and ion transport function by Peyer's patch lymphocytes	Aim: To investigate the role of Peyer's patch lymphocytes in the regulation of enteric epithelial barrier and ion transport function in homeostasis and host defense. Methods: Mouse Peyer's patch lymphocytes were co-cultured with human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 either in the mixed or separated (isolated but permeable compartments) culture configuration. Barrier and transport functions of the Caco-2 epithelial monolayers were measured with short-circuit current (Isc) technique. Release of cytokines was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cytokine mRNA expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Barrier and iontransport functions of both culture conditions following exposure to Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were also examined. Results: The transepithelial resistance (TER) of the epithelial monolayers co-cultured with Peyer's patch lymphocytes was maintained whereas that of the Caco-2 monolayers alone significantly decreased after eight days in culture. The forskolin-induced anion secretion, in either absence or presence of LPS, was significantly suppressed in the both co-cultures as compared with the Caco-2 cells alone. Furthermore, only the mixed co-culture condition induced the expression and release of mIL-6 from Peyer's patch lymphocytes, which could be further enhanced by LPS. However, both co-culture conditions suppressed expression and release of epithelial hIL-8 under the unstimulated conditions, while the treatment with LPS stimulated their hIL-8 expression and release. Conclusion: Peyer's patch lymphocytes may modulate intestinal epithelial barrier and ion transport function in homeostasis and host defense via cell-cell contact and cytokine signaling.

33745872933	Interaction between enteric epithelial cells and Peyer's patch lymphocytes in response to Shigella lipopolysaccharide: Effect on nitric oxide and IL-6 release	Aim: To investigate the effect of interaction between enteric epithelial cells and lymphocytes of Peyer's patch on the release of nitric oxide (NO) and IL-6 in response to Shigella lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods: Human colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2) were mixed cocultured with lymphocytes of Peyer's patch from wild-type (C57 mice) and inducible NO synthase knockout mice, and challenged with Shigella F2a-12 LPS. Release of NO and mIL-6 was measured by Griess colorimetric assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results: I n the absence of LPS challenge, NO was detected in the culture medium of Caco-2 epithelial cells but not in lymphocytes of Peyer's patch, and the NO release was further up-regulated in both cocultures with lymphocytes from either the wild-type or iNOS knockout mice, with a significantly higher level observed in the coculture with iNOS knockout lymphocytes. After Shigella F2a-12 LPS challenge for 24-h, NO production was significantly increased in both Caco-2 alone and the coculture with lymphocytes of Peyer's patch from the wild-type mice but not from iNOS knockout mice. LPS was found to stimulate the release of mIL-6 from lymphocytes, which was suppressed by coculture with Caco-2 epithelial cells. The LPS-induced mIL-6 production in lymphocytes from iNOS knockout mice was significantly greater than that from the wild-type mice. Conclusion: Lymphocytes of Peyer's patch maintain a constitutive basal level of NO production from the enteric epithelial cell Caco-2. LPS-induced mIL-6 release from lymphocytes of Peyer's patch is suppressed by the cocultured epithelial cells. While no changes are detectable in NO production in lymphocytes from both wild-type and iNOS knockout mice before and after LPS challenge, NO from lymphocytes appears to play an inhibitory role in epithelial NO release and their own mIL-6 release in response to LPS. © 2006 The WJG Press.

33748965932	ATL-mediated anion secretion in cystic fibrosis pancreatic duct cells	It has been suggested that the apical Cl conductance plays a pivotal role in pancreatic ductal bicarbonate secretion by recirculating the Cl imported into duct cells through the Cl -HCO, exchanger. The -adrenergic (cAMP-dependent) regulation of Cl conductance is defective in cystic fibrosis (CF). The present study explored alternative regulation of anion secretion in CF pancreatic ductal cells (CFPAC-1 cells grown on permeable supports) by angiotensin II (All) using the short-circuit current (/5C) technique. An increase in 7ic could be induced in CFPAC-1 cells by basolateral application of AH in a concentration-dependent manner (ECSO at 0.5 /M). Replacement of Cl' in the bathing solution or treatment with a Cl channel blocker, DIDS, markedly reduced ihe /sc, indicating that large portion of the All-activated lsc was Cl'-dependent. Angiotensin receptor subtypes were identified using specific antagonists, losartan and PD123177, for AT, and AT2 receptors, respectively. It was found that losartan (1 /iM) could completely inhibit the All-induced /sc, whereas, PD123177 exerted insignificant effect on the Ix, indicating the involvement of AT, receptors.

Hematoxylin staining showed that after 4 days grown on permeable supports, rMSCs formed an epithelial-like monolayer. Immunofluorescence of the permeably-supported monolayers, but not the rMSCs grown in culture flasks, showed positive signals for epithelial markers, cytokeratin 5 & 8.

In an in vivo study, rats were randomized into four groups: (1) sham-burn group, (2) burn group (40% total body surface area full-thickness burn), (3) burn + SB203580 group, and (4) burn + vehicle group. The rats from each group were killed at varying times after burn to examine the p38 MAP kinase activation (by means of Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical assay), the expression of cPLA2 (by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), the level of cardiac membrane phospholipids, and the level of the remaining creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) isoenzyme in the heart. These studies showed that burn resulted in a significant decrease in the level of cardiac membrane phospholipids from 3 to 24 h after burn, which was paralleled with a persistent activation of p38 MAP kinase and an increased expression of cPLA2 in the heart. SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, inhibited the activation of cardiac p38 MAP kinase, suppressed the burn-induced upregulation of cPLA2 and the increased PLA2 activity, and prevented burn-induced decrease in the levels of the cardiac membrane phospholipids and the remaining creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme. In addition, the in vitro treatment of cardiac myocytes with SB203580 also abolished the upregulation of cPLA2 and the disturbance of phospholipid homeostasis elicited by hypoxia and burn serum challenge. Taken together, these results have demonstrated for the first time that p38 MAP kinase is involved in burn-induced membrane phospholipids degradation in cardiac myocytes, at least in part through the regulation of cPLA2. ©2007The Shock Society.

0033765149	In silico studies of energy metabolism of normal and diseased heart	Biotechnology research is developing into genomic analyses that involve the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes. The development of various bioinformatics resources that provide efficient access to information is necessary. We have used single-pass sequencing of randomly selected cDNA clones to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs). These ESTs data has been widely used to study gene expression in a variety of heart libraries [1, 2]. Data annotation on our recent finding allows us to construct the profiles of genes in the energy metabolizing pathways (glycolysis and glycogen metabolism) that are expressed in heart cDNA libraries. In silico studies of genes of energy metabolism yields data that are consistent with results derived from conventional metabolic experiments. The change in gene profiles describing the metabolism of diseased hearts is also presented here.

39049145972	Bak Foong protects dopaminergic neurons against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity by its anti-apoptotic activity	Bak Foong pill (BFP) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used for treatment of various gynaecological disorders. In addition, it exerts beneficial effects on other functional systems including the central nervous system. In the present study, we have investigated the possible neuroprotective action of BFP upon the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system by examining its effect on the expression patterns of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahyrdropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model. MPTP significantly decreased TH and DAT mRNA levels in the striatum and midbrain of both female and male C57BL/6 mice. However, with BFP pre-treatment mice showed a reduced neurotoxicity, with TH and DAT mRNA levels either not affected by MPTP or affected to a lesser extent in the midbrain and striatum when compared to vehicle treated animals. Possible anti-apoptotic activity of BFP was further studied in a dopamine-secreting neuroendocrine cell line, PC12. In this assay, MPTP elevated the expression of a pro-apoptotic gene, Bax, while this expression was reduced by BFP pre-treatment. Flow cytometry results also revealed that the effect of MPTP-induced apoptosis in PC12 cell lines was significantly reduced by BFP. The present results suggest that BFP is able to protect dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxin-induced neuronal injury with anti-apoptotic activity being one of the possible mechanisms. © 2007 International Federation for Cell Biology.

0034712153	Testicular hormonal regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the rat epididymis	Evidence for the existence of an intrinsic angiotensin system based on locally formed angiotensinogen as a precursor for angiotensin production has been demonstrated in the rat epididymis. The data strongly support the presence of an epididymal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which may be important for epididymal and sperm functions. In the present study, the effects of castration and testicular hormonal replacement on the expression of RAS components from the rat epididymis are investigated at the gene and protein levels. Results from northern blot and western blot analyses consistently showed that the expression of angiotensinogen mRNA and protein was apparently abolished by castration whereas their expression was completely restored to control levels when the castrated rats were hormonally replaced with either testosterone alone or with combined testosterone and estradiol. Northern blot did not detect any signal for angiotensinogen mRNA while western blot could detect a weak signal for angiotensinogen protein when the castrated rats were replaced with estradiol alone. Renin could be detected neither in control, castrated nor hormonally replaced rats. Moreover, the expression of angiotensin II receptor, type I (AT

However, the question of whether and how CD147 may be involved in the apoptotic process during spermatogenesis remains elusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CD147 in the regulation of germ cell apoptosis in mice. Methods CD147 function was blocked by anti-CD147 antibody in GC-1 (immortalized spermatogonia) and GC-2 (immortalized spermatocytes) cell lines and in testicular germ cells in vivo. Testes size and weight were examined after injection of anti-CD147 antibody into the seminiferous tubules of severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Germ cell apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and levels of p53 and two effectors, caspase 3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), using western blots. Results The size and weight of the CD147-immunodepleted testes were decreased compared with that in control testes (P < 0.001). The TUNEL assay showed an increase in the number of apoptotic spermatocytes (P < 0.001 versus control) but not spermatogonia in Stages XIXII of CD147-immunodepleted testes. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that CD147 immunodepletion induced an increase in apoptosis in GC-2 cells (P < 0.001 versus control) but had no effect on GC-1 cells. Moreover, deprivation of CD147 induced apoptosis in spermatocytes through a p53-independent mechanism, which led to caspase 3 and PARP activation. Conclusions We have demonstrated that immunodepletion of CD147 induces p53-independent apoptosis in mouse spermatocytes but not spermatogonia. © 2012 The Author.

84867045888	CFTR mediates bicarbonate-dependent activation of miR-125b in preimplantation embryo development	Although HCO 3 is known to be required for early embryo development, its exact role remains elusive. Here we report that HCO 3 acts as an environmental cue in regulating miR-125b expression through CFTR-mediated influx during preimplantation embryo development. The results show that the effect of HCO 3 on preimplantation embryo development can be suppressed by interfering the function of a HCO 3-conducting channel, CFTR, by a specific inhibitor or gene knockout. Removal of extracellular HCO 3 or inhibition of CFTR reduces miR-125b expression in 2 cell-stage mouse embryos. Knockdown of miR-125b mimics the effect of HCO 3 removal and CFTR inhibition, while injection of miR-125b precursor reverses it. Downregulation of miR-125b upregulates p53 cascade in both human and mouse embryos. The activation of miR-125b is shown to be mediated by sAC/PKA-dependent nuclear shuttling of NF-κB. These results have revealed a critical role of CFTR in signal transduction linking the environmental HCO 3 to activation of miR-125b during preimplantation embryo development and indicated the importance of ion channels in regulation of miRNAs. © 2012 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

84867113575	Ion channels/transporters as epigenetic regulators? -a microRNA perspective	MicroRNA (miRNA) alterations in response to changes in an extracellular microenvironment have been observed and considered as one of the major mechanisms for epigenetic modifications of the cell. While enormous efforts have been made in the understanding of the role of miRNAs in regulating cellular responses to the microenvironment, the mechanistic insight into how extracellular signals can be transduced into miRNA alterations in cells is still lacking. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that ion channels/transporters, which are known to conduct or transport ions across the cell membrane, also exhibit changes in levels of expression and activities in response to changes of extracellular microenvironment. More importantly, alterations in expression and function of ion channels/transporters have been shown to result in changes in miRNAs that are known to change in response to alteration of the microenvironment. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent data demonstrating the ability of ion channels/transporters to transduce extracellular signals into miRNA changes and propose a potential link between cells and their microenvironment through ion channels/transporters. At the same time, we hope to provide new insights into epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying a number of physiological and pathological processes, including embryo development and cancer metastasis. © 2012 The Author(s).

4444369588	Effects of Bak Foong Pills and Menoease Pills on white blood cell distribution in old age female rats	This study examined the effects of Bak Foong Pills (BFP) and the new BFP-derived post-menopause formula, Menoease Pills (MBFP), on the distribution of peripheral white blood cells (WBC) between BFP/MBFP-treated and non-treated rats. Eighteen months old female SD rats were used to mimic post-menopausal and old age animal models. The percentage distribution of lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes were measured using flow cytometry with and without treatments of BFP or MBFP. Results showed that WBC distribution in old age rats were significantly different from that of adult rats, suggesting that as the animal aged, their WBC distributions were altered. Old age rats were observed to have much lower percentages of lymphocytes, but higher percentages of granulocytes when compared to the adult rats, indicating possible attenuated immunity. Following treatment with BFP or MBFP, WBC populations were found to be redistributed back into the ranges observed in adult animals. Furthermore, MBFP, was found to alter WBC distribution in a dose-dependent manner. When compared to estrogen (E

44449151611	Involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in infection-induced edema	Abnormal fluid accumulation in tissues, including the life-threatening cerebral and pulmonary edema, is a severe consequence of bacteria infection. Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis is an obligate intracellular gram-negative human pathogen responsible for a spectrum of diseases, causing tissue fluid accumulation and edema in various organs. However, the underlying mechanism for tissue fluid secretion induced by C. trachomatis and most of other infectious pathogens is not known. Here, we report that in mice C. trachomatis infection models, the expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP activated chloride channel, is up regulated together with increased cytokine release and tissue fluid accumulation that can be reversed by treatment with antibiotic specific for C. trachomatis and CFTR channel blocker.

4644318384	A gene encoding sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase found in human adult testis	Using differential display RT-PCR, we identified a gene of 2750 bp from human adult testis, named H-Lse, which encoded a putative protein of 523 amino acids and molecular weight of 58 kd with structural characteristics similar to that of mouse lysosome sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase. Northern blot analysis showed a widespread distribution of H-Lse in various human tissues with high expression in the testis, prostate, and colon. In situ hybridization results showed that while H-Lse was not detected in embryonic testis, positive signals were found in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in adult testis of human. The subcellular localization of H-Lse was visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the amino terminus of H-Lse, showing compartmentalization of H-Lse in large dense-core vesicles, presumably lysosomes, in the cytoplasm. The developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific expression of H-Lse suggests its possible involvement in the development of the testis and/or differentiation of germ cells.

However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation are unknown. The present study investigated the regulation of smooth muscle contraction by the epithelium in rat vas deferens and the possible factor(s) involved. Exogenously applied ATP inhibited electrical field stimulation (EFS)-evoked smooth muscle contraction in an epithelium-dependent manner. As the effects of ATP on smooth muscle contractility were abrogated by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, but not by those of nitric oxide synthesis, prostaglandins might mediate the effects of ATP.

55649104483	Involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the pathogenesis of hydrosalpinx induced by Chlamydia trachomatis infection	Background: Genital Chlamydia (C) trachomatis infection has been recognized as the single most common cause of pelvic inflammatory disease leading to severe tubal damage, ectopic pregnancy, infertility and hydrosalpinx. However, the mechanism underlying the formation of hydrosalpinx induced by C. trachomatis infection remains largely unknown. We performed this study to determine the involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel that regulates epithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion, in hydrosalpinx fluid formation. Methods: Western blot analysis was used to determine CFTR expression in the hydrosalpinges that were seen on the ultrasound scans of infertile assisted reproduction treatment patients. Correlation with C. trachomatis infection was done by testing patients' sera for C. trachomatis immunoglobulin G antibody titer using a Capita enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based kit. CFTR involvement was further verified in a rat C. trachomatis infection model and confirmed using CFTR mutant (CFTR

57349136681	A novel member of the Rhomboid family, RHBDD1, regulates BIK-mediated apoptosis	Rhomboid family members are widely conserved and found in all three kingdoms of life. They are serine proteases and serve important regulatory functions. In the present study, a novel gene highly expressed in the testis, RHBDD1, is shown to be a new member of the Rhomboid family, participating in the cleavage of BIK, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. The RHBDD1-involved proteolytic modification is upstream of the BIK protein degradation pathway. Mutagenesis studies show that the amino acid residues glycine142 and serine144 of RHBDD1 are crucial for its activity in cleaving BIK at a site located in the transmembrane region. Overexpression or knock-down of RHBDD1 in HEK 293T cells can reduce or enhance BIK-mediated apoptosis, respectively. The present findings suggest that, by acting as a serine protease, RHBDD1 modulates BIK-mediated apoptotic activity. © 2008 Birkhaueser.

61449222731	Altered expression of inflammatory cytokine receptors in response to LPS challenge through interaction between intestinal epithelial cells and lymphocytes of Peyer's patch	The intense innate immunological activities occurring at the enteric mucosal surface involve interactions between intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells. Our previous studies have indicated that Peyer's patch lymphocytes may modulate intestinal epithelial barrier and ion transport function in homeostasis and host defense via cell-cell contact as well as cytokine signaling. The present study was undertaken using the established co-culture system of Caco-2 epithelial cells with lymphocytes of Peyer's patch to investigate the expression of IL-8 and IL-6 cytokines and cytokine receptors in the co-culture system after challenge with Shigella F2a-12 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2 was co-cultured with freshly isolated lymphocytes from the murine Peyer's patch either in the mixed or separated (isolated but permeable compartments) co-culture configuration, and was challenged with Shigella F2a-12 LPS for 8 h. The level of mRNA expressions of human interleukin-8 (hIL-8), human interleukin-8 receptor (hIL-8R), mouse interleukin-8 receptor (mIL-8R), mouse interleukin-6 (mIL-6), mouse interleukin-6 receptor (mIL-6R) and human interleukin-6 receptor (hIL-6R) was examined by semi-quantitative PCR. In both co-culture groups, hIL-8 expression of Caco-2 cells was decreased, and hIL-8R expression was increased compared to the Caco-2 alone group. Upon LPS challenge, hIL-8 expression from the Caco-2 cells of both co-culture groups was higher than in the Caco-2 control group. The increased hIL-8 expression of Caco-2 cells in the separated co-culture group is correlated with a decreased hIL-8R expression and an increased mIL-8R expression. In the mixed co-culture group, the increased expression of hIL-8 was associated with the upregulated hIL-8R expression on Caco-2 cells and downregulated mIL-8R on murine Peyer's patch lymphocytes (PPL). mIL-6 expression from mouse PPL was also upregulated by LPS in mixed co-culture. However, upon the treatment with LPS, hIL-6R expression of Caco-2 cells was decreased in the mixed co-culture, but increased in separated co-culture. The data suggest that release of hIL-8 from epithelial cells may act on lymphocytes through a paracrine pathway, but it may also act on the epithelial cells themselves via an autocrine pathway. The data also suggest that the release of mIL-6 from Peyer's patch lymphocytes affects epithelial cells in a paracrine fashion. © 2009 International Federation for Cell Biology.

63049113417	A sperm GPI-anchored protein elicits sperm-cumulus cross-talk leading to the acrosome reaction	The acrosome reaction has long been thought to be induced by the zona pellucida. Here we report the identification and function of a novel human sperm glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein, NYD-SP8. The release of the protein during sperm-egg interaction and its binding to the cumulus, the first layer of egg investment, elicits cross-talk between the gametes and produces calcium dependant release of progesterone, which lead to the acrosome reaction. An in vivo mouse model of NYD-SP8 immunization is also established showing a reduced fertility rate. Thus, contrary to accepted dogma, our study demonstrates for the first time that, prior to reaching the zona pellucida, sperm may release a surface protein that acts on the cumulus cells leading to the acrosome reaction, which may be important for determining the outcome of fertilization. © 2009 Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel.

65749098190	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in reproductive health and disease	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, which is expressed in epithelial cells of a wide variety of tissues including the reproductive tracts. Mutations in the gene encoding CFTR cause cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disease in Caucasian populations with a multitude of clinical manifestations including infertility/subfertility in both sexes. However, the physiological role of CFTR in reproduction and its involvement in the pathogenesis of reproductive diseases remain largely unknown. This review discusses the role of CFTR in regulating fluid volume and bicarbonate secretion in the reproductive tracts and their importance in various reproductive events. We also discuss the contribution of CFTR dysfunction to a number of pathological conditions. The evidence presented is consistent with an important role of CFTR in reproductive health and disease, suggesting that CFTR might be a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive diseases including infertility. © 2009 The Authors.

67650948505	Activation of GABAA receptor/Cl- channel and capacitation in rat spermatozoa: HCO3 - and Cl- are essential	This study was designed to determine whether HCO3- and Cl- are required for the activation of the GABAA receptor/Cl- channel (GBRC) by GABA and the subsequent capacitation of rat sperm. Spermatozoa from adult Sprague Dawley rats were incubated in four different media: modified complete rat fertilization medium (mRFM), Cl - deficient (Cl - DF) mRFM, HCO3 - DF mRFM, and Cl - DF HCO3 - DF mRFM, with or without GBRC agonists (GABA and progesterone) or GBRC antagonists (bicuculline and picrotoxin) for 0-6 h under capacitating conditions. Sperm capacitation and hyperactivation were assessed by chlortetracycline staining and computer-assisted sperm analysis, respectively. The results showed that GABA added to the mRFM accelerated capacitation and hyperactivation, followed by increase in the acrosome reaction, reaching maximum value after 5 h. Progesterone also accelerated sperm capacitation and hyperactivation. Bicuculline and picrotoxin, antagonists of GABA, blocked the effects of both GABA and progesterone acceleration of sperm capacitation and hyperactivation. Sperm capacitation required both Cl- and HCO3-. These results indicate that activation of GBRC may contribute to sperm capacitation and hyperactivation, and that both HCO3- and Cl- are essential. This is the first report of a close relationship between HCO3-/Cl- transport and the activation of GBRC in rat sperm capacitation and hyperactivation. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

0034771023	Upregulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator expression by oestrogen and Bak Foong Pill in mouse uteri	Although cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been shown to be expressed in the female reproductive tract, its functional role in the uterus is not fully understood. The present study investigated a possible physiological role of CFTR by comparing the effects of 17β-oestradiol and Bak Foong Pill (BFP), an over-the-counter Chinese medicine used for centuries for the treatment of various gynaecological disorders, on uterus size and the expression of CFTR in the uterus of ovariectomised mice using RT-PCR. Treatment of ovariectomised mice with 17β-oestradiol (0.2 mg/kg, p.o.) for 12 days caused a significant increase in uterine wet weight compared to vehicle. However, treatment with BFP (3 g/kg, p.o.) for the same period failed to increase uterine wet weight, indicating a lack of direct oestrogen-like activity of BFP. Analysis of CFTR mRNA expression in the harvested uteri using RT-PCR showed that both 17β-oestradiol and BFP induced an increase in CFTR mRNA expression in mouse uteri compared to levels observed in vehicle-treated animals. These results suggest that CFTR can be upregulated by oestrogen and BFP, however, the effect exerted by BFP does not seem to be mediated by direct oestrogen-like activity. Regulation of CFTR expression by both oestrogen and gynaecological medication BFP indicates an important role of CFTR in reproductive functions. © 2001 Academic Press.

0034775225	Quantification of apoptotic DNA fragmentation in a transformed uterine epithelial cell line, HRE-H9, using capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detector (CE-LIF)	Apoptotic cell death of uterine epithelial cells is thought to play an important role in the onset of menstruation and the successful implantation of an embryo during early pregnancy. Abnormal apoptosis in these cells can result in dysmenorrhoea and infertility. In addition, decreased rate of epithelial apoptosis likely contributes to endometriosis. A key step in the onset of apoptosis in these cells is cleavage of the genomic DNA between nucleosomes, resulting in polynucleosomal-sized fragments of DNA. The conventional technique for assessing apoptotic DNA fragmentation uses agarose (slab) gel electrophoresis (i.e. DNA laddering). However, recent technological advances in the use of capillary electrophoresis (CE), particularly the introduction of the laser-induced fluorescence detector (LIF), has made it possible to perform DNA laddering with improved automation and much greater sensitivity. In the present study, we have further developed the CE-LIF technique by using a DNA standard curve to quantify accurately the amount of DNA in the apoptotic DNA fragments and have applied this new quantitative technique to study apoptosis in a transformed uterine epithelial cell line, the HRE-H9 cells. Apoptosis was induced in the HRE-H9 cells by serum deprivation for 5, 7 and 24 h, resulting in increased DNA fragmentation of 2.2-, 3.1- and 6.2-fold, respectively, above the 0 h or plus-serum controls. This ultrasensitive CE-LIF technique provides a novel method for accurately measuring the actions of pro- or anti-apoptotic agents or conditions on uterine epithelial cell lines. © 2001 Academic Press.

77449097807	A suppressor of multiple extracellular matrix-degrading proteases and cancer metastasis	Cancer metastasis remains the most poorly understood process in cancer biology. It involves the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by a series of 'tumour-associated' proteases. Here we report the identification of a novel protease suppressor, NYD-SP8, which is located on human chromosome 19q13.2. NYD-SP8 encodes a 27 kD GPI-anchored cell surface protein, which shows structural homology to urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NYD-SP8 binds to uPA/uPAR complexes and interfere with active uPA production. Overexpression of NYD-SP8 results in reducing activities of the three major classes of proteases known to be involved in ECM degradation, including uPA, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cathepsin B, leading to suppression of both in vitro and in vivo cancer cell invasion and metastasis. These data demonstrate an important role of NYD-SP8 in regulating ECM degradation, providing a novel mechanism that modulates urokinase signalling in the suppression of cancer progression. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

75949118528	Immunization with Bin1b decreases sperm motility with compromised fertility in rats	Objective: To evaluate the contraceptive ability of a synthetic Bin1b peptide in vivo in the rat. Design: Basic research. Setting: University laboratory animal service center. Animal(s): A peptide-based immunization model was developed; rats were injected with the Bin1b specific peptide. Intervention(s): A synthetic peptide segment, MCRSGERKGDICSDP-conjugated with KLH (Bin1b), was used to immunize male wistar rats. Freund's complete adjuvant was used as a control. Main Outcome Measure(s): Anti-Bin1b levels in sera were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-Bin1b and control antisera were used to evaluate sperm function inhibition in vitro. The fertility of immunized rats was determined by mating experiment. The testis and epididymides were analyzed by histology. Result(s): Histological studies showed no evidence of orchitis or epididymitis in Bin1b-immunized animals. ELISA results revealed that the titers of anti-Bin1b antibodies in serum increased with the immunization process in immunized rats. Sperm recovered from the corpus epididymidis of the Bin1b-immunized animals exhibited a significant decrease in motility. Immunization of Bin1b also caused a reduction (25%) in fertility after the mating experiment. Conclusion(s): The present study has demonstrated that immunization with Bin1b peptide specifically interferes with sperm motility, resulting in a compromised fertilizing capacity of sperm. © 2010 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

77952320849	Abnormally up-regulated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator expression and uterine fluid accumulation contribute to Chlamydia trachomatis-induced female infertility	Objective: To investigate whether abnormal expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cyclic adenosine 3′:5′ monophosphate (cAMP)-activated chloride channel, and uterine fluid accumulation upon Chlamydia trachomatis infection may result in implantation failure, thus contributing to C. trachomatis-induced female infertility. Design: Experimental animal study. Setting: University laboratory animal service center. Animal(s): Adult female mice with regular estrous cycles. Intervention(s): Intrauterine injection of C. trachomatis lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and estrogen (E) at diestrus and preimplantation. Main Outcome Measure(s): The CFTR messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively, in mouse uterus treated with C. trachomatis LPS, TNF-α or E. Endometrial electrolyte transport and uterine fluid accumulation were determined by the short circuit current and uterine wet weight, respectively. Number of implanted embryos was also counted to demonstrate the effect of treatments. Result(s): Uterine C. trachomatis LPS infection induced up-regulation of CFTR expression with enhanced anion secretion, abnormal fluid accumulation in mouse uterus at diestrus, and reduced implantation rate. Administration of exogenous TNF-α to mouse uterus mimicked the C. trachomatis LPS infection-induced CFTR up-regulation, enhanced CFTR channel activity, and fluid accumulation. Abnormal uterine fluid accumulation and implantation failure were also observed when CFTR was up-regulated by E. Conclusion(s): The present results suggest that C. trachomatis infection-induced release of cytokines could abnormally up-regulate CFTR expression leading to abnormal uterine fluid accumulation, which may result in infertility often associated with C. trachomatis infection. © 2010 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

77951978312	Mechanosensitive gating of CFTR	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion and intracellular ligand-gated channel associated with cystic fibrosis, a lethal genetic disorder common among Caucasians. Here we show that CFTR is robustly activated by membrane stretch induced by negative pressures as small as 5 mmHg at the single-channel, cellular and tissue levels. Stretch increased the product of the number of channels present and probability of being open (NPo), and also increased the unitary conductance of CFTR in cell-attached membrane patches. CFTR stretch-mediated activation appears to be an intrinsic property independent of cytosolic factors and kinase signalling. CFTR stretch-mediated activation resulted in chloride transport in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells and mouse intestinal tissues. Our study has revealed an unexpected function of CFTR in mechanosensing, in addition to its roles as a ligand-gated anion channel and a regulator of other membrane transporters, demonstrating for the first time a mechanosensitive anion channel with a clearly defined molecular identity. Given that CFTR is often found in mechanically dynamic environments, its mechanosensitivity has important physiological implications in epithelial ion transport and cell volume regulation in vivo. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

77957320448	Switching from bone marrow-derived neurons to epithelial cells through dedifferentiation and translineage redifferentiation	While the ability of stem cells to switch lineages has been suggested, the route(s) through which this may happen is unclear. To date, the best characterized adult stem cell population considered to possess transdifferentiation capacity is BM-MSCs (bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells). We investigated whether BM-MSCs that had terminally differentiated into the neural or epithelial lineage could be induced to transdifferentiate into the other phenotype in vitro. Our results reveal that neuronal phenotypic cells derived from adult rat bone marrow cells can be switched to epithelial phenotypic cells, or vice versa, by culture manipulation allowing the differentiated cells to go through, first, dedifferentiation and then redifferentiation to another phenotype. Direct transdifferentiation from differentiated neuronal or epithelial phenotype to the other differentiated phenotype cannot be observed even when appropriate culture conditions are provided. Thus, dedifferentiation appears to be a prerequisite for changing fate and differentiating into a different lineage from a differentiated cell population. © The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2010 Portland Press Limited.

77957353564	Interaction between endometrial epithelial cells and blood leucocytes promotes cytokine release and epithelial barrier function in response to Chlamydia trachomatis lipopolysaccharide stimulation	Chlamydia trachomatis infection is currently the most common cause of infection-related sterility in women. However, it remains largely unknown how uterine epithelial cells interact with recruited leucocytes in response to C. trachomatis infection in the female genital tract. To study the defence mechanism of the endometrium against C. trachomatis infection, we established an in vitro co-culture of EEC (endometrial epithelial cells) and PBL (peripheral blood leucocytes) isolated from mice and investigated the immune response of these cells upon C. trachomatis LPS (lipopolysaccharide) challenge using a cytokine antibody array and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR). Our results showed that upon C. trachomatis LPS stimulation, proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1b, MIPs (macrophage inflammatory proteins), IL-12p40p70, KC, GCSFs (granulocyte colony stimulating factors), IL-6 and TIMPs (tissue inhibition metalloproteinases) are up-regulated and/or released from EEC-PBL co-culture. Further, the TER (transepithelial resistance), measured by the Isc (short-circuit current) technique was significantly increased in EEC/PBL co-cultured cells and also when stimulated with C. trachomatis LPS compared with EEC alone. These changes appear to be mediated by the change in cytokine-induced expression of tight junction-related protein ZO-1. The present results demonstrated that the epithelial-immune cross-talk could promote the release of proinflammatory cytokines and enhance the barrier function of the endometrium against C. trachomatis infection in the female reproductive tract. © The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2010 Portland Press Limited.

77957879994	Lymphocytes accelerate epithelial tight junction assembly: Role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)	The tight junctions (TJs), characteristically located at the apicolateral borders of adjacent epithelial cells, are required for the proper formation of epithelial cell polarity as well as for sustaining the mucosal barrier to the external environment. The observation that lymphocytes are recruited by epithelial cells to the sites of infection [1] suggests that they may play a role in the modulation of epithelial barrier function and thus contribute to host defense. To test the ability of lymphocytes to modulate tight junction assembly in epithelial cells, we set up a lymphocyte-epithelial cell co-culture system, in which Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, a well-established model cell line for studying epithelial TJ assembly [2], were cocultured with mouse lymphocytes to mimic an infection state. In a typical calcium switch experiment, the TJ assembly in coculture was found to be accelerated compared to that in MDCK cells alone. This accelaration was found to be mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation was independent of changes in cellular ATP levels but it was found to be activated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Forced suppression of AMPK, either with a chemical inhibitor or by knockdown, abrogated the accelerating effect of lymphocytes on TJ formation. Similar results were also observed in a coculture with lymphocytes and Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells, suggesting that the activation of AMPK may be a general mechanism underlying lymphocyte-accelerated TJ assembly in different epithelia. These results suggest that signals from lymphocytes, such as cytokines, facilitate TJ assembly in epithelial cells via the activation of AMPK. © 2010 Tang et al.

78149371688	Involvement of calpain-I and microRNA34 in kanamycin-induced apoptosis of inner ear cells	Inner ear cells, including hair cells, spiral ganglion cells, stria vascularis cells and supporting cells on the basilar membrane, play a major role in transducing hearing signals and regulating inner ear homoeostasis. However, their functions are often damaged by antibiotic-induced ototoxicity. Apoptosis is probably involved in inner ear cell injury following aminoglycoside treatment. Calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, is essential for mediating and promoting cell death. We have therefore investigated the involvement of calpain in the molecular mechanism underlying ototoxicity induced by the antibiotic kanamycin in mice. Kanamycin (750 mg/kg) mainly induced cell death of cochlear cells, including stria vascularis cells, supporting cells and spiral ganglion cells, but not hair cells within the organ of Corti. Cell death due to apoptosis occurred in a time-dependent manner with concomitant up-regulation of calpain expression. Furthermore, the expression levels of two microRNAs, mir34a and mir34c, were altered in a dose-dependent manner in cochlear cells. These novel findings demonstrated the involvement of both calpain and microRNAs in antibiotic-induced ototoxicity. © The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2010 Portland Press Limited.

78650184478	Regulatory mechanism underlying cyclic changes in mouse uterine bicarbonate secretion: Role of estrogen	Our previous study has demonstrated that bicarbonate in the uterine fluid plays an indispensable role in sperm capacitation. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of bicarbonate-rich uterine fluid and the regulatory mechanism remained largely unknown. In this study, the expression profiles of bicarbonate transport/production proteins, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), SLC26A6, carbonic anhydrase 2 (CAR2, CA2) and CAR12 (CA12), throughout the estrous cycle, were examined in the mouse uterus by western blot. The results showed that the maximum expression levels of the proteins examined were observed at estrus. Luminal surface pH measurements showed that the resting uterine surface pH at estrus was significantly higher than that at diestrus, which could be reduced significantly by CFTR blocker, diphenylamine-2,2′-dicarboxylic acid, SLC26A6 inhibitor, 4′,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2′,2′-disulfonic acid, and CA inhibitor, acetazolamide. In ovariectomized mice and primary culture of endometrial epithelial cells, estrogen could upregulate CFTR, SLC26A6, CAR2, and CAR12 expression with a corresponding increase in the bicarbonate-dependent short-circuit current (I

79952165899	A protective mechanism against antibiotic-induced ototoxicity: Role of prestin	Hearing loss or ototoxicity is one of the major side effects associated with the use of the antibiotics, particularly aminoglycosides (AGs), which are the most commonly used antibiotics worldwide. However, the molecular and cellular events involved in the antibiotic-induced ototoxicity remains unclear. In the present study, we test the possibility that prestin, the motor protein specifically expressed in the basolateral membrane of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea with electromotility responsible for sound amplification, may be involved in the process of AG-induced apoptosis in OHCs. Our results from both mice model and cultured cell line indicate a previously unexpected role of prestin, in mediating antibiotic-induced apoptosis, the effect of which is associated with its anion-transporting capacity. The observed downregulation of prestin mRNA prior to detectable apoptosis in OHCs and hearing loss in the antibiotic-treated mice is interesting, which may serve as a protective mechanism against hearing loss induced by AGs in the early stage. © 2011 Yu et al.

79953232031	Acrosome reaction in the cumulus oophorus revisited: Involvement of a novel sperm-released factor NYD-SP8	Fertilization is a process involving multiple steps that lead to the final fusion of one sperm and the oocyte to form the zygote. One of the steps, acrosome reaction (AR), is an exocytosis process, during which the outer acrosome membrane fuses with the inner sperm membrane, leading to the release of acrosome enzymes that facilitate sperm penetration of the egg investments. Though AR has been investigated for decades, the initial steps of AR in vivo, however, remain largely unknown. A well elucidated model holds the view that AR occurs on the surface of the zona pellucida (ZP), which is triggered by binding of sperm with one of the ZP glycosylated protein, ZP3. However, this model fails to explain the large number of 'falsely' acrosome-reacted sperms found within the cumulus layer in many species examined. With the emerging evidence of cross-talk between sperm and cumulus cells, the potential significance of AR in the cumulus oophorus, the outer layer of the egg, has been gradually revealed. Here we review the acrosome status within the cumulus layer, the cross-talk between sperm and cumulus cells with the involvement of a novel spermreleased factor, NYD-SP8, and re-evaluate the importance and physiological significance of the AR in the cumulus in fertilization. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79953685463	The non-catalytic carboxyl-terminal domain of ARFGAP1 regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization by antagonizing the activation of Rac1	Background: The regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking is coordinated in mammalian cells. One of the regulators of membrane traffic, the small GTP-binding protein ARF1, also activates phosphatidylinositol kinases that in turn affect actin polymerization. ARFGAP1 is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for ARF1 that is found on Golgi membranes. We present evidence that ARFGAP1 not only serves as a GAP for ARF1, but also can affect the actin cytoskeleton. Principal Findings: As cells attach to a culture dish foci of actin appear prior to the cells flattening and spreading. We have observed that overexpression of a truncated ARFGAP1 that lacks catalytic activity for ARF, called GAP273, caused these foci to persist for much longer periods than non-transfected cells. This phenomenon was dependent on the level of GAP273 expression. Furthermore, cell spreading after re-plating or cell migration into a previously scraped area was inhibited in cells transfected with GAP273. Live cell imaging of such cells revealed that actin-rich membrane blebs formed that seldom made protrusions of actin spikes or membrane ruffles, suggesting that GAP273 interfered with the regulation of actin dynamics during cell spreading. The over-expression of constitutively active alleles of ARF6 and Rac1 suppressed the effect of GAP273 on actin. In addition, the activation of Rac1 by serum, but not that of RhoA or ARF6, was inhibited in cells over-expressing GAP273, suggesting that Rac1 is a likely downstream effector of ARFGAP1. The carboxyl terminal 65 residues of ARFGAP1 were sufficient to produce the effects on actin and cell spreading in transfected cells and co-localized with cortical actin foci. Conclusions: ARFGAP1 functions as an inhibitor upstream of Rac1 in regulating actin cytoskeleton. In addition to its GAP catalytic domain and Golgi binding domain, it also has an actin regulation domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein. © 2011 Siu, et al.

79955837870	Defective CFTR-dependent CREB activation results in impaired Spermatogenesis and Azoospermia	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disease among Caucasians caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with over 95% male patients infertile. However, whether CFTR mutations could affect spermatogenesis and result in azoospermia remains an open question. Here we report compromised spermatogenesis, with significantly reduced testicular weight and sperm count, and decreased cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) expression in the testes of CFTR knockout mice. The involvement of CFTR in HCO<inf>3</inf> <sup>-</sup>transport and the expression of the HCO<inf>3</inf> <sup>-</sup>sensor, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), are demonstrated for the first time in the primary culture of rat Sertoli cells. Inhibition of CFTR or depletion of HCO<inf>3</inf> <sup>-</sup>could reduce FSH-stimulated, sAC-dependent cAMP production and phosphorylation of CREB, the key transcription factor in spermatogenesis. Decreased CFTR and CREB expression are also observed in human testes with azoospermia. The present study reveals a previously undefined role of CFTR and sAC in regulating the cAMP-CREB signaling pathway in Sertoli cells, defect of which may result in impaired spermatogenesis and azoospermia. Altered CFTR-sAC-cAMP-CREB functional loop may also underline the pathogenesis of various CF-related diseases. © 2011 Xu et al.

0035992521	Identification of testic development and spermatogenesis-related genes in human and mouse testes using cDNA arrays	We have constructed cDNA microarrays from the human testis large insert cDNA library, containing 9216 genes, together with several housekeeping genes. The cDNA microarrays were used to identify gene expression differences between human fetal and adult testes. Of >8700 hybridized clones, 731 exhibited significant differential expression characteristics. About 7500 genes were identified when the same cDNA microarrays were used for hybridization with cDNA probes from mouse testis, with 256 genes having significant differential expression between the age of 1-4 weeks. Among these genes, 101 were identified as critically related to testis development and possibly to spermatogenesis since they were found in both human and mouse testes, and expressed differentially at different stages of testis development. Of the 101 development-related genes, 59 full-length cDNAs have been sequenced previously, while the full-length cDNAs of the other 42 genes have not been published. We have obtained 11 full-length sequences of the 42 genes and deposited them in the GenBank. The conserved testis development-related genes found in both human and mouse testes may include genes that are likely to be involved in testicular functions, especially spermatogenesis, thus providing a basis for further functional characterization of the genes in mouse models.

0036562354	New insights into the mechanisms underlying hydrosalpinx fluid formation and its adverse effect on IVF outcome	The adverse effects of hydrosalpinx on the outcome of IVF have been well documented; however, the causes for impaired implantation in patients with hydrosalpinx are poorly understood. Hydrosalpinx fluid has been shown to be toxic to mouse embryos but not human embryos, and this has become a topic of intense debate. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying hydrosalpinx formation following pelvic inflammatory disease appears to be essential in elucidating the causes for reduced implantation in hydrosalpinx patients and providing more rational treatments. This review discusses the mechanisms underlying hydrosalpinx formation and its adverse effect on IVF outcome, with new insights into possible involvement of Fallopian tube epithelial transporters and ion channels, particularly the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Possible links between Chlamydia trachomatis in pelvic inflammatory disease and the subsequent CFTR-mediated events in hydrosalpinx formation leading to infertility in hydrosalpinx are proposed. The causes of reduced implantation, particularly in patients with visible hydrosalpinges shown on ultrasound scanning, are re-examined in light of these possible mechanisms.

79959466824	CD147 is required for matrix metalloproteinases-2 production and germ cell migration during spermatogenesis	Spermatogenesis is a highly programmed process that requires the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the remodeling of tight junctions (TJ) to facilitate differentiating germ cell migration. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are essential in regulating Sertoli cell TJ in the testis. CD147 is known to stimulate the production of MMPs in tumor metastasis and its knockout mice are infertile. However, the functional relationship between CD147 and MMPs in spermatogenesis has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined the expression profile of CD147 and MMPs during mouse testicular development by RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. We also examined CD147 involvement in the production of MMP-2 and the migration of germ cells (GC-1 and GC-2 cells) using CD147 antibody or synthetic microRNA mimics-mediated knockdown. The results showed that CD147 was present at all stages of testicular development from 7 to 56 days post-partum (dpp). CD147 expression was found to increase after 21 days from moderate levels in 7 and 14 days. Of the eight MMPs studied, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9 and MMP-23 were detected to have changes in expression during testicular development, with MMP-2 showing the largest change. CD147 and MMP-2 were co-localized in spermatogonia, spermatocytes and round spermatids in mouse testis, while in human testis, they were co-localized in spermatocytes and round spermatids. MMP-2 expression and migration of GC-1 and GC-2 cells were reduced by interfering with CD147 expression and function in vitro. These data suggest that CD147 regulates migration of spermatogonia and spermatocytes via induction of MMP-2 production during spermatogenesis. © The Author 2011.

80051693767	The adaptor function of TRAPPC2 in mammalian trapps explains TRAPPC2-associated sedt and TRAPPC9-associated congenital intellectual disability	Background: The TRAPP (Transport protein particle) complex is a conserved protein complex functioning at various steps in vesicle transport. Although yeast has three functionally and structurally distinct forms, TRAPPI, II and III, emerging evidence suggests that mammalian TRAPP complex may be different. Mutations in the TRAPP complex subunit 2 (TRAPPC2) cause X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda, while mutations in the TRAPP complex subunit 9 (TRAPPC9) cause postnatal mental retardation with microcephaly. The structural interplay between these subunits found in mammalian equivalent of TRAPPI and those specific to TRAPPII and TRAPPIII remains largely unknown and we undertook the present study to examine the interaction between these subunits. Here, we reveal that the mammalian equivalent of the TRAPPII complex is structurally distinct from the yeast counterpart thus leading to insight into mechanism of disease. Principal Findings: We analyzed how TRAPPII- or TRAPPIII- specific subunits interact with the six-subunit core complex of TRAPP by co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. TRAPPC2 binds to TRAPPII-specific subunit TRAPPC9, which in turn binds to TRAPPC10. Unexpectedly, TRAPPC2 can also bind to the putative TRAPPIII-specific subunit, TRAPPC8. Endogenous TRAPPC9-positive TRAPPII complex does not contain TRAPPC8, suggesting that TRAPPC2 binds to either TRAPPC9 or TRAPPC8 during the formation of the mammalian equivalents of TRAPPII or TRAPPIII, respectively. Therefore, TRAPPC2 serves as an adaptor for the formation of these complexes. A disease-causing mutation of TRAPPC2, D47Y, failed to interact with either TRAPPC9 or TRAPPC8, suggesting that aspartate 47 in TRAPPC2 is at or near the site of interaction with TRAPPC9 or TRAPPC8, mediating the formation of TRAPPII and/or TRAPPIII. Furthermore, disease-causing deletional mutants of TRAPPC9 all failed to interact with TRAPPC2 and TRAPPC10. Conclusions: TRAPPC2 serves as an adaptor for the formation of TRAPPII or TRAPPIII in mammalian cells. The mammalian equivalent of TRAPPII is likely different from the yeast TRAPPII structurally. © 2011 Zong et al.

83055193665	Preparation of anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody and its application in the analysis of NYD-SP8 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and clinical tissues	Aims and background. NYD-SP8 is a recently identified protein, the biological characteristics of which are still unclear. The aimof this study was to prepare an anti- NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody and investigate the expression of NYD-SP8 in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. Methods. The anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody was prepared and ELISA was performed to assess the antibody titer. With this antibody, the NYD-SP8 expression in four nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, CNE1, CNE2, 5-8F and 6-10B, was examined by Western blot and its expression in clinical tissues was also assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results. The anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody with a high titer was successfully prepared. Western blot showed higher NYD-SP8 expression in CNE2 and 6-10B cells and lower expression in CNE1 and 5-8F cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated overexpression of NYD-SP8 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue while the expression in normal nasopharyngeal tissue was negligible. Conclusions. Our anti-NYD-SP8 rabbit polyclonal antibody can be used both for Western blot and immunohistochemistry, and can be a valuable tool to investigate the function and distribution of NYD-SP8. The different NYD-SP8 expression in various nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines indicated its complicated functions at different biological stages. The overexpression of NYD-SP8 in clinical nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue indicated that it could play an important role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma carcinogenesis.

81855194776	Dedifferentiation-reprogrammed mesenchymal stem cells with improved therapeutic potential	Stem cell transplantation has been shown to improve functional outcome in degenerative and ischemic disorders. However, low in vivo survival and differentiation potential of the transplanted cells limits their overall effectiveness and thus clinical usage. Here we show that, after in vitro induction of neuronal differentiation and dedifferentiation, on withdrawal of extrinsic factors, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow, which have already committed to neuronal lineage, revert to a primitive cell population (dedifferentiated MSCs) retaining stem cell characteristics but exhibiting a reprogrammed phenotype distinct from their original counterparts. Of therapeutic interest, the dedifferentiated MSCs exhibited enhanced cell survival and higher efficacy in neuronal differentiation compared to unmanipulated MSCs both in vitro and in vivo, with significantly improved cognition function in a neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage rat model. Increased expression of bcl-2 family proteins and micro-RNA-34a appears to be the important mechanism giving rise to this previously undefined stem cell population that may provide a novel treatment strategy with improved therapeutic efficacy. © AlphaMed Press.

We investigated whether BFP (Bak Foong Pills), a traditional Chinese medicine treatment for dysmenorrhoea, possesses analgesic properties. Results showed that BFP was able to significantly reduce pain responses following subchronic treatment for 3 days, but not following acute (1 h) treatment in response to acetic acid-induced writhing in C57/B6 mice. The analgesic effect was not due to inhibition of COX (cyclo-oxygenase) activity, evidenced by the lack of inhibition of prostacyclin and PGE

84856116959	CD9 is critical for cutaneous wound healing through JNK signaling	Cutaneous injury triggers a cascade of signaling events essential for wound re-epithelialization. CD9, a cell-surface protein, has been implicated in a number of cellular processes by coupling to intracellular signaling; however, its exact role in wound healing remains unidentified. We reported that CD9 was downregulated in migrating epidermis, and reelevated to basal level when re-epithelialization was completed. Although low level of CD9 appears to be required for normal wound healing, a significant healing delay was found in CD9-null mice, with wounds gaping wider on day 5 and day 7 post wounding. Further analysis showed that re-epithelialization was adversely affected in CD9-null mice, due to impaired migration of epidermis. Notably, CD9 deficiency caused a persistent enhancement of C-JUN NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) signaling primarily in migrating epidermis with abnormal elevation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 detected in CD9-null wounds, leading to excessive degradation of type IV collagen, and thus a defective basement membrane at the wound site. JNK suppression reduced MMP-9 production and therefore ameliorated the healing delay with the appearance of significantly elongated migrating epidermis in CD9-null mice. Our study demonstrated the importance of CD9 in wound re-epithelialization, linking this molecule directly to basement membrane formation and epidermal migration through participating in the regulation of the JNK/MMP-9 pathway. © 2012 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.

84859476273	Aurora-A is an efficient marker for predicting poor prognosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma with aggressive local invasion: 208 cases with a 10-year follow-up from a single institution	Aurora-A kinase (Aur-A), a member of a family of mitotic serine/threonine kinases, is known to be amplified in epithelial malignancies. In this study, we focused our investigation on Aur-A expression and its prognostic significance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Immunohistochemical staining for Aur-A was performed on the paraffin sections of 208 patients with NPC. Data were subjected to statistical analysis with respect to clinicopathological variables, overall survival and disease-free survival. An immunohistochemical analysis showed that Aur-A was highly expressed in 132 (63.5%) of the 208 NPC tissues examined. Aur-A expression was significantly correlated with T classification (P=0.012), clinical stage (P=0.003) and skull base invasion (P=0.003). Statistical analysis showed that Aur-A expression was inversely correlated with the 10-year overall and disease-free survival rates of NPC patients. Results of the multivariate analysis revealed that Aur-A expression was an independent prognostic indicator for patient survival. More significantly, Aur-A was found to be a marker for poor survival, which was mainly attributed to its high expression in the subgroup of T

84862807635	Overexpression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is associated with human cervical cancer malignancy, progression and prognosis	Objective: To investigate the correlation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to cervical cancer progression and prognosis by examining CFTR expression levels in different cervical tissues and cell lines. Methods: Paraffin-embedded cervical tissue samples (n = 192) were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC), while fresh cervical tissue samples (n = 165) and human cervical cell lines were collected for protein and mRNA detection by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Correlations between CFTR expression levels to cancer clinicopathologic features and prognosis were statistically analyzed. Results: Both CFTR mRNA and protein expression gradually increased from normal to precancerous (LSIL, HSIL) and cervical cancer tissues (p < 0.05). Furthermore, CFTR expression level was well-correlated to tumor stage (p < 0.001), histological grades (p < 0.001), lymphatic metastasis (p < 0.001), vascular invasion (p < 0.05), interstitial invasive depth (p < 0.05), tumor size (p < 0.05) and HPV infection (p < 0.05). In vitro, CFTR mRNA and protein were expressed strongly both in SiHa and HeLa, but little was seen in Caski and H8 (p < 0.05). More importantly, overexpression of CFTR conferred significantly poorer survival in cervical carcinoma (Log rank p = 0.028), although it was not an independent predictor for prognosis according to multivariate analysis (p > 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that higher CFTR expression is closely associated with cervical cancer progression, aggressive behaviors and poorer prognosis, indicating that CFTR may function as a novel tumor marker, a prospective prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862776573	Anti-ACTL7a antibodies: A cause of infertility	Objective: To show that antibodies against ACTL7a, a spermatozoon-specific protein, may be a cause of immunologic infertility. Design: Determine the presence of anti-ACTL7a antibodies in infertile blood, raise antibodies against ACTL7a in rabbits, and demonstrate that the in vitro treatment of mouse spermatozoa with infertile sera markedly reduces their fertilizing capacity. Demonstrate that the active immunization of mice with ACTL7a protein reduces fertility. Setting: National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, World Health Organization Collaboration Center of Human Reproduction, China. Animal(s): Rabbits, ICR mice. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Mass spectrometry, indirect immunostaining, spermatozoa agglutination test, and standard fertility assay. Result(s): The fertilizing potential of mouse spermatozoa was markedly reduced after in vitro treatment with ACTL7a antibody-containing serum from a vasectomized man. Active immunization with ACTL7a significantly reduced the fertility of mice. Anti-ACTL7a antibodies caused the agglutination of mouse and human spermatozoa in vitro. Furthermore, the antibodies were detected in the sera of additional vasectomized men. Conclusion(s): Anti-ACTL7a antibodies may cause infertility in mice because the in vitro treatment of mouse spermatozoa with ACTL7a antibody-containing serum markedly reduced the fertilizing potential of the spermatozoa. In addition, the active immunization of mice with ACTL7a resulted in significant reductions in fertility. © 2012 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Published by Elsevier Inc.

84864958449	Cryptorchidism-induced CFTR down-regulation results in disruption of testicular tight junctions through up-regulation of NF-κB/COX-2/PGE 2	STUDY QUESTION Does elevated temperature-induced cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) down-regulation in Sertoli cells in cryptorchid testis disrupt testicular tight junctions (TJs) through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway? SUMMARY ANSWER Our results suggest that CFTR may be involved in regulating testicular TJs and the blood-testis barrier (BTB) through its negative regulation of the NF-κB/COX-2/PGE2 pathway in Sertoli cells, a defect of which may result in the spermatogenesis defect in cryptorchidism. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Cryptorchidism, or undescended testes, is known to result in defective spermatogenesis. Although an elevated testicular temperature is regarded as an important factor affecting spermatogenesis in cryptorchidism, the exact mechanism remains elusive. It is known that the expression of functional CFTR is temperature sensitive. Our previous study has demonstrated that CFTR negatively regulates NF-κB/COX-2/PGE2 in bronchial epithelial cells. Disruption of TJs by COX-2/PGE2 has been found in tumour cells. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Expression of CFTR, NF-κB, COX-2 and TJ proteins was examined in the testes of a surgical-induced cryptorchidism mouse model and a testicular hyperthermia mouse model, as well as in control or CFTR-inhibited/knocked down primary rat Sertoli cells. PGE2 production was measured by ELISA. Sertoli cell barrier function was determined by transepethelial resistance (TER) measurements in rat Sertoli cell primary cultures. BTB integrity in the cryptorchidism model was monitored by examining tracker dye injected into seminiferous tubules. MAIN RESULTS Down-regulation of CFTR accompanied by activation of NF-κB, up-regulation of COX-2 and down-regulation of TJ proteins, including ZO-1 and occludin, was observed in a cryptorchidism mouse model. BTB leakage revealed impaired BTB integrity in cryptorchid testes, confirming the destruction of TJs. The inverse correlation of CFTR and COX-2 was further confirmed in a mouse testis hyperthermia model and CFTR knockout mouse model. Culturing primary Sertoli cells at 37°C, which mimics the pathological condition of cryptorchidism, led to a significant decrease in CFTR and increase in COX-2 expression and PGE2 production compared with the culture at the physiological 32°C. Inhibition or knockdown of CFTR led to increased COX-2 but decreased ZO-1 and occludin expression in Sertoli cells, which could be mimicked by PGE2, but reversed by NF-κB or COX-2 inhibitor, suggesting that the regulation of TJs by CFTR is mediated by a NF-κB/COX-2/PGE2 pathway. Inhibition of CFTR or administration of PGE2 significantly decreased Sertoli cell TER. LIMITATIONSThis study has tested only the CFTR/NF-κB/COX-2/PGE2 pathway in mouse testes in vivo and in rat Sertoli cells in vitro, and thus, it has some limitations. Further investigations in other species, especially humans, are needed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our study may shed more light on one of the aspects of the complicated underlying mechanisms of defective spermatogenesis induced by cryptorchidism. © The Author 2012.

84865413040	Lymphocyte CFTR promotes epithelial bicarbonate secretion for bacterial killing	The expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in lymphocytes has been reported for nearly two decades; however, its physiological role remains elusive. Here, we report that co-culture of lymphocytes with lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3, promotes epithelial HCO3- production/secretion with up-regulated expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 and 4 (CA-2, CA-4) and enhanced bacterial killing capability. The lymphocyte-enhanced epithelial HCO3- secretion and bacterial killing activity was abolished when Calu3 cells were co-cultured with lymphocytes from CFTR knockout mice, or significantly reduced by interfering with E-cadherin, a putative binding partner of CFTR. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced E-cadherin and CA-4 expression in the challenged lung was also found to be impaired in CFTR knockout mice compared to that of the wild-type. These results suggest that the interaction between lymphocytes and epithelial cells may induce a previously unsuspected innate host defense mechanism against bacterial infection by stimulating epithelial HCO3- production/secretion, which requires CFTR expression in lymphocytes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0037329374	Characterization of epithelial cell culture from human hydrosalpinges and effects of its conditioned medium on embryo development and sperm motility	Background: Recent studies have reported the negative impact of hydrosalpinx on IVF outcome. Toxic effects of hydrosalpinx fluid (HF) have been the main reason for the recommendation of functional surgery, salpingectomy, prior to IVF. The present study characterized hydrosalpinx epithelial cell culture and examined the effects of its conditioned medium (CM) on sperm motility, acrosome reaction and embryo development. Methods: Normal Fallopian tubes (n = 6) and hydrosalpinges (n = 9) were used to prepare epithelial cell culture and CM. Epithelial cell characterization was confirmed using electron microscopy. Sperm motility and acrosome reaction were determined using computer-aided sperm analysis and acrobead assay respectively and embryo development by mouse embryo development assay. Results: The percentage of human motile sperm incubated in hydrosalpinx CM was significantly different from those in normal Fallopian tube (NFT) CM and modified human tubal fluid medium (hTF) (control) (P < 0.05 at 3 h and P < 0.001 at 5 and 24 h), with alteration in movement characteristic, linearity, 24 h after incubation in hydrosalpinx CM (P < 0.05). However, other sperm movement characteristics remained unchanged. Reduced acrosome reaction and poor mouse embryo development were also observed in hydrosalpinx CM but not in NFT CM and hTF. Conclusions: The results suggest that hydrosalpinx epithelial cells may be producing a fluid milieu hostile to sperm and early embryo development. The established epithelial cell culture system may provide a model to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of HF on embryo development and the adverse effects on IVF outcomes.

84872173196	Regulation of apoptosis by Bat3-enhanced YWK-II/APLP2 protein stability	YWK-II protein/APLP2 is a member of an evolutionarily conserved protein family that includes amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid precursor-like protein-1 (APLP1). We have previously demonstrated that YWK-II/APLP2 functions as a novel G0-proteincoupled receptor for Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) in cell survival. However, factors regulating the stability and turnover of YWK-II/APLP2 have not been identified. Here we present evidence that human leukocyte antigen-B-associated transcript 3 (Bat3), an important regulator involved in apoptosis, can interact with YWK-II/APLP2 and enhance its stability by reducing its ubiquitylation and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Coexpression of different Bat3 domain deletion constructs with YWK-II/APLP2 reveals that the proline-rich domain of Bat3 is required for its binding to YWK-II/APLP2. In addition, we find that the protein levels of YWK-II/APLP2 could be enhanced by nuclear export of Bat3 under apoptotic stimulation. We also find elevated levels of Bat3 and YWK-II/APLP2 in human colorectal cancer with a positive correlation between the two. Taken together, these results have revealed a previously undefined mechanism regulating cell apoptosis and suggest that aberrant enhancement of YWK-II/APLP2 by nuclear export of Bat3 may play a role in cancer development by inhibiting cell apoptosis.

84877577459	CFTR suppresses tumor progression through miR-193b targeting urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in prostate cancer	Cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in the epithelial cells of a wide range of organs/tissues from which most cancers are derived. Although accumulating reports have indicated the association of cancer incidence with genetic variations in CFTR gene, the exact role of CFTR in cancer development and the possible underlying mechanism have not been elucidated. Here, we report that CFTR expression is significantly decreased in both prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate cancer tissue samples. Overexpression of CFTR in prostate cancer cell lines suppresses tumor progression (cell growth, adhesion and migration), whereas knockdown of CFTR leads to enhanced malignancies both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we demonstrate that CFTR knockdown-enhanced cell proliferation, cell invasion and migration are significantly reversed by antibodies against either urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) or uPA receptor (uPAR), which are known to be involved in various malignant traits of cancer development. More interestingly, overexpression of CFTR suppresses uPA by upregulating the recently described tumor suppressor microRNA-193b (miR-193b), and overexpression of pre-miR-193b significantly reverses CFTR knockdown-enhanced malignant phenotype and abrogates elevated uPA activity in prostate cancer cell line. Finally, we show that CFTR gene transfer results in significant tumor repression in prostate cancer xenografts in vivo. Taken together, the present study has demonstrated a previously undefined tumor-suppressing role of CFTR and its involvement in regulation of miR-193b in prostate cancer development. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84886776849	Decreased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator impairs sperm quality in aged men	Sperm quality declines with aging; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been shown to play an essential role in fertilizing capacity of sperm and male fertility. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of age-dependent CFTR downregulation in lowering sperm quality in old age. Two hundred and one healthy fertile men of three age groups (20-40 years, n=64> 40-60 years, n=61; and O60 years, n=76) were recruited. Expression of CFTR was determined by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence staining. Collected sperm were treated with CFTR inhibitor or potentiator. Sperm quality was assessed by motility and bicarbonate-induced capacitation. The results showed that the expression of CFTR on the equatorial segment and neck region of sperm was significantly decreased in an age-dependent manner. Reduction of CFTR expression in sperm from old men was correlated with lowered forward motility and decreased HCO

0141839875	Involvement of CFTR in uterine bicarbonate secretion and the fertilizing capacity of sperm	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated chloride channel expressed in a wide variety of epithelial cells, mutations of which are responsible for the hallmark defective chloride secretion observed in cystic fibrosis (CF). Although CFTR has been implicated in bicarbonate secretion, its ability to directly mediate bicarbonate secretion of any physiological significance has not been shown. We demonstrate here that endometrial epithelial cells possess a CFTR-mediated bicarbonate transport mechanism. Co-culture of sperm with endometrial cells treated with antisense oligonucleotide against CFTR, or with bicarbonate secretion-defective CF epithelial cells, resulted in lower sperm capacitation and egg-fertilizing ability. These results are consistent with a critical role of CFTR in controlling uterine bicarbonate secretion and the fertilizing capacity of sperm, providing a link between defective CFTR and lower female fertility in CF.

0041766288	Effects of Bak Foong Pill on blood coagulation and platelet aggregation	The effects of Bak Foong Pill (BFP, also known as Bai Feng Wan), a preparation of crude drugs in wide clinical use for treatment of gynecological disorders, on blood coagulation and platelet aggregation were investigated. The anticoagulant effect of BFP was evaluated by using thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assays. Results showed that BFP 70% ethanol extract (BFP-E-ext) significantly prolonged the TT in a dose-dependent manner with values of 17.6, 38.3, and 50.4 s at concentrations of 4.0, 6.0, and 12.0 mg/ml, respectively. Whereas, the BFP-E-ext did not show significant prolonging effect in PT and APTT assays. The results suggest that the anticoagulant effect of BFP is mediated by directly blocking thrombin, the key enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade. BFP-E-ext significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with inhibition percentages of 74 and 52% at a concentration of 6.0 mg/ml, respectively, whereas, it exhibited a weak inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation induced by archidonic acid (AA). Comparing to BFP-E-ext, the effects of BFP aqueous extract (BFP-W-ext) on both anticoagulant and antiplatelet activities were significantly less potent. Moreover, the effects of the 26 ingredients of BFP on blood coagulation and platelet aggregation were separately evaluated with 19 ingredient herbs exhibiting anticoagulant effect and 10 exhibiting antiplatelet effect. The anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects of BFP were collectively demonstrated by in vivo assays showing prolonged bleeding times after BFP treatment for two weeks. The results of the present studies may provide explanations for beneficial effects of BFP on the circulation and indicate its potential use for cardiovascular diseases. © 2003 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

84888380730	Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of bladder cancer identifies frequent alterations in genes involved in sister chromatid cohesion and segregation	Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) being the predominant form. Here we report a genomic analysis of TCC by both whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 99 individuals with TCC. Beyond confirming recurrent mutations in genes previously identified as being mutated in TCC, we identified additional altered genes and pathways that were implicated in TCC. Notably, we discovered frequent alterations in STAG2 and ESPL1, two genes involved in the sister chromatid cohesion and segregation (SCCS) process. Furthermore, we also detected a recurrent fusion involving FGFR3 and TACC3, another component of SCCS, by transcriptome sequencing of 42 DNA-sequenced tumors. Overall, 32 of the 99 tumors (32%) harbored genetic alterations in the SCCS process. Our analysis provides evidence that genetic alterations affecting the SCCS process may be involved in bladder tumorigenesis and identifies a new therapeutic possibility for bladder cancer.

84891911619	Disrupted interaction between CFTR and AF-6/afadin aggravates malignant phenotypes of colon cancer	How mutations or dysfunction of CFTR may increase the risk of malignancies in various tissues remains an open question. Here we report the interaction between CFTR and an adherens junction molecule, AF-6/afadin, and its involvement in the development of colon cancer. We have found that CFTR and AF-6/afadin are co-localized at the cell-cell contacts and physically interact with each other in colon cancer cell lines. Knockdown of CFTR results in reduced epithelial tightness and enhanced malignancies, with increased degradation and reduced stability of AF-6/afadin protein. The enhanced invasive phenotype of CFTR-knockdown cells can be completely reversed by either AF-6/afadin over-expression or ERK inhibitor, indicating the involvement of AF-6/MAPK pathway. More interestingly, the expression levels of CFTR and AF-6/afadin are significantly downregulated in human colon cancer tissues and lower expression of CFTR and/or AF-6/afadin is correlated with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients. The present study has revealed a previously unrecognized interaction between CFTR and AF-6/afadin that is involved in the pathogenesis of colon cancer and indicated the potential of the two as novel markers of metastasis and prognostic predictors for human colon cancer. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84901606226	Novel regulators of spermatogenesis	Spermatogenesis is a multistep process that supports the production of millions of sperm daily. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate spermatogenesis has been a major focus for decades. Yet, the regulators involved in different cellular processes of spermatogenesis remain largely unknown. Human diseases that result in defective spermatogenesis have provided hints on the molecular mechanisms regulating this process. In this review, we have summarized recent findings on the function and signaling mechanisms of several genes that are known to be associated with disease or pathological processes, including CFTR, CD147, YWK-II and CT genes, and discuss their potential roles in regulating different processes of spermatogenesis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84901770556	Elevated expression of CD147 in patients with endometriosis and its role in regulating apoptosis and migration of human endometrial cells	Objective To examine the expression of CD147 in 60 human endometriosis lesions and how CD147 regulates migration and apoptosis in human uterine epithelial (HESs) cells. Design Experimental clinical study and laboratory-based investigation. Setting Hospital and academic research center. Patient(s) Sixty women with chocolate cysts and 16 control women without endometriosis. Intervention(s) Human uterine epithelial cells were treated with anti-CD147 antibody. Main Outcome Measure(s) Real-time polymerase chain reaction for detecting CD147 expression in 60 human endometriosis lesions; migration assay and CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) assay for cell functional investigation; Western blot for detecting protein levels; gelatin zymography for evaluating the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in cultured cells. Result(s) Expression of CD147 was significantly higher in ectopic endometrial tissues from patients with endometriosis than in normal endometrial tissues. Interference with CD147 function led to decreased migration and cell viability in HESs cells. Surprisingly, MMP-2 expression and activity were not changed after treating HESs cells with anti-CD147 antibody. Further examination revealed that immunodepletion of CD147 induced apoptosis in HESs cells, leading to the activation of caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Conclusion(s) The results of the present study suggest that abnormally high expression of CD147 in ovarian endometriosis lesions with enhanced cell survival (reduced apoptosis) and migration, in an MMP-2-independent manner, may underlie the progression of endometriosis in humans.

84904490730	Glucose-induced electrical activities and insulin secretion in pancreatic islet 2-cells are modulated by CFTR	The cause of insulin insufficiency remains unknown in many diabetic cases. Up to 50% adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), develop CF-related diabetes (CFRD) with most patients exhibiting insulin insufficiency. Here we show that CFTR is a regulator of glucose-dependent electrical acitivities and insulin secretion in 2-cells. We demonstrate that glucose elicited whole-cell currents, membrane depolarization, electrical bursts or action potentials, Ca 2+ oscillations and insulin secretion are abolished or reduced by inhibitors or knockdown of CFTR in primary mouse 2-cells or RINm5F 2-cell line, or significantly attenuated in CFTR mutant (DF508) mice compared with wild-type mice. VX-809, a newly discovered corrector of DF508 mutation, successfully rescues the defects in DF508 2-cells. Our results reveal a role of CFTR in glucose-induced electrical activities and insulin secretion in 2-cells, shed light on the pathogenesis of CFRD and possibly other idiopathic diabetes, and present a potential treatment strategy. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84907416250	Deficient human β-defensin 1 underlies male infertility associated with poor sperm motility and genital tract infection	Genital tract infection and reduced sperm motility are considered two pivotal etiological factors for male infertility associated with leukocytospermia and asthenozoospermia, respectively. We demonstrate that the amount of human β-defensin 1 (DEFB1) in sperm from infertile men exhibiting either leukocytospermia or asthenozoospermia, both of which are associated with reduced motility and reduced bactericidal activity in sperm, is much lower compared to that in normal fertile sperm. Interference with DEFB1 function also decreases both motility and bactericidal activity in normal sperm, whereas treatment with recombinant DEFB1 markedly restores DEFB1 expression, bactericidal activity, sperm quality, and egg-penetrating ability in sperm from both asthenozoospermia and leukocytospermia patients.

84907864962	Maternal caffeine exposure impairs insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells and increases the risk of type II diabetes mellitus in offspring	Maternal caffeine exposure may be one of the causes for intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight (LBW), and increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the adulthood has been associated with LBW. However, whether maternal caffeine exposure contributes to T2DM development of her offspring has not been fully investigated. We have investigated the influence of maternal caffeine exposure on glucose homeostasis in vivo and effects of long-term caffeine load on insulin secretion of β-cells. The intake of caffeine during gestation markedly decreases birth weight and postnatal body weight of the offspring. Serum insulin levels of adult offspring after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were significantly lower in the caffeine group compared to the control, although plasma glucose levels were not significantly altered. Proteome analysis of pancreas of adult offspring identified 24 proteins that were differentially expressed between the caffeine and control groups, including proteins involved in energy metabolism. In a rat pancreatic β-cell line Rin-5f cells, caffeine downregulated expression of one of the proteins involved in insulin synthesis, P4hb, and there was reduced transcriptional expression of insulin. While basal insulin secretion of caffeine-treated cells was elevated, insulin secretion after glucose challenge in long-term caffeine-treated cells was significantly reduced, with increased apoptosis of β-cells. These results indicate that maternal caffeine exposure may result in potentially abnormal glucose homeostasis and increase the risk of T2DM in the offspring adulthood.

84911133920	Emerging role of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator as an epigenetic regulator: Linking environmental cues to microRNAs	Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as one of the important epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression in response to changes in the environment, the links between environmental cues and changes in miRNAs remain largely unknown. Localized to the cell membrane and recognized as an anion channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has recently been shown to mediate important signalling pathways leading to activation of miRNAs. This brief review summarizes the related findings and discusses the emerging role of CFTR as an epigenetic regulator, possibly involved in a wide spectrum of physiological and pathological processes.

84913548658	Regulation of miR-101/miR-199a-3p by the epithelial sodium channel during embryo implantation: Involvement of CREB phosphorylation	In our previous study, we have demonstrated that the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) mediates the embryo-derived signals leading to the activation of CREB and upregulation of cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX2) required for embryo implantation. This study aims to investigate whether microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the ENaC-induced upregulation of COX2 during embryo implantation. The results show that the levels of miR-101 and miR-199a-3p, two COX2 targeting miRNAs, are reduced by ENaC activation, and increased by ENaC inhibition or knock-down of ENaC subunit (ENaCα ) in human endometrial surface epithelial (HES) cells or in mouse uteri during implantation. Phosphorylation of CREB is induced by the activation of ENaC, and blocked by ENaC inhibition or knockdown in HES cells. Knockdown of ENaCα or CREB in HES cells or in mouse uterus in vivo results in increases in miR-101 and miR-199a-3p, accompanied with decreases in COX2 protein levels and reduction in implantation rate. The downregulation of COX2 caused by knockdown of ENaC or CREB can be recovered by the inhibitors of miR-101 or miR-199a-3p in HES cells. These results reveal a novel molecular mechanism modulating COX2 expression during embryo implantation via ENaC-dependent CREB activation and COX2-targeting miRNAs.

84918582197	CFTR interacts with ZO-1 to regulate tight junction assembly and epithelial differentiation through the ZONAB pathway	Mutations in CFTR lead to dysfunction of tubular organs, which is currently attributed to impairment of its conductive properties. We now show that CFTR regulates tight junction assembly and epithelial cell differentiation through modulation of the ZO-1- ZONAB pathway. CFTR colocalizes with ZO-1 at the tight junctions of trachea and epididymis, and is expressed before ZO- 1 in Wolffian ducts. CFTR interacts with ZO-1 through the CTFR PDZ-binding domain. In a three-dimensional (3D) epithelial cell culture model, CFTR regulates tight junction assembly and is required for tubulogenesis. CFTR inhibition or knockdown reduces ZO-1 expression and induces the translocation of the transcription factor ZONAB (also known as YBX3) from tight junctions to the nucleus, followed by upregulation of the transcription of CCND1 and downregulation of ErbB2 transcription.
