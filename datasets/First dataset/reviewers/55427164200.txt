84867034476	Regulation of free carboxylate groups of alginate microspheres with naci solution and its effect in doxorubicin loading and release	Narrow-dispersed calcium alginate microspheres were prepared by a membrane emulsificationgelation method. The microspheres were treated with NaCl solutions of different concentrations to control the amount of free carboxylate groups. The size of the microspheres increased simultaneously after salt treatment. The quantity of calcium and sodium ions in the microspheres was measured by atomic absorption spectrometer, and the change of functional groups was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. During the treatment process calcium ions in the microspheres were replaced by sodium ions, and the carboxylate groups were converted from a chelate to a free state. As doxorubicin hydrochloride was positive in water while alginate was negative, doxorubicin was loaded into the alginate microspheres via electrostatic interaction. The loading capacity of microspheres was enhanced greatly after treatment with NaCl solution. When the microspheres were treated with 1.8% NaCl solution,the drug content increased remarkably to 1310 μ/mg,which was nearly 10 times the amount of the untreated ones. In vitro release tests confirmed that relative smaller percentage of drug was released from the microspheres containing more drug. The release behavior of the drug-loaded microspheres was pH-sensitive,i. e. slower at pH 7.4 but faster at pH 5.5. After salt treatment,the drug release mechanism was transformed from diffusion alone to the combination of diffusion and matrix erosion.

84867454502	Influence of surface coating of PLGA particles on the internalization and functions of human endothelial cells	This study is focused on the uptake of PLGA particles with different coatings and its influences on the functions and toxicity of human endothelial cells. The PLGA particles coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) were prepared via a one-step emulsion method, which had a similar diameter of ∼420 nm in water and ∼170 nm in a dry state but oppositely charged surfaces. Both types of the particles were readily internalized into cells within a short time regardless of their surface chemistry. Uptake of the positively charged particles caused apparently a decrease in cell viability, but did not significantly influence mitochondrial membrane potential and activity of caspase-3. The cell adhesion and migration were significantly affected, especially after uptake of the PLGA-PEI particles. The secretion levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and 6-k-PGF

84887648132	Effect of N/P ratios on physicochemical stability, cellular association, and gene silencing efficiency for trimethyl chitosan/small interfering RNA complexes	N,N,N-Trimethyl chitosan (TMC) with 40% quaternization was used as a vector for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery. Nano-sized complexes were formed in water by mixing siRNA with TMC; the smallest particle sizes were obtained at a N/P ratio of 10. The complexes had a positive surface charge that increased with increases in the N/P ratio and leveled off at +20 mV with N/P ratios > 10. The majority of particles had a diameter <100 nm under transmission electron microscope (TEM). When the N/P ratio was >10, the binding efficiency of TMC with siRNA was >90%. In 25% fetal bovine serum, the TMC/siRNA complexes with N/P ratios of 10 and 20 were intact for 12 and 48 h, respectively. TMC/siRNA complexes with an N/P ratio > 5 efficiently entered the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and trapped initially in the lysosomes, which could then relocate in the cytoplasm. Gene silencing, tested by using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), was reduced to ∼60% by the complexes with N/P ratios of 10 and 20. Specific silencing was confirmed by dose dependency and nonsilencing effect of sequence-mismatch siRNA. No significant cytotoxicity was detected for the TMC/siRNA complexes. In this study, the influence of the N/P ratio on TMC/siRNA complexes was systematically investigated and TMC was found to be an effective vector for siRNA delivery using optimized formulations. © 2013 The Author(s).

84908261140	Synthesis of poly(ester-carbonate) with a pendant acetylcholine analog for promoting neurite growth	The modification of biodegradable polyesters with bioactive molecules has become an important strategy for controlling neuron adhesion and neurite outgrowth in nerve regeneration. In this study we report a biodegradable poly(ester-carbonate) with a pendant acetylcholine analog, which a neurotransmitter for the enhancement of neuron adhesion and outgrowth. The acetylcholine-functionalized poly(ester-carbonate) (Ach-P(LA-ClTMC)) was prepared by copolymerizing L-lactide (LA) and 5-methyl-5-chloroethoxycarbonyl trimethylene carbonate (ClTMC), followed by quaternization with trimethylamine. The acetylcholine analog content could be modulated by changing the molar feeding fraction of ClTMC. The incorporation of the acetylcholine analog improved the hydrophilicity of the films, but the acetylcholine analog content did not significantly influence the surface morphology of the acetylcholine-functionalized films. The results of PC12 cell culture showed that the acetylcholine analog promoted cell viability and neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner. The longest length of neurite and the percentage of cells bearing neurites were obtained on the Ach-P(LA-ClTMC)-10 film. All the results indicate that the integration of the acetylcholine analog at an appropriate fraction could be an effective strategy for optimizing the existing biodegradable polyesters for nerve regeneration applications.

77955182491	Application of collagen-chitosan/fibrin glue asymmetric scaffolds in skin tissue engineering	To create a scaffold that is suitable for the construction of tissue-engineered skin, a novel asymmetric porous scaffold with different pore sizes on either side was prepared by combining a collagen-chitosan porous membrane with fibrin glue. Tissue-engineered skin was fabricated using this asymmetric scaffold, fibroblasts, and a human keratinocyte line (HaCaT). Epidermal cells could be seen growing easily and achieved confluence on the fibrin glue on the upper surface of the scaffold. Scanning electron microscopy showed typical shuttle-like fibroblasts adhering to the wall of the scaffold and fluorescence microscopy showed them growing in the dermal layer of the scaffold. The constructed composite skin substitute had a histological structure similar to that of normal skin tissue after three weeks of culture. The results of our study suggest that the asymmetric scaffold is a promising biologically functional material for skin tissue engineering, with prospects for clinical applications. © 2010 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79953701400	Studies of thermoresponsive polymer brushes by atomic force microscopy and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) brushes were prepared on silicon/gold surfaces using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of NIPAAm. AFM studies showed that the chain growth dynamics of PNIPAAm could be well controlled by the polymerization time. At room temperature, a PNIPAAm film with a thickness of 33 nm dried at room temperature increased its thickness to 82.4 nm in water as a result of extension of the PNIPAAm chains. On the contrary, the PNIPAAm chains collapsed in 1:1 (V:V) water/MeOH solution, leading to a film thickness of 45 nm. When the film was dried at 55°C, a more severe chain collapse occurred, resulting in a thin thickness of 22 nm. Moreover, the adhesion force between the PNIPAAm chains and AFM tip in solution was far smaller than that in air, demonstrating that the adhesion force at the collapsed state is larger than that at the extended state. The results of quartz crystal microbalance showed further that the PNIPAM brushes exhibited a continuous collapse over a temperature range of 24~42°C.

The fibrin gel evenly distributed in the hybrid scaffold with visible fibrinogen fibers after drying. In vitro culture it was found that in the hybrid scaffold the chondrocytes distributed more evenly and kept a round morphology as that in the normal cartilage. Although the chondrocytes seeded in the control PLGA sponges showed similar proliferation behavior with that in the hybrid scaffolds, they were remarkably elongated, forming a fibroblast-like morphology. Moreover, a larger amount of glycosaminoglycans was secreted in the hybrid scaffolds than that in the PLGA sponges after in vitro culture of chondrocytes for 4 weeks. The results suggest that the fibrin/PLGA hybrid scaffold may be favorably applied for cartilage tissue engineering. © Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

80053523535	Chitosan-based biomaterials for tissue repair and regeneration	Tissue repair and regeneration is an interdisciplinary field focusing on development of biological and bioactive substitutes. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide exhibiting excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, affinity to biomolecules, and wound-healing activity. It can also be easily modified via chemical and physical reactions to obtain derivatives of various structures, properties, functions, and applications. This paper focuses on chitosan and its derivatives as biomaterials for tissue repair and regeneration. Tuning the structure and properties such as biodegradability, mechanical strength, gelation property, and cell affinity can be achieved through chemical reaction, immobilization of specific ligands such as peptide and sugar molecules, combination with other biomaterials, and chemical or physical crosslinking. To obtain applicable three-dimensional scaffolding materials such as porous sponges, hydrogels, and rods, the formulation and stimuli-responsiveness of this material can also be modified. Moreover, chitosan and its derivatives can function as vectors for delivery of cell growth factors and particularly of functional genes encoding cell growth factors, which are easier to integrate with the formulated materials to obtain scaffolds of higher activity. Recent studies have shown that such scaffolds are of particular importance in mediating the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of stem cells. Finally, integration of chitosan with cell growth factors and associated genes and/or with cells (stem cells) produces chitosan-based biomaterials with applications in repair or regeneration of skin, cartilage, bone, and other tissue. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80855123898	Chemically cross-linked chitosan hydrogel loaded with gelatin for chondrocyte encapsulation	Composite hydrogels can be used as a scaffolding material for chondrogenesis, which requires a biomimetic environment to maintain chondrocyte morphology and phenotype. In this study, gelatin molecules were loaded into a hydrogel polymerized from a chitosan derivative (CML) to form a semi-interpenetrating polymer network. While the porous structure of the hydrogels in the dry state was not dependent on the gelatin content, the collapse extent and pore size decreased as the gelatin content increased. The gelatin loading also reduced the swelling ratio of the CML hydrogel and enhanced the hydrogel strength at 20°C due to gelation of the gelatin. The release behavior of the gelatin from the CML hydrogel could be controlled by many factors, such as the amount of gelatin, temperature, and solution pH. The weight loss of the composite hydrogel was expedited after gelatin loading and showed a positive relationship with the gelatin content. The results of in vitro cell culture in the hydrogels revealed that gelatin loading improved cell viability and promoted proliferation and glycosaminoglycans secretion of chondrocytes. This new scaffold production technology for chondrocyte encapsulation provides a further step towards CML applications in tissue engineering and other biomedical areas. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84855160960	Preparation and applications of ordered and gradient scaffolds in regenerative medicine	The tissue loss or organ failure, resulting from trauma or diseases, is a major concern in human healthcare. The recent development of regenerative medicine by combing the cells and degradable scaffolds offers a unique pathway to recreate tissues and organs with high bioactivity and biomimetic structures. This article reviews the state-of-art of the ordered and gradient scaffolds in terms of their preparation methods and biological performance. In contrast with the homogeneous counterpart, the ordered scaffolds facilitate delivery of nutrients and metabolites, and can guide cell growth, distribution and new tissue formation in vitro, leading to construction of 3D-engineered tissues with ordered cells and extracellular matrix. On the other hand, the gradient cues (e. g. physical, chemical and biological properties) incorporated into the 3D scaffolds can create a microenvironment governing the cell behaviors such as migration rate and direction as well as differentiation, and thereby guiding the tissue regeneration. The methods of phase separation, electrospinning, injection and centrifugation are usually employed to prepare the ordered and gradient 2D substrate and 3D scaffolds. The biological performance of these scaffolds is discussed. Wish such a structure mimicking the native tissue-like environment, the scaffolds are expected to show exceptional advantages in regeneration of tissues and organs of better functions and structures.

However, the disorderly growth and aggregation of CaP nanocrystals limit their practical application. This paper reports a strategy for designing polypeptide/trace elements (TE), dual mediating the self-assembly of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) nanocrystals, with multilayered porous cross section and TE dilute doping. Intriguing advantages such as bead morphology, mesoporous structure, tunable diameter (20-1000 μm) and TE contents, biodegradability and bioactivity are obtained.

The microchannel device with a constriction (5.7 μm in depth) in the middle was designed, and the multilayer microcapsules with different size and layer thickness (and thereby different mechanical strength) were used. Deformation in the microchannel was observed for all the capsules with a size larger than the constriction height, and its extent was mainly governed by the difference between capsule size and constriction height. The squeezed microcapsules could recover their original spherical shape when the deformation extent was smaller than 16%, whereas permanent physical deformation took place when the deformation extent was larger than 34%. The capsules filled with polyelectrolytes could greatly enhance their shape recovery ability due to the higher osmotic pressure in the capsule interior and could well maintain the preloaded low-molecular-weight dyes regardless of the squeezing. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84857356742	Stability of polyelectrolyte multilayer micropatterns in response to post-treatments	Post-treatments of the micro-molded poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid, 1:1 SS:MA) sodium salt (PSSMA)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) multilayers in water or at elevated temperature were conducted to disclose the stability and transformation of patterns prepared at different conditions. The compression induced patterns kept unchanged regardless of the incubation time, while the lateral flow induced patterns disappeared rapidly within 10. min in water. Results showed that the pattern disappearance was not caused by the remodeling or swelling of the multilayers, but caused by mass loss of the uncompressed region. Heat treatment of the high ridge patterns could greatly decrease their height and stabilize the pattern structure. The double strip patterns could be transformed to the high ridge patterns and the linear patterns by annealing at 70 °C for 3 h and 6 h, respectively. Therefore, the pattern features and stability against water etching can be effectively modulated by the post-treatment time at elevated temperature. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84856223826	Restoration of rat calvarial defects by poly(lactide-co-glycolide)/hydroxyapatite scaffolds loaded with bone mesenchymal stem cells and DNA complexes	A composite construct comprising of a bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) sheet, plasmid DNA, encoding human bone morphogenic protein-2 (hBMP-2), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide)/hydroxyapatite (PLGA/HA) sponge was designed and employed in the restoration of rat calvarial defects. To improve gene transfection efficiency, a cationic chitosan derivative, N,N,N,-trimethyl chitosan chloride (TMC), was employed as the vector. The TMC/DNA complexes had a transfection efficiency of 13% in rat BMSCs, resulting in heterogeneous hBMP-2 expression in a 10-d culture period in vitro. In vivo culture of the composite constructs was performed by implantation into rat full-thickness calvarial defects, using constructs lacking pDNA-hBMP-2 or BMSC sheets as controls. Significantly higher heterogeneous expression of hBMP-2 was detected in vivo at 2 weeks for the cell sheet/DNA complex/scaffold constructs, compared with the constructs lacking pDNA-hBMP-2 or BMSC sheets. New bone formation was evident as early as 4 weeks in the experimental constructs. At 8 weeks, partial bridging of calvarial defects was observed in the experimental constructs, which was significantly better than the constructs lacking pDNA-hBMP-2 or BMSC sheets. Therefore, the combination of the PLGA/HA scaffold with BMSC sheets and gene therapy vectors is effective at enhancing bone formation. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84860863407	Gradient biomaterials and their influences on cell migration	Cell migration participates in a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, cancer metastasis, blood vessel formation and remoulding, tissue regeneration, immune surveillance and inflammation. The cells specifically migrate to destiny sites induced by the gradually varying concentration (gradient) of soluble signal factors and the ligands bound with the extracellular matrix in the body during a wound healing process. Therefore, regulation of the cell migration behaviours is of paramount importance in regenerative medicine. One important way is to create a microenvironment that mimics the in vivo cellular and tissue complexity by incorporating physical, chemical and biological signal gradients into engineered biomaterials. In this review, the gradients existing in vivo and their influences on cell migration are briefly described. Recent developments in the fabrication of gradient biomaterials for controlling cellular behaviours, especially the cell migration, are summarized, highlighting the importance of the intrinsic driving mechanism for tissue regeneration and the design principle of complicated and advanced tissue regenerative materials. The potential uses of the gradient biomaterials in regenerative medicine are introduced. The current and future trends in gradient biomaterials and programmed cell migration in terms of the long-term goals of tissue regeneration are prospected. © 2012 The Royal Society.

84861945886	Understanding the influence of alendronate on the morphology and phase transformation of apatitic precursor nanocrystals	Bisphosphonates (BPs) are a class of synthetic pyrophosphate analogs that can prevent the loss of bone mass, given orally to treat postmenopuasal osteoporosis. It is not clear yet if the benefits of BPs include the possibility of affecting bone apatitic precursors transition for bone consolidation except for encouraging osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, the complexity of the in vivo system makes it difficult to isolate and study such extracellular topographical cues that trigger bone turnover response. Herein, we proposed a wet-chemical approach employing alendronate sodium (AS) as a guide of hydroxyapatite (HA) precursor growth and conversion which was initiated from the nucleantion of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) in a cell membrane-mimicking surfactant micelle aqueous system. The nanocrystal clusters of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and OCP nanocryatals were readily precipitated within a relatively narrow AS concentration range (2-8 μM). However, such low concentrations of AS seemed to stabilize the more acidic phases, and to delay the transformation into HA, to an extent which increased on increasing AS concentration. In contrast, at a slight higher concentrations (16-32 μM), AS promoted HA precipitation after ageing for 1 h. It was found that the effect of AS on the phase selectivity of apatitic precursors was concentration-dependent within a prolonged ageing time stage (0.5-168 h). The AS-assisted reactions in vitro offer an expedient way to understand the underlying implementarity between bone and BPs for bone consolidation, and to improve our understanding of benefit of BP dosages on bone turnover and trauma healing. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862809574	Enhancement of osteogenesis by poly(lactide-co-glycolide) sponges loaded with surface-embedded hydroxyapatite particles and rhBMP-2	The bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were seeded on [poly(lactide-co- glycolide) scaffolds with hydroxyapatite (HA) coating, and "s" stands for surface] (PLGA/HA-S), PLGA/HA-M (containing the same HA amount in the matrix as that of the PLGA/HA-S and "m" stands for matrix), and PLGA scaffolds, which were then cultured in a medium-containing Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (ErhBMP-2). In vitro culture of rat BMSCs found no different cell morphology in all the scaffolds, but the alkaline phosphatase activity and osteogenic gene expression of type I collagen (COL I) and osteocalcin (OCN) in the PLGA/HA-S scaffolds were always highest and were significantly improved in comparison with those in the PLGA scaffolds. In a rat calvarial defect model, new bone formation was enhanced in the PLGA/HA-S/ErhBMP-2 implants at 4 and 8 weeks after implantation too. Therefore, the PLGA/HA-S scaffold can better enhance the ErhBMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro and osteogenesis in vivo. © 2012 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

Significant mass loss was observed when the salt concentration was higher than 2 M and reached as high as 72% in a 5 M NaCl solution. The disassembly occurred initially in the superficial layers and then developed in the bulk multilayers. For the multilayers with PDADMAC as the outmost layer, the molar ratio of PSS/PDADMAC was increased and the surface chemistry was changed from PDADMAC domination below 2 M NaCl to PSS domination above 3 M NaCl. Owing to the higher concentrations of uncompensated for polyelectrolytes at both lower and higher salt concentrations, the swelling ratio of the multilayers was decreased until reaching 3 M NaCl and then was increased significantly again. The salt-treated PSS/PDADMAC thin films are expected to show different behaviors in terms of the physical adsorption of various functional substances, cell adhesion and proliferation, and chemical reaction activity. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84863289966	Fabrication and characterization of poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) knitted mesh-reinforced collagen-chitosan hybrid scaffolds for dermal tissue engineering	Mechanical properties are essential considerations for the design of porous scaffolds in the field of tissue engineering. To develop a well-supported hybrid dermal substitute, poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) yarns were knitted into a mesh with relative fixed loops, followed by incorporation into collagen-chitosan scaffolds (CCS) to obtain PLGA knitted mesh-reinforced CCS (PLGAm/CCS). The morphology and tensile strength in both the dry and wet state of PLGAm/CCS were investigated in vitro. To characterize the tissue response, specifically angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, PLGAm/CCS was embedded subcutaneously in Sprague-Dawley rats and compared with two control implants, i.e., PLGA mesh (PLGAm) and CCS. At weeks 1, 2, and 4 post surgery, tissue specimens were harvested for histology, immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. These results demonstrated that the incorporation of PLGA knitted mesh into CCS can improve the mechanical strength with little influence on its mean pore size and porosity. After implantation, PLGAm/CCS can resist contraction and promote cell infiltration, neotissue formation, and blood vessel ingrowth, effectively. In conclusion, the mechanical strength of scaffolds can play a synergetic role in tissue regeneration and vascularization by maintaining its 3D microstructure. The ability of PLGAm/CCS to promote angiogenesis and induce in situ tissue formation demonstrates its strong potential in the field of skin tissue engineering. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For this to occur, a PAH-g-poly(ethylene glycol) (PAH-g-PEG-COOH) layer was further adsorbed onto the (PAH/PSS)<inf>2</inf> multilayer-coated BSA NPs and used to covalently bond the aptamer AS1411, which is known to specifically bind the over-expressed nucleolin on cancer cell membranes. The PEGylated multilayer-coated BSA NPs showed good suspension stability in diverse media, in particular in a serum containing medium. By a mechanism of spontaneous deposition, doxorubicin (DOX) was effectively loaded into the pre-formed BSA NPs with both good encapsulation efficiency (98.6%) and loading percentage (9%). The loaded drug showed a pH-dependent release behaviour, i.e. faster at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.4. The multilayer coating did not significantly influence either both drug loading or release. In vitro cell culture demonstrated that the as-prepared BSA NPs could be specifically delivered to liver cancer cells, leading to higher cellular uptake and cytotoxicity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

84866047937	Facile fabrication of the glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen/chitosan porous scaffold for skin tissue engineering	Porous scaffold is one of the key factors in skin tissue engineering. In this study, a facile method was developed to prepare the glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linked collagen/chitosan porous scaffold (S2). The properties of S2 were compared with the scaffolds prepared by the traditional method (S1). Compared to the rough surface and collapsed inner structure of S1, S2 showed a smooth surface and controlled size. After treated by GA with same concentration, S1 and S2 showed the similar swelling ratios, which are big enough to ensure the nutrient supply in the early stage of wound healing. The effects of the fabrication methods as well as the GA concentration on the cross-linking degree and in vitro degradation degree of the scaffolds were studied. It was found that the cross-linking degree of S2-0.25% was much higher than that of S1. Investigation of the tensile and compression properties of the scaffolds found that the mechanical property of S2-0.04% is closest to that of S1. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied to determine the residual GA. The results proved that, compared to water rinse, oven drying is a feasible and effective method to remove the residual GA. Finally, the cytocompatibility of S2 was evaluated by in vitro culture of fibroblasts. The results of cell morphology and cell viability proved that S2-0.04% could retain the original good cytocompatibility of S1 to accelerate cell infiltration and proliferation effectively.

Among the available fabrication methods, the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of multilayer films onto colloidal particles followed by selective template removal has attracted extensive attention due to its advantages of precise control over the size, shape, composition, wall thickness and functions of the obtained capsules. The past decade has witnessed a rapid increase of research concerning the new fabrication strategies, functionalization and applications of this kind of capsules, particularly in the biomedical fields such as drug delivery, biosensors and bioreactors. In this critical review, the very recent progress of the multilayer capsules is summarized. First, the advances in assembly of capsules by the LbL technique are introduced with focus on tailoring the properties of hydrogen-bonded multilayer capsules by cross-linking, and fabrication of capsules based on covalent bonding and bio-specific interactions.

For comparisons, PLGA scaffolds loaded with same amount of HA particles (2%) in the matrix (PLGA/HA-M) and pure PLGA scaffolds were prepared by using pure paraffin spheres as porogens. Although the three types of scaffolds had same pore size (450-600μm) and similar porosity (90%-93%), the PLGA/HA-S showed the highest compression modulus. The embedment of the HA particles on the pore walls endow the PLGA/HA-S scaffold with a stronger ability of protein adsorption and mineralization as well as a larger mechanical strength against compression. In vitro culture of rat bone marrow stem cells revealed that cell morphology and proliferation ability were similar on all the scaffolds. However, the alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly improved for the cells cultured on the PLGA/HA-S scaffolds. Therefore, the method for fabricating scaffolds with spatially embedded nanoparticles provides a new way to obtain the bioactive scaffolds for tissue engineering. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84868101289	Repeated protrusion of fluorescent pyrene nanorods on the surface of crosslinked poly(allylamine hydrochloride) microcapsules	The ability to prepare micro/nano materials with a stable structure is highly demanded in advanced sciences and technologies. In this work, poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-graft-pyrene microcapsules with a stable structure were obtained by glutaraldehyde crosslinking, which could then be employed as microreactors to protrude 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde nanorods at low pH. The protrusion length of nanorods (NR) was tuned by the pH value, e.g. shorter NRs and a larger covering density or longer NRs and a lower covering density on the microcapsule surface at higher and lower pHs, respectively. The protruded pyrene NRs showed strong fluorescent emissions on the surface of microcapsules. The NRs could be repeatedly protruded by manipulating the reversible Schiff base formation and hydrolysis. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Stabilities of the BSA NPs in diverse mediums with different surfaces were detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Multilayers and PAH-g-PEG coated BSA NPs can be well dispersed in various mediums with a narrow polydispersity index (PDI). The BSA NPs with the highest surface density of PEG show the best stability. The multilayers and PAH-g-PEG coating do not deter the pH-dependent loading and release property of BSA NPs. At pH 9, the encapsulation efficiency of doxorubicin reaches almost 99%, and the release rate at pH 5.5 is significantly higher than that at pH 7.4. © 2012 Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84868202092	Preparation and cellular uptake of PLGA particles loaded with lamivudine	Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles loaded with lamivudine and coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were prepared via a double emulsion method. The influences of experiments parameters such as volume of inner aqueous phase, concentration of organic phase and ultrasonication time on the particle size and drug entrapment efficiency were investigated, obtaining PLGA particles with a diameter of ~260 nm and drug entrapment efficiency of ~35%. The particles were observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmittance electron microscopy, showing a core-shell structure. BCA assay found that 58 mg BSA was present on/in 1 g LPB particles. The loaded lamivudine showed a burst release at beginning and sustained release until 24 h in physiological conditions. Low pH could accelerate the release of lamivudine from PLGA particles, making the PLGA particles potential intelligent intracellular drug carriers. The PLGA particles were readily internalized into the human liver cells within a short time and increased gradually with the prolongation of incubation time regardless of the loading of lamivudine. The particles either resided within lysosomes or transferred to cytoplasm, but could not enter into the cell nucleus. The cell viability was not significantly influenced in the presence of the particles regardless of lamivudine encapsulation, suggesting that this kind of particles may be a good candidate for the intracellular anti-hepatitis B drug delivery. © 2012 The Author(s).

84867794124	Bioactive glasses-incorporated, core-shell-structured polypeptide/ polysaccharide nanofibrous hydrogels	Although the synthetic hydrogel materials capable of accelerating wound healing are being developed at a rapid pace, achieving inorganic-organic hybrid at nanoscale dimension in nanofibrous hydrogels is still a great challenge because of its notorious brittleness and microstructural stability in wet state. Here, we developed a new nanofibrous gelatin/bioactive glass (NF-GEL/BG) composite hydrogel by phase separation method and followed by arming the nanofibers network with counterionic chitosan-hyaluronic acid pairs for improving microstructural and thermal integrity. We achieve this feature by carrying an optimal balance of charges that allows the inorganic ion release in aqueous solution without minimal structure collapse. Therefore, such NF-GEL-based, polysaccharide-crosslinked bioactive hydrogel could afford a close biomimicry to the fibrous nanostructure and constituents of the hierarchically organized natural soft tissues to facilitate chronic, nonhealing wound treatment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84868704173	Responsive polyelectrolyte multilayers assembled at high ionic strength with an unusual collapse at low ionic strength	Responsive polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) of poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly(styrene sodium sulfonate) (PSS) with thicknesses between 350 and 400 nm for 11 deposited polyelectrolyte layers were fabricated assembling the polyelectrolytes at 3 M NaCl. When the 3 M NaCl bulk solution is replaced by water, the PEMs release water, approximately a 46% of the total mass, and experience a thickness reduction of more than 200 nm. Changes in thickness and water content are fully reversible. The film recovers its original thickness and water content when it is exposed again to a 3 M NaCl solution. A responsive polymer film is achieved with the capability of swelling at high ionic strength and collapsing in water with variations in thickness of hundred of nanometers.

84868314488	Cellular Uptake of Covalent Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) Microcapsules and Its Influences on Cell Functions	The mechanism of the cellular uptake of polyelectrolyte microcapsules and its influences on the functions and toxicity of human SMCs are explored. The covalently assembled poly(allylamine hydrochloride)/glutaraldehyde microcapsules are easily ingested by SMCs mainly through macropinosis and caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways. The capsules mainly disperse in cytoplasm without colocalization in early endosomes and cell nucleus. The results of gene chips reveal substantial and profound alternation of cell phenotypes and functions. Uptake of the microcapsules cause a slight decrease of cell viability, but leads to significant changes in cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle, as well as cell adhesion and migration ability.

84868538800	Influences of surface chemistry and swelling of salt-treated polyelectrolyte multilayers on migration of smooth muscle cells	The cell migration plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes and can be regulated by the cell-substrate interactions. We found previously that the poly (sodium 4-styrenesulphonate) (PSS)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) multilayers post-treated in 1-5 M NaCl solutions result in continuous changes of their physicochemical properties such as thickness, chemical composition, surface charge, swelling ratio and wettability. In this study, the responses of human smooth muscle cells (SMCs) on these salt-treated multilayers, particularly the governing factors of cellular migration that offer principles for designing therapeutics and implants, were disclosed. The cell migration rate was slowest on the 3 M NaCl-treated multilayers, which was comparable with that on tissue culture plates, but it was highest on 5 M NaCl-treated multilayers. To elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms, cell adhesion, proliferation, adhesion and related gene expressions were further investigated. The SMCs preferred to attach, spread and proliferate on the PSS-dominated surfaces with well-organized focal adhesion and actin fibres, especially on the 3 M NaCl-treated multilayers, while were kept round and showed low viability on the PDADMAC-dominated surfaces. The relative mRNA expression levels of adhesion-related genes such as fibronectin, laminin and focal adhesion kinase, and migration-related genes such as myosin IIA and Cdc42 were compared to explain the different cellular behaviours. These results reveal that the surface chemistry and the swelling of the salt-treated multilayers govern the cell migration behaviours. © 2012 The Royal Society.

The poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) multilayers were post-treated in a gradient NaCl solution with a concentration ranging from 3 m to 5 m, yielding the gradient multilayers with a similar chemistry composition (PSS domination) but gradually changed swelling ratio. The gradient nature and physicochemical properties were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry.

84871486563	RNAi functionalized collagen-chitosan/silicone membrane bilayer dermal equivalent for full-thickness skin regeneration with inhibited scarring	Scar inhibition of dermal equivalent is one of the key issues for treatment of full thickness skin defects. To yield a bioactive RNAi functionalized matrix for skin regeneration with inhibited scarring, collagen-chitosan/silicone membrane bilayer dermal equivalent (BDE) was combined with trimetylchitosan (TMC)/siRNA complexes which could induce suppression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) pathway. The RNAi-BDE functioned as a reservoir for the incorporated TMC/siRNA complexes, enabling a prolonged siRNA release. The seeded fibroblasts in the RNAi-BDE showed good viability, internalized the TMC/siRNA complexes effectively and suppressed TGF-β1 expression constantly until 14 d. Application of the RNAi-BDE on the full-thickness skin defects of pig backs confirmed the in vivo inhibition of TGF-β1 expression by immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting during 30 d post surgery. The levels of other scar-related factors such as collagen type I, collagen type III and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were also down-regulated. In combination with the ultra-thin skin graft transplantation for 73 d, the regenerated skin by RNAi-BDE had an extremely similar structure to that of the normal one. Our study reflects the latest paradigm of tissue engineering by incorporating the emerging biomolecule siRNA. The 3-D scaffolding materials for siRNA delivery may have general implications in generation of bioactive matrix as well. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84871925937	Polycaprolactone scaffolds or anisotropic particles: The initial solution temperature dependence in a gelatin particle-leaching method	A porogen-leaching method was applied to intend fabrication of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds. Following with a routine solution infiltration, freeze-drying and porogen-leaching process, the porous scaffolds were normally prepared at an initial solution temperature of 25 °C. However, the PCL anisotropic particles with the smooth and fuzzy surfaces toward the gelatin porogen and the solution, respectively, were unexpectedly obtained when the initial solution temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The freezing temperature was a governing factor for formation of the different PCL products too, while the coarsening time and the PCL concentration within 10-20% had no substantial influence. The PCL anisotropic particles are highly crystallized than the PCL raw materials. To clarify the intrinsic mechanisms, the temperature, cloud point, crystalline ability, and particle size in the solution were quantified. It is demonstrated that the sponges are formed by the traditional liquid-liquid demixing for the 25 °C solution, whereas the anisotropic particles are obtained by the solid-liquid demixing for the 37 °C solution and under the assistance of gelatin particles as nucleation sites. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By changing the relative contents of monomers and solvent, hydrogels with different swelling property and mechanical strength were obtained. Generally ,with a larger volume of solvent the hydrogel had a larger swelling ratio but a smaller compressive modulus due to the existence of pores in the matrix. Considering the balance between the hydrogel swelling and mechanical strength, a composite hydrogel with a macroporous structure was further fabricated by mixing 30% PPF and NVP,3% hydroxyapatite( HA) nanoparticles and benzoyl peroxide in 1,4dioxane,following by casting the mixture into NaCl particles(280 -450 μm as porogens) ,polymerization and removal of porogens. Addition of the HA particles increased the compressive modulus of porous hydrogels by 61%. Due to the sufficient exposure of the pre-loaded HA nucleation seeds and the good ability of medium exchange, significantly faster apatite growth was found in the composite macroporous hydrogel after being incubated in simulated body fluid, demonstrating that the PPF-NVP/HA macroporous hydrogel has better bone formation activity than the pure PPF-NVP macroporous hydrogel.

84873673056	Control over the gradient differentiation of rat BMSCs on a PCL membrane with surface-immobilized alendronate gradient	Gradient biomaterials can offer progressively changing signals to specific tissue interface, and thereby modulate the conjunction between different tissues. A linear density gradient of alendronate (Aln), a molecule that is capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), was created on an aminolyzed poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) membrane. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation revealed the linear increase of the Aln amount as a function of the position on the PCL membrane. By contrast, the surface wettability and energy were kept unchanged. The surface-grafted Aln showed a stronger ability to induce the osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs than its counterpart in culture medium of the same amount, and the osteo-inductive culture medium. On the Aln-grafted gradient surface, the BMSCs showed gradient osteogenic differentiation as a function of membrane position in terms of cell morphology, alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium deposition, and the expression of osteogenesis marker proteins including collagen type I (COL I), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osteocalcin (OCN). © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84873325496	Aminolysis-based surface modification of polyesters for biomedical applications	The ester-containing polymers, in particular polyesters, are widely used as biomedical materials due to their industrial availability and, in many cases, degradability. However, the commercially available polyesters are usually absent of bioactive sites or motifs to meet the requirements of some specific biomedical uses, especially in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Aminolysis is a convenient and versatile method to introduce -NH <inf>2</inf> or other functional groups onto the polyester surface. Functional moieties can then be conjugated to or grafted from these active sites. Numerous studies have managed to fabricate a series of functional surfaces on various types and forms of polyesters. They are capable of improving cell adhesion, proliferation and cellular functions, domination of stem cell differentiation and isolation of certain subgroup of cells, demonstrating the versatility of the aminolysis-based polyester surface modification in biomedical applications. The mechanism and kinetics of aminolysis reaction, as well as its subsequent influence on materials properties are discussed in this review. The successive functionalization strategies and derivative applications of the aminolyzed surfaces are introduced.

84874833558	Uptake of hydrogel particles with different stiffness and its influence on HepG2 cell functions	The interactions between colloidal particles and cells are of paramount importance for understanding the potential safety issue of the particles, which in turn provide the design principles of various carriers for biomedical applications. In this study, the influence of particle stiffness on cellular uptake and cell functions are elucidated. Four types of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (HEMA) hydrogel particles with different amounts of crosslinking agent, N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide (BIS), and thereby compressive modulus (from 15-156 kPa) were synthesized by an emulsion-precipitation polymerization. All of the particles had a diameter of 800-1000 nm in water. Although the softer particles were slightly swollen in the cell culture medium, the particle sizes were still similar. Adsorption of proteins (35 mg g <sup>-1</sup> particles) occurred on all the particles, leading to a change of zeta potential from -20 mV (in water) to -5 mV (in serum containing medium). However, the particle size and surface charge property were not significantly changed. The softer particles were internalized by HepG2 cells at a faster rate and larger amount than the stiffer particles. Cellular uptake mechanisms were clarified by the addition of inhibitors to specific endocytosis pathways. The influence of the particle uptake on cell toxicity and functions were then studied in terms of cell viability, morphology and cytoskeleton organization, and cell adhesion. Uptake of all types of the particles did not cause an apparent decrease of cell viability and alteration of cell morphology, but changed the cytoskeleton organization to some extent. The cell adhesion ability was significantly affected, especially after uptake of the stiffer particles. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly was used to engineer the surface of the NPs. Then, the multilayer coated PLGA NPs were further modified via self-assembly with lipid vesicles composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn- glycero-3-choline (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) at different molar ratios: 65:35, 75:25, 85:15 and 95:5. The influence of the lipid composition of the NPs on cellular uptake and uptake pathways for the HepG2 cell line was studied by means of flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated and caveolae-mediated endocytosis are the main internalisation pathways of the lipid coated PLGA NPs. Lipid coated PLGA NPs tend to form vesicle-like aggregates in close proximity to the nucleus. Co-localisation studies indicate that lipid coated NPs could be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Decreasing the proportion of negatively charged DOPS in the lipid coating results in a decrease in NP uptake and an increase in the presence of vesicle-like aggregates with an apparently higher association with the ER. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84876520010	Biomimetic preparation of trace element-codoped calcium phosphate for promoting osteoporotic bone defect repair	Specific implants to speedily regenerate critical-sized osteoporotic bone defects (COBDs) are a major clinical need. However, little progress in methods focusing on biological repair has been reported. We developed a biomimetic mineralization method to prepare trace element-codoped calcium phosphate (CaP) particles via hydrothermal treatment of modified simulated body fluid (SBF) with the addition of binary to quaternary trace elements. The morphology, structure, and composition of the particles were characterized by a combination of SEM, TEM, XRD, and FTIR measurements. The quantitative analysis shows that the dopant contents in the solid phase can be regulated by the trace ion concentrations in the aqueous medium. The conditioned cell culture medium from the quaternary Mg/Zn/Sr/Si-co-doped CaP (qCaP) could significantly enhance cell activity and osteogenic differentiation of ovariectomized rat-derived bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. After injecting the qCaP-loaded chitosan/hyaluronic acid hydrogel into the COBDs, histology and computed tomography scanning revealed that the new bone regeneration was significantly enhanced, and the quantity of mature bone was substantially increased in the rats implanted with qCaP 12 weeks post-operatively in comparison with the defects filled with the CaP obtained from SBF. These results suggest that the biomimetic mineralization of the trace ion-added SBF allows the preparation of highly bioactive trace element-codoped CaP biomaterials and these materials are potential candidates for the biological repair of COBDs. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

In this work, a molecular weight gradient of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) brushes with a thickness ranging from 3 to 30 nm and slopes of 0.8-3.2 nm/mm were fabricated by using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and a dynamically controlled reaction process. The PHEMA gradients were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and ellipsometry. The adhesion number, spreading area, adhesion force, and expression of focal adhesion and actin fibers of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) decreased along with the increase of the PHEMA brushes length. The VSMCs exhibited preferential orientation and enhanced directional migration toward the direction of reduced PHEMA thickness, whose extent was dependent on the gradient slope and polymer thickness. Most of the cells were oriented, and 87% of the cells moved directionally at the optimal conditions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84884901344	Fabrication of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) scaffold filled with fibrin gel, mesenchymal stem cells, and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(L -lysine)/TGF-β1 plasmid DNA complexes for cartilage restoration in vivo	A poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold filled with fibrin gel, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly (L-lysine) (PEO-b-PLL)/pDNA-TGF-β1 complexes was fabricated and applied in vivo for synchronized regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone. The PEO-b-PLL/pDNA-TGF-β1 complexes could transfect MSCs in vitro to produce TGF-β1 in situ and up regulate the expression of chondrogenesis-related genes in the construct. The expression of heterogeneous TGF-β1 in vivo declined along with the prolongation of implantation time, and lasted for 3 and 6 weeks in the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. The constructs (Experimental group) of PLGA/fibrin gel/MSCs/(PEO-b-PLL/pDNA-TGF-β1 complexes) were implanted into the osteochondral defects of rabbits to restore the functional cartilages, with gene-absent constructs as the Control. After 12 weeks, the Experimental group regenerated the neo-cartilage and subchondral bone with abundant deposition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and type II collagen. The regenerated tissues had good integration with the host tissues too. By contrast, the defects were only partially repaired by the Control constructs. qRT-PCR results demonstrated that expression of the chondrogenesis-marker genes in the Experimental group was significantly higher than that of the Control group, and was very close to that of the normal cartilage tissue. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Formation of the scaffold is mainly governed by the crystallization of the PCL polymer at appropriate conditions. All the 10-20% PCL/THF solutions yield the microspheres-aggregated scaffolds when the initial solution temperature is higher than 37°C, whereas the 10-15% solutions form dense membranes when the initial solution temperature is below 25°C. The size of the microspheres and pores is as large as 70-150 μm and 170-816 μm, respectively. The PCL microspheres-aggregated scaffold can better support the adhesion and proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) compared to the traditional porous scaffold obtained by a porogen leaching method.

Along with the increase of sulfated chitosan concentration, the nanoparticles with larger size and more negatively-charged surface were obtained. Both the SCS/PLL and SCS/PLL/TGF-β1 nanoparticles had a round morphology observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with a dry size of (177 ±26) nm and (195 ±35) nm, respectively. In vitro cell culture was performed to evaluate the differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) induced by the SCS/PLL/TGF-β1 nanoparticles. The result of cell proliferation showed that the addition of TGF-β1 either in a free state or as nanoparticles could block the proliferation of BMSCs to some extent. However, compared to the blank, SCS/PLL and free TGF-β1 groups, the SCS/PLL/TGF-β1 group secreted the highest amount of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Moreover, the results of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) also showed that the BMSCs seeded with the SCS/PLL/TGF-βl nanoparticles expressed significantly higher amount of collagen type II gene at day 14. All these results confirm that the bioactivity of TGF-β1 can be largely preserved in the form of SCS/PLL/TGF-β1 nanoparticles, leading to the preferential differentiation of BMSCs toward chondrocytes.

However, clinical translation of NPs with the goal of treating particularly challenging diseases, such as cancer, will require a thorough understanding of how the NP properties influence their fate in biological systems, especially in vivo. Many efforts have been paid to studying the interactions and mechanisms of NPs and cells.

After implantation in rabbit knees for 12 weeks, the full-thickness defects (both cartilage and subchondral bone were destroyed with a diameter and depth of 4 mm) repaired by the PLGA 122 group had formed a hyaline cartilage-like tissue with abundant glycosaminoglycans on the top layer and subchondral bone on the bottom layer. The group also achieved the best macroscopic (11.3±0.8) and histological scoring (Wakitani, 0.5±0.6). To unveil the mechanism of the cartilage repair outcome and the PLGA degradation behaviors, the chondrogenesis-related genes, inflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction at week 1, 3, and 6 postsurgery. At each time point, the regenerated tissues by the PLGA 122 group had the highest mRNA expression of SOX9 and collagen type II, but the smallest mRNA expression of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α, and MMP-13 and MMP-3. In summary, as a scaffolding matrix, the PLGA with different Mw shows a huge difference in cartilage regeneration in vivo. The one with a moderate Mw (122 kDa) causes the weakest inflammatory response and results in the best cartilage regeneration. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84892668479	Polyelectrolyte multilayer patterns created by capillary force and their impact on cell migration	Cell migration plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In this study a method of capillary force lithography was used to treat poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)/ poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) multilayers with a PDMS stamp before or after etching by NaCl solution, yielding physical patterns with various features such as double thin lines, double strips, meniscus-shaped ridges, and high ridges. The ridge height is controllable in the range of 25 and 1100 nm. Migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was restrained by the double-line patterns in a ridge height-dependent manner. By contrast, the mobility of SMCs was controlled by both the hydration ratio of the multilayers and the pattern features. Copyright © 2014 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84891671575	The roles of knitted mesh-reinforced collagen-chitosan hybrid scaffold in the one-step repair of full-thickness skin defects in rats	Full-thickness skin defects represent a significant and urgent clinical problem. Dermal substitutes serving as a regenerative template to induce dermal reconstruction provide a promising method to treat serious skin defects. Although collagen-chitosan dermal scaffolds display good biocompatibility and a suitable porous structure for angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, their poor mechanical properties compromise their application. To develop a well-supported dermal substitute, a poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) knitted mesh was fabricated and integrated with collagen-chitosan scaffold (CCS) to obtain a PLGA knitted mesh-reinforced CCS (PLGAm/CCS). The morphology of this PLGAm/CCS was investigated in vitro. To characterize the tissue response, specifically angiogenesis and tissue regeneration, the PLGAm/CCS was transplanted in combination with thin split-thickness autografts to repair full-thickness skin wounds using a one-step surgical procedure in Sprague-Dawley rats. These results were then compared with CCSs. At weeks 2, 4 and 8 after the operation, the healing wounds were imaged to analyse wound changes, and tissue specimens were harvested for histology, immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that collagen-chitosan sponge in the PLGAm/CCS remained porous, interconnected and occupied the openings of PLGA mesh, and the incorporation of the PLGA knitted mesh into CCS improved the mechanical strength with little influence on its mean pore size and porosity. Following transplantation, PLGAm/CCS inhibited wound contraction, and effectively promoted neotissue formation and blood vessel ingrowth. In conclusion, the mechanical strength of the scaffolds plays an important role in the process of tissue regeneration and vascularization. The ability of PLGAm/CCS to promote angiogenesis and induce in situ tissue regeneration demonstrates its potential in skin tissue engineering. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84896131939	Novel highly bioactive and biodegradable gypsum/calcium silicate composite bone cements: From physicochemical characteristics to in vivo aspects	Gypsum is a promising material for bone defect repair due to its osteoconductivity, whereas it is still limited in orthopedic and dental surgeries due to its low bioactivity and too rapid resorption so that one major concern is the significant loss in microstructural stability in vivo. In the present strategy some key features were significantly improved by introducing rapidly biodegradable but highly bioactive calcium silicate (CS) for regulating the physicochemical properties and biological performances of the gypsum-based cements at the same liquid/solid ratio. We demonstrated that introduction of 23% CS into β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH) could improve the physicochemical properties but would not compromise the mechanical strength of the composite. The surface bioactivity was significantly enhanced by introducing 23% CS, and these biphasic composites were favorable for decelerating the biodegradation rate by nearly 18.5% in 28 days in vitro. A mild bioresorption rate, with 39.6% of composite residual 4 weeks after operation, was determined when implanted in subcutaneous tissue of rats. 8 weeks after implantation, the composite cement containing 23% CS significantly enhanced new bone tissue regeneration with a much higher relative bone content (∼68.6%) than pure gypsum in critical size femoral defects in rabbits. The novel CSH-CS biocements represent promising candidates for rapid bone resconstruction and repair in trauma and pathological conditions. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84901013929	Comparison studies of the in vivo treatment of full-thickness excisional wounds and burns by an artificial bilayer dermal equivalent and J-1 acellular dermal matrix	The effects upon skin repair were compared between a homemade bilayer dermal equivalent (BDE), composed of a collagen/chitosan porous scaffold and a silicone membrane, and J-1 acellular dermal matrix (ADM), a commercial ADM that is used widely in China to treat various skin defects. Full-thickness excisional and burn wounds were prepared on the backs of pigs and then treated with the BDE and J-1 ADM. Biopsy specimens were harvested on days 7, 14, and 21 after surgery for gross, biochemical, and molecular examinations. In comparison with the burn wounds, the excisional wounds showed accelerated granular tissue formation and superior integration with the equivalents, regardless of their type. Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses showed that the vascularization rates in the excisional wounds group were also significantly faster than those of the burn group for both dermal equivalents. There was no significant difference between J-1 ADM and BDE treatment on the formation of newly formed blood vessels for the excisional wounds at days 7, 14, and 21. However, there was a significant difference in the number of nascent blood vessels formed in the burn wounds after treatment with J-1 ADM compared with BDE. The highest numbers of newly formed and mature blood vessels were present in the J-1 ADM-treated excisional wounds after 21 days. Ultrathin skin grafts were further transplanted on to the regenerated dermis for 28 days, resulting in the repair of the full-thickness wounds and production of a structure similar to normal skin. © 2014 by the Wound Healing Society.

84902174326	Complementary density gradient of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) and YIGSR selectively guides migration of endotheliocytes	Selective enhancement of directional migration of endotheliocytes (ECs) over vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays a significant role for the fast endothelialization of blood-contacting implants, in particular for the antirestenosis of vascular stents. Herein, a complementary density gradient of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) brushes and YIGSR peptide, a sequence specifically improving the mobility of ECs, was fabricated using a dynamically controlled reaction process. The gradients were visualized by fluorescent labeling and further quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-d). The ECs exhibited preferential orientation and enhanced directional migration behavior on the gradient surface toward the region of lower PHEMA density and higher YIGSR density. The migration rate of the ECs was significantly enhanced to 5-fold, whereas the mobility of SMCs was not significantly influenced, leading to faster migration of ECs than SMCs. Therefore, the success of the complementary gradient relies on the appropriate interplay between the PHEMA brushes and the cell-specific ligands, enabling the selective guidance of EC migration. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84902687792	Chitosan-modified, collagen-based biomimetic nanofibrous membranes as selective cell adhering wound dressings in the treatment of chemically burned corneas	Corneal chemical injury is a general but intractable ocular emergency, the sequelae of which are particularly challenging to treat. Human amniotic membrane (HAM) is one of the resources as a wound dressing for damaged corneal reconstruction, but the concerns related to the possible transmission of infectious diseases are the main drawbacks. Here we present a versatile method utilizing electrospinning and surface modification processes to develop optically highly transparent, microstructurally stable (>20 MPa in tensile strength in the wet state) biomimetic nanofibrous membranes. These membrane nanofibers, mainly consisting of a collagen-hyaluronate interior and a chitosan surface coating, showed superior mechanical and biological performances compared to HAM, and were favorable to the selective adhesion of epithelial cells (corneal, conjunctival) and fibroblasts. The alkali-burned corneal damage model in rats demonstrated that the biomimetic membranes could markedly improve re-epithelialization in corneal tissue within one week. Therefore, such bioactive multifunctional membranes may find widespread biomedical applications in wound healing and postoperative anti-adhesion in the near future.

84903955064	A three-dimensionally engineered biomimetic cartilaginous tissue model for osteoarthritic drug evaluation	Osteoarthritis (OA) is primarily characterized by focal cartilage destruction and synovitis. Presently, the pathogenesis of OA remains unclear, and an effective treatment methodology is an unmet need. To this end, a plethora of animal models and monolayer models have been developed, but they are faced with the limitation of high cost and inability to recapitulate a pure hyaline cartilaginous phenotype, which is important in studying the efficacy of therapeutic agents. We have previously developed a living hyaline cartilage graft (LhCG) that accurately presented a pure hyaline cartilage phenotype. Here, through the coculture of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages with LhCG, we hypothesized that an accurate OA disease model may be developed. Subsequently, this model was evaluated for its accuracy for in vitro drug testing. Results indicated that chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis were increased in the disease model. Additionally, extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis increased as indicated by the increased anabolic gene expression levels, such as collagen type II and aggrecan. Up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and MMP-3 genes suggested increased degradative activity, while chondrocytic hypertrophic differentiation was observed. Furthermore, extensive degradation of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were also observed. The results of celecoxib treatment on our model showed inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, as well as down-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression. Taken together, the results suggested that this coculture model was able to sufficiently mimic the native, diseased OA cartilage, while drug testing results confirmed its suitability as an in vitro model for predicting native cartilage response to drug treatment. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84904018020	Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)/fibrin gel construct as a 3D model to evaluate gene therapy of cartilage in vivo	Combination of gene therapy with tissue engineering can enhance the interplay between cells and matrix, leading to better restoration and regeneration of tissues and organs in vivo. In this study the PLGA/fibrin gel hybrids were employed to load lipofectamine/pDNA-TGF-β1 complexes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (experimental group), acting as a cartilage-mimetic tissue platform. The gene complexes distributed more evenly in the hybrid scaffolds, whereas they adhered onto the pore walls of the PLGA sponges. The filled fibrin gel rendered gene release in a slower manner, too. Moreover, the fibrin gel entrapped MSCs and contributed to a higher cell loading density in the hybrid constructs. In vivo assay showed that in the defects implanted with the experimental constructs both gene and protein expression levels of TGF-β1 were significantly higher than those of the fibrin-free group at weeks 1, 3, and 6 after surgery. The full articular cartilage defects repaired by the experimental group for 12 w were resurfaced by neo-tissues with a similar thickness, cell arrangement, and color to the normal neighboring cartilage and abundant glycosaminoglycans. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84904310630	A correlation study of protein adsorption and cell behaviors on substrates with different densities of PEG chains	The adsorption of proteins, in particular fibronectin (Fn), was studied on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, 5kDa)-grafted surfaces, and was correlated with the adhesion behaviors of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The PEG molecules were covalently grafted on aldehyde-activated substrates with different densities of amino groups. The thickness of PEG layer increased nearly 10 fold in a hydrated state, reaching to 27nm on the surface of highest PEG chain density with a brush configuration. On the lower PEG-grafted surfaces, however, the PEG molecules adopted a mushroom configuration. The adsorption of Fn without and with the competition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and serum was studied by using ellipsometry, fluorescence microscopy and radio-labeling techniques. The adsorption amount of Fn in serum decreased initially with increased PEG chain density until 0.12chains/nm

84904316824	A quantitative study of the intracellular concentration of graphene/noble metal nanoparticle composites and their cytotoxicity	Noble-metal nanoparticles (NPs) especially prepared from gold and silver have been combined on the surface of graphene to obtain graphene-based nanocomposites for novel functions in enhanced performance in bio-imaging, cancer detection and therapy. However, little is known about their cellular uptake, especially the intracellular quantity which plays a critical role in determining their functions and safety. Therefore, we prepared covalently conjugated GO/Au and GO/Ag composites by immobilizing Au and Ag nanoparticles on GO sheets pre-functionalized with disulfide bonds, respectively. The cellular uptake of these composites was quantitatively studied by means of an ion beam microscope (IBM) to determine the metal content in human lung cancer cells (A549 cells) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 cells). The cell uptake was also studied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which is one of the most sensitive techniques being applied to cell suspensions, for comparison. Toxicity, one of the consequences of cellular uptake of GO based composites, was studied as well. The potential toxicity mechanism was also suggested based on the results of intracellular quantification of the nanomaterials. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84905280458	Immobilization of enzymes on 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate copolymer brushes	The immobilization of enzymes is of paramount importance to maintain their activity and stability. In this study, surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization was applied to prepare poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) brushes on glass slides. The polymerization kinetics was followed by using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and ellipsometry in terms of mass and thickness growth, respectively. The surface chemical compositions of the obtained polymer brushes were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Their mass, thickness, and enzyme-immobilization ability could be easily tuned by the initiator reaction time, monomer ratio, and polymerization time. The antibacterial activity and stability of the immobilized lysozymes were studied by fluorescent staining and bacteria lysis assay, which revealed that the lysozymes on the copolymer brushes had good stability during storage at 4°C for up to 30 days. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84906683345	Preparation of TAT peptide-modified poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgel particles and their cellular uptake, intracellular distribution, and influence on cytoviability in response to temperature change	Thermo-sensitive microgel particles may exert a swelling force inside cells and influence on cell viability due to their volume transition in response to external temperature change. In this study, cross-linked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles with a thermo-responsive volume expansion ability were prepared by precipitation polymerization of NIPAM, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and acrylic acid. To endow the microgel particles with enhanced cellular uptake and visualization, cell penetrating peptide TAT and fluorescent probe were further covalently immobilized. The cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and thermo-responsive cytotoxicity of the microgel particles were studied by co-culture with lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. The PNIAPM microgel particles were largely ingested by A549 cells and mainly located in lysosomes. TAT modification enhanced the cellular internalization of particles but did not alter their intracellular distribution. While the PNIPAM microgel particles did not show significant impact on cell viability at 37. °C, they caused cytotoxicity to some extent when being cultured at 25. °C for 4. h. Doxorubicin loaded PNIPAM microgel particles showed the strongest cytotoxicity when being cultured at 25. °C for 4. h, suggesting the combinational effect of intracellular volume expansion and drug release on cells. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
