15744400697	Mycobacterium keratitis after laser in situ keratomileusis	Purpose: We present a case of Mycobacterium keratitis after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Method: A retrospective case report. Results: A 40-year-old woman developed Mycobacterium chelonae keratitis in the right eye 2 weeks after bilateral LASIK. The diagnosis was made by acid-fast staining of corneal scrapings on admission and confirmed by culture results 2 weeks later. Intensive treatment with topical amikacin (25 mg/mL) and ciprofloxacin and partial excision of the flap led to resolution of the infection after 2 months of therapy. In addition, topical methylprednisolone (1 mg/mL) was necessary to control inflammation and pain. No recurrence was found during the 1-year follow-up period. The final uncorrected and corrected visual acuity in the right eye was 20/25 and 20/20, respectively. Conclusion: Mycobacterium keratitis is a potentially vision-threatening complication after LASIK. Early recognition of the organisms and aggressive treatment if infection develops may improve the outcome. When surgery is indicated, partial flap amputation, which may help to resolve the infection and preserve better vision, may be considered. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

17844405580	Recurrent alcaligenes xylosoxidans keratitis	Purpose: To describe a case of postkeratoplasty recurrent Alcaligenes xylosoxidans keratitis. Methods: A 33-year-old man with a history of penetrating keratoplasty developed corneal infiltrate with intact epithelium and then was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Corneal scraping was taken for microbiologic study. Results: The culture result identified A. xylosoxidans, sensitive to piperacillin and ceftazidime. There were 3 recurrent episodes within 2 months after each apparent resolution achieved after the instillation of topical piperacillin (10 mg/mL). During the fourth attack, the lesion responded poorly to piperacillin and ceftazidime (25 mg/mL), so therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty was performed to eradicate the recalcitrant infection. Conclusions: A. xylosoxidans has probably been underreported as a cause of ocular infection. It does not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy and may be difficult to eradicate. Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty might be necessary if medical treatment fails. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

17144391069	Highly efficient ex vivo gene delivery into human corneal endothelial cells by recombinant adeno-associated virus	Purpose: Gene delivery at high efficiency is crucial for cornea endothelial cell gene therapy. This study investigated the efficiency of gene transfer by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) in an organ culture system. Methods: Human cornea tissue was exposed to rAAV delivering green fluorescent protein (ss-rAAV2-CMV-GFP) for one hour and then cultured at 31°C for 2 weeks in a medium supplemented with growth factors. Endothelial cells expressing GFP gene were then identified. Results: High-efficiency gene transfer was found in over 90% of endothelial cells. Gene expression could be detected within 24 hours and remained stable up to 2 weeks in the organ culture system. Conclusions: The high-delivery efficiency and rapid induction of gene expression indicate that rAAV is a promising vector for cornea endothelial cell gene therapy for ocular diseases. Organ culture at 31°C using culture medium supplemented with growth factors significantly facilitates gene transfer into human corneal endothelium.

20144368310	Correspondence of the Dark-prone test to ultrasound biomicroscopy in the diagnosis of plateau iris syndrome: A pilot study	Background: This study evaluated the correspondence of the dark-prone provocative test to ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the diagnosis of plateau iris syndrome. Materials and methods: Patients, after undergoing a laser iridotomy to eliminate pupillary block, with UBM-confirmed plateau iris syndrome underwent the dark-prone provocative test. An increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) of 8 mmHg or more following the test was considered a positive result. Nine eyes from six patients were included in the study. Results: Eight eyes (88.9%) had elevated IOP of at least 8 mmHg following 1 hour of provocation and, therefore, a positive dark-prone provocative test. One eye had an IOP elevation of only 5 mmHg. Conclusion: There is a high level of correspondence between a positive dark-prone test and UBM in patients with plateau iris syndrome. The dark-prone test could be effective in confirming the clinical diagnosis of plateau iris syndrome. ©2004 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

23044491170	Prevention of indocyanine green toxicity on retinal pigment epithelium with whole blood in stain-assisted macular hole surgery	Purpose: To examine whether whole blood prevents indocyanine green (ICG) toxicity on in vitro retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and prevents RPE staining in ICG-assisted macular hole (MH) surgery. Design: In vitro study and prospective case series. Participants: In vitro study and 20 patients who underwent ICG-assisted MH surgery (20 eyes). Methods: In the in vitro study, cultured human RPE cells were covered with balanced saline solution (BSS), heparinized whole blood, plasma, or packed red blood cells, then exposed to various concentrations of ICG. One cohort was incubated in the dark; the other cohort was exposed to light. Indocyanine green toxicity was evaluated by mitochondrial dehydrogenase assay. In the clinical study, a prospective noncomparative review of 20 consecutive patients (20 eyes) with stage 3 to stage 4 MH who underwent surgery with ICG to stain the internal limiting membrane (ILM) was performed. Indocyanine green solution (0.5 mg/ml) was used to stain the ILM after autologous whole blood covered the macular hole area. Postoperative staining of ICG on RPE was detected by an infrared-sensitive camera. Main Outcome Measures: Cultured human RPE cell viability, macular hole closure rate, median visual acuity preoperatively and postoperatively, postoperative ICG staining, and retinal changes. Results: Cultured human RPE cells covered by whole blood or plasma showed no decrease of mitochondrial dehydrogenase even in 5.0 mg/ml concentration of ICG for 20 minutes with or without light exposure. Conversely, those exposed to ICG and covered with BSS demonstrated a significant decrease of mitochondrial dehydrogenase after incubation in 5, 2.5, and 1.0 mg/ml for 20 minutes in the dark and in 5 to 0.05 mg/ml with light. Clinically, no postoperative staining on RPE was detected. No atrophic RPE changes or other retinal changes were observed in the previous MH area that was covered by autologous whole blood in all 20 eyes on average follow-up of 10.6 months. The hole closed in 19 eyes (95%) on first surgery. Visual acuity improved in 17 eyes (85%) on most recent follow-up. Conclusions: Whole blood prevents ICG toxicity in RPE cell culture and prevents staining of RPE in surgery of MH when the ILM is stained with ICG. © 2005 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

23944526635	Toxic keratopathy-related corneal dehydration after laser in situ keratomileusis	A 33-year-old woman had progressive blurred vision 2 weeks after uneventful laser in situ keratomileusis surgery. Initial satisfactory uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was complicated by postoperative dry eye and drug toxicity. Slitlamp biomicroscopy revealed diffuse punctate epithelial keratitis and inferior corneal epithelial defect with rolled-up epithelium on the flaps and the inferior unoperated cornea in both eyes. Diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrates were evident in the stroma. Stromal thinning was evident on serial Orbscan (Bausch & Lomb) and pachymetry examinations, and a hyperopic shift of almost +6 diopters was observed in the refractive error in both eyes. These examinations showed a gradual recovery of stromal thickness after copious hydration with balanced salt solution. The UCVA was 1.0 in both eyes after corneal rehydration. © 2005 ASCRS and ESCRS.

2342462290	Pseudomonas aeruginosa Corneal Ulcer Related to Overnight Orthokeratology	Background: Overnight orthokeratology was thought to be a safe and non-invasive alternative for low-grade myopia and astigmatism correction. We assessed histories, clinical courses, and visual outcomes of the patients with pseudomonal keratitis related to overnight orthokeratology. Methods: The records of six patients with pseudomonal keratitis related to overnight orthokeratology were reviewed from January 2001 through December 2002. Results: The average age of the patients was 13 years. The average period between the time that the patient started the overnight orthokeratology program and the onset of infectious keratitis was 17 months. All patients presented with painful red eyes. The area of the corneal ulcer was central in three, and paracentral in three eyes. The corneal infiltrate was small in one eye, and medium in five eyes. The corneal scrapings from these six patients revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All patients responded well to topical antibiotic treatment. Two of six eyes had a final visual acuity within two lines of the pre-infection vision at the last follow-up. Four of the eyes examined lost their best-corrected visual acuity due to central corneal scar or irregular astigmatism. Conclusions: Overnight orthokeratology contact lens wear has the potential complication of pseudomonal keratitis and may cause significant visual impairment.

24944500043	Long-term safety of GDNF gene delivery in the retina	Purpose: To examine retinal function after the long-term, gene therapy-delivered expression of exogenous glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Methods: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats each received an intravitreal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing GDNF (rAAV-GDNF) in their right eye. The left eye was untreated. One year after viral transduction in ocular tissues, retinal morphology and function were compared between rAAV-GDNF-injected and normal naïve eyes. Synthesis and accumulation of GDNF within the retina were immunohistologically confirmed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Morphological analyses included light microscope examination of retinal sections and the counting of retinal ganglion cells. Inflammation by infiltration of leukocytes in retina was assessed immunohistochemically. Retinal function was assessed using electroretinography. Results: GDNF expression was confirmed. There was no obvious abnormality in retinal section or increased infiltration by leukocytes after retinal transduction of rAAV-GDNF for 1 year. Counts of retinal ganglion cells were not decreased in rAAV-GDNF-injected eyes. There were no statistical differences in amplitude as well as latency of the electroretinogram-determined a- and b-waves between transduced and untreated eyes. Conclusions: Long-term expression of GDNF within the eyes can be achieved by intravitreal injection of rAAV vectors in the absence of morphological or functional deficits in the retina.

25844490388	Infectious keratitis related to overnight orthokeratology	Purpose: To report the microbial culture results, clinical course, and visual outcomes for infectious keratitis related to overnight orthokeratology. Methods: The records of patients with infectious keratitis related to overnight orthokeratology who presented to a tertiary referral center from April 2000 to March 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Twenty patients (21 eyes) were included; 1 patient had bilateral infections. The average age of the patients was 14 years. The average period between the time the patient started the overnight orthokeratology program and the onset of infectious keratitis was 23 months. Thirteen of the 21 eyes were culture positive. Organisms cultured were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 9), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 2), Serratia marcescens (n = 1), and Acathamoeba species (n = 1). All patients responded well to medical antimicrobial treatment. Final best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to 20/100. Conclusions: Infectious keratitis is a potential complication of overnight orthokeratology that may cause significant visual impairment. Parents of children who consider overnight orthokeratology should evaluate the benefit of temporary myopia reduction and the risk of infection. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

27644514092	Pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in East Asians	Purpose: To describe clinical features, predisposing factors, and surgical outcomes of retinal detachment in different age groups in a pediatric population. Design: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. Participants: A total of 296 eyes from 278 children younger than 18 years of age underwent the first surgical procedure for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment between 1983 and 2003. They were divided into 3 age groups: 38 eyes in group 1 (0-10 years), 107 eyes in group 2 (11-15 years), and 151 eyes in group 3 (16-18 years). Methods: Predisposing factors for retinal detachment were classified into 4 categories: (1) high myopia, (2) trauma, (3) congenital or developmental structural ocular abnormalities, and (4) previous intraocular surgery. Main Outcome Measurements: Visual acuity and retinal reattachment. Results: The mean age of the patients was 14.6 years; 73.7% were boys. The mean follow-up period was 51 months. At least 1 predisposing factor could be identified in 282 (95%) of study eyes. High myopia was most common in 111 eyes (38%). Thirty-one percent of eyes experienced trauma, 17% had structural abnormalities, and 5% underwent previous intraocular surgery. Macular involvement was found in 237 eyes (80%). The initial surgery was scleral buckling alone in 224 eyes (76%). Retinal reattachment was achieved in 214 eyes (72%) after the first operation and in 250 eyes (85%) at the end of intervention. Features seen in patients with a poor surgical outcome included congenital anomaly (P<0.001), previous intraocular surgery (P = 0.007), proliferative vitreoretinopathy grade C or worse (P<0.001), macula off (P = 0.001), total retinal detachment (P<0.001), and use of silicone oil (P<0.001). Conclusions: Myopia is one of the important predisposing factors of pediatric retinal detachment in East Asians. The predisposing factors, clinical features, timing of diagnosis, and frequency of proliferative vitreoretinopathy of retinal detachment are somewhat different in the 3 age groups considered. Because of higher proportions of congenital anomaly, total retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and a low success rate with poor postoperative compliance, patients in group 1 experienced the lowest final reattachment rate and the worst visual recovery. © 2005 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

27644536135	Ischemic retinopathy and uveitis in a patient with tetralogy of fallot	Purpose: To describe ischemic retinopathy in a patient with tetralogy of Fallot. Design: Interventional case report. Testing: Clinical and imaging evaluation. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings in a patient with tetralogy of Fallot. Results: A 20-year-old female patient with tetralogy of Fallot had progressive visual loss of 3 weeks duration. Bilateral examination revealed dilated, tortuous, conjunctival vessels; prominent anterior chamber reaction; iris neovascularization; posterior synechia; retinal vascular tortuosity in both eyes; and inferior exudative retinal detachment. Fluorescein angiography revealed delayed retinal and choroidal filling. The working diagnosis was ischemic retinopathy with uveitis. The patient was treated for 6 months with a high-dose oral corticosteroid combined with a topical corticosteroid, a topical mydriatic, and panretinal photocoagulation. Conjunctival, vascular congestion subsided with a decrease in anterior chamber reaction. The inferior, exudative retinal detachment resolved, and vision was restored. Conclusions: Retinal ischemic syndrome combined with uveitis can develop in patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Treatment can restore vision in such patients. © 2005 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

3242879066	In vitro antiangiogenic activity in ex vivo expanded human limbocorneal epithelial cells cultivated on human amniotic membrane	PURPOSE. To compare the in vitro antiangiogenic activities of ex vivo expanded human limbocorneal epithelial (HLE) cells cultivated on preserved human amniotic membrane (AM) and to identify factors responsible for the activities. METHODS. The antiangiogenic effects were compared of culture media conditioned by AM, HLE cells, or HLE cells cultivated on intact AM (HLE/IAM), on denuded AM (HLE/DAM), or on DAM cocultured with 3T3 fibroblasts (HLE/DAM/3T3). A monolayer culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) was used in a proliferation and migration assay. ECs suspended in type I collagen gel were used to assess capillary tube formation. Quantitative analyses of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, thrombospondin (TSP)-1, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and endostatin (proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII) were performed by ELISA. Immunoconfocal microscopy was performed to localize the site of endostatin expression in HLE cells and AM. RESULTS. HLE cell- but not AM-conditioned medium (CM) inhibited the proliferation and migration of ECs, and coculture of HLE cells, but not of AM, with ECs inhibited capillary tube formation. Although some data from HLE cells alone are not significantly different from the control, increased inhibitory activity was expressed by HLE/IAM and HLE/DAM and was most significantly expressed by HLE/DAM/3T3. Quantitation of TIMP-1, TSP-1, PEDF, and endostatin revealed that only the level of endostatin showed an increased expression by HLE cells cultivated on AM. Neutralizing antibody to endostatin substantially abrogated the inhibitory effect on EC proliferation and migration, but was less effective on EC differentiation, Endostatin signal was more prominent in the basement membrane zone of HLE cells cultivated on denuded AM than in those cultivated on intact AM. CONCLUSIONS. The antiangiogenic effect of HLE cells was enhanced when they were cultivated on AM and cocultured with 3T3 fibroblasts, and endostatin-related antiangiogenic factor may play a major role. This highlights the significance of cell-matrix and cell-cell interaction in the regulation of antiangiogenic factor secretion by HLE cells.

33645993908	Central corneal iron deposition after myopic laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis	Purpose: To describe central corneal iron deposition after myopic laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Methods: Patients visiting our outpatient clinics between February 2003 and January 2004 and displaying post-LASIK corneal iron deposits were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Results: Forty-two eyes of 24 patients developed corneal iron deposition after myopic LASIK surgery. All eyes displayed a small, spotty iron deposit located in the center of the corneal flap. The median interval between LASIK and diagnosis of corneal iron deposition was 22.5 months. The spherical equivalents of achieved correction ranged from 4.00 D to 17.50 D. Conclusion: Spotty corneal iron deposition can develop in the center of the corneal flap after myopic LASIK surgery. Because it is asymptomatic, the condition may have been hitherto underestimated in patient populations. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

33745059364	Interventions for relieving pain associated with panretinal photocoagulation: A prospective randomized trial	Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of pain relief by oral diazepam, acetaminophen, mefenamic acid, intramuscular ketorolac tromethamine, and peribulbar anaesthesia in panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Methods: A total of 220 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring PRP treatment were enrolled in this study. Before laser treatment, the patients were allocated randomly to one of eight groups: group 1: diazepam (n=22), group 2: acetaminophen (n=21), group 3: mefenamic acid (n=21), group 4: diazepam and acetaminophen (n=22), group 5: diazepam and mefenamic acid (n=22), group 6: peribulbar anaesthesia with lidocaine (n=23), group 7: intramuscular injection of ketorolac tromethamine (n=22), group 8: placebo (n=67). Pain after the laser treatment was assessed by a verbal descriptive scale. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and after laser treatment. Results: Patients receiving peribulbar anaesthesia had a significantly lower pain score than the control group (P=0.0001). Additionally, the peribulbar anaesthesia-treated group had the significantly least PRP-associated rise in either systolic (P=0.043) or diastolic blood pressure rates (P=0.030). There were no significant differences in pain score using other anesthetic agents when compared with the control group. There were no significant changes in heart rate after PRP treatment. Conclusion: Peribulbar anaesthesia is effective in reducing pain and blood pressure increase after PRP treatment. Oral diazepam, mefenamic acid, and acetaminophen (either alone or in combination with each other) are not effective in preventing PRP treatment-associated pain. Intramuscular injection of ketorolac tromethamine is also not effective in reducing PRP-associated pain. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

33746769949	Amniotic membrane transplantation for persistent corneal ulcers and perforations in acute fungal keratitis	PURPOSE: To report the therapeutic effect and complications of amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) in acute fungal keratitis. METHODS: Diagnosis of fungal keratitis was confirmed by cultures in 23 eyes of 23 patients. The indications to perform AMT were to promote reepithelialization in non-healing ulcers or to prevent corneal perforation. Antifungal agents were administered throughout the whole course of hospitalization. Repeated cultures were performed immediately before AMT. The main outcome measurements were epithelial healing rate, necessity of therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK), and persistence of infection. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up time of 20.6 months ± 23.22 (6-65 months) AMT was performed during the active phase of the keratitis (fungal culture was still positive) in 16 patients (69.6%), and during the inactive phase (fungal culture negative) in 7 patients (30.4%). Single-layer AMT was performed in 17 patients, and double-layer AMT was performed in 6 patients with corneal perforation and anterior chamber collapse. Complete epithelialization was observed in 12 patients (75%) in the active group and in 7 patients (100%) in the inactive group. Treatment failure requiring TPK was experienced in 4 patients (25%) in the active group. Persistent fungal keratitis was noted in 2 patients (8.7%) in that group. The final visual acuity improved in 17 cases, worsened in 2 cases, and remained unchanged in 4 cases. Twelve of the 23 eyes (52.2%) in this study preserved useful vision (20/400 and better) with or without subsequent surgeries. CONCLUSION: AMT is effective in promoting epithelialization and preventing corneal perforations in acute fungal keratitis, and there is no risk of rejection. However, the risk of persistent or recurrent infection necessitates continued antifungal treatment and patient monitoring. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

33750550924	Ulcerative keratitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae	PURPOSE: To report the clinical course, treatments, antibiotic sensitivities, and visual outcomes for eyes with ulcerative keratitis caused by Haemophlilus influenzae. METHODS: The medical records of 10 patients with culture-proven H. influenzae-associated corneal ulcer in a tertiary referral center in a 5-year period (1998-2003) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The median age was 61 years (range, 2-83 years). The mean follow-up time was 9.4 months (range, 2-31 months). Risk factors such as previous surgeries (5), herpes simplex keratitis (2), leukoma adherens with calcification (1), and exposure keratitis (1) were identified in 9 patients. In vitro testing of the H. influenzae isolates showed that 6 of 10 were resistant to ampicillin; all were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime. All cases responded well to medical antibiotic treatment. Final best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ranged from no light perception to 20/30. CONCLUSION: H. influenzae is a rare cause of corneal ulceration. Predisposing factors for infection are usually present. Accurate diagnosis and treatment may preserve ocular integrity and visual acuity. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

33845624885	Ahmed glaucoma valve implant for childhood glaucoma in Sturge-Weber syndrome with choroidal hemangioma	We present our experience with implantation of an Ahmed glaucoma valve in a 9-year-old girl with Sturge-Weber syndrome with choroidal hemangioma. In this case of childhood glaucoma, the choice of surgical procedure should be based on the efficacy and elimination of intra-and post-operative complications. An Ahmed glaucoma valve offered safety and efficacy in controlling glaucoma. This technique avoided sudden drops in intraocular pressure and decreases the risk of intraoperative and postoperative choroidal effusion and hemorrhage. The surgical procedure was not complicated: a one-staged implant was satisfactory and a prophylactic sclerostomy was not required.

33750975056	Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of pediatric cataract in Taiwan	Purpose: To report treatment of pediatric patients with cataract, and evaluate the efficiency of different surgical interventions. Method: This study comprised a consecutive series of pediatric patients with congenital or developing cataract who received surgery between 1993 and 2002 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Patients' demographics, cataract type, presenting symptoms, surgical intervention, postoperative visual acuity, and follow-up refractive changes were recorded. Results: Three hundred and ninety-nine eyes of 246 children were included; unilateral cataract was present 21.8% of the eyes. The age at surgery was ranged from 1 to 157 months. Eyes were grouped by surgical interventions performed: Group 1 included 98 eyes that had lensectomy. Group 2 included 89 eyes that had lensectomy and secondary intraocular lens implantation. Group 3 included 212 eyes that had lensectomy with primary intraocular implantation. The mean follow up time was 41.3 months. Finally, 23.1% group 1 patients, 42.1% group 2 patients, and 63.4% group 3 patients achieved visual acuity better than 20/60 (P=0.000). Upon analysis with multifactor regression, age at onset (P=0.011) was the only significant factor related to visual outcome. Complications such as after cataract and glaucoma occurred in 21.6% and 5.8% of all patients, respectively. Conclusions: Intraocular lens implantation for children with congenital or developing cataract is an effective treatment for visual rehabilitation, even for those patients age 2 years and younger. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33845791517	Camphor-related self-inflicted keratoconjunctivitis complicating delusions of parasitosis	PURPOSE: To report a case of camphor-related self-inflicted keratoconjunctivitis secondary to delusions of parasitosis. METHODS: A 61-year-old man with delusions of parasitosis suffered from camphor-related self-inflicted ocular trauma that manifested with corneal epithelial defects and secondary anterior chamber reaction. Two episodes of exacerbation of the ocular conditions related to the use of camphor occurred. The left eye had secondary infection with Sternotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus in the second episode of exacerbation. RESULTS: The right eye recovered well with the treatment of topical lubricants and corticosteroids and had best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/25. The infection of the left eye led to corneal perforation, necessitating penetrating keratoplasty; BCVA was hand motions because of a mature cataract. Olanzapine therapy for 1 month to decrease the delusions of parasitosis and 24-hour watch to prevent the use of camphor led to the resolution of self-inflicted keratoconjunctivitis in the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Delusions of parasitosis may lead to vision-threatening self-inflicted ocular trauma. This may be the first case report of pure camphor-related self-inflicted toxic keratoconjunctivitis. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

33847746237	Generation of endostatin by matrix metalloproteinase and cathepsin from human limbocorneal epithelial cells cultivated on amniotic membrane	PURPOSE. Cultured human limbocorneal epithelial (HLE) cells secrete endostatin-related molecules that are augmented when the cells are cultivated on denuded amniotic membrane (DAM). This study is to identify mechanisms for enhanced endostatin production by HLE cells cultivated on AM. METHODS. HLE cells were cultured on dish, on intact AM (IAM) or on DAM. Collagen XVIII α1 mRNA was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. In HLE/DAM cultures, inhibitors of MMPs (GM-6001; 1,10-phenanthroline), cathepsins (E64; cathepsin B inhibitor II), elastase (elastatinal), and serine proteases (AEBSF; aprotinin) were added. Endostatin in the conditioned medium (CM) was detected by Western blot. MMP-7; MMP-9; and cathepsins B, K, L, and V in the CM were quantitated by ELISA. Exogenous cathepsin B or V was added to the concentrated HLE/DAM CM to see the effect on endostatin production. RESULTS. The expression of collagen XVIII α1 mRNA in the three groups was similar. Elastatinal, AEBSF, and aprotinin had no effect on endostatin generation. MMP inhibitors inhibited the generation of all the 20- and 28- to 30-kDa endostatin-related fragments, while cathepsin inhibitors inhibited only the 20-kDa endostatin. The level of MMP-7 and cathepsin B but not cathepsin V increased as the culture time increased, and paralleled with endostatin production. However, cathepsins K and L were absent in the CM. Exogenous cathepsins B and V further augmented the generation of endostatin. CONCLUSIONS. MMP-7 and cathepsins B and V are involved in the generation of endostatin by HLE cells. Facilitating endostatin generation may be a novel physiological function of the cornea-specific cathepsin V. Copyright © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

34247133002	Functional visual disturbance due to hysteria	A 23-year-old male complained of loss of peripheral visual field and everything having purple shadows in the afternoon. This had lasted for 3 years but he had paid little attention to the symptoms. Investigations, including visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure, pupil reflex, and anterior and posterior segment of the eyes, were normal. He denied ocular pain, history of head injury, epilepsy or related family history. The Goldmann perimeter and tangent screen examinations showed a bilateral constricted tubular visual field defect within the central 10° and steep margins. Tracing his past social history, he had been in jail for 3 months. He also complained his work was hard and caused him tension. The visual symptoms were a functional disturbance, not an organic disorder. We diagnosed him with hysterical functional visual disturbance. Hysteria, or conversion disorder, has long been a puzzling and fascinating problem in psychology and ophthalmology. The mechanism and reasons for hysteria are still not clear. The tangent screen is useful in diagnosis. The constricted tubular, spiral or star-shaped visual fields with steep slopes are specific findings in hysteria. We suggest that ophthalmologists should treat patients with psychogenic symptoms, using suggestion, patience and reassurance.

36549016718	Alport syndrome with recurrent herpes simplex virus keratitis	PURPOSE: To report a case of Alport syndrome with recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. METHODS: Case report and review of the literature. RESULTS: A 29-year-old man with Alport syndrome suffered from 4 consecutive episodes of HSV keratitis within 2 years. A type IV collagen defect in basement membranes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alport syndrome. The relationship between HSV keratitis and Alport syndrome is discussed. After remission from HSV keratitis, the patient underwent bilateral phacoemulsification and posterior-chamber intraocular lens implantation for anterior lenticonus and an anterior polar cataract. After surgery, the uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. CONCLUSIONS: We assume that the underlying basement membrane defects in Alport syndrome may account for the recurrent episodes of HSV keratitis in this patient. In addition, phacoemulsification and posterior-chamber intraocular lens implantation, rather than correction of refractive errors, provide a safe and efficient therapeutic choice for the management of anterior lenticonus, with or without associated cataract in patients with Alport syndrome. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

38549102604	Photoreceptor protection against light damage by AAV-mediated overexpression of heme oxygenase-1	PURPOSE. To investigate whether overexpression of the cytoprotective gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in photoreceptors by gene delivery attenuates cellular injury caused by intense light damage and to document the possible mechanisms of protection. METHODS. Recombinant adeno-associated virus type 5 (rAAV5) expressing the mouse HO-1 gene (mHO-1) was delivered to cyclic-light reared Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by subretinal injection. Three weeks after transfer of HO-1 gene, animals were subjected to 2-hour intense light exposure then were returned to darkness. Expression of HO-1, p53, p38, and cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) at different times after intense light damage was evaluated by Western blot analysis. HO-1 transgene expression, along with expression of c-fos and bcl-2, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the protective effects of HO-1 were evaluated by determining the morphology of the retina. Finally, apoptosis in photoreceptors was measured using TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL) 24 hours after photic injury. RESULTS. Exogenous administration of HO-1 by gene transfer led to HO-1 transgene expression in photoreceptors. Protection of retina by HO-1 overexpression is evident from the partially preserved retina structure and attenuated apoptosis in photoreceptors after photic injury. Concurrently, overexpression of HO-1 was associated with a decrease in the expression of c-fos and p53, an increase in the activation of p38 and bcl-2, and preserved the expression of c-FLIP. CONCLUSIONS. Overexpression of HO-1 in photoreceptors protected themselves from subsequent cellular damage caused by intense light exposure. The anti-apoptotic mechanisms of HO-1 may be related to the induction of p38, bcl-2, and c-FLIP and to the suppression of c-fos and p53.

34248559909	Pediatric microbial keratitis in Taiwanese children: A review of hospital cases	Objective: To study the clinical and microbiological characteristics of pediatric microbial keratitis in Taiwan. Methods: The medical records of 81 eyes with microbial keratitis in 78 children aged 16 years or younger who were diagnosed and treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, from July 1, 1998, through December 31, 2002, were retrospectively reviewed. Predisposing factors, microbial culture results, clinical course, and visual outcomes were analyzed. Results: Predisposing factors were contact lens wear (33 cases [40.7%]), trauma (17 cases [21.0%]), ocular disease (12 cases [14.8%]), and systemic disease (9 cases [11.1%]). Eight of the 33 contact lenses were rigid gas-permeable lenses that were worn overnight for orthokeratology. Forty-seven (58.0%) of the 81 eyes were culture positive. The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21 eyes [44.7%]) and Staphylococcus aureus (9 eyes [19.1%]). Twelve (14.8%) of the 81 eyes required surgical intervention. Of the 68 eyes that had a best-corrected visual acuity available at the last follow-up, 33 eyes achieved best-corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better. Conclusions: Predisposing factors for pediatric infectious keratitis vary with age. In the teenage years, the most predominant risk factor is contact lens wear. Infectious keratitis resultant from overnight orthokeratology lenses should receive particular attention. Parents of children who consider overnight orthokeratology should evaluate the benefit of temporary myopia reduction and the risk of infection. Identification of predisposing factors and microorganisms may be helpful for early recognition and treatment of pediatric microbial keratitis. ©2007 American Medical Association.

41149108659	Herpes simplex virus and pterygium in Taiwan	PURPOSE: To evaluate the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pterygia to study the possible association between HSV and pterygia in Taiwan, a tropical country with a high prevalence of pterygium. METHODS: Sixty-five pterygia, 10 normal conjunctiva, 8 conjunctival nevi, and 2 malignant conjunctival melanomas were obtained. Clinical histories were recorded for each patient. HSV detection was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral sequences. HSV-positive specimens underwent subsequent DNA in situ hybridization. Results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: By using polymerase chain reaction, HSV was detected in 3 (5%) pterygia, and no conjunctival control displayed HSV. All 3 HSV-positive pterygia studies were DNA in situ hybridization negative. There was no statistically significant correlation between pterygium and the presence of HSV. CONCLUSIONS: HSV is not associated with pterygium formation in Taiwan; the pathogenesis of pterygia is still incompletely understood. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

41449088181	Primary intraocular lens implantation for unilateral idiopathic cataract in children	Background: To examine the efficacy of intraocular lens implantation on visual rehabilitation and ocular growth in children with unilateral idiopathic cataracts. Methods: Preoperative characteristics, visual outcome and postoperative refraction change were analyzed through a retrospective study of the charts of children who underwent cataract removal and primary intraocular lens implantation for unilateral idiopathic cataracts between 1994 and 2003. Results: Thirty-one children were included in this study. Preoperatively, 83% of the eyes with cataracts had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of less than 20/200. Posterior subcapsular opacity was the most common type of cataract. The average age at surgery was 66.8 months (range 14-115 months) and the mean follow-up was 43.4 months (range 12-117 months). At the final visit, there was no significant difference in refractive development between the pseudophakic eyes and the fellow eyes of the subjects. Sixty percent of the pseudophakic eyes had a BCVA of 20/200 or better and 37% had a BCVA of 20/60 or better. Preoperative visual acuity was the only significant factor related to visual outcome. Conclusion: Primary intraocular lens implantation in children with unilateral idiopathic cataracts is an effective treatment for visual rehabilitation. The refractive development of the pseudophakic eyes was not significantly different from the fellow eyes.

62549131125	A different approach to assess resident phacoemulsification learning curve: Analysis of both completion and complication rates	Purpose: To assess phacoemulsification learning curve by analysing residents' surgical completion and complication rates. Methods: This prospective study included 226 cases of phacoemulsification performed by 11 senior residents under a single supervisor during a 27-month period. Both completion and complication rates were collected to assess their surgical results. 'Short-term completion rate (STCR)', the frequency of the surgeries completed exclusively by the residents during every five consecutive cases, was used in the evaluation of the learning curve parameter. Results: These residents could complete phacoemulsification independently in 101 surgeries (44.7%). Intraoperative complications occurred in 62 cases (27.4%), of which 11 cases were complicated with vitreous loss (4.9%). By tracing different residents' individual STCRs, we found that the learning curve for phacoemulsification surgery to be of an exponential pattern, and the first STCR of 60% to be a good representation of the exponential point. Before the residents' first STCR of 60%, their average completion rate was only 16.7% and complication rate was as high as 39.2%. While after that point, the average completion rate accelerated to 76.4% and complication rate decreased to 14.2%. Conclusion: The learning curve of phacoemulsification is of an exponential pattern and the trainees' STCR can be a useful parameter to evaluate their surgical performance. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

66049111280	Prognostic indicators of open globe injuries in children	Purpose: To determine the prognostic indicators of visual outcome in children with open globe injuries. Basic procedures: The charts of 62 patients, 16 years of age or younger, who had been treated for open globe injuries were reviewed. Main findings: The types of injury included penetrating (30 eyes), rupture (20 eyes), intraocular foreign body (10 eyes), and perforation (2 eyes). Sharp objects, such as knives or scissors, were the most common causes of open globe injuries. A visual acuity (VA) of at least 20/40 was achieved in 80.8% (21/26) of eyes with a corneal injury only, in 45.5% (5/11) of eyes with additional lens damage, and in 17.4% (4/23) of eyes with extensive anterior and posterior injuries. Conclusions: Unfavorable outcomes were related to the location of injury, the extent of injury, the initial presentation of hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, retina detachment, cornea wound across the pupil, and the development of endophthalmitis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67149139342	Pediatric herpes simplex virus keratitis	PURPOSE: To report the clinical characteristics and visual outcomes of pediatric herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis. METHODS: The medical records of 29 patients younger than 16 years with HSV keratitis who were diagnosed and treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, between 1996 and 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnosis of HSV keratitis was proven by a positive viral culture and/or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction or by a clear history of dendritic keratitis or herpetic kerato-uveitis. Type of HSV keratitis, recurrence rate, and visual outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: The average age at the entry into the study was 5.7 years (range: 7 months to 15 years). Mean follow-up time was 35.3 months (range: 2-69 months). Epithelial keratitis including dendritic and geographic ulcers was noted in 14 eyes, stromal keratitis in 2 eyes, stromal keratitis concurrent with epithelial keratitis in 8 eyes, and endotheliitis in 6 eyes. One patient had sequential involvement of both eyes. Thirteen patients (45%) developed recurrent HSV keratitis after the first documented episode. Female gender (but not age or the type of keratitis) was significantly associated with recurrences. Five patients who were maintained on oral valacyclovir prophylaxis up to 1 year had no recurrence during the period. Fifteen of 21 patients younger than 8 years of age had best-corrected visual acuity available at last follow-up, and 10 patients developed amblyopia. CONCLUSIONS: Children with HSV keratitis are at risk for recurrent keratitis and amblyopia. Prolonged systemic antiviral prophylaxis may help to prevent such consequences. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

67650698249	Transplantation of cultivated oral mucosal epithelial cells for severe corneal burn	Purpose: To access the feasibility of using cultivated oral mucosal epithelial cell transplantation (COMET) for the management of severe corneal burn.MethodsCOMET was performed to promote re-epithelialization in two eyes with acute alkaline burn and one eye with chronic alkaline burn, and to reconstruct the ocular surface in two eyes with chronic thermal burn. Autologous oral mucosal epithelial cells obtained from biopsy were cultivated on amniotic membrane. Immunoconfocal microscopy for keratins and progenitor cell markers was performed to characterize the cultivated epithelial sheet. Following transplantation, the clinical outcome and possible complications were documented. The patients were followed for an averaged 29.63.6 (range: 26-34) months.ResultsCultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet expressed keratin 3, 13, and progenitor cell markers p63, p75, and ABCG2. After COMET, all the corneas became less inflamed, and the corneal surface was completely re-epithelialized in 6.03.2 (range: 3-10) days in all but one patients. Microperforation occurred in one patient, and a small persistent epithelial defect developed in another. Both were solved uneventfully. In all patients, superficial corneal blood vessels invariably developed, and to further improve vision, conjunctivo-limbal autografting (N3) and/or penetrating keratoplasty (N3) were performed subsequently. The vision of all patients showed substantial improvement after additional surgeries.ConclusionsThis study showed the potential of COMET to promote re-epithelialization and reduce inflammation in acute corneal burn, and to reconstruct the corneal surface in chronic burn. COMET may, therefore, be considered an alternative treatment for severe corneal burn. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

70349675743	Matrix revolution: Molecular mechanism for inflammatory corneal neovascularization and restoration of corneal avascularity by epithelial stem cell transplantation	Corneal neovascularization (CNV) associated with severe limbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency remains a challenging ocular surface disease in that corneal inflammation may persist and progress, and the condition will not improve without LSC transplantation. A prominent feature after successful LSC transplantation is the suppression of corneal inflammation and CNV, which is generally attributed to the endogenous anti-angiogenic/anti-inflammatory factors secreted by corneal epithelial cells. In addition, corneal epithelial basement membrane (EBM) plays a unique role in the regulation of angiogenesis; several potent anti-angiogenic factors are derived from the matrix component of EBM, such as endostatin (from collagen XVIII) and restin (from collagen XV). Also, angio-inhibitory thrombospondin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 are deposited in EBM. Moreover, the heparan sulphate proteoglycan in EBM can bind and sequester VEGF and FGF-2 from activation. Recently, cultivated corneal epithelial transplantation (CCET) and cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (COMET) have emerged as promising techniques for the treatment of LSC deficiency. When human limbo-corneal epithelial (HLE) cells are cultivated on cryopreserved amniotic membrane, production of endostatin, restin, and IL-1ra is enhanced. This highlights the significance of delicate epithelial-matrix interactions in the generation of anti-angiogenic/anti-inflammatory factors by HLE cells, and this may, in part, explain the rapid restoration of corneal avascularity following CCET. In addition, whether epithelial stem cells can persist after transplantation is the key for CCET and COMET. Emerging evidence of long-term survival of cultivated epithelial cells after transplantation suggest that epithelial stem cells can be isolated and cultivated in vitro, and can re-establish the epithelial phenotype in vivo. Taken together, the merits of enhanced anti-angiogenic activity and the preservation of corneal epithelial stem cells encourage further application of this tissue engineering technique for ocular surface reconstruction. © 2009 Ethis Communications, Inc.

70350138488	Corneal arcus and cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged subjects in taiwan	BACKGROUND: To delineate the association between corneal arcus and potential cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study randomly enrolled 119 subjects with corneal arcus and 119 subjects without arcus, aged between 30 and 60 years, from community-based East Asian population. Corneal arcus identification was completed by a single ophthalmologist using slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination. Cardiovascular risk factor parameters were measured by standardized techniques. RESULTS: Subjects with higher levels of total-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and total/HDL cholesterol ratio had increased risk of having corneal arcus, whereas subjects with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure had decreased risk. Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, we found that male gender was a strong independent risk factor for arcus formation [odds ratio (OR): 2.87; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59-5.17; P < 0.001]. Higher non-HDL-C level also had significant but mildly increased risk (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02; P 0.008) of having arcus, whereas higher SBP had significant but mildly decreased risk (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-0.99; P < 0.001). Besides, subjects who had circumferential arcus had significantly higher risk of having LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL than those who had only partial arcus (OR: 5.79 versus OR: 4.60; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to serum LDL-C, male gender and serum non-HDL-C level are significantly correlated to corneal arcus. Conversely, SBP is negatively correlated to corneal arcus. Presence of corneal arcus in middle-aged men may be an indicator for dyslipidemia, and we speculate that the relationship between arcus and coronary heart disease may be dependent of dyslipidemia.

72849129442	The effect of low-vision simulators on ophthalmology residents' perception of quality of life	Objective: To evaluate the effect of low-vision simulators on daily activities performed by ophthalmology residents. Design: Experimental study. Participants: Twenty-nine ophthalmology residents. Methods: Four types of low-vision simulators - central loss, peripheral loss, hemianopia, and overall blur - were provided to 29 residents. They wore these simulators while performing daily activities described in the Visual Function-14 (VF-14). Their VF-14 scores after the exercises and the utility values before and after the exercises were analyzed. Results: After the exercises, the residents recorded significantly different utility values in the peripheral loss and overall blur groups. The changes in utility values were similar for the senior and junior residents. On the basis of the mean VF-14 scores of the 4 simulators, the residents considered overall blur to be the most serious visual impairment and hemianopia to be the least. Conclusion: Ophthalmology residents tend to underestimate the impact of visual disability on patients' quality of life. They can gain a better appreciation of such an impact by using low-vision simulators during daily activities.

77649086831	Presence of human papillomavirus in pterygium in Taiwan	Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence and possible role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the formation of pterygia in patients in Taiwan, a tropical country with high prevalence of pterygium. Methods: A total of 62 patients with 65 pterygia were retrospectively examined. Ten normal conjunctiva, 8 conjunctival nevi, and 2 malignant conjunctival melanomas served as controls. HPV detection and typing were accomplished using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the viral sequences. HPV-positive specimens underwent further investigation with fluorescence in situ hybridization. Clinical histories were recorded for each patient. Results: Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, 2 of 65 pterygia harbored HPV type 18, and they were also fluorescence in situ hybridization positive. No conjunctival control had HPV. There was no statistically significant correlation between pterygium and the presence of HPV. The presence of HPV was not significantly different between primary and recurrent pterygia. Conclusions: The limited presence of HPV DNA in pterygium does not conclude that HPV is necessary or acting alone in the formation of pterygium, but HPV may still be implicated to play a role in some pterygia in Taiwan. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77949261551	Intravitreal loading injection of ganciclovir with or without adjunctive oral valganciclovir for cytomegalovirus anterior uveitis	Background: A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic results of intravitreal ganciclovir injection as a loading dose with or without the following oral valganciclovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis in immunocompetent patients. Methods: Six consecutive patients in whom active CMV anterior uveitis was detected by polymerase chain reaction assay of the aqueous humor were enrolled between January 2006 and December 2008. These patients received an intravitreal injection of ganciclovir (2 mg/0.05 ml) as a loading dose. Subsequent use of oral valganciclovir (900 mg twice a day) was determined according to the severity of the post-injection aqueous inflammation. Immune status and anterior chamber reaction of individual patients, visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP) at study entry, and follow-up intervals were examined. Results: The mean patient-month follow-up period after intravitreal injection was 14.7 months (range, 12-22 months). Two patients received only the intravitreal ganciclovir injection once and four patients had received the following oral valganciclovir for average 2.3 months (range, 1-4 months). With this treatment strategy, the best-corrected visual acuity of the patients improved or stabilized; the IOP and the inflammation of anterior chamber of the patients were well controlled at all time points and there were no treatment-associated complications by the end of follow-up. Conclusions: In patients with CMV anterior uveitis, intravitreal ganciclovir injection as a loading dose with or without the following oral valganciclovir can control the inflammation and IOP well. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77950606017	Iron foreign body in the optic nerve without ocular siderosis	Background And Purpose An intraocular iron foreign body may cause many ocular complications, sometimes even blindness. Therefore, if possible, it should be removed to avoid ocular siderosis. We report a case in which a foreign body was trapped in the optic nerve and could not be removed. After a 2-year follow-up, no ocular siderosis or progressive deterioration in vision was found. This is the first case report of a foreign body in the optic nerve behind the eyeball in the PubMed literature. METHODS The authors describe the case of a 33-year-old man with an ocular trauma history at work. A metal iron foreign body was trapped in the optic nerve behind the eyeball, which was demonstrated by computed tomography. RESULTS There was no significant vision change and ocular siderosis by electroretinogram after 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Intra-optic-nerve foreign body may have a better ocular prognosis. Siderosis may not be seen in patients with optic nerve iron foreign body. Intraocular foreign body should be accurately studied before surgical procedures. © 2009 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.

77957337220	Retinal protection from acute glaucoma-induced ischemia-reperfusion injury through pharmacologic induction of heme oxygenase-1	PURPOSE. To investigate the protective effects of cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a potent heme oxygenase (HO)-1 inducer, in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury and to document the possible antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms underlying the protection. METHODS. Rats pretreated with intraperitoneal injection of CoPP (5 mg/kg) were subjected to retinal ischemia by increases in intraocular pressure to 130 mm Hg for 60 minutes. The protective effects of CoPP were evaluated by determining the morphology of the retina, counting the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and measuring apoptosis in retinal layers. In addition, expressions of HO-1, caspase-3, p53, Bcl-xL, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were documented by Western blot analysis. Detection of HO-1, NF-κB, and CD68 protein in the retina was performed by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. RESULTS. Pharmacologic induction of HO-1 by CoPP led to HO-1 expression in the full retinal layer. HO-1 overexpression alleviated apoptosis in the retina, preserved RGCs, and attenuated the reduction of inner retinal thickness after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Concurrently, overexpression of HO-1 was associated with inhibition of caspase-3, p53, NF-κB, and iNOS and with increased expression of Bcl-xL. Meanwhile, the anti-inflammatory effect of HO-1 was related to reduction in the recruitment of macrophage infiltration in the retina through the suppression of MCP-1. These beneficial effects of HO-1 induced by CoPP were diminished by the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP. CONCLUSIONS. Overexpression of HO-1 by pharmacologic induction protected the retina from subsequent cellular damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury through antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

79951720963	The validity of clinical feature profiles for cytomegaloviral anterior segment infection	Background: Anterior segment cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which can be presented as anterior uveitis and corneal endotheliitis, has recently been reported in immunocompetent patients. We would like to access the validity of two presumed characteristic clinical profiles: profile 1, non-herpes simplex virus (HSV)/varicella zoster virus (VZV) corticosteroid-recalcitrant inflammatory ocular hypertensive syndrome (IOHS), and profile 2, corneal endotheliitis with specific coin-shaped keratic precipitates (KPs), that could be helpful in identifying CMV anterior segment intraocular infection. Methods: Patients with either profile 1 or profile 2 or both were enrolled consecutively from the uveitis service in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, between January 1, 2006 and May 31, 2010. Diagnostic anterior chamber tapping was performed and followed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect herpesviridae DNA including HSV I and II, VZV, CMV, and Epstein-Barr virus. Results: Thirty-one eyes of 30 patients (21 males and nine females) were enrolled in this study. CMV DNA PCR was positive in 29 eyes of 28 patients (20 males and eight females). Nineteen of 20 eyes (19 patients) in profile 1 had positive CMV PCR. Ten of 11 eyes (11 patients) in profile 2 had positive CMV PCR. The positive predictive value of profile 1 and profile 2 was 94.7% and 90.9%, respectively. The positive predictive value of combining the two profiles was 93.3%. Conclusions: Non-HSV/ZVZ corticosteroid-recalcitrant IOHS and corneal endotheliitis with specific coin-shaped KPs could be used as the screening tool for CMV anterior segment intraocular infection. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79951768435	Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium as a corticosteroid-sparing agent for the treatment of autoimmune scleritis	Purpose: To evaluate enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in the treatment of autoimmune scleritis. Methods: A retrospective, interventional, noncomparative review of EC-MPS use in patients with autoimmune scleritis. Results: Seven eyes of 5 patients (all female; median age: 47 years, range: 20-55 years) with inflammatory scleral disease were treated with EC-MPS. The mean follow-up duration was 16.4 months (range, 12-20 months). EC-MPS was started at 360 mg twice daily. The mean time to treatment success was 1.6 months (range, 1-3 months). The mean prednisolone dosage at the onset of EC-MPS was 24 mg daily (range, 15-30 mg), and this was reduced to 6.5 mg daily (range, 0-10 mg) as inflammation control was achieved. No severe adverse events except for 1 patient with transient knee pain were reported; the incidence of adverse events after using EC-MPS was 1/6.83 person-years. There was no recurrence of scleral inflammation during the follow-up period. Conclusions: EC-MPS can be used as a corticosteroid-sparing agent to safely suppress inflammatory autoimmune scleritis.

79952165559	Association of severity of conjunctival and corneal calcification with all-cause 1-year mortality in maintenance haemodialysis patients	Background: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is the most common form of metastatic calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The aim of this study is to investigate if severity of CCC correlates with vascular calcification and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients.Methods. One hundred and nine MHD patients were recruited. CCC was evaluated by external eye photographs, and was graded and scored according to modified Porter and Crombie classification system described by Tokuyama et al. Chest X-ray examination was used to evaluate aortic arch calcification. Geographic, haematological, biochemical and dialysis-related data were obtained. The patients were analysed for traditional and non-traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease stratified by severity of CCC. All patients were followed up for 1 year to investigate the risks for mortality.Results. Forty-three, 35 and 31 patients had mild (scores ≤ 4), moderate and severe (scores < 9) CCC at baseline, respectively. With trend estimation, patients with severe CCC had a significantly higher percentage of severe aortic arch calcification. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that hypertension, haemodialysis duration and corrected calcium level were associated with scores of CCC in MHD patients. Moreover, age, corrected calcium-phosphate level, and moderate and severe CCC were associated with grades of aortic arch calcification. At 1-year follow-up, 11 of 109 (10.1%) patients had died. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that age, corrected calcium and severe CCC were significant risk factors for all-cause 1-year mortality in MHD patients. Each increment of one score of CCC is associated with a 26.4% increased risk for all-cause mortality.Conclusions. Severity of CCC, which is easily obtained at bedside, acts as an independent predictor for all-cause 1-year mortality in MHD patients. © The Author 2011.

0036067088	Surgical management of scleral perforation after pterygium excision	OBJECTIVE: Scleral perforation is a rare complication occurring after pterygium excision often leading to scleral ulceration and loss of vision. Our purpose is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of tenonplasty and amniotic membrane transplantation in the management of scleral perforation after pterygium excision. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on patients with scleral perforation after pterygium excision that underwent tenonplasty and amniotic membrane transplantation at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 1997 to 1999 and followed up for at least 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: There were 6 patients, 1 male and 5 females ranging in ages from 46 to 71 years (mean, 63.3). The interval between pterygium excisions to scleral perforation ranged from 3 to 20 years. There were no recurrences during the follow-up period of 12 to 24 months (average, 18.3 months). CONCLUSIONS: Tenonplasty and amniotic membrane transplantation appears to be a relatively simple, safe, and effective method for treating scleral perforation after pterygium excision.

80054688275	Down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate prevented retinal ganglion cell death after transection of optic nerve in rats	Purpose: To investigate the effects of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) inhibitor, on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and MMP-mediated apoptosis in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following the transection of the optic nerve (ON) in rats. Materials and Methods: The ON of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats was transected. The expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB was measured by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis following transection. In situ zymography was also performed to localize gelatinolytic activity in the retinas. PDTC was injected intravitreally immediately following transection of the ON to evaluate the effect on the expression of NF-κB and MMP as well as its anti-apoptotic effect and neuroprotective effect on RGCs. Results: Significant up-regulation of MMP-9, and NF-κB was observed 7 days post-transection; however, this was not observed for MMP-2. PDTC at concentrations of 0.5mM suppressed the up-regulation of MMP-9 and NF-κB, inhibiting gelatinolytic activity in the RGC layer. Meanwhile, far fewer apoptotic RGCs were detected and more surviving RGCs were preserved in PDTC-treated retinas 7 days post-transection compared to retinas in the control group. However, this kind of neuroprotective effect was not significant at 14 days post-transection. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that PDTC, mediated in part through the down-regulation of MMP-9, could contribute to delaying the death of RGCs following transection of the ON. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

80955159623	Clinical characteristics of optic neuritis in Taiwanese children	PurposeTo document the etiology, clinical presentation, and visual prognosis of optic neuritis in Taiwanese children.MethodsRetrospectively reviewed children younger than 18 years old with optic neuritis in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung Childrens Hospital from 1998 to 2009.ResultsThere were 24 children (38 eyes) with optic neuritis in that period. Overall, 14 patients (58.3%) were female and 10 patients (41.7%) were male. In total, 14 patients (58.3%) had bilateral involvement, and 10 patients (41.7%) had unilateral involvement. Out of 38 eyes, 24 (63.2%) had disc swelling. Out of 24 patients, 21 (87.5%) underwent intravenous steroid therapy (10 to 30 mg/kg/day) for 3-5 days, and followed by an oral taper. Out of 24 patients, 20 (83.3%) achieved final visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or better. However, a poor visual outcome (four patients) (VA<20/40) was correlated with pale disc at presentation (P=0.002, Pearson χ

84857924529	Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ocular infection: A 10-year hospital-based study	Purpose: To characterize the patient demographics, clinical features, and antibiotic susceptibility of ocular infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), including community-associated (CA) and healthcare-associated (HA) isolates. Design: Retrospective, observational study. Participants: Patients (n = 519) with culture-proven S. aureus ocular infections seen between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2008, in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Methods: Data collected included patient demographics and clinical information. Antibiotic susceptibility was verified by disc diffusion method. Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of MRSA in S. aureus ocular infections and the clinical characteristics, diagnoses, and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of CA-MRSA versus HA-MRSA ocular infections. Results: We identified 274 patients with MRSA ocular infections, which comprised 181 CA-MRSA and 93 HA-MRSA isolates. The average rate of MRSA in S. aureus infections was 52.8% with a stable trend, whereas the annual ratio of CA-MRSA in ocular MRSA infections averaged 66.1% and tended to increase over the 10-year interval. Patients with ocular CA-MRSA were younger. Lid and lacrimal system disorders were more common, but keratitis, endophthalmitis, and wound infection were less common among CA-MRSA cases than HA-MRSA cases. Both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA isolates were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin, but CA-MRSA was more susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Conclusions: Community-associated MRSA is an important pathogen of ocular infections; CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA ocular infections differ demographically and clinically, but both strains were multi-resistant in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, one of the biggest referral centers in Taiwan. In a country with a high prevalence of MRSA, ophthalmologists should be aware of such epidemiologic information.

84862933523	Up-regulation of heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1) in human limbo-corneal epithelial cells cultivated on amniotic membrane: A proteomic study	Transplantation of cultivated human limbo-corneal epithelial (HLE) cells has been recognized as an effective stem cell (SC) therapy for treating corneal epithelial SC deficiency caused by burn or other diseases. With this technique, cryo-preserved human intact amniotic membrane (IAM) has been successfully used as a cell culture substrate and carrier, and is reported to preferentially preserve HLE stem/progenitor cells in vitro. However, little is known about what factors released by HLE cells are involved in the progenitor cell-preserving mechanism. Using proteomic method, we identified 13 proteins over-expressed by HLE cells cultured on IAM, which included heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1), Hsp-27, glutathione (GSH) S-transferase, annexin A2, galectin-7, and protein S100-A9. Increased Hsp70-1 expression was confirmed by Western blot and real-time PCR. The role of Hsp70-1 in promoting HLE cell survival was demonstrated by increased apoptosis index and increased cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (CPARP) formation in hsp70-1-silenced, but not normal HLE cells after exposure to sublethal UVB irradiation or hydrogen peroxide. To understand the regulatory mechanism of Hsp70-1 expression in HLE cells, the role of transcription factor deltaNp63 (a well-recognized HLE stem cell; SC marker) was studied. We found that over-expression of deltaNp63α by plasmid vector induced a corresponding increase in Hsp70-1 protein production. Likewise, Hsp70-1 expression decreased in HLE cells after addition of deltaNp63α SiRNA. Immunoconfocal microscopy also revealed a paralleled expression of both proteins in corneal specimens. Thus, deltaNp63α-associated Hsp70-1 over-expression may promote HLE progenitor cell survival on IAM, possibly through the cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effect of Hsp70-1. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84864653620	Staphylococcus aureus Ocular infection: Methicillin-resistance, clinical features, and antibiotic susceptibilities	Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is an important public health issue. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of ocular infections caused by MRSA and to identify the clinical characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility of ocular MRSA infections by comparing those of ocular methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) infections. Methodology/Principal Findings: The medical records of the patients (n = 519) with culture-proven S. aureus ocular infections seen between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2008 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Two hundred and seventy-four patients with MRSA and 245 with MSSA ocular infections were identified. The average rate of MRSA in S. aureus infections was 52.8% and the trend was stable over the ten years (P value for trend = 0.228). MRSA ocular infections were significantly more common among the patients with healthcare exposure (P = 0.024), but 66.1% (181/274) patients with MRSA ocular infections had no healthcare exposure. The most common clinical presentation for both MRSA and MSSA ocular infections was keratitis; MRSA and MSSA caused a similar disease spectrum except for lid infections. MRSA was significantly more resistant than MSSA to clindamycin, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (all P<0.001). Conclusions/significance: We demonstrated a paralleled trend of ocular MRSA infection in a highly prevalent MRSA country by hospital-based survey. Except for lid disorder, MRSA shared similar spectrum of ocular pathology with MSSA. Since S. aureus is a common ocular pathogen, our results raise clinician's attention to the existence of highly prevalent MRSA. © 2012 Chuang et al.

0036809246	Reversal of optic disc cupping after trabeculotomy in primary congenital glaucoma	Background: The phenomenon of reversal of glaucomatous cupping of the optic disc following lowering of the intraocular pressure (IOP) was originally recognized in infants. We evaluated the change in optic disc cupping with normalization of the IOP after trabeculotomy in primary congenital glaucoma and assessed the factors associated with reversal of cupping. Methods: We reviewed the records of 17 patients (24 eyes) who underwent trabeculotomy between July 1993 and June 1999 and who had been followed for at least 1 year. Surgical success was defined as IOP less than 22 mm Hg without anti-glaucoma medication, stable or reduced optic disc cupping, and lack of further corneal enlargement disproportionate to normal growth. Patients who required more than one surgical procedure to control the IOP and those with cloudy media that precluded documentation of cupping were excluded from analysis. Optic disc cupping was assessed independently before and after surgery by two clinicians. The cup:disc ratio was estimated as the percentage of surface area of the optic disc occupied by cupping in the vertical axis. We accepted a difference of 0.1 or 0.2 in the cup:disc ratio between the two observers in each subjective assessment and used the mean value of the two results for data analysis. If the difference was more than 0.2, the eye was excluded from further study. Results: Of the 17 patients 4 were excluded: 2 because they received antiglaucoma medication to control the IOP postoperatively, 1 because he underwent more than one surgical procedure to control the IOP during follow-up, and 1 owing to disagreement in the assessment of the cup:disc ratio between the two observers. Eighteen eyes of 13 patients were thus included in the analysis. Twelve eyes were from boys and six, from girls. The patients were followed for a mean of 43.2 (standard deviation [SD] 30.4) months (range 12 to 90 months). The mean cup:disc ratios pre- and postoperatively were 0.74 (SD 0.20) and 0.60 (SD 0.21) respectively (p = 0.003). Of the 18 eyes 11 (61.1%) had documented reduction in optic disc cupping. The mean time to stabilization of cupping reversal was 4.8 (SD 2.8) months (range 2 to 12 months). In multivariable analysis the age of the patient at surgery was the only variable significantly associated with reversal of cupping (p = 0.027). The mean age at surgery for the 11 eyes with reduction in cupping was 6.9 (range 3 to 15) months, compared with 23.4 (range 12 to 42) months for the 7 eyes with unchanged cupping. The mean preoperative cup:disc ratio was 0.67 (SD 0.17) in the former group and 0.83 (SD 0.17) in the latter group. Six of the seven eyes with unchanged cupping had advanced cupping. Interpretation: Optic disc cupping can be reversed at an early stage of primary congenital glaucoma following successful reduction of IOP. Younger age at surgery was associated with reversal of cupping.

0038102591	Nuclear sclerotic cataract in young patients in Taiwan	Purpose: To document the clinical features of discrete nuclear sclerosis in young patients. Setting: Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China. Methods: The medical records of all patients younger than 45 years with nuclear sclerosis who had cataract surgery at 1 hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with congenital cataract, ocular trauma, ocular disease in addition to myopia, and systemic disease associated with cataract were excluded. The patients' age, sex, bilateral lens status, axial length, original and preoperative refractive status, and preoperative and postoperative best corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) were recorded. Results: Fifty-five eyes of 35 patients aged 32 to 45 years met the study criteria. Nuclear sclerotic cataract was bilateral in 20 patients. The mean age at surgery was 40.64 years ± 3.63 (SD). The mean refraction before the development of cataract was -7.80 ± 3.57 diopters (D) and the mean preoperative refraction, -17.40 ± 6.05 D. The mean axial length was 28.09 ± 2.31 mm. The postoperative BCVA was 20/22 or better in 53 eyes (96.4%). Conclusions: In patients younger than 45 years with cataract in Taiwan, nuclear sclerosis was not a rare cause of visual loss and axial myopia was strongly associated with the formation of nuclear sclerosis. Bilateral sclerosis was observed in most cases. Patients with an axial length greater than 27.0 mm had the greatest risk. Surgical treatment was therapeutic. © 2003 ASCRS and ESCRS.

0347418919	Combination of Adult Inclusion Conjunctivitis and Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma in a Young Adult	Purpose: To report a patient who was diagnosed with combined adult inclusion conjunctivitis (AIC) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Methods: This is a case report. Results: An 18-year-old male patient presented with chronic conjunctivitis and giant follicles. Evaluation by chlamydial antigen assay was positive. Conjunctival biopsy for the immunohistochemical stain and polymerase chain reaction of the left eye showed MALT lymphoma. Conclusions: MALT lymphoma can masquerade as other ocular surface diseases. Chlamydial infection causes chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva. Both of these diseases should be considered as a differential diagnosis of refractory follicular conjunctivitis. It is worthy of further study to determine whether chronic inflammation resulting from chlamydial infection increases the risk of MALT lymphoma or it is coincidental.

1242336990	Clinical Experience with the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve Implant in Complicated Glaucoma	Background: To assess clinical outcomes of the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant, an aqueous shunting device with a unidirectional valve mechanism, in eyes with refractory glaucoma. Methods: Consecutive patients with intractable glaucoma who underwent Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion were retrospectively reviewed. Only patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up were included. The presence of intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 22 mmHg in the first 6 postoperative months was defined as a hypertensive phase (HP). This study included 19 eyes in 19 patients. Results: The mean preoperative IOP was 32.1±6.9 mmHg, with medication (mean times medication administered, 3.8±1.0; range, 0-3). The mean postoperative IOP was 7.8±2.2 mmHg on day 1, 11.3±4.4 mmHg at 1 week, 19.1± 7.7 mm Hg at 1 month, 16.5±6.4 mmHg at 3 months, and 17.5±0.7 mmHg at 6 months, respectively. Twelve patients (63.2%) exhibited the HP. Nine patients (49.3%) experienced the HP at 1 month and 3 patients at 2 months after the operation. At the end of 6 months of follow-up, 11 patients (57.9%) who had exhibited the HP required additional anti-glaucoma medication to control the IOP (mean times medication was administered, 1.0±1.1; range, 0-2). Complications associated with the valve included hyphema in 1 case, choroidal effusion in 2 cases, iris plugging of the tube in 1 case, bleb encapsulation in 3 cases, and PK graft failure in 1 case. Postoperative hypotony resolved within 1 week. Conclusion: The Ahmed glaucoma valve implant was safe and effective in this series. The hypertensive phase peaked in the first to second months after surgery.
