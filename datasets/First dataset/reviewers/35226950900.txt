20144388935	φ Meson production in Au + Au and p + p collisions at 	We report the STAR measurement of φ meson production in Au+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV. Using the event mixing technique, the φ spectra and yields are obtained at mid-rapidity for five centrality bins in Au+Au collisions and for non-singly-diffractive p+p collisions. It is found that the φ transverse momentum distributions from Au+Au collisions are better fitted with a single-exponential while the p+p spectrum is better described by a double-exponential distribution. The measured nuclear modification factors indicate that φ production in central Au+Au collisions is suppressed relative to peripheral collisions when scaled by the number of binary collisions (〈Nbin〉). The systematics of 〈pt〉 versus centrality and the constant φ/K- ratio versus beam species, centrality, and collision energy rule out kaon coalescence as the dominant mechanism for φ production. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

21044449751	Experimental and theoretical challenges in the search for the quark-gluon plasma: The STAR Collaboration's critical assessment of the evidence from RHIC collisions	We review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus-nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on results from the STAR experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au + Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark-gluon matter has been produced at RHIC. © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

26944440542	Azimuthal anisotropy in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	The results from the STAR Collaboration on directed flow (v1), elliptic flow (v2), and the fourth harmonic (v4) in the anisotropic azimuthal distribution of particles from Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV are summarized and compared with results from other experiments and theoretical models. Results for identified particles are presented and fit with a blast-wave model. Different anisotropic flow analysis methods are compared and nonflow effects are extracted from the data. For v2, scaling with the number of constituent quarks and parton coalescence are discussed. For v4, scaling with v22 and quark coalescence are discussed. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144446656	Multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions of photons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4GeV	We present the first measurement of pseudorapidity distribution of photons in the region 2.3≤η≤3.7 for different centralities in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4GeV. We find that the photon yield scales with the number of participating nucleons at all collision centralities studied. The pseudorapidity distribution of photons, dominated by π0 decays, has been compared to those of charged pions, photons, and inclusive charged particles from heavy-ion and nucleon-nucleon collisions at various energies. The photon production has been shown to be consistent with the energy and centrality independent limiting fragmentation scenario. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144486155	K(892)* resonance production in Au+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV	The short-lived K(892)* resonance provides an efficient tool to probe properties of the hot and dense medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We report measurements of K* in sNN=200GeV Au+Au and p+p collisions reconstructed via its hadronic decay channels K(892) *0→Kπ and K(892)*±→KS0π± using the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The K*0 mass has been studied as a function of pT in minimum bias p+p and central Au+Au collisions. The K*pT spectra for minimum bias p+p interactions and for Au+Au collisions in different centralities are presented. The K*/K yield ratios for all centralities in Au+Au collisions are found to be significantly lower than the ratio in minimum bias p+p collisions, indicating the importance of hadronic interactions between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs. A significant nonzero K*0 elliptic flow (v2) is observed in Au+Au collisions and is compared to the KS0 and Λ v2. The nuclear modification factor of K* at intermediate pT is similar to that of KS0 but different from Λ. This establishes a baryon-meson effect over a mass effect in the particle production at intermediate pT (2<pT≤4GeV/c). © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144507972	Event-wise pt fluctuations in Au-Au collisions at sNN=130 GeV	We present the first large-acceptance measurement of event-wise mean transverse momentum ?pt? fluctuations for Au-Au collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-momentum collision energy sNN = 130 GeV. The observed nonstatistical ?pt?fluctuations substantially exceed in magnitude fluctuations expected from the finite number of particles produced in a typical collision. The r.m.s. fractional width excess of the event-wise ?pt?distribution is 13.7±0.1(stat) ±1.3(syst)% relative to a statistical reference, for the 15% most-central collisions and for charged hadrons within pseudorapidity range |η|<1,2π azimuth, and 0.15≤pt≤2 GeV/c. The width excess varies smoothly but nonmonotonically with collision centrality and does not display rapid changes with centrality which might indicate the presence of critical fluctuations. The reported ?pt? fluctuation excess is qualitatively larger than those observed at lower energies and differs markedly from theoretical expectations. Contributions to ?pt? fluctuations from semihard parton scattering in the initial state and dissipation in the bulk colored medium are discussed. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144524094	Multistrange baryon elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	We report on the first measurement of elliptic flow ν2(pT) of multistrange baryons Ξ-+Ξ̄+ and Ω-+Ω̄+ in heavy-ion collisions. In minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV, a significant amount of elliptic flow, comparable to other nonstrange baryons, is observed for multistrange baryons which are expected to be particularly sensitive to the dynamics of the partonic stage of heavy-ion collisions. The pT dependence of ν2 of the multistrange baryons confirms the number of constituent quark scaling previously observed for lighter hadrons. These results support the idea that a substantial fraction of the observed collective motion is developed at the early partonic stage in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

28844459491	Distributions of charged hadrons associated with high transverse momentum particles in pp and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Charged hadrons in 0.15<p⊥<4GeV/c associated with particles of p⊥trig>4GeV/c are reconstructed in pp and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The associated multiplicity and p⊥ magnitude sum are found to increase from pp to central Au+Au collisions. The associated p⊥ distributions, while similar in shape on the nearside, are significantly softened on the awayside in central Au+Au relative to pp and not much harder than that of inclusive hadrons. The results, consistent with jet quenching, suggest that the awayside fragments approach equilibration with the medium traversed. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

We observe correlations decreasing with centrality that are similar at all four incident energies. The correlations multiplied by the multiplicity density increase with incident energy, and the centrality dependence may show evidence of processes such as thermalization, jet production, or the saturation of transverse flow. The square root of the correlations divided by the event-wise average transverse momentum per event shows little or no beam energy dependence and generally agrees with previous measurements made at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

We observe correlation structures not predicted by theory but consistent with evolution of hadron emission geometry with increasing centrality from one-dimensional fragmentation of color strings along the beam direction to an at least two-dimensional hadronization geometry along the beam and azimuth directions of a hadron-opaque bulk medium. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33745549985	Minijet deformation and charge-independent angular correlations on momentum subspace (η,) in Au-Au collisions at sNN=130 GeV	Measurements of two-particle correlations on angular difference variables η1-η2 (pseudorapidity) and 1- 2 (azimuth) are presented for all primary charged hadrons with transverse momentum 0.15≤pt≤2 GeV/c and |η|≤1.3 from Au-Au collisions at sNN=130 GeV. Large-amplitude correlations are observed over a broad range in relative angles where distinct structures appear on the same-side and away-side (i.e., relative azimuth less than π/2 or greater than π/2). The principal correlation structures include that associated with elliptic flow plus a strong, same-side peak. It is hypothesized that the latter results from correlated hadrons associated with semi-hard parton scattering in the early stage of the heavy-ion collision which produces a jet-like correlation peak at small relative angles. The width of the jet-like peak on η1-η2 increases by a factor 2.3 from peripheral to central collisions, suggesting strong coupling of semi-hard scattered partons to a longitudinally-expanding medium. The new methods of jet analysis introduced here provide access to scattered partons at low transverse momentum well below the kinematic range where perturbative quantum chromodynamics and standard fragmentation models are applicable. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33747374836	Multiplicity dependence of inclusive pt spectra from p-p collisions at s=200GeV	We report measurements of transverse momentum pt spectra for ten event multiplicity classes of p-p collisions at s=200GeV. By analyzing the multiplicity dependence we find that the spectrum shape can be decomposed into a part with amplitude proportional to multiplicity and described by a Lévy distribution on transverse mass mt, and a part with amplitude proportional to multiplicity squared and described by a Gaussian distribution on transverse rapidity yt. The functional forms of the two parts are nearly independent of event multiplicity. The two parts can be identified with the soft and hard components of a two-component model of p-p collisions. This analysis then provides the first isolation of the hard component of the pt spectrum as a distribution of simple form on yt. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33749986786	Forward neutral pion production in p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Measurements of the production of forward Ï€0 mesons from p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN=200â€‰â€‰GeV are reported. The p+p yield generally agrees with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The d+Au yield per binary collision is suppressed as Î• increases, decreasing to â 30% of the p+p yield at = 4.00, well below shadowing expectations. Exploratory measurements of azimuthal correlations of the forward Ï€0 with charged hadrons at 0 show a recoil peak in p+p that is suppressed in d+Au at low pion energy. These observations are qualitatively consistent with a saturation picture of the low-x gluon structure of heavy nuclei. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

In central Au+Au collisions, both and p(p) show significant suppression with respect to binary scaling at pT 4 GeV/c. Protons and antiprotons are less suppressed than ±, in the range 1.5a pT 6 GeV/c. The -/I + and p/p ratios show at most a weak pT dependence and no significant centrality dependence. The p/Ï€ ratios in central Au+Au collisions approach the values in p+p and d+Au collisions at pT 5 GeV/c. The results at high pT indicate that the partonic sources of ±, p, and p have similar energy loss when traversing the nuclear medium. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The proton and lambda source size is inferred from the p-Λ and p̄-Λ̄ correlation functions. It is found to be smaller than the pion source size also measured by the STAR experiment at smaller transverse masses, in agreement with a scenario of a strong universal collective flow. The p-Λ̄ and p̄-Λ correlation functions, which are measured for the first time, exhibit a large anticorrelation. Annihilation channels and/or a negative real part of the spin-averaged scattering length must be included in the final-state interactions calculation to reproduce the measured correlation function. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

A model that takes the effect of the strong interaction into account has been used to fit the measured correlation function. The effects of single and coupled channels were explored. At the mean transverse mass mT =1.07 GeV, we obtain the values R=4.09±0.46(stat)±0.31(sys) fm and λ=0.92±0.23(stat) ±0.13(sys), where R and λ are the invariant radius and chaoticity parameters, respectively.

33947145694	Δ Δη correlations in central Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We report charged particle pair correlation analyses in the space of Δ (azimuth) and Δη (pseudorapidity), for central Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV in the STAR detector. The analysis involves unlike-sign charged pairs and like-sign charged pairs, which are transformed into charge-dependent (CD) signals and charge-independent (CI) signals. We present detailed parametrizations of the data. A model featuring dense gluonic hot spots as first proposed by Van Hove predicts that the observables under investigation would have sensitivity to such a substructure should it occur, and the model also motivates selection of transverse momenta in the range 0.8<pt<2.0 GeV/c. Both CD and CI correlations of high statistical significance are observed, and possible interpretations are discussed. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The yield of multistrange baryons per participant nucleon increases from peripheral to central collisions more rapidly than that of Λ, indicating an increase of the strange-quark density of the matter produced. The strange phase-space occupancy factor γs approaches unity for the most central collisions. Moreover, the nuclear modification factors of p, Λ, and Ξ are consistent with each other for 2<pT<5GeV/c in agreement with a scenario of hadron formation from constituent quark degrees of freedom. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547283529	Transverse momentum and centrality dependence of high-pT nonphotonic electron suppression in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	The STAR collaboration at the BNL Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) reports measurements of the inclusive yield of nonphotonic electrons, which arise dominantly from semileptonic decays of heavy flavor mesons, over a broad range of transverse momenta (1.2<pT<10GeV/c) in p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The nonphotonic electron yield exhibits an unexpectedly large suppression in central Au+Au collisions at high pT, suggesting substantial heavy-quark energy loss at RHIC. The centrality and pT dependences of the suppression provide constraints on theoretical models of suppression. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547293386	Strange particle production in p+p collisions at s=200 GeV	We present strange particle spectra and yields measured at midrapidity in s=200 GeV proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We find that the previously observed universal transverse mass (mT pT2+m2) scaling of hadron production in p+p collisions seems to break down at higher mT and that there is a difference in the shape of the mT spectrum between baryons and mesons. We observe midrapidity antibaryon to baryon ratios near unity for Λ and Ξ baryons and no dependence of the ratio on transverse momentum, indicating that our data do not yet reach the quark-jet dominated region. We show the dependence of the mean transverse momentum pT on measured charged particle multiplicity and on particle mass and infer that these trends are consistent with gluon-jet dominated particle production. The data are compared with previous measurements made at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron and Intersecting Storage Rings and in Fermilab experiments and with leading-order and next-to-leading-order string fragmentation model predictions. We infer from these comparisons that the spectral shapes and particle yields from p+p collisions at RHIC energies have large contributions from gluon jets rather than from quark jets. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547300669	Mass, quark-number, and sNN dependence of the second and fourth flow harmonics in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions	We present STAR measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy parameter v2 for pions, kaons, protons, Λ,Λ̄,Ξ+Ξ̄, and Ω+Ω̄, along with v4 for pions, kaons, protons, and Λ+Λ̄ at midrapidity for Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV. The v2(pT) values for all hadron species at 62.4 GeV are similar to those observed in 130 and 200 GeV collisions. For observed kinematic ranges, v2 values at 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV are as little as 10-15% larger than those in Pb+Pb collisions at sNN=17.3 GeV. At intermediate transverse momentum (pT from 1.5-5 GeV/c), the 62.4 GeV v2(pT) and v4(pT) values are consistent with the quark-number scaling first observed at 200 GeV. A four-particle cumulant analysis is used to assess the nonflow contributions to pions and protons and some indications are found for a smaller nonflow contribution to protons than pions. Baryon v2 is larger than antibaryon v2 at 62.4 and 200 GeV, perhaps indicating either that the initial spatial net-baryon distribution is anisotropic, that the mechanism leading to transport of baryon number from beam- to midrapidity enhances v2 or that antibaryon and baryon annihilation is larger in the in-plane direction. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34548399014	Global polarization measurement in Au+Au collisions	The system created in noncentral relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions possesses large orbital angular momentum. Because of spin-orbit coupling, particles produced in such a system could become globally polarized along the direction of the system angular momentum. We present the results of Λ and Λ̄ hyperon global polarization measurements in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV performed with the STAR detector at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The observed global polarization of Λ and Λ̄ hyperons in the STAR acceptance is consistent with zero within the precision of the measurements.

We have sensitivity to metastable strangelets with lifetimes of order ≥0.1 ns, in contrast to limits over ten times longer in BNL Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) studies and longer still at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).

34548768687	Partonic flow and I-Meson production in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We present first measurements of the Ï•-meson elliptic flow (v2(pT)) and high-statistics pT distributions for different centralities from sNN=200GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC. In minimum bias collisions the v2 of the Ï• meson is consistent with the trend observed for mesons. The ratio of the yields of the Î© to those of the Ï• as a function of transverse momentum is consistent with a model based on the recombination of thermal s quarks up to pT 4GeV/c, but disagrees at higher momenta. The nuclear modification factor (RCP) of Ï• follows the trend observed in the KS0 mesons rather than in baryons, supporting baryon-meson scaling. These data are consistent with Ï• mesons in central Au+Au collisions being created via coalescence of thermalized s quarks and the formation of a hot and dense matter with partonic collectivity at RHIC. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34948864310	Measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for dijet production in proton-proton collisions at s=200GeV	We report the first measurement of the opening angle distribution between pairs of jets produced in high-energy collisions of transversely polarized protons. The measurement probes (Sivers) correlations between the transverse spin orientation of a proton and the transverse momentum directions of its partons. With both beams polarized, the wide pseudorapidity (-1≤η≤+2) coverage for jets permits separation of Sivers functions for the valence and sea regions. The resulting asymmetries are all consistent with zero and considerably smaller than Sivers effects observed in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. We discuss theoretical attempts to reconcile the new results with the sizable transverse spin effects seen in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and forward hadron production in pp collisions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35948984150	Rapidity and species dependence of particle production at large transverse momentum for d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We determine rapidity asymmetry in the production of charged pions, protons, and antiprotons for large transverse momentum (pT) for d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The rapidity asymmetry is defined as the ratio of particle yields at backward rapidity (Au beam direction) to those at forward rapidity (d beam direction). The identified hadrons are measured in the rapidity regions |y|<0.5 and 0.5<|y|<1.0 for the pT range 2.5<pT<10GeV/c. We observe significant rapidity asymmetry for charged pion and proton+antiproton production in both the rapidity regions. The asymmetry is larger for 0.5<|y|<1.0 than for |y|<0.5 and is almost independent of particle type. The measurements are compared to various model predictions employing multiple scattering, energy loss, nuclear shadowing, saturation effects, and recombination and also to a phenomenological parton model. We find that asymmetries are sensitive to model parameters and show model preference. The rapidity dependence of π-/π+ and p̄/p ratios in peripheral d+Au and forward neutron-tagged events are used to study the contributions of valence quarks and gluons to particle production at high pT. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

37549010623	Forward Λ production and nuclear stopping power in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We report the measurement of Λ and Λ̄ yields and inverse slope parameters in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV at forward and backward rapidities (y=±2.75), using data from the STAR forward time projection chambers. The contributions of different processes to baryon transport and particle production are probed exploiting the inherent asymmetry of the d+Au system. Comparisons to model calculations show that baryon transport on the deuteron side is consistent with multiple collisions of the deuteron nucleons with gold participants. On the gold side, HIJING-based models without a hadronic rescattering phase do not describe the measured particle yields, while models that include target remnants or hadronic rescattering do. The multichain model can provide a good description of the net baryon density in d+Au collisions at energies currently available at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and the derived parameters of the model agree with those from nuclear collisions at lower energies. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The results are obtained using the three-particle cumulant method, the event plane method with mixed harmonics, and for the first time at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, the standard method with the event plane reconstructed from spectator neutrons.

33644894160	Multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles and photons at forward pseudorapidity in Au+Au collisons at sNN=62.4 GeV	We present the centrality-dependent measurement of multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles and photons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 GeV. The charged particles and photons are measured in the pseudorapidity region 2.9≤η≤3.9 and 2.3≤η≤3.7, respectively. We have studied the scaling of particle production with the number of participating nucleons and the number of binary collisions. The photon and charged particle production in the measured pseudorapidity range has been shown to be consistent with energy-independent limiting fragmentation behavior. Photons are observed to follow a centrality-independent limiting fragmentation behavior, while for charged particles it is centrality dependent. We have carried out a comparative study of the pseudorapidity distributions of positively charged hadrons, negatively charged hadrons, photons, pions, and net protons in nucleus-nucleus collisions and pseudorapidity distributions from p+p collisions. From these comparisons, we conclude that baryons in the inclusive charged particle distribution are responsible for the observed centrality dependence of limiting fragmentation. The mesons are found to follow an energy-independent behavior of limiting fragmentation, whereas the behavior of baryons is energy dependent. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

41549114230	ρ0 photoproduction in ultraperipheral relativistic heavy ion collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Photoproduction reactions occur when the electromagnetic field of a relativistic heavy ion interacts with another heavy ion. The STAR Collaboration presents a measurement of ρ0 and direct π+π- photoproduction in ultraperipheral relativistic heavy ion collisions at sNN=200 GeV. We observe both exclusive photoproduction and photoproduction accompanied by mutual Coulomb excitation. We find a coherent cross section of σ(AuAu→Au*Au*ρ0)=530±19(stat.)±57(syst.) mb, in accord with theoretical calculations based on a Glauber approach, but considerably below the predictions of a color dipole model. The ρ0 transverse momentum spectrum (pT2) is fit by a double exponential curve including both coherent and incoherent coupling to the target nucleus; we find σinc/σcoh=0. 29±0.03(stat.)±0.08(syst.). The ratio of direct π+π- to ρ0 production is comparable to that observed in γp collisions at HERA and appears to be independent of photon energy. Finally, the measured ρ0 spin helicity matrix elements agree within errors with the expected s-channel helicity conservation. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

77954561353	Higher moments of net proton multiplicity distributions at RHIC	We report the first measurements of the kurtosis (κ), skewness (S), and variance (σ2) of net-proton multiplicity (Np-Np̄) distributions at midrapidity for Au+Au collisions at √sNN=19.6, 62.4, and 200 GeV corresponding to baryon chemical potentials (μB) between 200 and 20 MeV. Our measurements of the products κσ2 and Sσ, which can be related to theoretical calculations sensitive to baryon number susceptibilities and long-range correlations, are constant as functions of collision centrality. We compare these products with results from lattice QCD and various models without a critical point and study the √sNN dependence of κσ2. From the measurements at the three beam energies, we find no evidence for a critical point in the QCD phase diagram for μB below 200 MeV. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

43049133258	Enhanced strange baryon production in Au+Au collisions compared to p+p at sNN=200 GeV	We report on the observed differences in production rates of strange and multistrange baryons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV compared to p+p interactions at the same energy. The strange baryon yields in Au+Au collisions, when scaled down by the number of participating nucleons, are enhanced relative to those measured in p+p reactions. The enhancement observed increases with the strangeness content of the baryon, and it increases for all strange baryons with collision centrality. The enhancement is qualitatively similar to that observed at the lower collision energy sNN=17.3 GeV. The previous observations are for the bulk production, while at intermediate pT,1<pT<4 GeV/c, the strange baryons even exceed binary scaling from p+p yields. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

43949107889	Centrality dependence of charged hadron and strange hadron elliptic flow from sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions	We present STAR results on the elliptic flow v2 of charged hadrons, strange and multistrange particles from sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The detailed study of the centrality dependence of v2 over a broad transverse momentum range is presented. Comparisons of different analysis methods are made in order to estimate systematic uncertainties. To discuss the nonflow effect, we have performed the first analysis of v2 with the Lee-Yang zero method for KS0 and Λ. In the relatively low pT region, pT≤2GeV/c, a scaling with mT-m is observed for identified hadrons in each centrality bin studied. However, we do not observe v2(pT) scaled by the participant eccentricity to be independent of centrality. At higher pT,2≤pT≤6GeV/c,v2 scales with quark number for all hadrons studied. For the multistrange hadron Ω, which does not suffer appreciable hadronic interactions, the values of v2 are consistent with both mT-m scaling at low pT and number-of-quark scaling at intermediate pT. As a function of collision centrality, an increase of pT-integrated v2 scaled by the participant eccentricity has been observed, indicating a stronger collective flow in more central Au+Au collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

45349088511	Spin alignment measurements of the K*0(892) and (1020) vector mesons in heavy ion collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We present the first spin alignment measurements for the K*0(892) and (1020) vector mesons produced at midrapidity with transverse momenta up to 5 GeV/c at sNN=200 GeV at RHIC. The diagonal spin-density matrix elements with respect to the reaction plane in Au+Au collisions are ρ00=0.32±0.04 (stat) ± 0.09 (syst) for the K*0 (0.8<pT<5.0 GeV/c) and ρ00=0.34±0.02 (stat) ± 0.03 (syst) for the (0.4<pT<5.0 GeV/c) and are constant with transverse momentum and collision centrality. The data are consistent with the unpolarized expectation of 1/3 and thus no evidence is found for the transfer of the orbital angular momentum of the colliding system to the vector-meson spins. Spin alignments for K*0 and in Au+Au collisions were also measured with respect to the particle's production plane. The result, ρ00=0.41±0.02 (stat) ± 0.04 (syst), is consistent with that in p+p collisions, ρ00=0.39±0.03 (stat) ± 0.06 (syst), also measured in this work. The measurements thus constrain the possible size of polarization phenomena in the production dynamics of vector mesons. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

55849133704	Hadronic resonance production in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV measured at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider	We present the first measurements of the ρ(770)0,K*(892), Δ(1232)++,Σ(1385), and Λ(1520) resonances in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV, reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels using the STAR detector (the solenoidal tracker at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider). The masses and widths of these resonances are studied as a function of transverse momentum pT. We observe that the resonance spectra follow a generalized scaling law with the transverse mass mT. The pT of resonances in minimum bias collisions are compared with the pT of π,K, and p̄. The ρ0/π-,K*/K-,Δ++/p,Σ(1385)/Λ, and Λ(1520)/Λ ratios in d+Au collisions are compared with the measurements in minimum bias p+p interactions, where we observe that both measurements are comparable.

The xF dependence of the results is in fair agreement with perturbative QCD model calculations that identify orbital motion of quarks and gluons within the proton as the origin of the spin effects.

We find that the directed flow depends on the incident energy but, contrary to all available model implementations, not on the size of the colliding system at a given centrality. We extend the validity of the limiting fragmentation concept to v1 in different collision systems, and investigate possible explanations for the observed sign change in v1(pt). © 2008 The American Physical Society.

We observe that the dynamical fluctuations are nonzero at all energies and exhibit a modest dependence on beam energy. A weak system size dependence is also observed. We examine the collision centrality dependence of the net charge fluctuations and find that dynamical net charge fluctuations violate 1/Nch scaling but display approximate 1/Npart scaling. We also study the azimuthal and rapidity dependence of the net charge correlation strength and observe strong dependence on the azimuthal angular range and pseudorapidity widths integrated to measure the correlation. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

63049105920	Observation of two-source interference in the photoproduction reaction AuAu→AuAuρ0	In ultraperipheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a photon from the electromagnetic field of one nucleus can fluctuate to a quark-antiquark pair and scatter from the other nucleus, emerging as a ρ0. The ρ0 production occurs in two well-separated (median impact parameters of 20 and 40 F for the cases considered here) nuclei, so the system forms a two-source interferometer. At low transverse momenta, the two amplitudes interfere destructively, suppressing ρ0 production. Since the ρ0 decays before the production amplitudes from the two sources can overlap, the two-pion system can only be described with an entangled nonlocal wave function, and is thus an example of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. We observe this suppression in 200 GeV per nucleon-pair gold-gold collisions. The interference is 87%±5%(stat.) ±8%(syst.) of the expected level. This translates into a limit on decoherence due to wave function collapse or other factors of 23% at the 90% confidence level. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

64149108573	Systematic measurements of identified particle spectra in pp, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at the STAR detector	Identified charged-particle spectra of π±, K±, p, and p̄ at midrapidity (|y|<0.1) measured by the dE/dx method in the STAR (solenoidal tracker at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) time projection chamber are reported for pp and d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV and for Au+Au collisions at 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV. Average transverse momenta, total particle production, particle yield ratios, strangeness, and baryon production rates are investigated as a function of the collision system and centrality. The transverse momentum spectra are found to be flatter for heavy particles than for light particles in all collision systems; the effect is more prominent for more central collisions. The extracted average transverse momentum of each particle species follows a trend determined by the total charged-particle multiplicity density. The Bjorken energy density estimate is at least several GeV/fm3 for a formation time less than 1 fm/c. A significantly larger net-baryon density and a stronger increase of the net-baryon density with centrality are found in Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV than at the two higher energies. Antibaryon production relative to total particle multiplicity is found to be constant over centrality, but increases with the collision energy. Strangeness production relative to total particle multiplicity is similar at the three measured RHIC energies. Relative strangeness production increases quickly with centrality in peripheral Au+Au collisions, to a value about 50% above the pp value, and remains rather constant in more central collisions. Bulk freeze-out properties are extracted from thermal equilibrium model and hydrodynamics-motivated blast-wave model fits to the data. Resonance decays are found to have little effect on the extracted kinetic freeze-out parameters because of the transverse momentum range of our measurements. The extracted chemical freeze-out temperature is constant, independent of collision system or centrality; its value is close to the predicted phase-transition temperature, suggesting that chemical freeze-out happens in the vicinity of hadronization and the chemical freeze-out temperature is universal despite the vastly different initial conditions in the collision systems. The extracted kinetic freeze-out temperature, while similar to the chemical freeze-out temperature in pp, d+Au, and peripheral Au+Au collisions, drops significantly with centrality in Au+Au collisions, whereas the extracted transverse radial flow velocity increases rapidly with centrality. There appears to be a prolonged period of particle elastic scatterings from chemical to kinetic freeze-out in central Au+Au collisions. The bulk properties extracted at chemical and kinetic freeze-out are observed to evolve smoothly over the measured energy range, collision systems, and collision centralities. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67650109881	Measurements of meson production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)	We present results for the measurement of meson production via its charged kaon decay channel →K+K- in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4,130, and 200 GeV, and in p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV from the STAR experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The midrapidity (|y|<0.5) meson transverse momentum (pT) spectra in central Au+Au collisions are found to be well described by a single exponential distribution. On the other hand, the pT spectra from p+p, d+Au, and peripheral Au+Au collisions show power-law tails at intermediate and high pT and are described better by Levy distributions. The constant /K- yield ratio vs beam species, collision centrality, and colliding energy is in contradiction with expectations from models having kaon coalescence as the dominant mechanism for production at RHIC. The Ω/ yield ratio as a function of pT is consistent with a model based on the recombination of thermal s quarks up to pT~4 GeV/c, but disagrees at higher transverse momenta. The measured nuclear modification factor, RdAu, for the meson increases above unity at intermediate pT, similar to that for pions and protons, while RAA is suppressed due to the energy loss effect in central Au+Au collisions. Number of constituent quark scaling of both Rcp and v2 for the meson with respect to other hadrons in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV at intermediate pT is observed. These observations support quark coalescence as being the dominant mechanism of hadronization in the intermediate pT region at RHIC. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The multiplicity and transverse momentum dependences of the extracted correlation lengths (radii) are studied.

70350215885	Growth of long range forward-backward multiplicity correlations with centrality in au+au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Forward-backward multiplicity correlation strengths have been measured with the STAR detector for Au+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV. Strong short- and long-range correlations (LRC) are seen in central Au+Au collisions. The magnitude of these correlations decrease with decreasing centrality until only short-range correlations are observed in peripheral Au+Au collisions. Both the dual parton model (DPM) and the color glass condensate (CGC) predict the existence of the long-range correlations. In the DPM, the fluctuation in the number of elementary (parton) inelastic collisions produces the LRC. In the CGC, longitudinal color flux tubes generate the LRC. The data are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the DPM and indicate the presence of multiple parton interactions. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

70449459077	Neutral pion production in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The results of midrapidity (0<y<0.8) neutral pion spectra over an extended transverse momentum range (1<pT<12 GeV/c) in sNN=200 Ge, Au+Au collisions, measured by the STAR experiment, are presented. The neutral pions are reconstructed from photons measured either by the STAR Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter or by the Time Projection Chamber via tracking of conversion electron-positron pairs. Our measurements are compared to previously published π± and π0 results. The nuclear modification factors RCP and RAA of π0 are also presented as a function of pT. In the most central Au+Au collisions, the binary collision scaled π0 yield at high pT is suppressed by a factor of about 5 compared to the expectation from the yield of p+p collisions. Such a large suppression is in agreement with previous observations for light quark mesons and is consistent with the scenario that partons suffer considerable energy loss in the dense medium formed in central nucleus-nucleus collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

The inclusive J/ψ production cross section for Cu+Cu collisions is found to be consistent at high pT with the binary collision-scaled cross section for p+p collisions. At a confidence level of 97%, this is in contrast to a suppression of J/ψ production observed at lower pT.

We report measurements of charged hadrons near center-of-mass rapidity with this observable in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV using the STAR detector.

The cross section was measured over a transverse momentum range of 1<pT<17GeV/c and found to be in good agreement with a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry was measured in the range of 3.7<pT<11GeV/c and excludes a maximal positive gluon polarization in the proton.

73849102439	Long range rapidity correlations and jet production in high energy nuclear collisions	The STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider presents a systematic study of high-transverse-momentum charged-di-hadron correlations at small azimuthal pair separation ΔΦ in d+Au and central Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. Significant correlated yield for pairs with large longitudinal separation Δη is observed in central Au+Au collisions, in contrast to d+Au collisions. The associated yield distribution in Δη×ΔΦ can be decomposed into a narrow jet-like peak at small angular separation which has a similar shape to that found in d+Au collisions, and a component that is narrow in ΔΦ and depends only weakly on Δη, the "ridge." Using two systematically independent determinations of the background normalization and shape, finite ridge yield is found to persist for trigger pt>6 GeV/c, indicating that it is correlated with jet production. The transverse-momentum spectrum of hadrons comprising the ridge is found to be similar to that of bulk particle production in the measured range (2<pt<4 GeV/c). © 2009 The American Physical Society.

77953241673	Spectra of identified high-pT π	We report new results on identified (anti)proton and charged pion spectra at large transverse momenta (3<pT<10 GeV/c) from Cu+Cu collisions at √sNN=200 GeV using the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). This study explores the system size dependence of two novel features observed at RHIC with heavy ions: the hadron suppression at high-pT and the anomalous baryon to meson enhancement at intermediate transverse momenta. Both phenomena could be attributed to the creation of a new form of QCD matter. The results presented here bridge the system size gap between the available pp and Au+Au data, and allow for a detailed exploration of the onset of the novel features. Comparative analysis of all available 200 GeV data indicates that the system size is a major factor determining both the magnitude of the hadron spectra suppression at large transverse momenta and the relative baryon to meson enhancement. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

These domains are predicted to lead to charge separation of quarks along the orbital momentum of the system created in noncentral collisions. To study this effect, we investigate a three-particle mixed-harmonics azimuthal correlator which is a P-even observable, but directly sensitive to the charge-separation effect. We report measurements of this observable using the STAR detector in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at √sNN=200 and 62GeV. The results are presented as a function of collision centrality, particle separation in rapidity, and particle transverse momentum. A signal consistent with several of the theoretical expectations is detected in all four data sets. We compare our results to the predictions of existing event generators and discuss in detail possible contributions from other effects that are not related to P violation. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

Charge ordering properties are exploited to separate the jetlike component and the ridge (long range Δη correlation). The results indicate that the correlation of ridge particles are uniform not only with respect to the trigger particle but also between themselves event by event in our measured Δη.

Photons from the decay π0→γγ were detected in the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The η→γγ decay was also observed and constituted the first η measurement by STAR. The first direct photon cross-section measurement by STAR is also presented; the signal was extracted statistically by subtracting the π0, η, and ω(782) decay background from the inclusive photon distribution observed in the calorimeter.

77956151577	Balance functions from Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions at √sNN=200 GeV	Balance functions have been measured for charged-particle pairs, identified charged-pion pairs, and identified charged-kaon pairs in Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions at √sNN=200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider using the STAR detector. These balance functions are presented in terms of relative pseudorapidity, Δη, relative rapidity, Δy, relative azimuthal angle, Δ, and invariant relative momentum, qinv. For charged-particle pairs, the width of the balance function in terms of Δη scales smoothly with the number of participating nucleons, while hijing and urqmd model calculations show no dependence on centrality or system size. For charged-particle and charged-pion pairs, the balance functions widths in terms of Δη and Δy are narrower in central Au+Au collisions than in peripheral collisions. The width for central collisions is consistent with thermal blast-wave models where the balancing charges are highly correlated in coordinate space at breakup. This strong correlation might be explained by either delayed hadronization or limited diffusion during the reaction. Furthermore, the narrowing trend is consistent with the lower kinetic temperatures inherent to more central collisions. In contrast, the width of the balance function for charged-kaon pairs in terms of Δy shows little centrality dependence, which may signal a different production mechanism for kaons. The widths of the balance functions for charged pions and kaons in terms of qinv narrow in central collisions compared to peripheral collisions, which may be driven by the change in the kinetic temperature. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

For associated particles at higher pT2.5 GeV/c, narrow correlation peaks are seen in d+ Au and Au+Au, indicating that the main production mechanism is jet fragmentation. At lower associated particle pT<2 GeV/c, a large enhancement of the near- (Δ0) and away-side (Δπ) associated yields is found, together with a strong broadening of the away-side azimuthal distributions in Au+Au collisions compared to d+ Au measurements, suggesting that other particle production mechanisms play a role. This is further supported by the observed significant softening of the away-side associated particle yield distribution at Δπ in central Au+Au collisions. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

79956303213	Observation of the antimatter helium-4 nucleus	High-energy nuclear collisions create an energy density similar to that of the Universe microseconds after the Big Bang; in both cases, matter and antimatter are formed with comparable abundance. However, the relatively short-lived expansion in nuclear collisions allows antimatter to decouple quickly from matter, and avoid annihilation. Thus, a high-energy accelerator of heavy nuclei provides an efficient means of producing and studying antimatter. The antimatter helium-4 nucleus (), also known as the anti-(), consists of two antiprotons and two antineutrons (baryon number B = '4). It has not been observed previously, although the -particle was identified a century ago by Rutherford and is present in cosmic radiation at the ten per cent level. Antimatter nuclei with B'1 have been observed only as rare products of interactions at particle accelerators, where the rate of antinucleus production in high-energy collisions decreases by a factor of about 1,000 with each additional antinucleon. Here we report the observation of, the heaviest observed antinucleus to date. In total, 18 counts were detected at the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC; ref. 6) in 10 9 recorded gold-on-gold (Au+Au) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 200 GeV and 62 GeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. The yield is consistent with expectations from thermodynamic and coalescent nucleosynthesis models, providing an indication of the production rate of even heavier antimatter nuclei and a benchmark for possible future observations of in cosmic radiation. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Pairs of back-to-back high-transverse-momentum hadrons are used for triggers to study associated hadron distributions. In contrast with two- and three-particle correlations with a single trigger with similar kinematic selections, the associated hadron distribution of both trigger sides reveals no modification in either relative pseudorapidity Δη or relative azimuthal angle Δ from d+Au to central Au+Au collisions.

We use the observed longitudinal broadening of the near-side peak of C with increasing centrality to estimate the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density, η/s, of the matter formed in central Au. +.

The STAR Collaboration has previously presented measurements of coherent ρ0 photoproduction at center of mass energies of 130 GeV and 200 GeV in AuAu collisions. Here, we present a measurement of the cross section at 62.4 GeV; we find that the cross section for coherent ρ0 photoproduction with nuclear breakup is 10.5±1.5±1.6 mb at 62.4 GeV. The cross-section ratio between 200 GeV and 62.4 GeV is 4.4±0.6, less than is predicted by most theoretical models. It is, however, proportionally much larger than the previously observed 15%±55% increase between 130 GeV and 200 GeV. © 2012 American Physical Society.

This work extends the previous analysis for nearly symmetric trigger pairs with the highest momentum threshold of trigger hadron of 5 GeV/c with the new calorimeter-based triggers with energy thresholds of up to 10 GeV and above.

Here we present the correlator previously used split into its two component parts to reveal correlations parallel and perpendicular to the event plane. The results are from a high-statistics 200-GeV Au + Au collisions data set (57×106 events) collected by the STAR experiment. We explicitly count units of charge separation from which we find clear evidence for more charge-separation fluctuations perpendicular than parallel to the event plane. We also employ a modified correlator to study the possible P-even background in same- and opposite-charge correlations, and find that the P-even background may largely be explained by momentum conservation and collective motion. © 2013 American Physical Society.

Neutral pions were detected using the end cap electromagnetic calorimeter in the STAR detector at RHIC. The cross section was measured over a transverse momentum range of 5<pT<16 GeV/c and is found to agree with a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry ALL is measured in the same pseudorapidity range and spans a range of Bjorken-x down to x≈0.01. The measured ALL is consistent with model predictions for varying degrees of gluon polarization. The parity-violating asymmetry AL is also measured and found to be consistent with zero. The transverse single-spin asymmetry AN is measured over a previously unexplored kinematic range in Feynman-x and pT. Such measurements may aid our understanding of the onset and kinematic dependence of the large asymmetries observed at more forward pseudorapidity (η≈3) and their underlying mechanisms. The AN results presented are consistent with a twist-3 model prediction of a small asymmetry over the present kinematic range. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The measurements are carried out by the STAR experiment at midrapidity (|y|<0.5) and within the transverse momentum range 0.4<pT<0.8 GeV/c in the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. These measurements are important for understanding the quantum chromodynamic phase diagram. The products of the moments, Sσ and κσ2, are sensitive to the correlation length of the hot and dense medium created in the collisions and are related to the ratios of baryon number susceptibilities of corresponding orders. The products of moments are found to have values significantly below the Skellam expectation and close to expectations based on independent proton and antiproton production. The measurements are compared to a transport model calculation to understand the effect of acceptance and baryon number conservation and also to a hadron resonance gas model. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84897379022	Jet-hadron correlations in sNN =200GeV p+p and central Au+Au collisions	Azimuthal angular correlations of charged hadrons with respect to the axis of a reconstructed (trigger) jet in Au+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV in STAR are presented. The trigger jet population in Au+Au collisions is biased toward jets that have not interacted with the medium, allowing easier matching of jet energies between Au+Au and p+p collisions while enhancing medium effects on the recoil jet. The associated hadron yield of the recoil jet is significantly suppressed at high transverse momentum (pTassoc) and enhanced at low pTassoc in 0%-20% central Au+Au collisions compared to p+p collisions, which is indicative of medium-induced parton energy loss in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84899717564	Event-plane-dependent dihadron correlations with harmonic vn subtraction in Au + Au collisions at s NN =200 GeV	STAR measurements of dihadron azimuthal correlations (Δφ) are reported in midcentral (20-60%) Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV as a function of the trigger particle's azimuthal angle relative to the event plane, φs=|φt-ψEP|. The elliptic (v2), triangular (v3), and quadratic (v4) flow harmonic backgrounds are subtracted using the zero yield at minimum (ZYAM) method. The results are compared to minimum-bias d+Au collisions. It is found that a finite near-side (|Δφ|<π/2) long-range pseudorapidity correlation (ridge) is present in the in-plane direction (φs∼0). The away-side (|Δφ|>π/2) correlation shows a modification from d+Au data, varying with φs. The modification may be a consequence of path-length-dependent jet quenching and may lead to a better understanding of high-density QCD. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84899752374	Measurement of charge multiplicity asymmetry correlations in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions at sNN =200 GeV	A study is reported of the same- and opposite-sign charge-dependent azimuthal correlations with respect to the event plane in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The charge multiplicity asymmetries between the up/down and left/right hemispheres relative to the event plane are utilized. The contributions from statistical fluctuations and detector effects were subtracted from the (co-)variance of the observed charge multiplicity asymmetries. In the mid- to most-central collisions, the same- (opposite-) sign pairs are preferentially emitted in back-to-back (aligned on the same-side) directions. The charge separation across the event plane, measured by the difference, Δ, between the like- and unlike-sign up/down-left/right correlations, is largest near the event plane. The difference is found to be proportional to the event-by-event final-state particle ellipticity (via the observed second-order harmonic v2obs), where Δ=[1.3±1.4(stat)-1.0+4.0(syst)]×10- 5+[3.2±0.2(stat)-0.3+0.4(syst)]×10-3v2obs for 20-40% Au+Au collisions. The implications for the proposed chiral magnetic effect are discussed. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84899510179	Beam-energy dependence of the directed flow of protons, antiprotons, and pions in au+au collisions	Rapidity-odd directed flow (v1) measurements for charged pions, protons, and antiprotons near midrapidity (y=0) are reported in sNN=7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions as recorded by the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. At intermediate impact parameters, the proton and net-proton slope parameter dv1/dy|y=0 shows a minimum between 11.5 and 19.6 GeV. In addition, the net-proton dv1/dy|y=0 changes sign twice between 7.7 and 39 GeV. The proton and net-proton results qualitatively resemble predictions of a hydrodynamic model with a first-order phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined matter, and differ from hadronic transport calculations. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84902661144	Suppression of Υ{hooked} production in d + Au and Au + Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	We report measurements of Υ{hooked} meson production in p + p, d + Au, and Au + Au collisions using the STAR detector at RHIC. We compare the Υ{hooked} yield to the measured cross section in p + p collisions in order to quantify any modifications of the yield in cold nuclear matter using d + Au data and in hot nuclear matter using Au + Au data separated into three centrality classes. Our p + p measurement is based on three times the statistics of our previous result. We obtain a nuclear modification factor for Υ{hooked}(1S + 2S + 3S) in the rapidity range |y| < 1 in d + Au collisions of

84904314168	Dielectron mass spectra from Au+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	We report the STAR measurements of dielectron (e+e-) production at midrapidity (|yee|<1) in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The measurements are evaluated in different invariant mass regions with a focus on 0.30-0.76 (ρ-like), 0.76-0.80 (ω-like), and 0.98-1.05 (φ-like) GeV/c2. The spectrum in the ω-like and φ-like regions can be well described by the hadronic cocktail simulation. In the ρ-like region, however, the vacuum ρ spectral function cannot describe the shape of the dielectron excess. In this range, an enhancement of 1.77±0.11(stat)±0.24(syst)±0. 33(cocktail) is determined with respect to the hadronic cocktail simulation that excludes the ρ meson. The excess yield in the ρ-like region increases with the number of collision participants faster than the ω and φ yields. Theoretical models with broadened ρ contributions through interactions with constituents in the hot QCD medium provide a consistent description of the dilepton mass spectra for the measurement presented here and the earlier data at the Super Proton Synchrotron energies. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84905575386	Beam-energy dependence of charge separation along the magnetic field in Au+Au collisions at RHIC	Local parity-odd domains are theorized to form inside a quark-gluon plasma which has been produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The local parity-odd domains manifest themselves as charge separation along the magnetic field axis via the chiral magnetic effect. The experimental observation of charge separation has previously been reported for heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. In this Letter, we present the results of the beam-energy dependence of the charge correlations in Au+Au collisions at midrapidity for center-of-mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV from the STAR experiment. After background subtraction, the signal gradually reduces with decreased beam energy and tends to vanish by 7.7 GeV. This implies the dominance of hadronic interactions over partonic ones at lower collision energies. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84907263146	Beam energy dependence of moments of the net-charge multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at RHIC	We report the first measurements of the moments - mean (M), variance (2), skewness (S), and kurtosis (κ) - of the net-charge multiplicity distributions at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at seven energies, ranging from sNN=7.7 to 200 GeV, as a part of the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC. The moments are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of net charge, and are sensitive to the location of the QCD critical point. We compare the products of the moments, 2/M, S, and κ2, with the expectations from Poisson and negative binomial distributions (NBDs). The S values deviate from the Poisson baseline and are close to the NBD baseline, while the κ2 values tend to lie between the two. Within the present uncertainties, our data do not show nonmonotonic behavior as a function of collision energy. These measurements provide a valuable tool to extract the freeze-out parameters in heavy-ion collisions by comparing with theoretical models. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84908053125	Observation of D0 meson nuclear modifications in Au+Au collisions at sNN =200GeV	We report the first measurement of charmed-hadron (D0) production via the hadronic decay channel (D0→K-+π+) in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV with the STAR experiment. The charm production cross section per nucleon-nucleon collision at midrapidity scales with the number of binary collisions, Nbin, from p+p to central Au+Au collisions. The D0 meson yields in central Au+Au collisions are strongly suppressed compared to those in p+p scaled by Nbin, for transverse momenta pT>3GeV/c, demonstrating significant energy loss of charm quarks in the hot and dense medium. An enhancement at intermediate pT is also observed. Model calculations including strong charm-medium interactions and coalescence hadronization describe our measurements.

84911878387	J/ψ production at low pT in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN =200 GeV with the STAR detector	The J/ψ pT spectrum and nuclear modification factor (RAA) are reported for pT<5GeV/c and |y|<1 from 0% to 60% central Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV at STAR. A significant suppression of pT-integrated J/ψ production is observed in central Au+Au events. The Cu+Cu data are consistent with no suppression, although the precision is limited by the available statistics. RAA in Au+Au collisions exhibits a strong suppression at low transverse momentum and gradually increases with pT. The data are compared to high-pT STAR results and previously published BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider results. Comparing with model calculations, it is found that the invariant yields at low pT are significantly above hydrodynamic flow predictions but are consistent with models that include color screening and regeneration. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84919706481	Dielectron azimuthal anisotropy at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	We report on the first measurement of the azimuthal anisotropy (v2) of dielectrons (e+e- pairs) at mid-rapidity from sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), presented as a function of transverse momentum (pT) for different invariant-mass regions. In the mass region Mee<1.1 GeV/c2 the dielectron v2 measurements are found to be consistent with expectations from π0,η,ω, and φ decay contributions. In the mass region 1.1<Mee<2.9GeV/c2, the measured dielectron v2 is consistent, within experimental uncertainties, with that from the cc¯ contributions.

The asymmetries for W± were measured as a function of the decay lepton pseudorapidity, which provides a theoretically clean probe of the proton's polarized quark distributions at the scale of the W mass. The results are compared to theoretical predictions, constrained by polarized deep inelastic scattering measurements, and show a preference for a sizable, positive up antiquark polarization in the range 0.05<x<0.2. © 2014 American Physical Society.
