14944361919	Mechanism of the hypoglycemic effect of stevioside, a glycoside of Stevia rebaudiana	We have studied the effects of stevioside on the glucose and insulin metabolism in 2 models of diabetes in rats, STZ-induced diabetic rats and NIDDM diabetic rats induced by feeding with fructose. Stevioside (0.5 mg/kg), lowered the blood glucose levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats, peaking at 90 min. Stevioside administered twice daily also demonstrated dose-dependent effects in lowering the glucose levels in both diabetic rat models. Stevioside reduced the rise in glucose during glucose tolerance testing in normal rats. Stevioside dose-dependently decreased protein levels of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and PEPCK mRNA after 15 days of treatment. Stevioside also reduced insulin resistance in the diabetic animals as shown by the glucose lowering effects of tolbutamide. In conclusion, stevioside was able to regulate blood glucose levels by enhancing not only insulin secretion, but also insulin utilization in insulin-deficient rats: the latter was due to decreased PEPCK gene expression in rat liver by stevioside's action of slowing down gluconeogenesis. Further studies of this agent for the treatment of diabetes appear warranted.

14044259888	Antioxidant activity of Ganoderma lucidum in acute ethanol-induced heart toxicity	The hot water extract of the mushroom Ganoderma lucidum was shown to have antioxidative effect against heart toxicity. Investigations into the mechanisms of action, level of lipid peroxidation level in vivo, and superoxide scavenging activity were also conducted. The mice were divided into six groups with ten animals in each group. Ganoderma lucidum, at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg (p.o.) was administered. Superoxide anions were assayed by UV spectrophotometer using the cytochrome C reduction method. The results of this study showed that Ganoderma lucidum exhibited a dose-dependent antioxidative effect on lipid peroxidation and superoxide scavenging activity in mouse heart homogenate. Additionally, this result indicated that heart damage induced by ethanol shows a higher malonic dialdehyde level compared with heart homogenate treated with Ganoderma lucidum. It is concluded that the antioxidative activity may therefore contribute to the cardioprotective effect of Ganoderma lucidum, and may therefore protect the heart from superoxide induced damage.

20944438741	Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation versus atrioventricular junction ablation plus pacing therapy for elderly patients with medically refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation	Background: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) has become another nonpharmacologic therapeutic option for medically refractory paroxysmal AF. Whether this method is better than atrioventricular (AV) junction ablation plus pacing therapy is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare the very long-term (longer than 4 years) clinical outcomes of the 2 methods in elderly patients (>65 years old) with medically refractory paroxysmal AF. Methods: From January 1995 to December 2001, 71 elderly patients with medically refractory paroxysmal AF were included; group 1 included 32 patients with successful AV junction ablation plus pacing therapy and group 2, 37 patients with successful catheter ablation of AF. Results: After a mean follow-up of more than 52 months, the AF was better controlled in the group 1 patients than group 2 (100% vs 81%, P = 0.013), however, they had a significantly higher incidence of persistent AF (69% vs 8%, P < 0.001) and heart failure (53% vs 24%, P = 0.001). Furthermore, the incidence of ischemic stroke and cardiac death was similar between the 2 groups. Compared with the preablation values, a significant increase in the NYHA functional class (1.7 ± 0.9 vs 1.4 ± 0.7, P = 0.01) and significant decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction (44 ± 8% vs 51 ± 10%, P = 0.01) were noted in the group 1 patients, but not in the group 2 patients. Conclusions: Although AV junction ablation plus pacing therapy better controlled the AF in elderly patients with medically refractory paroxysmal AF, that method was associated with a higher incidence of persistent AF and heart failure than catheter ablation of AF in the very long-term follow-up.

1942469280	The Beneficial Effect of Regular Endurance Exercise Training on Blood Pressure and Quality of Life in Patients with Hypertension	Regular aerobic exercise can reduce blood pressure and is recommended as part of the lifestyle modification to reduce high blood pressure and cardiovascular risk. Hypertension itself, or/and pharmacological treatment for hypertension is associated with adverse effects on some aspects of quality of life. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of regular endurance exercise training on quality of life and blood pressure. Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-180 or diastolic blood pressure 90-110 mm Hg) were randomized to a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise group training for 3 sessions/week over 10 weeks or to a non-exercising control group. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) at baseline and after 6 and 10 weeks. In the 102 subjects (47 male, mean age 47 years) who completed the study, reductions in blood pressure in the exercise group at 10 weeks (-13.1/-6.3 mm Hg) were significant (P < 0.001) compared to baseline and to the control group (-1.5/+6.0 mm Hg). Unlike the control group, the exercise group showed an increase in exercise capacity from 8.2 ± 1.6 to 10.8 ± 2.2 METS (P < 0.01) and showed higher scores on 7 out of 8 subscales (P < 0.05) of the SF-36. Improvement in bodily pain and general health sub-scores correlated with reduction in systolic blood pressure. Regular endurance training improves both blood pressure and quality of life in hypertensive patients and should be encouraged more widely.

22044440743	Angiotensin II stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α accumulation in glomerular mesangial cells	Hypoxia increases hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein levels by inhibiting ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α, which regulates the transcription of many genes. Recent studies have revealed that many ligands can stimulate HIF-1α accumulation under nonhypoxic conditions. In this study, we show that angiotensin II (Ang II) increased HIF-1α protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner under normoxic conditions. Treatment of mesangial cells with Ang II (100 nM) increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ang II (100 nM) increased the phosphorylation of PDK-1 and Akt/PKB in glomerular mesangial cells. Ang II-stimulated HIF-1α accumulation was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitors, Ly 294001, and wortmannin, suggesting that PI-3K was involved. Because increased ROS generation by Ang II may activate the PI-3K-PKB/Akt signaling pathway, these results suggest that Ang II may stimulate a ROS-dependent activation of the PI-3K-PKB/Akt pathway, which leads to HIF-1α accumulation. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.

0029818679	Beneficial effects of pravastatin on fasting hyperinsulinemia in elderly hypertensive hypercholesterolemic subjects	We undertook this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose (15 mg) pravastatin in elderly hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects with concurrent antihypertensive treatment and to determine whether fasting hyperinsulinemia could also be improved. At three hypertension and lipid clinics of two medical centers, 96 elderly (49 women, 47 men) ambulatory subjects were randomized to active treatment or placebo for 12 months after a 3-month single-blind lead in period. Hypertensive subjects with plasma total cholesterol levels of at least 6.47 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) and triglyceride levels less than 3.39 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) were treated with 15 mg pravastatin for 12 months after receiving 3 mouths of the American Heart Association step 1 diet. Lipid, glucose, and fasting insulin levels were measured; clinical laboratory tests included liver function and creatine kinase determinations. After 12 months of pravastatin therapy, plasma total cholesterol concentration decreased by 25.1% (from a mean of 7.29 to 5.47 mmol/L, P<.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 30.2% (from 5.27 to 3.68 mmol/L, P<.05), and triglycerides decreased by 10.7% (from 1.68 to 1.50 mmol/L, P<.05). High- density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 9.2% (from 1.20 to 1.31 mmol/L, P<.05). Fasting insulin levels decreased from 89.0 to 61.5 pmol/L (P<.05). All of these changes were greater (P<.05) than any tendency toward change in the placebo group. Adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities were generally mild and transient in both placebo and pravastatin groups. Study drugs were withdrawn from one subject in each group with asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations. We conclude that low-dose pravastatin was effective and safe in the treatment of hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects on concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It also improved fasting hyperinsulinemia despite the use of β-blockers and diuretics in these hypertensive subjects.

0029829118	Thrombophilia in patients with hypercholesterolemia	To investigate a possible interrelationship between hypercholesterolemia and the coagulation and fibrinolytic system, the Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor. Two-Township Study in Taiwan was undertaken as a longitudinal prospective study focusing on the evolution of cardiovascular disease risk factors, with an emphasis on hemostatic factors. Hemostatic parameters measured in this study included prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, factor VIIc, factor VIIIc, antithrombin III, and plasminogen. Subjects of both sexes with hypercholesterolemia (> 6.2 mmol/L) also had significant elevations of diastolic blood pressure, plasma glucose, triglycerides, fibrinogen, and factor VIIc and reduced PT and APTT compared with subjects with lower cholesterol. The hypercholesterolemic women additionally had significant elevations of systolic blood pressure and factor VIIIc. Levels of the anticoagulant factors, antithrombin III and plasminogen, were also higher in both hypercholesterolemic men and women. In men, only factor VIIIc bad no statistically significant elevation. In women, only PT showed no statistical difference. Established coronary risk factors such as fibrinogen and factor VIIIc showed remarkable elevations in patients of both sexes. Using Pearson correlation and multiple regression, the most significant parameter related to cholesterol level was factor VIIc. The present results show that hemostatic abnormalities do exist in patients with hypercholesterolemia, and this thrombophilic phenomenon sheds further light on the study of higher cardiovascular mortality in these subjects.

0029830573	Association between hyperinsulinemia and hypertension in elderly subjects, independent of obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia	The association between hyperinsulinemia and hypertension has attracted much attention in recent years. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which hyperinsulinemia is associated with hypertension in the elderly Chinese and whether interventional therapy can improve hyperinsulinemia. This study included 144 institutionalized, healthy, nondiabetic elderly Chinese subjects were examined. Their ages ranged from 65 to 83 years, with a mean of 74 years. There were 72 men and 72 women. Forty-eight subjects were normotensive, and 96 were hypertensive; average body mass index (BMI) was 23. The hypertensive subjects could be divided into two groups: (A) untreated hypertensive (n = 48) and (B) treated hypertensive (n = 48). Fasting venous blood samples from every subject were collected with background data such as age, gender, and BMI. Fasting, 1-h, and 2-h insulin level were all measured after a 75-g oral glucose load. Plasma insulin levels (fasting, 1-h, 2-h) were significantly higher in the untreated hypertensive group. For the treated hypertensive group, plasma insulin levels were higher than normotensive group, but did not reach statistical significance and the insulin levels were lower than the untreated hypertensive group. Age, BMI, waist/hip ratio, and levels of fasting glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol were not significantly different between normotensive and hypertensive subjects. This study indicates that hyperinsulinemia - independent of hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity - is associated with hypertension in these nondiabetic, healthy Chinese elderly. Lifestyle modification probably accounts for lower levels of fasting and postabsorptive insulin levels in the treated hypertensive subjects.

0029877632	Influence of contraceptive pill use, premenopause and postmenopausal state on hemostatic parameters in ethnic Chinese women	Background: Epidemiological studies has shown that increased fibrinogen and factor VIIc are two independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Postmenopausal women have a higher incidence of CVD than premenopausal women; one possible explanation is the increase of fibrinogen. Purpose: This study was undertaken to evaluate the influence of oral contraceptive pill use and postmenopausal status on coagulation factors in ethnic Chinese women. Patients and methods: This study included 1402 women aged 40-55 years, with 288 premenopausal women taking oral contraceptives and 364 postmenopausal women. All subjects underwent blood examination of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, factor VIIc, factor VIIIc, plasminogen, and antithrombin III. Results: Data show that oral contraceptives users had a significant increase in plasminogen (91.7 ± 40.7 vs. 80.0 ± 26.5%; p < 0.01), while the levels of other hemostatic parameters were similar to non-contraceptive pill users. Postmenopausal women also had higher levels of plasminogen (113 ± 36.2 vs. 108.7 ± 30.7%; p = 0.06); the other parameters also show no statistical significance. Conclusions: Contrary to previous reports, which show elevation of fibrinogen and antithrombin III in menopause and in pill users, this study shows that only plasminogen levels exhibit a statistically significant contraceptive trend in Chinese women. Whether racial difference may account for the discrepancy in the present results needs further evaluation.

0029920305	Trilinolein preserves mitochondria ultrastructure in isolated rat heart subjected to global ischemia through antioxidant activity as measured by chemiluminescence	Oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR) have been proposed as the cause of myocardial damage through lipid peroxidation during ischemia and reperfusion. Antioxidants can effectively ameliorate the damage induced by lipid peroxidation. Trilinolein is a triacylglycerol recently purified from the well known traditional Chinese herb Panax pseudoginseng, which has been used in treating circulatory disorders among Chinese for hundreds of years; it has linoleate as the only fatty acid residue in all three esterified positions of glycerol. This chemical has recently been demonstrated to have antioxidant activity by enhanced chemiluminescence. The addition of phorbol myristic acetate (PMA) to medium containing leukocytes produces OFR; this phenomenon was measured by chemiluminescence. Addition of trilinolein to medium containing leukocytes preceding the addition of PMA suppressed the production of OFR. The control value of chemiluminescence of a medium containing leukocytes with addition of PMA was 9.23 ± 1.19 x 10

0029947979	Effectiveness and safety of low-dose pravastatin and squalene, alone and in combination, in elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia	A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose (10 mg) pravastatin and squalene (860 mg), either alone or in combination therapy, with placebo in the treatment of elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia. Ambulatory elderly patients (N = 102) were assigned in randomized fashion to receive active treatment or placebo for 20 weeks after o single-blind placebo lead-in period of 8 weeks. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma were at least 250 mg/dL and less than 300 mg/dL, respectively. Concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins were measured, and clinical laboratory tests included liver function and creatine kinase determinations. Pravastatin 10 mg daily was more effective than squalene in reducing total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides and in increasing levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Combination therapy significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol to a greater extent than either drug alone. Adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities were generally mild and transient in all groups, and all but two patients finished the study. The incidence of side effects was low; myopathy did not occur. Coadministration of pravastatin and squalene combined the specific effects of the two drugs on lipoprotein concentrations. This combination may be useful and more cost-effective in elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia, who might have a higher incidence of side effects when using larger doses of pravastatin alone.

0029988742	Diagnostic imaging of Salmonella-related mycotic aneurysm of aorta by CT	The purpose of this study was to review the computed tomography (CT) appearance of mycotic aneurysm of the aorta caused by Salmonella infection. Eight patients were suggested to have mycotic aneurysm of the aorta by clinical presentation of fever, abdominal or back pain, leukocytosis, and pulsatile abdominal mass in addition to positive blood or tissue culture of salmonella. All underwent plain radiography, abdominal sonography, and CT for confirmation. Five patients died during hospitalization despite medical or surgical treatment. CT features of mycotic aneurysm of aorta included (a) hazy aortic wall with rupture; (b) gas-forming inflammation around the aneurysm; (c) retroperitoneal paraaortic fluid collection and vertebral erosion; and (d) thrombus formation within a false lumen after aneurysmal rupture. Because of its availability and noninvasiveness, CT is the major diagnostic modality to use for Salmonella-related mycotic aneurysm.

0030575828	The in vitro antioxidant activity of trilinolein and other lipid-related natural substances as measured by enhanced chemiluminescence	There is abundant evidence for the premise that oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR) mediate ischemia/reperfusion injury to the myocardium. OFR scavengers such as superoxide dismutase can effectively reduce damage through lipid peroxidation during ischemia/reperfusion. Enhanced chemiluminescence, which has been used to measure OFR, was used to measure the antioxidant activity of fatty acids (palmitic and linoleic acid) and triglycerides (triolein, tristearin) and natural plant antioxidants (magnolol, catechin, trilinolein). Trilinolein, which has recently been isolated from natural products, as well as the well-known water soluble analogue of vitamine E - Trolox, were used as control.

0030339382	Values of Blood Coagulating Factors Vary with Ambient Temperature: The Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Two-Township Study in Taiwan	Seasonal influence on mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is well documented. Understanding the seasonal variations in cardiovascular risk factors can shed light on this phenomenon. Elevation of coagulation factors during cold weather may in part explain the higher mortality from myocardial infarction and stroke in winter. The Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Community Study (CVDFACTS) included subjects belonging to 2 cohorts located in northern and southern Taiwan. This study included 2877 subjects aged 18 and above whose blood levels were examined for various coagulating factors. Besides measuring conventional cardiovascular risk factors including: blood pressure, body mass index and total cholesterol, values for blood fibrinogen, factor VII activity, factor VIII activity, plasminogen, antithrombin III, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were determined for all subjects. Of these hemostatic parameters, levels of all, except prothrombin time, were statistically different between days with mean temperature >20 °C and days with temperature <20 °C (P>0.01). In cold weather, a greater tendency to clot in circulatory system was demonstrated in this study, indicating seasonal variations may be demonstrated in this subtropical region.

0030735046	Effect of trilinolein on superoxide dismutase activity and left ventricular pressure in isolated rat hearts subjected to hypoxia and normoxic perfusion	Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in the development of myocardial injury during hypoxia/reperfusion. Antioxidants can effectively inhibit the formation of free radicals and ameliorate the myocardial damage which may occur during hypoxia/reperfusion. Trilinolein is a triacylglycerol recently purified from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Panax pseudo-ginseng. It has linoleic-acid residues as the only type of fatty acid residue in all three esterified positions of the triacyglycerol, It has been proposed that decreased endogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity may contribute to free radical-mediated reperfusion injury of the ischemic myocardium. In the present study, when isolated rat hearts were subjected to hypoxia for 10, 30, 60 and 90 min without normoxic perfusion, a significant decrease in Mn-SOD activity was shown throughout the period of hypoxia, whereas the Cu·Zn-SOD activity was increased at 10 and 30 min but was not different from the baseline at 60 and 90 min of hypoxia.

0030746060	Additive effects of diltiazem and lisinopril in the treatment of elderly patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension	A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with multifactorial design was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, in a sustained release preparation, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril, in the treatment of elderly Chinese patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. In addition to the hypotensive effects of combinations of both drugs compared with monotherapy, all given once daily, the effect on quality of life was also evaluated. This study consisted of a 3 x 2 multifactorial design in which 156 women and men with a sitting diastolic pressure of between 95 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg, after a 4-week placebo washout phase, were randomized to one of six treatment groups for 12 weeks of active treatment. Monotherapy with diltiazem 120 or 240 mg produced increasing reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with placebo, lisinopril 10 mg had an effect intermediate between the diltiazem doses. The combinations of diltiazem 240 mg + lisinopril 10 mg and diltiazem 120 mg + lisinopril 10 mg showed increased efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to these drug doses used in monotherapy, but the effect of the combinations was less than predicted by an additive model. Although the total number of other adverse events reported was similar for all active treatment groups compared to placebo, lisinopril-induced cough was common with an incidence of 31% after rechallenge. Premature drug withdrawal was necessary in four of 78 patients receiving lisinopril, due to intractable cough. The combination of diltiazem 240 mg and lisinopril 10 mg was significantly more effective at reducing blood pressure than either drug alone; this additive effect did not result in a higher rate of adverse effects or impairment of quality of life. Thus, combination therapy with these agents was well tolerated and resulted in increased efficacy in these elderly patients.

0030847883	Left ventricular filling profiles in young white-coat hypertensive patients without hypertrophy	This study was to assess left ventricular diastolic function in young white-coat hypertensive subjects <50 years of age without hypertrophy. Hypertensive patients (systolic or diastolic blood pressure ≤140 or ≤90 mmHg on all three visits) were defined as white coat if their average 24- hour blood pressure was <127/81 mmHg and at least 18/16 mmHg lower than their average office values. We chose three groups balanced for sex, age, and body mass index: 50 sustained hypertensives, 25 white-coat hypertensives, and 25 normotensives. Office blood pressure was similar in white-coat and sustained hypertensives. Ambulatory blood pressure was comparable in white-coat hypertensives and normotensives. Compared with normotensives, white-coat hypertensives had more impaired diastolic function: increased ratio of late to early filling velocities, raised ratio of late to early time-velocity integral, prolonged deceleration time, and lengthened isovolumic relaxation time (P<.001, P<.001, P=.002, and P<.001, respectively). No difference was noticed between white-coat and sustained hypertensives. Compared with normotensives, white-coat hypertensives had higher values of plasma and urine norepinephrine (P<.001 and P<.001, respectively), plasma and urine aldosterone (P<.001 and P=.002, respectively), plasma renin activity (P=.04), total cholesterol (P=.001), and LDL cholesterol (P<.001). No difference was observed between white-coat and sustained hypertensives. Within white-coat hypertensives, 24-hour urinary aldosterone closely correlated with the ratio of late to early filling velocities (P=.008), and plasma and 24-hour urinary norepinephrine correlated well with total cholesterol (P=.037 and P=.006, respectively). No correlation was detected within the sustained hypertensives and normotensives. Heightened neurohumoral activity clearly supported the progression of diastolic dysfunction and metabolic abnormality in white-coat hypertensives.

A randomized, double-blind, stratified, parallel-group comparison of lisinopril at 10 mg, losartan at 50 mg, and metolazone at 1 mg, each given once daily for a maximum of 10 weeks, was performed in four hypertension clinics in four centers in two countries. Cough was detected by a questionnaire (the primary end point) given to elderly patients with hypertension, and the cough frequency was quantified by a visual analog scale (a secondary end point). A total of 84 elderly patients with hypertension, all who were nonsmokers with ACE inhibitor-induced cough and were confirmed by lisinopril rechallenge then placebo dechallenge, were randomized to the three treatment groups. The incidence of cough with losartan (18%) was significantly lower than with lisinopril (97%) and similar to that for metolazone (21%). Cough frequency evaluated by the visual analog scale was significantly lower for losartan than for lisinopril and similar to that for metolazone. The specific, selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan is associated with a decrease in the incidence of cough in patients with previous ACE inhibitor- induced cough.

0030481477	The clustering of cardiovascular and haemostatic risk factors in newly diagnosed type II diabetes	Background. In diabetic patients, the clustering of coronary risk factors has been well-recognized. Early detection and modification can reduce overall mortality. In addition to reviewing the conventional risk factors, this study investigated whether other important risk factors exist for ethnic Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Methods and Results. This study included 2,653 middle-aged ethnic Chinese (male 1129, female 1524) recruited from two geographically different communities. Among these subjects, 115 presented with the newly-diagnosed type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus (male, 51; female, 64). Biochemical data and apolipoprotein A and B were gathered, and hematological studies of coagulation factors were also performed. Hypertension already existed at a higher incidence in these diabetic patients. Statistically significant elevation of fibrinogen, fasting insulin, triglyceride and obesity were noted in both sexes. Hematological study demonstrated significant reduction of activated partial thromboplastin time and elevation of factor VIIIc in both sexes, whereas the female diabetic patients also exhibited a significant elevation of both factor VIIc and plasminogen. Conclusion. In addition to the conventional coronary risk factors, type 2 diabetic patients also manifested thrombophilia which constitutes an additional risk for cardiovascular mortality. Female diabetic patients appeared to be at higher risk than males.

The patients had a total plasma cholesterol level of at least 250 mg/dL and had been, for at least 3 months, consuming a standard lipid-lowering diet (American Heart Association Step 1 Diet). Elderly hypertensive patients (n = 76) were randomized to receive treatment with either placebo (n = 38) or simvastatin (n = 38). The dosage consisted of 10 mg simvastatin daily during the 3-month trial. During that period, in the simvastatin group, plasma levels of total cholesterol and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly (27% and 33%, respectively) compared with those levels in plasma in the placebo group. The plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased (7%), whereas triglyceride levels slightly decreased (8%). There were no serious side effects, and simvastatin was generally well tolerated. Fasting hyperinsulinemia also improved (-21%) after 3 months of simvastatin therapy. Results of this study confirmed that a low dose (10 mg) of simvastatin daily is a safe and effective method of reducing plasma levels of total and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive elderly patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive drug therapy, and that it has the additional potential benefit of reducing plasma levels of insulin.

Treatment with quinine is a common practice, but the effectiveness of the drug is doubtful and adverse drug effects are common. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitamin B complex capsules (fursulthiamine 50 mg, hydroxocobalamin 250 μg, pyridoxal phosphate 30 mg, and riboflavin 5 mg) in 28 elderly patients with hypertension who had severe nocturnal leg cramps that disturbed their sleep. Self-reported ratings of leg cramp frequency, duration, and intensity were used to evaluate severity of nocturnal leg cramps. Both the patients taking vitamin B capsules (n = 14) and those taking placebo (n = 14) received medications three times daily, and were examined regularly at 2-week intervals for 3 months. After 3 months, 86% of the patients taking vitamin B had prominent remission of leg cramps, whereas those taking placebo had no significant difference from baseline. Treatment with vitamin B complex significantly reduced the frequency, intensity, and duration of nocturnal leg cramps. Because quinine is not without potential for side effects, and vitamin B complex is a relatively safe and effective alternative, clinicians should reconsider the treatment of choice for nocturnal leg cramps.

It has previously been shown to reduce blood pressure in studies in animals and human. The effect of intravenous stevioside on the blood pressure was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The hypotensive effect on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was dose-dependent for intravenous doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg in conscious SHR. The maximum reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 31.4 ± 4.2% and 40.8 ± 5.6% (mean ± SEM) respectively and the hypotensive effect lasted for more than 60 min with a dose of 200 mg/kg. Serum dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were not changed significantly 60 min after intravenous injection of stevioside 100 mg/kg in anesthetized SHR. The present data show that stevioside given intravenously to conscious SHR was effective in blood pressure reduction and there was no change in serum catecholamines in anaesthetized animals with this natural compound.

2342656374	Advanced glycosylation end products induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression via a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway	Background. Advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) accumulation in tissue has been implicated in diabetic related complications, including diabetic nephropathy. Activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) ameliorates diabetic nephropathy. Methods. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AGEs on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production, and the effects of rosiglitazone, an activator of PPAR-γ, on AGE-induced iNOS expression and nitrite release in glomerular mesangial cells. Results. AGEs caused a dose- and time-dependent increase of iNOS induction and nitrite accumulation in mesangial cells. A protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), or a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor (SB203580) suppressed AGE-induced iNOS expression and nitrite release from mesangial cells. Addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-AGEs to mesangial cells increased p38 MAPK activities. Activation of PPAR-γ by rosiglitazone inhibited AGE-induced iNOS expression, nitrite release, and p38 MAPK activation in mesangial cells. AGE-stimulated nitrite release was attenuated by pretreatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and anti-transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) antibodies. AGE-induced iNOS expression was inhibited by treatment with a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor, pyrrolidone dithiocarbamate. Addition of BSA-AGEs to mesangial cells stimulated p65 NF-κB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Conclusion. These data suggest that cytokine release, NF-κB and p38 MAPK-dependent pathways may play a role in AGE-induced iNOS expression and subsequent nitric oxide production in mesangial cells. Rosiglitazone may prevent AGE-induced iNOS expression by interfering with p38 MAPK activity.

33644685199	Tetramethylpyrazine downregulates angiotensin II-induced endothelin-1 gene expression in vascular endothelial cells	1. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is one of the active ingredients of the Chinese herb Ligusticum wallichii Franchat. It is well documented that TMP exerts a cardiovascular protective effect. The aims of the present study were to examine whether TMP alters angiotenisn (Ang) II-induced endothelin (ET)-1 gene expression and to identify the putative underlying signalling pathways in vascular endothelial cells. 2. Cultured vascular endothelial cells were pre-incubated with TMP, stimulated with AngII and ET-1 gene expression was then examined. The effects of TMP pretreatment on AngII-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation were investigated to elucidate the intracellular mechanism responsible for the effects of TMP on ET-1 gene expression. 3. Tetramethylpyrazine inhibited AngII-induced ET-1 gene expression, as revealed by nothern blotting and a promoter activity assay. Tetramethylpyrazine also inhibited the AngII-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), as measured by the redox sensitive fluorescent dye 2′ 7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and ERK phosphorylation. 4. In summary, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that TMP inhibits AngII-induced ROS generation, ERK phosphorylation and ET-1 gene expression in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, the present study delivers important new insights into the molecular pathways that may contribute to the proposed beneficial effects of TMP in the cardiovascular system.

33745127751	Dipyridamole activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 mediates inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells	Dipyridamole is a nucleoside transport inhibitor and a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor. However, the mechanisms by which dipyridamole exerts its anti-inflammatory effects are not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in dipyridamole's anti-inflammatory effects. We show that dipyridamole inhibited interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion, inducible nitric oxide synthase protein expression, nitrite accumulation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Dipyridamole inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway as demonstrated by inhibition of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) phosphorylation, IκB degradation, p65 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, and transcription of the reporter gene. Dipyridamole also inhibited LPS-stimulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and IκB kinase-beta (IKK-β) activities in RAW 264.7 cells. A p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580, inhibited LPS-stimulated COX-2 expression and IKK-β activation suggesting that LPS may activate the NF-κB signaling pathway via upstream p38 MAPK activation. Furthermore, dipyridamole stimulated transient activation of MKP-1, a potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK function. Knockdown of MKP-1 by transfecting MKP-1 siRNA or inhibition of MKP-1 by the specific inhibitor, triptolide, significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of dipyridamole on COX-2 expression induced by LPS. Taken together, these data suggest that dipyridamole exerts its anti-inflammatory effect via activation of MKP-1, which dephosphorylates and inactivates p38 MAPK. Inactivation of p38 MAPK in turn inhibits IKK-β activation and subsequently the NF-κB signaling pathway that mediates LPS-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33748618426	Tetramethylpyrazine attenuates adriamycin-induced apoptotic injury in rat renal tubular cells NRK-52E	Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), a compound purified from Rhizoma Ligustici, is a widely used active ingredient in Chinese herbal medicine to treat cardiovascular diseases on account of its vasodilatory actions and antiplatelet activity. Studies have shown that TMP can remove oxygen free radicals and protect rat kidney from ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, adriamycin-induced nephrosis in rats is commonly used in pharmacological studies of human chronic renal diseases. Apoptosis of renal tubular cells has been reported in adriamycin-treated rats. To examine the therapeutic potential of TMP on chronic progressive renal diseases, adriamycin-induced injury in rat renal tubular cells NRK-52E has been used to monitor its protective effect. In TUNEL staining, TMP showed a dose-dependent protective effect against adriamycin-induced apoptosis in NRK-52E cells. Pretreatment of the cells with 10 or 100 μM of TMP effectively decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation induced by adriamycin, as measured in fluorescent assays. TMP was found to reduce the adriamycin-stimulated activities of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, inhibit adriamycin-induced release of cytochrome c, and elevate the expression of Bcl-x

3543063032	Spontaneous transition from atrial fibrillation to typical atrial flutter during catheter ablation of the pulmonary vein	A 71-year-old male patient was admitted for catheter ablation of the pulmonary veins to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation originating from the left superior pulmonary vein was induced after a pause of atrial pacing under isoproterenol infusion and became sustained. Spontaneous transition from atrial fibrillation to typical atrial flutter was noted after complete isolation of the pulmonary vein focus from the left atrium. Subsequently linear ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was created with completely bidirectional isthmus conduction block. We hypothesized that ectopic pulmonary vein focus played an important role in the spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation to typical atrial flutter, and complete isolation of the pulmonary vein could stop the spontaneous transition between the two atrial tachyarrhythmias.

36549062126	The effects of simple eight-week regular exercise on cardiovascular disease risk factors in middle-aged women at risk in Taiwan	Background: The effects of exercise on cardiovascular disease risk factors among middle-aged women at risk of the disease in Taiwan remained unclear. Methods: Thirty-six women (35-64 years) with more than 1 traditional cardiovascular risk factor were equally assigned into the exercise group (with a treadmill training program for 30 minutes each time, 3 times a week for 8 weeks, n = 18) and a control group (maintained their previous lifestyles, n = 18). Blood biochemistries, resting blood pressure, body composition, and mood state were evaluated before and after the 8-week period. Results: Compared with the baseline, the exercise group had significantly lower body mass index (p = 0.01), waist-to-hip ratio (p = 0.04), and systolic (p = 0.01) and diastolic (p < 0.001) blood pressure, as well as a better mood state (p < 0.01) after 8 weeks of exercise. However, the control group did not have significant changes in the parameters. Comparison between the groups showed that the exercise group had significant changes in waist-to-hip ratio (p = 0.03) and mood state (p = 0.04). Using multivariable linear regression model, we demonstrated that exercise was significantly related to waist to hip ratio (β = -0.43, p = 0.02) and total mood scores (β = -0.37, p = 0.04) after adjustment for age, menopause, and previous hormone replacement therapy. Conclusion: A simple 8-week exercise program is able to effectively modify cardiovascular risk factors, such as the waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, and the mood state in Taiwanese women at risk of the disease.

36248932162	Changes of serum β-endorphin by programmed exercise training are correlated with improvement of clinical symptoms and quality of life in female mitral valve prolapse syndrome	Background: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common entity in female population. Although this is a minor disease, it may cause annoying symptoms that impair quality of life (QOL), and no established therapy for this problem. The aim of this study isto examine whether programmed exercise training by treadmill in female MVP syndrome would improve clinical symptoms and QOL. Methods: An interventional study of 39 females with MVP syndrome with treadmill exercise endurance training for 12 weeks. Every individual received training for 30 min a day, thrice a week for 12 weeks. Baseline and post-exercise at 12 weeks serum β-endorphins were measured. Symptom improvement was assessed by the MVP symptom checklist questionnaire and the Euro-QOL-5D was used to measure QOL improvement in these females. Results: The mean serum β-endorphin increased from 0.5 to 1.68 ng/ml (p = 0.001) in the exercise group (n = 18) after 12 weeks exercise, whereas the control group (n = 21) did not show any significant changes (0.44 vs. 0.43 ng/ml). Major symptoms of MVP such as chest pain, palpitation, fatigue were improved significantly by the assessment of MVP symptom checklist. The QOL of the exercised females also showed significant changes. Conclusions: Through programmed exercise training in these MVP females, the improvement of symptoms and QOL is parallel to the increase of serum β-endorphin. This result implicates that MVP females should initiate exercise to tackle this annoying problem. Copyright © 2007 S. Karger AG.

0033005439	Calcium influx inhibition: Possible mechanism of the negative effect of tetrahydropalmatine on left ventricular pressure in isolated rat heart	The active ingredient dl-tetrahydropalmatine (THP) isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Corydalis racemosa has been found to have antihypertensive effects. However, severe cardiac and neurological toxic effects were reported from using this herb for the treatment of pain. In an isolated perfused rat heart model, THP at the concentration of 100 μM was found to have a negative effect (-45%) on left ventricular pressure and this effect was produced concentration-dependently from concentrations lower than 50 μM. In isolated cardiomyocytes, radioactive calcium influx was also inhibited significantly by THP at the concentration of 100 μM and this effect was also in a concentration-dependent manner (-39%). In a patient with latent heart disease, the use of Corydalis should probably be detrimental, the toxic effect was probably due to calcium influx inhibition.

0033376207	Subtype of neuropeptide Y receptor in the heart of Wistar rat	Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-amino acid peptide, is stored with noradrenaline (NA) in sympathetic nerves, particularly those which serve the cardiovascular regulation. However, little is known about the cardiac action of NPY. This study investigated the subtypes of neuropeptide Y receptors in the heart of Wistar rats. The isolated rat heart (Wistar rat, weighing 320- 350g) was suspended in a Langendorff apparatus. The Change of left ventricular pressure (LVP) was measured during the perfusion of different NPY receptor agonist and antagonist. Perfusion with NPY induced a decrease of LVP in a concentration-dependent manner from 1 nm to 5 nm (LVP decreased to 42.2 ± 0.9% of the basal tone at 5 nm). Treatment with NPY

0033385652	Inducibility of atrial fibrillation during atrioventricular pacing with varying intervals: Role of atrial electrophysiology and the autonomic nervous system	Introduction: Patients receiving VVI pacemakers have a higher incidence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) than those receiving DDD pacemakers. However, the mechanism behind the difference is not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether atrial electrophysiology and the autonomic nervous system play a role in the occurrence of AF during AV pacing. Methods and Results: The study population consisted of 28 patients who had (group I, n = 15) or did not have (group II, n = 13) AF induced by a single extrastimulus during pacing with different AV intervals. Atrial pressure, atrial size, atrial effective refractory periods, and atrial dispersion were evaluated during pacing with different AV intervals. Twenty- four-hour heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity also were examined. Atrial pressure, atrial size, effective refractory periods in the right posterolateral atrium and distal coronary sinus, and atrial dispersion increased as the AV interval shortened from 160 to 0 msec. During AV pacing, group I patients had greater minimal (52 ± 17 vs 25 ± 7 msec; P < 0.005) and maximal (76 ± 16 vs 36 ± 9 msec; P < 0.005) atrial dispersion than group II patients. The differences in atrial size and atrial dispersion among different AV intervals were greater in patients with AF than in those without AF. Baroreflex sensitivity (6.6 ± 1.7 vs 3.9 ± 1.0; P < 0.00005), but not heart rate variability, was higher in patients with AF than in those without AF. Conclusion: Abnormal atrial electrophysiology and higher vagal reflex activity can play important roles in the genesis of AF in patients receiving pacemakers.

0032758164	The antihypertensive effect of the berberine derivative 6-protoberberine in spontaneously hypertensive rats	Berberine is a natural isoquinoline alkaloid found in plants of the Ranunculaceae and Berberidaceae families. Extracts from berberine-containing plants have been used as traditional Chinese folk remedies for centuries. The antihypertensive effects of the herberine derivative 6-protoberberine (PTB-6) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In conscious SHRs, PTB-6 lowered the systolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner (6-PTB: 5 mg/kg, -31.1 ± 1.6 mmHg; 10 mg/kg, -42.4 ± 3.1 mmHg). Cardiac output using the thermodilution method was reduced in PTB-6-treated anesthetized SHRs with a tendency to decrease in heart rate. Injection of PTB-6 into the intraceral ventricles of SHRs lowered the systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The berberine derivative PTB-6 is an effective antihypertensive agent. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of PTB-6 is probably through a central sympatholytic effect.

0033516592	Effect of trilinolein on the activity and gene expression of superoxide dismutase in cultured rat brain astrocytes	Cerebrovascular disease is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in recent. Oxygen free radicals produced during cerebral infarction increases the damage to neurons. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the endogenous antioxidant enzyme that can effectively scavenge superoxide radicals. Trilinolein is a lipophilic antioxidant purified from the herb of Panax pseudoginseng. In the cultured rat brain astrocytes (RBA), the activity of SOD (both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD subtypes) was markedly increased by incubation with trilinolein at low concentration (0.1 μM) for 2 days. This stimulatory effect of trilinolein was not related to the incubating concentration. However, long-term (7 days) incubation with trilinolein at same concentration decreased the activity. Similar changes were also observed in the gene expression of SOD in RBA; short-term (2 days) incubation of RBA by 0.1 μM trilinolein increased the mRNA level that was lowered in RBA received a long- term incubation with 0.1 μM trilinolein. This result shows that trilinolein is an effective antioxidant to increase the activity of SOD in RBA which would be beneficial to neurons subjected to oxygen free radical damage. However, long-term medication of antioxidant shall be concerned.

0032824081	Relationship between hemostatic factors and known cardiovascular disease correlates in two suburban populations in Taiwan	The Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Factor Two-Township Study is a longitudinal cardiovascular epidemiologic study of two suburban towns in Taiwan. Analyzing baseline data from 1,080 men and 1,510 women aged 18 and above, this paper focuses on the relationship of several hemostatic factors to CVD correlates: blood lipids, apolipoproteins, glucose, and uric acid, and blood pressure. Information on these relationships can shed light on whether hemostatic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD independently or through known mechanisms. Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze the data. In the population studied, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B had the strongest correlations with all hemostatic factors tested. Triglyceride was also strongly associated with factor VIIc. Factor VIIIc, factor VIIc, and fibrinogen, ordered by the strength of the correlation, were positively and significantly correlated with glucose, uric acid, and blood pressure levels. The associations of apolipoprotein B and cholesterol with fibrinogen (p = 0.14-0.20) were not as strong as those with factors VIIc (p = 0.28-0.37) and VIIIc (p = 0.15-0.30). Factors VIIc and VIIIc were independently associated with most clinical variables studied, including the levels of cholesterol components, triglyceride, glucose, uric acid, and diastolic blood pressure. These finding indicate that states of coagulating factors correlated, to varied degrees, with levels of blood lipid parameters, uric acid, and blood pressure in the population studied.

0032860895	Changes of superoxide dismutase in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) by an incubation of vitamin E	Supplementation of antioxidants such as vitamin E and vitamin C as health promotion food is popular recently. Epidemiological studies supported the beneficial effect of these antioxidants because oxygen free radicals have been linked to the process of diseases and aging. The present study evaluated the effect of α-tocopherol (vitamin E) on the changes of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) after a short-term (2 days) or long-term (7 days) incubation. Incubation of A7r5 cells with vitamin E at a concentration of 50 μmol/l for 2 days caused an increase of both the activity and mRNA level of SOD. At higher concentrations, such as 100 or 200 μmol/l, vitamin E failed to enhance SOD more effectively. However, after incubation for 7 days, vitamin E caused a decrease in both the activity and mRNA level of SOD in a concentration-dependent manner. Otherwise, the protein amount of SOD remained the same in these samples regardless of the concentration of vitamin E or the duration of incubation. The obtained results suggest that vitamin E can increase the effect of SOD to result in the beneficial influence of this antioxidant only at low concentration under a short-term supplementation because a down-regulation of SOD was observed in cells receiving a long-term incubation.

0032898340	Effects of losartan on the sexual behavior of male rats	Many commonly used antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics and beta-blockers can interfere with sexual function in both sexes, causing loss of libido, impairment of erectile function and ejaculation in men, and delay or prevent orgasm in women. Newly developed antihypertensive drugs should ideally not interfere with the patients' quality of life including sexual function. This study examined the effects of losartan, a nonpeptide, specific antagonist for type I angiotensin II receptors, on the male sexual behavior of rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with losartan 30 mg/kg/day or saline control for 7, 30 and 90 days. Dark-cycle video recording was used to analyze the male sexual activities of the rats. No significant alteration in male sexual performance was observed after 7 and 30 days of treatment with losartan. In contrast, SHRs treated with propranolol 5 mg/kg/day showed increases in intromission latency, ejaculation latency and postejaculatory period indicating decreased libido and erectile and ejaculatory function. Upon completion of 90 days of losartan administration, the mount latency of the SHR was significantly increased, suggesting a decrease in libido although other parameters were unchanged and there was no effect in WKY rats. It is therefore concluded that losartan may have an advantage in preservation of sexual function when used clinically for the treatment of hypertensive disorders.

0033661499	Effects of trilinolein on superoxide dismutase activity and mRNA levels in aortic smooth muscle cells	1. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Western countries. Oxygen free radicals are considered to be intimately involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Anti-oxidants may help to protect mammalian cells from the damage induced by these reactive oxygen species. Many reports have indicated that anti-oxidants used in the treatment or prevention of disease could modify the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD). However, the effects of long-term anti-oxidant treatment on the levels of SOD in smooth muscle cells (SMC) is still unclear. In the present study, the effects of the lipophilic anti-oxidant trilinolein on the activity and gene expression of SOD in SMC were evaluated. 2. After 2 days incubation with 0.1 μmol/L trilinolein, the activity and mRNA levels of SOD were increased in rat aortic SMC (A7r5), but there was no significant change in these parameters with a higher concentration of 1 μmol/L trilinolein. 3. In contrast, after 7 days incubation with trilinolein, both the activity and mRNA levels of SOD were lowered in a dose-dependent manner. 4. These data emphasize the importance of choosing an optimal dosage for supplementation with anti-oxidants in humans for the scavenging of oxygen free radicals.

0033302623	Superoxide dismutase gene expression and activity in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive rats	Objective: To determine if changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain occur in the hypertensive state. Methods: We compared the levels of the two main subtypes of this enzyme in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats using enzyme activity estimation, Western blotting for enzyme contents, and Northern blotting of mRNA level. Five discrete brain regions, cerebrocortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, the remaining non-cortex cerebrum (NCC area), and cerebellum, were employed for comparison in 30-31 weeks old rats. Results: A lower level of both Mn-SOD activity and Mn-SOD mRNA expression was found in all areas of the brain of SHR as compared with WKY rats. Also, the mRNA levels of Cu, Zn-SOD in the brain of SHR differed from WKY rats in parallel to the enzyme activities. The activity and mRNA expression of Cu, Zn-SOD were lower in the hypothalamus and cerebellum of SHR but the mRNA level and the activity in hippocampus were significantly higher in the SHR compared to WKY rats. No differences for Cu, Zn-SOD were observed in cerebrocortex or NCC area in the two species. However, the amount of SOD enzyme subtypes, determined by Western blotting analysis, was not different between SHR and WKY rats. Conclusions: The results indicate a lower gene expression and less activity of Mn-SOD in SHR brain. This alternation of SOD may be one of the important factors for the vulnerability of the brain from oxygen free radicals or may be related to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this species.

Sexually active 9-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were given losartan 60 mg/kg intraperitoneal injections. Mean blood pressure (MBP) dropped significantly in both SHR and WKY rats (for SHR: from 140 ± 8 to 114 ± 5 mm Hg, p < 0.05, n = 8; for WKY: from 113 ± 7 to 79 ± 9 mm Hg, p < 0.05, n = 8). On the contrary, the intracavernous pressure (ICP) of SHR and WKY rats did not differ significantly from that of the corresponding controls receiving saline injections (p > 0.05, n = 8 for each group). For the chronic study, the rats were fed with losartan 30 mg/kg/day for 30 days.

Previous animal studies have shown that stevioside has an antihypertensive effect. This study was to designed to evaluate the effect of stevioside in human hypertension. Methods: A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken. This study group consisted of 106 Chinese hypertensive subjects with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mmHg and ages ranging from 28 to 75 years with 60 subjects (men 34, women 26; mean ± s.d, 54.1±3.8 years) allocated to active treatment and 46 (men 19, women 27; mean ±s.d, 53.7±4.1 years) to placebo treatment. Each subject was given capsules containing stevioside (250 mg) or placebo thrice daily and followed-up at monthly intervals for 1 year. Results: After 3 months, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the stevioside group decreased significantly (systolic: 166.0±9.4-152.6±6.8 mmHg; diastolic: 104.7±5.2-90.3±3.6 mmHg, P<0.05), and the effect persisted during the whole year. Blood biochemistry parameters including lipid and glucose showed no significant changes. No significant adverse effect was observed and quality of life assessment showed no deterioration. Conclusions: This study shows that oral stevioside is a well tolerated and effective modality that may be considered as an alternative or supplementary therapy for patients with hypertension.

39349102362	Prostacyclin protects renal tubular cells from gentamicin-induced apoptosis via a PPARα-dependent pathway	To study the protective effect of prostacyclin (PGI2) we increased PGI2 production by infected NRK-52E cells with an adenovirus carrying cyclooxygenase-1 and prostacyclin synthase. PGI2 overexpression protected these cells from gentamicin-induced apoptosis by reducing cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, cytochrome c, and decreasing generation of reactive oxygen species. Expression of the nuclear receptor of PGI2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα), was reduced during gentamicin treatment of the cells, while its overexpression significantly inhibited gentamicin-induced apoptosis and the amount of cleaved caspase-3. Transformation with PPARα short interfering RNA abolished the protective effect of PGI2 overproduction in gentamicin-treated cells. The PPARα activator docosahexaenoic acid given to gentamicin-treated mice significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in renal cortex, but this protective effect was not seen in PPARα knockout mice. Our study suggests that increased endogenous PGI2 production protects renal tubular cells from gentamicin-induced apoptosis through a PPARα-signaling pathway. © 2008 International Society of Nephrology.

32344432531	Left ventricular aneurysm with normal coronary angiogram: A case report and literature review	Most left ventricular aneurysms (LVA) develop in the atherosclerotic occlusive coronary artery disease following a transmural myocardial infarction. However, occasionally, LVA associated with normal coronary artery was found as well in dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Chagas's disease, sarcoidosis, chest trauma, and congenital malformation. We report a 53-year-old male who had systolic heart failure owing to a posterior wall aneurysm of the left ventricle, which was found unintentionally during echocardiographic examination. Subsequent stress thallium scan revealed irreversible defects in the inferolateral wall and apex, and coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. The patient remained well under medical control for a follow-up period of 40 months. Previously undiagnosed inferoposterior wall myocardial infarction caused by thromboembolism with spontaneous reperfusion may be considered in this patient.

0034546342	Evaluation of absorbed radiation dose to working staff during cardiac catheterization procedures	Background. Cardiac catheterization has been used frequently for the evaluation and treatment of patients with heart diseases. The working staff, particularly cardiologists who perform these procedures, have the highest potential risk of receiving high radiation doses due to close contact with patients. The purpose of this study was to measure and evaluate the accumulated radiation dosage of the cardiologists while they were performing clinical procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The working environment of the catheterization laboratory was also monitored for radiation. Methods. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) with very high sensitivity were employed for dose evaluations. They were taped to various parts of the body of the cardiologists during catheterization procedures. For environmental monitoring, TLDs were also distributed at several sites of the catheterization rooms for a period of 2 to 4 weeks. Results. The study showed that the left wrist of the cardiologists received the highest radiation dose (338 microsieverts [μSv]/procedure) and the left lens received the second highest dose (149 μSv/procedure) during the procedures. The dose to the knees was unexpectedly high (92 μSv/procedure), partly due to radiation leakage from the lead curtain shielding under the patient couch. On average, the effective radiation dose per year was 37 mSv/y for a cardiologist who performs 10 catheterization procedures per week. Compare this to the occupational exposure limit of 50 mSv/y. The estimated accumulated equivalent dose to the lens was 152 mSv/y, which exceeded the regulatory limit for occupational exposure. Conclusions. Using proper lead shielding and increasing the distance from the radiation source are good strategies for reducing the radiation dose in medical staff. The work area outside the catheterization room was considered safe because the radiation level was essentially equivalent to the background radiation level.

We investigated the effect of danshen or tanshinone IIA on blood pressure and its possible mechanisms. An i.p. injection of danshen at 10mgkg(1) significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) but failed to modify the SBP in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Oral administration of tanshinone IIA also decreased SBP in SHR but not in WKY.

84897551344	Merit of ginseng in the treatment of heart failure in type 1-like diabetic rats	The present study investigated the merit of ginseng in the improvement of heart failure in diabetic rats and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors δ (PPARδ). We used streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat (STZ-rat) to screen the effects of ginseng on cardiac performance and PPARδ expression. Changes of body weight, water intake, and food intake were compared in three groups of age-matched rats; the normal control (Wistar rats) received vehicle, STZ-rats received vehicle and ginseng-treated STZ-rats. We also determined cardiac performances in addition to blood glucose level in these animals. The protein levels of PPARδ in hearts were identified using Western blotting analysis. In STZ-rats, cardiac performances were decreased but the food intake, water intake, and blood glucose were higher than the vehicle-treated control. After a 7-day treatment of ginseng in STZ-rats, cardiac output was markedly enhanced without changes in diabetic parameters. This treatment with ginseng also increased the PPARδ expression in hearts of STZ-rats. The related signal of cardiac contractility, troponin I phosphorylation, was also raised. Ginseng-induced increasing of cardiac output was reversed by the cotreatment with PPARδ antagonist GSK0660. Thus, we suggest that ginseng could improve heart failure through the increased PPARδ expression in STZ-rats. © 2014 Cheng-Chia Tsai et al.

46749106386	Effects of hesperidin on cyclic strain-induced endothelin-1 release in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	1. Hesperidin, a member of the flavanone group of flavonoids, can be isolated in large amounts from the rinds of some citrus species and has been reported to have antihypotensive and vasodilator properties. However, the mechanism of action of hesperidin in the prevention and treatment of vascular diseases remains unclear. 2. The vascular endothelium can produce potent contracting factors, such as endothelin (ET)-1, and endothelium-derived relaxing factors, such as nitric oxide (NO). The aims of the present study were to test the hypothesis that hesperidin may alter strain-induced ET-1 secretion and NO production and to identify the putative underlying signalling pathways in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). 3. Hesperidin (10 and 100 mmol/L) inhibited strain-induced ET-1 secretion. Hesperidin also inhibited strain-induced increases in the formation of reactive oxygen species and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. 4. Hesperidin treatment of HUVEC enhanced NO production, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and the phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt. Furthermore, hesperidin modulated strain-induced ET-1 release and suppressed ERK phosphorylation in part via the NO/protein kinase G pathway. 5. In summary, we have demonstrated that hesperidin inhibits strain-induced ET-1 secretion and enhances NO production in HUVEC. © 2008 The Authors.

4644359969	Double atrial potentials recorded in the coronary sinus in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: A possible mechanism of induced atrial fibrillation	Background: Double atrial potentials recorded in the coronary sinus are not an unusual phenomenon in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. They have been demonstrated to potentiate the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Methods: Two hundred and forty-eight patients were included for investigating the presence of double atrial potentials on the coronary sinus recordings during electrophysiologic study. Group 1 consisted of 136 patients with WPW syndrome and group 2 consisted of 112 patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Group 1 patients had a higher incidence of induced atrial fibrillation (AF) (27% vs. 15%, P = 0.045) than group 2 patients. In addition, the incidence of double atrial potentials was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 patients (14% vs. 2%, P = 0.001). In group 1, 19 patients with double atrial potentials had a significantly higher incidence of left lateral bypass tracts (79% vs. 39%, P = 0.001) and induced AF (47% vs. 22%, P = 0.01) than 117 patients without double atrial potentials. Conclusions: WPW syndrome, especially with a left lateral bypass tract, had a higher incidence of double atrial potentials and induced AF than AVNRT. WPW patients with double atrial potentials had a higher incidence of induced AF than those without double atrial potentials. These findings may contribute to understanding the mechanism of induced AF in WPW syndrome.

56849114504	Recurrent deep vein thrombosis caused by inherited coagulopathy in a Japanese male	Deep vein thrombosis is a common disease entity to which attention should be paid due to its complication of pulmonary embolism. This disease usually has precipitating factors such as obesity, varicose veins or non-ambulation. Congenital coagulation defects should be suspected if patient has recurrent deep vein thrombosis without identifiable precipitating factors. We report a case of 44-year-old Japanese male, who had three events of deep vein thrombosis within four years. Doppler ultrasound study at the time of the first event showed extensive thrombosis of femoral veins. Coagulation factors study revealed that patient had antithrombin III deficiency. This patient's sister in Japan also had this defect. This patient is using warfarin 5 mg daily and has been followed up uneventfully. In patients with recurrent deep vein thrombosis, hereditary coagulation defect should be suspected and warfarin should be used indefinitely.

0035000628	The in vitro inhibitory effect of tannin derivatives on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase on vero cells	Coronary heart disease is still the major cause of death in industrialized countries. Multiple primary or secondary interventional trials to lower serum cholesterol in humans have resulted in significant reduction of coronary events and death, one of the major reasons attributed to developing a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor such as pravastatin. Developing new inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis is still common in the pharmaceutical industry. Tannin comprises a large group of natural polyphenolic compounds possessing antioxidant effects. The methods for analysis of specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis have already been well established by using Vero cells, a cell line obtained from kidneys of African green monkeys. Tannin derivatives isolated from different traditional Chinese herbs were dissolved in DMSO and incubated with Vero cells with or without the addition of 1 mmol/l mevalonate or 5 mmol/l sodium acetate for 24 h in order to observe cell growth. Pravastatin, a specific HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was used as positive control which could inhibit Vero cells growth effectively and cell growth inhibition was reversible after adding 1 mmol/l mevalonate. More than 50 tannin derivatives were used for the study, but only two compounds - proanthrocyanidin A-2 (belonging to the flavan-3-ol group) and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (belonging to the gallotannin group) - showed significant growth inhibition of Vero cells. This study showed that some isolated tannin derivatives from traditional herbs were effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which might be developed into new hypocholesterolemic agents.

0034748170	The antihypertensive effect of stevioside derivative isosteviol in spontaneously hypertensive rats	Background: Hypertension is one of the most common disease entity causing major mortality. Isosteviol (IST) is the derivative from stevioside. Stevioside is a sweet-tasting glycoside existed in the leaves of the herb Stevia rebaudiana that has been using widely in Japan as sugar substitute. Stevioside has been proved to have hypotensive effect. This study investigated the antihypertensive effect of isosteviol in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Methods: Isosteviol synthesized from stevioside was employed to inject intraperitoreally into SHR by dose-dependent manner. Isolated aortic strips and vascular smooth muscle cells were employed to evaluate the mechanism of hypotension. Results: IST (25 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally decreased mean artery blood pressure by 12 mmHg. In isolated aortic rings from rats, IST could dose-dependently relaxed vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction.

0035018717	Effect of tetramethylpyrazine on blood pressure in hypertensive rats and calcium mobilization in vascular smooth muscle cells	Background: Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is a plant alkaloid isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Chuang Xiong. It has been proved to have antihypertensive effect on anestheized animals. This study was undertaken to evaluate its effect on ambulatory hypertensive rats and its mechanism of antihypertension. Materials and Methods: Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)- induced hypertensive rats comprising 4 groups (each n = 8) were used for study. TMP dissolved in normal saline was given intraperitoneally at different dosages (1,5,10 mg/kg) and blood pressure was recorded by a noninvasive tail-cuff monitor. Aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) were employed to evaluate calcium influx inhibition by using Fura-2 calcium-sensitive dye. Results: The hypotensive effect of TMP on DOCA-salt sensitive hypertensive rats was dose-dependent; the maximal blood pressure decrease was 28.2 ± 5.0 mm Hg at the dosage of 10 mg/kg. By using calcium influx stimulating agents phenylephrine (an α adrenergic agonist) and arginine vasopressin to induce calcium influx, TMP showed a dose-dependent calcium influx inhibition. Conclusion: TMP isolated from traditional herb has an effective antihypertensive action and this antihypertension is probably due to intracellular calcium influx inhibition.

0034792091	How well tolerated are lipid-lowering drugs?	It has been clearly established that lipid-lowering treatments [such as 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutamyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins') or fibrates] can reduce cardiovascular events, and with one of the statins even total mortality, in high-risk populations. Intervention studies have not included the very old, but it is generally assumed that this patient group would benefit from these treatments to an extent similar to younger patients. Worries about the associations seen in observational studies between low cholesterol levels and cancer, cerebral haemorrhage or mood and behaviour change have been largely overcome by findings from the latest large drug intervention trials, which do not show any increase in these conditions with statin or fibrate treatments. The common adverse effects associated with these drugs are relatively mild and often transient in nature. Potentially more serious adverse effects, which are more clearly related to drug treatment and are probably dose-dependent, include elevations in hepatic transaminase levels and myopathy; however, these effects are uncommon and generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped. The risk of myopathy with fibrate treatment is increased in patients with renal impairment, and the risk of myopathy with statin treatment increases with coadministration of drugs that inhibit statin metabolism or transport. Other adverse effects are related to specific drugs, for example, clofibrate is associated with an increased risk of gallstones. Studies in elderly patients have not shown an increased risk of adverse effects with lipid-lowering drugs compared with younger patients, but in clinical practice there may be some increased risk, particularly with regards to drug interactions. Therefore, lipid-lowering drugs should be administered with extra caution to elderly patients.

0034805005	The In vitro inhibitory effect of flavonoid astilbin on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase on vero cells	Background. Epidemiological studies have shown that hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. In clinical trials of lipid lowering therapy, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor has been shown to decrease cardiac events and mortality. Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural antioxidants existing in vegetables, fruits and beverages such as tea and wine. Previous studies have shown that some antioxidants had hypocholesterolemic effect, and flavonoid intake was associated with the decrease of mortality from coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on HMG-CoA reductase. Methods. The methods for analysis of specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis have been well-established, using Vero cells, a cell line obtained from kidneys of African green monkeys. Flavonoids isolated from different traditional Chinese herbs were dissolved in DMSO and incubated with Vero cells with or without the addition of 1 mM mevalonate or 5 mM sodium acetate in order to observe cell growth for 24 h. Results. Concentrations of 1 mM mevalonate or 5 mM sodium acetate were added into culture medium in order to observe the effect on cell growth. Different concentrations of pravastatin to inhibit cell growth were used as a positive control. About 40 flavonoid compounds were used for study, only one compound, astilbin (belonging to the flavonol group), showed significant inhibition of Vero cell growth. Conclusions. This study shows that one flavonoid compound, isolated from traditional medicinal herbs, may be an effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which might be developed into a new hypocholesterolemic agent.

0034490144	Down-regulation of superoxide dismutase gene expression in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) after long-term incubation with vitamin C	Background: Oxygen free radicals have been linked to the process of cardiovascular disease and aging. Epidemiological studies supported the beneficial effect of supplementation of antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a endogenous enzyme system which can scavenge oxygen free radicals. This study investigated the effect of supplementation of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on the changes of SOD. Methods: Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) were divided into 4 groups: a control group (without vitamin C) and treatment groups with vitamin C at 50 μM, 100 μM and 200 μM. After a short-term (2 days) or long-term (7 days) incubation, the enzyme activity and mRNA level of SOD were measured. Results: After 7 days incubation, vitamin C resulted in a decrease in the activity and mRNA level of Mn-SOD (mitochondrial enzyme) in a concentration-dependent manner. However, vitamin C supplementation did not change the gene expression and activity of Cu,Zn-SOD (cytosolic enzyme) either after short-term or long-term incubation. Conclusion: The results obtained suggest that 7 days incubation with relative high concentrations of vitamin C may down-regulate the gene expression and activity of antioxidant enzyme Mn-SOD in cultured smooth muscle cells.

75849164737	Uric acid activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases and thereafter endothelin-1 expression in rat cardiac fibroblasts	Background: The association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular diseases has long been recognized. Elevated levels of uric acid may have a causal role in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. However, the direct effect of uric acid on cardiac cells remains unclear. Therefore, this study was aimed to examine the effect of uric acid in rat cardiac fibroblasts and to identify the putative underlying signaling pathways. Methods: Cultured rat cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated with uric acid; cell proliferation and endothelin-1 (ET-1) gene expression were examined. The effect of uric acid on NADPH oxidase activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) phosphorylation were tested to elucidate the intracellular mechanism of uric acid in ET-1 gene expression. Results: Uric acid-increased cell proliferation and ET-1 gene expression. Uric acid also increased NADPH oxidase activity, ROS formation, ERK phosphorylation, and activator protein-1 (AP-1)-mediated reporter activity. Antioxidants suppressed uric acid-induced ET-1 gene expression, and ERK phosphorylation, and AP-1 reporter activities. Mutational analysis of the ET-1 gene promoter showed that AP-1 binding site was an important cis-element in uric acid-induced ET-1 gene expression. Conclusions: These results suggest that uric acid-induced ET-1 gene expression, partially by the activation of ERK pathway via ROS generation in cardiac fibroblasts. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

0036015046	Beneficial effects on blood pressure and lipid profile of programmed exercise training in subjects with white coat hypertension	Background: Patients with white coat hypertension comprise a substantial portion of the hypertensive population. Previous reports have shown that moderate-intensity regular exercise training in patients with mild hypertension usually reduces blood pressure (BP), but there is a lack of data regarding individuals with white coat hypertension. This study was performed to evaluate whether programmed exercise was effective in reducing BP in patients with white coat hypertension and whether it also had beneficial effects on other biochemical parameters. Methods: A total of 42 patients (23 men and 19 women) with white coat hypertension (mean 24-h ambulatory BP 119.2 ± 6.6/78.3 ± 5.8 mm Hg) were divided randomly into two groups: control (n = 20) (no exercise), and moderate-intensity exercise (n = 22). The training group exercised three times per week at the prescribed exercise intensity using a treadmill exercise program. Blood pressure, heart rate, and biochemical parameters were monitored every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Results: Significant reductions in clinic and ambulatory BPs were seen in the exercise group after only 4 weeks regular exercise training and these persisted over the 12-week study. The mean maximal reductions in clinic BP were 11 mm Hg for systolic and 5 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. Significant reductions were found in plasma total cholesterol (-6.1%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-14.1%), and triglyceride (-11.4%). Elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (+11.2%) was also noted. Conclusions: These data, which are clinically significant, suggest that 12 weeks of exercise training can result in successful reduction of BP and favorable changes in the lipid profile that would be beneficial to patients with white coat hypertension. © 2002 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

Previous reports have shown that moderate-intensity regular exercise training in these patients usually reduces blood pressure. By designing programmed exercise to evaluate whether it is effective in reducing blood pressure in mild hypertensive patients and also has beneficial effects on other biochemical parameters. Twenty-three mild hypertensive Taiwanese patients (resting blood pressure 139.1 ± 11.4/99.5 ± 8.0 mmHg) were divided randomly into two groups: control (no exercise) and moderate-intensity exercise (average 6.4 ± 0.7 METs). The training group exercised three times per week at the prescribed exercise intensity by using the Treadmill exercise test. Blood pressure, heart rate and other biochemical parameters were monitored regularly every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks regular exercise training, the exercise group showed for significant resting blood pressure reduction. Mean maximal reduction of systolic pressure was 18 mmHg. Significant reduction of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride were found; elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was also noted. These data suggest that after 12 weeks of exercise training in mild hypertensive patients, successful reduction of blood pressure and favorable changes of lipid profile will be noted.

0035808014	Effects of rapid atrial pacing on the arrhythmogenic activity of single cardiomyocytes from pulmonary veins: Implication in initiation of atrial fibrillation	Background - Pulmonary veins (PVs) are important sources of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Long-term rapid atrial pacing (RAP) changes atrial electrophysiology and facilitates the maintenance of atrial fibrillation. It is not clear whether RAP alters the arrhythmogenic activity of PVs. The purpose of this study was to isolate single PV cardiomyocytes from control and RAP dogs and evaluate their electrophysiological characteristics. Methods and Results - The action potential and ionic currents were investigated in PV cardiomyocytes from control and long-term (6 to 8 weeks) RAP (780 bpm) dogs by use of the whole-cell clamp technique. Dissociation of PVs yielded rod-shaped single cardiomyocytes without (n=91, 60%) or with (n=60, 40%) pacemaker activity. Compared with the control group, the RAP dog PV cardiomyocytes had faster beating rates (0.86±0.28 versus 0.45±0.07 Hz, P<0.05) and shorter action potential duration. The RAP dog PV cardiomyocytes with pacemaker activity have a higher incidence of delayed (59% versus 7%, P<0.001) or early (24% versus 0%, P<0.005) afterdepolarization. The RAP dog PV cardiomyocytes with pacemaker activity had smaller slow inward and transient outward but larger transient inward (0.017±0.004 versus 0.009±0.002 pA/pF, P<0.05) and pacemaker (0.111±0.019 versus 0.028±0.008 pA/pF, P<0.001) currents. The RAP dog PV cardiomyocytes without pacemaker activity had only smaller slow inward and transient outward and larger pacemaker currents. Conclusions - PVs contain multiple cardiomyocytes with distinct electrophysiological characteristics. RAP changes the electrophysiological characteristics and arrhythmogenic activity of PVs.

0036074931	Clinical pharmacology of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists	The angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists are the latest class of antihypertensive agents to be approved for treatment of hypertension. They have a similar efficacy in lowering blood pressure as other classes of antihypertensive agents. The blood pressure-lowering effect is potentiated when given concomitantly with low-dose thiazide diuretics. These agents are well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse effects similar to that of placebo and significantly lower than experienced with the other class of renin-angiotensin system antagonists, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Dose adjustments are often not necessary in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency or in the elderly. In summary, these agents are efficacious for blood pressure lowering with a single daily dose.

0036091433	Antihypertensive effect of stevioside in different strains of hypertensive rats	Background. Stevioside is a natural sweet-tasting glycoside isolated from the herb Stevia rebaudiana, composed of stevia, a diterpenic carboxylic alcohol with three glucose molecules, mainly used commercially as sugar substitute. Previous study has shown that it can lower blood pressure in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). This study was undertaken to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of stevioside in different strains of hypertensive rats and to observe whether there is difference in blood pressure lowering effect. Methods. Noninvasive tail-cuff method was employed to measure blood pressure. Stevioside at the concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally (ip) to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (NTR), SHR, deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-NaC1) sensitive hypertensive rats (DHR) and renal hypertensive rats (RHR). Results. Significant hypotensive effect of stevioside administered ip was noted in different strains of rats at the dose of 50 mg/kg. When stevioside was increased to the concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/kg, ip, it also caused slow and persistent lowering of blood pressure in SHR and NTR. Data also showed that stevioside given at the concentrations of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg ip resulted in lowering of blood pressure in SHR dose-dependently. Blood pressure returned to previous levels after the drug was discontinued for 2-3 days. Drinking of 0.1% stevioside solution in mature SHR could have antihypertensive effect and also prevented hypertension in immature SHR. Conclusions. This study reconfirmed stevioside has hypotensive effect and the effect is more prominent in hypertensive rats.

Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) cDNA via plasmid transfection leads to growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo in various human cancers. Polyphenolic compounds such as catechin isolated from tea bush Camellia sinensis has been shown to have anticancer effect in vitro. This study evaluated the effect of catechin on the MnSOD activity and mRNA level of pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12). Methods. PC-12 cells were incubated with different concentrations of catechin at short-term (2 days) and long-term (7 days) in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was measured and its mRNA was assayed by Northern blotting. Results. After incubation for 2 days, catechin slightly but significantly increased the activity of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). However, it did not show any significant effect at 7 days. The MnSOD activity showed significant changes in both short-term and long-term. The amount of mRNA also showed similar changes. Conclusions. Catechin is a natural antioxidant which has been shown to have antitumor effect in basic and epidemiological studies. The present data suggest that catechin can increase MnSOD gene expression in PC-12, which might have beneficial effect in tumor prevention.

0036622420	Comparison of superoxide dismutase gene expression and activity in the hearts of spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats	Background: Recent studies have suggested that oxygen free radicals (OFRs) play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a naturally existing antioxidant, which plays an important role in scavenging OFRs. In order to determine if changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in the heart occur in the hypertensive state, the present study compared SOD in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with normotensive rats. Methods: We measured the enzyme activities and mRNA levels of two main subtypes of SOD (Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD) in hearts of 6-week, 9-week and 12-week-old SHRs and compared them with that of age-matched, normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Results: Higher levels of both Mn-SOD activity (55.9 ± 0.8 vs 33.6 ± 0.4 μ/mg protein, p < 0.001) and Mn-SOD mRNA expression (195 ± 50% vs 99 ± 37%, p < 0.001) were found in hearts of SHRs compared to WKY rats. Mild elevation of CuZn-SOD activity of SHRs (31.9 ± 0.4 vs 27.3 ± 0.4 μ/mg protein, p < 0.05) was noted, but there was no significant difference in mRNA level of CuZn-SOD in hearts of SHRs and WKY rats. Conclusion: Alternation of OFRs scavenging enzyme SOD may be an important factor in the vulnerability of the rat heart to OFRs, or it may be related to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this species.

84855174216	Tanshinone IIA attenuates cyclic strain-induced endothelin-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	1. Tanshinone IIA, one of the active components of the Radix of Salvia miltiorrhiza, is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the intracellular mechanism of action of tanshinone IIA remain to be determined. The aims of the present study were to test the hypothesis that tanshinone IIA alters strain-induced endothelin (ET)-1 expression and nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as to identify the putative signalling pathways involved, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). 2. Cultured HUVEC were exposed to cyclic strain in the presence of 1-10μmol/L tanshinone IIA. Expression of ET-1 was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. Phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and activating transcription factor (ATF) 3 was assessed by western blot analysis. 3. Tanshinone IIA (3 and 10μmol/L) inhibited strain-induced ET-1 expression. In contrast, NO production, eNOS phosphorylation and ATF3 expression were enhanced by tanshinone IIA. The eNOS inhibitor N

84861093906	Tanshinone IIA prevents doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis through Akt-dependent pathway	Background: Doxorubicin, one of the original anthracyclines, remains among the most effective anticancer drugs ever developed. Clinical use of doxorubicin is, however, greatly limited by its serious adverse cardiac effects that may ultimately lead to cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Tanshinone IIA is the main effective component of Salvia miltiorrhiza known as 'Danshen' in traditional Chinese medicine for treating cardiovascular disorders. The objective of this study was set to evaluate the protective effect of tanshinone IIA on doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and to explore its intracellular mechanism(s). Methods: Primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with the vehicle, doxorubicin (1 μM), tanshinone IIA (0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 μM), or tanshinone IIA plus doxorubicin. Results: We found that tanshinone IIA (1 and 3 μM) inhibited doxorubicin-induced reactive oxygen species generation, reduced the quantity of cleaved caspase-3 and cytosol cytochrome c, and increased BcL-x

0037210692	Mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of stevioside in anesthetized dogs	Stevioside is a sweet-tasting glycoside isolated from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana. It has been used as a noncaloric sugar substitute in Japan and Brazil for decades. Previous studies have shown that it lowered blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by intravenous injection. This study was designed to evaluate the hypotensive effect of stevioside in dogs and to define the underlying mechanism. After nasogastric administration of stevioside powder (200 mg/kg), the blood pressure of healthy mongrel dogs began to significantly decrease at 60 min and returned to baseline level at 180 min. The reduction of blood pressure was more rapid (at 5-10 min) and effective after intravenous injection. However, no significant change of blood pressure was noted after injection through left vertebral artery, implicating that the hypotensive effect is not related to the central nervous system. Stevioside also showed significant hypotensive effects in renal hypertensive dogs, in a dose-dependent manner. In cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5 cell line), stevioside can dose-dependently inhibit the stimulatory effects of vasopressin and phenylephrine on intracellular Ca

0036879455	The effects of exercise training on walking function and perception of health status in elderly patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease	Objective. To determine the effects of 12-week exercise programme on ambulatory function, free-living daily physical activity and health-related quality of life in disabled older patients with intermittent claudication. Design. Prospective, randomized controlled trial. Setting. University Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan. Subjects. Thirty-two of 64 patients with Fontaine stage II peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) were randomized to exercise training and 32 to usual care control. Five patients from the exercise group and six patients from the control group dropped out, leaving 27 and 26 patients, respectively, completing the study in each group. Interventions. Twelve weeks of treadmill exercise training. Main outcome measures. Treadmill walking time to onset of claudication pain and to maximal claudication pain, 6-min walk distance, self-reported ambulatory ability and perceived health-related quality of life (QOL). Results. Compliance of exercise programme was 83% of the possible sessions. Exercise training increased treadmill walking time to onset of claudication pain by 88% (P < 0.001), time to maximal pain by 70% (P < 0.001), and 6-min walk distance by 21% (P < 0.001). Subjects. Perception of health-related QOL improved from 12% to 178% in the exercise group. These improvements were significantly better than the changes in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions. Significant improvements in claudication following 12-week exercise training in elderly PAOD patients were observed. Increase in treadmill walking time to maximal claudication pain in these patients translated into the improvement of perceived physical health, which enabled the patients to become more functionally independent.

0037116531	Effects of thyroid hormone on the arrhythmogenic activity of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes	OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to investigate the effects of thyroid hormone on the electrophysiological characteristics of pulmonary vein (PV) cardiomyocytes. BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism is an important etiology of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Pulmonary veins are known to initiate paroxysmal AF. METHODS: The action potential and ionic currents were investigated in single rabbit PV and atrial cardiomyocytes with (hyperthyroid) and without (control) incubation of L-triiodothyronine using the whole-cell clamp technique. RESULTS: Compared with the control cardiomyocytes, hyperthyroid PV and atrial cardiomyocytes had shorter action potential duration. Hyperthyroid PV cardiomyocytes had faster beating rates (1.82 ± 0.13 Hz vs. 1.03 ± 0.15 Hz, p < 0.005) and a higher incidence of delayed afterdepolarization (beating: 92% vs. 6%, p < 0.0001; non-beating: 45% vs. 3%, p < 0.005). However, only hyperthyroid PV beating cardiomyocytes had a higher incidence of early afterdepolarization (46% vs. 0%, p < 0.0001). The ionic current experiments showed that hyperthyroid PV beating cardiomyocytes had larger densities of overall slow inward (2.72 ± 0.21 pA/pF vs. 2.07 ± 0.19 pA/pF, p < 0.05), overall transient outward (1.39 ± 0.21 pA/pF vs. 0.48 ± 0.08 pA/pF, p < 0.001) and steady state outward currents (0.78 ± 0.06 pA/pF vs. 0.58 ± 0.04 pA/pF, p < 0.05) on depolarization and larger transient inward (0.021 ± 0.004 pA/pF vs. 0.005 ± 0.001 pA/pF, p < 0.001) on repolarization. By contrast, the hyperthyroid PV non-beating cardiomyocytes had larger densities of overall transient outward (1.01 ± 0.14 pA/pF vs. 0.37 ± 0.07 pA/pF, p < 0.001), steady state outward (0.61 ± 0.06 pA/pF vs. 0.44 ± 0.04 pA/pF, p < 0.05) and transient inward currents (0.011 ± 0.002 pA/pF vs. 0.003 ± 0.001 pA/pF, p < 0.05). C0NCLUSIONS: Thyroid hormone changes the electrophysiological activity of the PV cardiomyocytes. Increased automaticity and enhanced triggered activity may increase the arrhythmogenic activity of PVs in hyperthyroidism. © 2002 by the American College of Cardiology.

0037119209	Effect of catechin on the activity and gene expression of superoxide dismutase in cultured rat brain astrocytes	Stroke is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in recent. Oxygen free radicals produced during cerebral infarction increases the damage to neurons. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the endogenous antioxidant enzyme that can effectively scavenge superoxide radicals. Catechin is a hydrophilic antioxidant usually existed in tea, fruits and vegetables. In the cultured rat brain astrocytes (RBA), the activity of SOD (both Cu, Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD subtypes) was markedly increased by incubation with catechin at low concentration (0.1 μM) for 2 days (short-term) and 7 days (long-term). This stimulatory effect of catechin was not related to the incubating concentration. Similar changes were also observed in the gene expression of SOD in RBA. The increase in quantity of SOD-messenger RNA was remarkable and seemed to be more obvious than the other antioxidants such as vitamin E. This result shows that catechin is an effective antioxidant to increase the activity of SOD in RBA which would be beneficial to neurons subjected to oxygen free radical damage. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

0037790605	Clinical outcome of very late recurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation	Very Late Recurrence of AF. Introduction: High recurrence rate is still a major problem associated with ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Most of the recurrences occur within 6 months after ablation. The characteristics of very late recurrent AF (> 12 months after ablation) have not been reported. Methods and Results: Two hundred seven patients with drug-refractory AF underwent successful focal ablation or isolation of AF loci. After the first ablation procedure, Holter monitoring and event recorders were used to evaluate symptomatic recurrent AF. A second ablation procedure was recommended if the antiarrhythmic drugs could not control recurrent AF. During long-term follow-up (mean 30 ± 11 months, up to 51 months), 70 patients had recurrent AF, including 13 patients (6%) with very late (>12 months) recurrent AF (group 1) and 57 patients (28%) with late (within 12 months after ablation) recurrent AF(group 2). Group 1 patients had a significantly lower incidence of multiple (≥2) AF foci (23% vs 63%, P = 0.02) than group 2 patients. In addition, the incidence of antiarrhythmic drugs use (38% vs 84%, P = 0.001) to maintain sinus rhythm after the first episode of recurrent AF was significantly lower in group 1 than group 2 patients, and the incidence of a second intervention procedure (8% vs 35%, P = 0.051) tended to be lower in group 1 than group 2 patients. Conclusion: The incidence of very late recurrent AF after ablation of paroxysmal AF is very low, and the clinical outcome of patients with very late recurrent AF is benign.

0038612802	Statins in lipid-lowering therapy	The discovery of the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (so called statins) is a great step forward in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics. Substantial clinical evidence suggests that statins are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. Recent well-controlled clinical studies also suggest the long-term usage of statins is sale in terms of all causes of mortality, including cancers. The incidence of myopathy, which is a concern of most physicians, is relatively low from new clinical evidence. The effectiveness of statins for prevention of CHD also is shown in diabetics. The mechanisms of prevention of CHD by statins are multifactorial, including reversal of endothelial dysfunction. The cost-effectiveness of using statins in the treatment of CHD and stroke is obvious, which should encourage primary care physicians to treat those patients who need lipid-lowering therapy.

0038014088	The in vitro inhibitory effects of crude extracts of traditional Chinese herbs on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase on vero cells	Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Western countries. Epidemiological studies have shown that hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Clinical trials of lipid lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitor have been shown to decrease coronary events and mortality. Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural antioxidants occurring in natural products such as traditional Chinese herbs, fruits and beverages such as tea and wine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of crude extracts from traditional Chinese herbs on HMG Co-A reductase. The methods for analysis of specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis have been well-established by using Vero cells, a cell line obtained from kidneys of African green monkeys. Crude extracts from different traditional Chinese herbs were dissolved in 1% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with Vero cells with or without the addition of 1 mM mevalonate or 5 mM sodium acetate for 24 hours in order to observe cell growth. Pravastatin, a specific HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, was used as a positive control which inhibits Vero cells growth effectively and cell growth inhibition was reversible after 1 mM mevalonate. Among 100 traditional Chinese herbs used for the study, only two herbs: Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe and Porcirus trifoliata Raf. showed significant growth inhibition of Vero cells. This study shows that some crude extracts isolated from traditional medicinal herbs were effective HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors which might be developed into new hypocholesterolemic agents. © 2002 World Scientific Publishing Company & Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

84879830996	Pathologic diagnosis of spontaneous splenic rupture in systemic lupus erythematosus	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common autoimmune disease that involved multiple organ systems. Diagnosis is usually not difficult. However, SLE involved spleen with spontaneous rupture is a rare condition that has been only 5 cases reported previously; and no definite pathologic diagnosis has been reported. We present the case of a 54 year-old white American woman who had SLE for 10 years with multiple immunosuppressive agents treatment at stable condition. She had acute abdomen presented to the emergency department and received timely surgical treatment which confirmed she had spontaneous spleen rupture (SSR). Detailed pathologic study, with control of a traumatic rupture spleen of almost the same age and sex, revealed marked congestion of the red pulp and atrophy of white pulp notified in the SLE spleen. Congestion of red pulp may be the cause of SSR in the SLE spleen.

84883010096	Pathologic finding of increased expression of interleukin-17 in the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease of chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that will affect multiple tissues and organs such as skin, heart or lungs; but it principally attacks the joints, producing a nonsuppurative inflammatory and proliferative synovitis that often progresses to major damaging of articular cartilage and joint ankylosis. Although the definite etiology is still unknown, recent studies suggest that T-helper cells (Th17) may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of RA. And interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is a cytokine of Th17 cells, may be a key factor in the occurrence of RA. The binding of IL-17 to specific receptor results in the expression of fibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells and also synthesis of several major factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-1β that result in the structural damage of RA joints. Though some previous studies have shown that IL-17 exists in the synovium of RA, few has definite proof quantitatively by pathology about its existence in synovial membrane. This study comprised of 30 RA patients and 10 healthy control, pathologic study of the synovial membrane showed increased expression of IL-17 in the synovial tissue of RA patients, the intensity is compatible with clinical severity of disease as validated by DAS28 score and disease duration. Northern blot study also confirmed the increased expression of IL-17 in the synovial tissues. This study sheds further light that IL-17 may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of RA and a determinant of disease severity.

0042423726	Temperature regulates the arrhythmogenic activity of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes	Temperature plays an important role in the electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes. Pulmonary veins (PVs) are known to initiate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The effects of temperature on the arrhythmogenic activity of rabbit single PV and atrial cardiomyocytes were assessed using the whole-cell clamp technique. PV cardiomyocytes had different beating rates at low (22-25°C), normal (38-39°C) and high (40-41°C) temperatures (0.9 ± 0.1, 3.2 ± 0.4, 6.4 ± 0.6 Hz, respectively; p < 0.001). There were different action potential durations and incidences of delayed afterdepolarization in PV cardiomyocytes with pacemaker activity (31, 59, 63%; p < 0.05), PV cardiomyocytes without pacemaker activity (16, 47, 60%; p < 0.001), and atrial myocytes (0, 0, 21%; p < 0.05). However, oscillatory afterpotentials were only found in PV cardiomyocytes with pacemaker activity at normal (50%) or high (68%) temperatures, but not at low temperatures (p < 0.001). Both PV and atrial cardiomyocytes had larger transient inward currents and inward rectified currents at high temperatures. Additionally, PV cardiomyocytes with and without pacemaker activity had larger pacemaker currents at higher temperatures. This study demonstrated that PV cardiomyocytes have an increase in arrhythmogenic activity at high temperatures because of enhanced automaticity, induced triggered activity, or shortening of action potential duration.

0043175437	Downregulation of superoxide dismutase activity and gene expression in cultured rat brain astrocytes after incubation with vitamin C	Reactive oxygen species have been linked with neuropathological changes in the central nervous system. Epidemiological studies supported the beneficial effect of supplementation of antioxidants. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an endogenous enzyme which can scavenge reactive oxygen species. This study investigated the effect of supplementation with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on the changes of SOD in cultured neurological cells. Rat brain astrocytes (RBA-1 cells) were incubated with vitamin C and divided into four groups: a control group (without vitamin C) and three treatment groups with vitamin C at 40, 80, and 160 μmol/l. After short-term (2 days) and long-term (7 days) incubation, SOD activity, SOD mRNA level by Northern blotting, and SOD protein amounts by Western blotting were measured. After 2 days of incubation, vitamin C resulted in a decrease in the activity of SOD in a concentration-dependent manner (Mn-SOD from 14.8 ± 1.2 to 13.2 ± 0.5 U/mg protein and Cu/Zn-SOD from 64.8 ± 1.2 to 51.7 ± 0.9 U/mg protein; p < 0.05), and vitamin C also attenuated the Cu/Zn-SOD mRNA level from 100 to 86.3 ± 6.7%; p < 0.01), whereas the protein amounts of these two SODs remained unchanged. After 7 days of incubation with vitamin C, the SOD activity of RBA-1 cells decreased significantly (Mn-SOD from 14.9 ± 0.3 to 11.8 ± 0.3 U/mg protein and Cu/Zn SOD from 61.8 ± 1.8 to 54.6 ± 0.9 U/mg protein; p < 0.01), and the mRNA level was also attenuated (Mn-SOD from 100 to 86.8 ± 8.7% and Cu/Zn-SOD from 100 to 84.7 ± 4.8%; p < 0.01). These results suggest that 2 and 7 days of incubation with relatively high concentrations of vitamin C may downregulate activity and gene expression of SOD in cultured RBA-1 cells.

0344664552	Efficacy and Tolerability of Oral Stevioside in Patients with Mild Essential Hypertension: A Two-Year, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study	Background: Stevioside, a natural glycoside isolated from the plant Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, has been used as a commercial sweetening agent in Japan and Brazil for >20 years. Previous animal and human studies have indicated that stevioside has an antihypertensive effect. Objectives: This study was undertaken to investigate the long-term (2-year) efficacy and tolerability of stevioside in patients with mild essential hypertension. Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of stevioside on left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and quality of life (QOL). Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Chinese men and women aged between 20 and 75 years with mild essential hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140-159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 90-99 mm Hg). Patients took capsules containing 500 mg stevioside powder or placebo 3 times daily for 2 years. Blood pressure was measured at monthly clinic visits; patients were also encouraged to monitor blood pressure at home using an automated device. LVMI was determined by 2-dimensional echocardiography at baseline and after 1 and 2 years of treatment. QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Electrocardiographic, laboratory, and QOL parameters were assessed at the beginning of treatment, and at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Results: One hundred seventy-four patients (87 men, 87 women) were enrolled in the study, and 168 completed it: 82 (42 men, 40 women; mean [SD] age, 52 [7] years) in the stevioside group and 86 (44 women, 42 men; mean age, 53 [7] years) in the placebo group. After 2 years, the stevioside group had significant decreases in mean (SD) SBP and DBF compared with baseline (SBP, from 150 [7.3] to 140 [6.8] mm Hg; DBF, from 95 [4.2] to 89 [3.2] mm Hg; P < 0.05) and compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Based on patients' records of self-monitored blood pressure, these effects were noted beginning -1 week after the start of treatment and persisted throughout the study. There were no significant changes in body mass index or blood biochemistry, and the results of laboratory tests were similar in the 2 groups throughout the study. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects was noted between groups, and QOL scores were significantly improved overall with stevioside compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Neither group had a significant change in mean LVMI. However, after 2 years, 6 of 52 patients (11.5%) in the stevioside group had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), compared with 17 of 50 patients (34.0%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Of those who did not have LVH at baseline, 3 of 46 patients (6.5%) in the stevioside group had developed LVH after 2 years, compared with 9 of 37 patients (24.3%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In this 2-year study in Chinese patients with mild hypertension, oral stevioside significantly decreased SBP and DBP compared with placebo. QOL was improved, and no significant adverse effects were noted. Copyright © 2003 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

0242580896	The Beneficial Effects of Tai Chi Chuan on Blood Pressure and Lipid Profile and Anxiety Status in a Randomized Controlled Trial	Objectives: To evaluate the effects on blood pressure, lipid profile, and anxiety status on subjects received a 12-week Tai Chi Chuan exercise program. Design: Randomized controlled study of a Tai Chi Chuan group and a group of sedentary life controls. Setting: Taipei Medical University Hospitals and University campus in the Taipei, Taiwan, area. Subjects: Two (2) selected groups of 76 healthy subjects with blood pressure at high-normal or stage I hypertension. Intervention: A 12-week Tai Chi Chuan exercise training program was practiced regularly with a frequency of 3 times per week. Each session included 10-minute warm-up, 30-minute Tai Chi exercise, 10-minute cool-down. Exercise intensity was estimated to be approximately 64% of maximal heart rate. Outcome measures: Blood pressure, lipid profile and anxiety status (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI) were evaluated. Results: After 12-weeks of Tai Chi training, the treatment group showed significant decrease in systolic blood pressure of 15.6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 8.8 mm Hg. The serum total cholesterol level decreased 15.2 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased 4.7 mg/dL. By using STAI evaluation, both trait anxiety and state anxiety were decreased. Conclusions: This study shows that under well-designed conditions, Tai Chi exercise training could decrease blood pressure and results in favorable lipid profile changes and improve subjects' anxiety status. Therefore, Tai Chi could be used as an alternative modality in treating patients with mild hypertension, with a promising economic effect.

84893793090	Merit of anisodamine combined with opioid δ -receptor activation in the protection against myocardial injury during cardiopulmonary bypass	Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MIR) injury easily occurrs during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in elderly patients. In an attempt to develop an effective strategy, we employed a pig model of MIR injury to investigate the maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure, left ventricular enddiastolic pressure, and left intraventricular pressure. Coronary sinus cardiac troponin T (TnT) and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) content in myocardium were measured. The ultrastructures for MIR injury were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The role of δ-opioid receptor activation using D-Ala2, D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) in both early (D1) and late (D2) phases of cardioprotection was identified. Also, the merit of cardioprotection by DADLE in combination with anisodamine, the muscarinic receptor antagonist (D+M), was evaluated. Glibenclamide was employed at the dose sufficient to block ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Significant higher cardiac indicators, reduced TnT and increased ATP contents, were observed in D1, D2, and D+M groups compared with the control group. DADLE induced protection was better in later phase of ischemia that was attenuated by glibenclamide. DADLE after the ischemia showed no benefit, but combined treatment with anisodamine showed a marked postischemic cardioprotection. Thus, anisodamine is helpful in combination with DADLE for postischemic cardioprotection. © 2013 Xuan Hong et al.

84901828371	Effects of endurance exercise training on risk components for metabolic syndrome, interleukin-6, and the exercise capacity of postmenopausal women	We conducted this study to investigate how an exercise program affects the risk components of metabolic syndrome (MS), serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels, and exercise capacity in postmenopausal women. A randomized clinical trial design was used. Women in an exercise group participated in a treadmill-exercise program for 12 weeks, whereas women in a control group maintained their customary lifestyle. Data on variables were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks of the study, which was completed by 46 women (mean age, 56.0 ± 7.0 y). Our results indicate endurance exercise exerted significant beneficial effects on waist circumference, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and IL-6 levels, and exercise capacity (all P < 0.05). The beneficial effects on IL-6 and exercise capacity were correlated with improvements in HDL-C levels (r = -0.33, P = 0.03 and r = 0.31, P = 0.04, respectively). Our results suggest that health-care providers can incorporate an exercise program in treatments to improve the health of postmenopausal women. © 2014 Mosby, Inc.

84908672634	Palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity and protection by (+)-catechin in rat cortical astrocytes	Background Astrocytes do not only maintain homeostasis of the extracellular milieu of the neurons, but also play an active role in modulating synaptic transmission. Palmitic acid (PA) is a saturated fatty acid which, when being excessive, is a significant risk factor for lipotoxicity. Activation of astrocytes by PA has been shown to cause neuronal inflammation and demyelination. However, direct damage by PA to astrocytes is relatively unexplored. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism(s) of PA-induced cytotoxicity in rat cortical astrocytes and possible protection by (+)-catechin. Methods Cytotoxicity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers were assessed by MTT assay and Western blotting, respectively. Cytosolic Ca <sup>2+</sup> and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured microfluorimetrically using fura-2 and rhodamine 123, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assayed by the indicator 2′-7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Results Exposure of astrocytes to 100 μM PA for 24 h resulted in apoptotic cell death. Whilst PA-induced cell death appeared to be unrelated to ER stress and perturbation in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, it was likely a result of ROS production and subsequent MMP collapse, since ascorbic acid (anti-oxidant, 100 μM) prevented PA-induced MMP collapse and cell death. Co-treatment of astrocytes with (+)-catechin (300 μM), an anti-oxidant found abundantly in green tea, significantly prevented PA-induced ROS production, MMP collapse and cell death. Conclusion Our results suggest that PA-induced cytotoxicity in astrocytes may involve ROS generation and MMP collapse, which can be prevented by (+)-catechin. © 2014 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

0348143003	Down-regulation of Endogenous Antioxidant Enzymes Gene Expression by Supplement of Vitamin C in Cultured Pheochromocytoma Cells	Background: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been linked to a variety of pathophysiological changes. Epidemiological studies supported the beneficial effect of supplementation of antioxidants. Antioxidant enzymes including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) are endogenous enzymes which can scavenge ROS. This study investigated the effect of supplementation of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on the changes of catalase, SOD, and GPX gene expression in cultured pheochromocytoma cells. Methods: Pheochromocytoma cells were incubated with vitamin C and divided into 4 groups: a control group (without vitamin C) and 3 treatment groups with vitamin C at 40, 80 and 160 μmol/L, respectively. After short-term (2 days) and long-term (7 days) incubation, the catalase, SOD, and GPX mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot. Results: After 2 days of incubation, vitamin C (160 μmol/L) attenuated the GPX mRNA level (100% to 91.8 ± 3.8%, p < 0.01), whereas the catalase and SOD mRNA remained unchanged. After 7 days' incubation with vitamin C, all the catalase, SOD, and GPX mRNA were decreased significantly. Conclusion: These results suggest that 2 and 7 days of incubation with relatively high concentrations of vitamin C may down-regulate gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in cultured pheochromocytoma cells. Whether this phenomenon implicates clinical benefit needs further evaluation.

0347318071	Effect of ethanol on the electrophysiological characteristics of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes	Ethanol consumption has been considered to contribute to the occurrences of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary veins are known to initiate atrial fibrillation. This study investigated whether ethanol may induce atrial fibrillation through increasing arrhythmogenic activity of pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes. Using the whole-cell clamp technique, the action potential and ionic currents were investigated in rabbit single pulmonary vein beating cardiomyocytes with and without (control) incubation of ethanol. Compared with control cardiomyocytes, pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes receiving 0.3 mg/ml or 1 mg/ml ethanol had shorter action potential duration, but had similar beating rates (2.6±1.3, 2.7±1.2, 2.7±1.2 Hz) and incidences (45%, 41%, 32%) of delayed afterdepolarization. Pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes receiving ethanol had smaller L-type Ca

0347479294	Inhibition of Cyclic Strain-Induced Endothelin-1 Gene Expression by Resveratrol	Resveratrol is a phytoestrogen naturally found in grapes and is among the major constituents of wine thought to have a cardioprotective effect. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasopressor synthesized by endothelial cells both in culture and in vivo. The aims of this study were to test the hypothesis that resveratrol may alter strain-induced ET-1 gene expression and to identify the putative underlying signaling pathways in endothelial cells. We show that resveratrol indeed potently inhibits strain-induced ET-1 secretion, ET-1 mRNA level, and ET-1 promoter activity. Resveratrol also inhibits strain-increased NADPH oxidase activity, reactive oxygen species formation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Furthermore, pretreating cells with resveratrol or antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine decreases strain-increased or hydrogen peroxide-increased ET-1 secretion, ET-1 promoter activity, and ET-1 mRNA and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Using both the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a reporter gene assay, resveratrol and N-acetyl-cysteine also attenuated the strain-stimulated activator protein-1 binding activity and activator protein-1 reporter activity. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that resveratrol inhibits strain-induced ET-1 gene expression, partially by interfering with the ERK1/2 pathway through attenuation of reactive oxygen species formation. Thus, this study provides important new insights in the molecular pathways that may contribute to the proposed beneficial effects of resveratrol in the cardiovascular system.

0347765864	An update on the management of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes	Background. To provide an update on the latest evidence-based management of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. Methods. A literature search (MEDLINE 1966 to 2002) was performed using the key words "diabetic nephropathy," and relevant book chapters were also reviewed, to identify well-controlled, prospective landmark studies and expert review articles on diabetic nephropathy (DN). Data and conclusions from the selected articles that Provided solid evidence regarding the optimal management of DN were extracted and interpreted in light of clinical and research experience with Chinese patients. Results. DN is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. High blood pressure, dyslipidemia, long duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control and central obesity are important risk factors. Microalbuminuria is a practical marker to predict the development of overt nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. Risk factor modification, renal function monitoring and combined therapies are the current integrated approaches to manage patients with diabetic kidney disease. Optimal glycemic control is a fundamental goal, but effective antihypertensive and possibly lipid-lowering therapy delay the progression of DN. Recent large clinical trials support the earlier experimental data that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have important renoprotective actions independent of their blood pressure lowering actions. Conclusions. Screening for microalbuminuria and monitoring renal function will identify patients with DN at an early stage and allow for intervention. Tight glycemic control and aggressive antihypertensive treatment as well as the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors should substantially delay the progression of nephropathy.
