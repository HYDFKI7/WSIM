1442312554	Global sliding-mode control for companion nonlinear system with bounded control	Based on feedback linearization, quasi-time-optimal control and sliding-mode control theory, a kind of quasi-time-optimal continuously time-varying sliding-mode for robust control of nonlinear uncertainties systems subject to input constraint is presented. The proposed sliding surface can adapt it to the initial conditions of the system and the controller can be composed of two parts, one part is used to turn the nonlinear system into linear system by feedback linearization, and the other part is used to realize the quasi-time-optimal control for feedback linearized system. By this means, insensitivity of the system to external disturbance and parameter uncertainties is guaranteed from the very beginning of the proposed control action, and the system error convergence rate can be greatly increased. The advantages of the proposed scheme are indicated by comparison with the Bartoszewicz's scheme[5], and the Lyapunov theory is used to prove the existence of a sliding mode on the surface.

0030080276	New method for pole assignment in engineering problems	This paper proposes POM (Parameter Oscillation Method) as a first step towards overcoming the difficulty in reduction of flutter in helicopter vibration. The flutter of helicopter may be simulated as oscillation of a group of systems. According to vibration control theory, reducing flutter of helicopter is equivalent to making the system to be vibrationally stabilizable. To bypass the necessity of on-line measurements is equivalent to avoidance of the necessity of measuring the states of the system. This avoidance is achieved through introducing APAZ (almost periodic vector with the average value equal to zero) signals into the system to get another system. Applying Bogoloubov's averaging principle and using transform formulas the corresponding averaging system was obtained.

0030205248	Design of time sub-optimal control system with multi-linear switch plane control law	Though it is difficult to apply TOC (Time Optimal Control) law to a high-order system, it is desirable to utilize the dynamic characteristics of the TOC system for applications. To design the control system of a underwater navigator, a new method with MLSP (Multi-Linear Switch Plane) control law for designing TSOC (Time Sub-Optimal Control) system is proposed. For the linear system the MLSP control law is given. The new method proposed has the following advantages: 1. The MLSP control approaches the TOC law, and the approach becomes better as the number of linear switch planes selected freely by designer increases; 2. Since the switch surface is composed of multi-linear planes, the control law is easily implemented. The simulation results for depth control system of a underwater navigator confirms the validity of this method.

0031384151	Improving robust self-organizing fuzzy variable structure controller	The improvements were mainly in two respects: elimination of need for upper bounds on norms of system uncertainties and large reduction of control chatter. The key to the improvements was the selection of a equation that represented a virtual controller (virtual controller was a part of the fuzzy controller) and allowed mismatched uncertainties to be compensated for adaptively. Thus no upper bounds on norms of system uncertainties were needed. With mismatched uncertainties adaptively compensated for, k in the sliding-mode control law becomes very small according to Kosko's theory, small k signified that chatter was small. Simulation results show that steady-state chatter is very small.

33846567565	A new active and passive asynchronous fusion tracking of maneuvering target	A new asynchronous data fusion algorithm was adopted in this paper. This new fusion algorithm was based on the feedback fusion and the delicate time-slicing. Its basic idea is: at instants with neither passive (PTT) nor active target track-ing (ATT) measurements, it will predict this instant's states based on last instant's filtering result; at instants with only active or passive target tracking measurement, it will use its own filtering algorithm i.e., Converted Measurement Kalma-n Filter (CMKF) for active radar, Pseudo Linear Estimator (PLE) with frequency information for passive radar to get this instant's states; at instants with both passive and active target tracking measurements, it will fuse the active and passive measurements by feedback fusion algorithm, with the passive radar receiving the feedback information. The advantage of this new algorithm is that it can fuse the active and passive target tracking with non multiple integer sampling period ratio. This paper also extended the 2D constant velocity moving target to the 3D maneuvering target. Simulation results indicate that the new fusion algorithm can improve the tracking performance in some acceptable degree.

In knowledge acquisition, the scheme used the production rule representation and described the experts' knowledge by the four-table structure composed by measure point table, symptom table, rule table and result table, which has the excellent versatility and transportability. Furthermore, the scheme combined the distributed inference and multi-level inference as the inference strategy. Because the distributed inference analyzes the system faults and each subsystem faults respectively at the same time, it can improve the diagnosis speed effectively. In addition, the multi-level inference can diagnose the faults with the high hazard rating preferentially. Therefore, once the highly hazardous faults of the launch vehicle happen, the fault diagnosis system can find them in time and give the maintenance measure to reduce their harm to the lowest level.

However, when test points of a faulty system are limited, combinatorial explosion problem of minimal diagnosis is caused by the use of modelbased fault diagnosis expert system. In this paper, we develop a method to gradually reduce the minimal diagnosis by adding the system test points to realize fault location. Firstly, the computing procedure is formalized by combining set enumeration tree (SE-tree) with closed nodes to generate all the minimal hitting sets (i.e., minimal diagnosis). Then, as fault diagnosis synthetic information quantity and correlation matrix are introduced, we show that with progressive decomposition of the matrix, test point optimization strategy can be found out. Finally, using new observations and removal rules, minimal diagnosis can be gradually reduced, until the only minimal diagnosis is retained. The proposed test point optimization strategy for model-based fault diagnosis expert system can be applied to different engineering applications and its effectiveness is demonstrated with an example.

Control allocation is used to deliver the virtual control moments to redundant control effectors. Due to the physical constrains and aerodynamic considerations, each control effector has some constrains and the control allocation becomes more complicated. A new control allocation algorithm based on weighted pseudo-inverse is proposed in this paper. Weighted pseudo-inverse is a control allocation method with easy structure and high computational efficiency, but it could not give out the optimal result. Genetic algorithm is a randomized search algorithm. In this paper, it will be used to optimize the weighting matrix to achieve maximum attainable moment set. To enhance the performance of the algorithm, the space of the desired moment will be divided into several parts and each part will get one optimal weighting matrix obtained by genetic algorithm. Multiple weighting matrices could guarantee better performance in each part than one weighting matrix. Direct allocation is used to be contrast to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

The performance of compensation is limited by the accuracy of local inclination angle of magnetic field and initial heading. A 14-state extended kalman filter (EKF) algorithm is developed to calibrate magnetic deviation, local magnetic inclination angle error and initial heading error all together. The calibration procedure is to change the attitude of AHRS and rotate it two cycles. As the strapdown matrix can hold high precision after initial alignment of AHRS in short time for the gyro's short-term precision, the magnetic field vector can be projected onto the body frame of AHRS. The experiment results demonstrate that 14-state EKF outperforms 12-state KF, with measurement errors exist in the initial heading and local inclination angle.

Two issues are addressed, concerning how earlier results developed elsewhere may be extended to more general classes of reference signals, and how tracking performance may be further improved beyond that offered by feedback control. Toward these issues we consider exponentially increasing reference inputs and examine the use of preview control for tracking. We take an optimal interpolation approach, and our purpose is to develop analytical expressions and conceptual insight which will aid in the understanding of these issues. To this effect, we derive explicit expressions for the optimal tracking error, either as exact solutions or bounds.

The approach using the linear parameter varying transformations doesn't involve linearizations about operating points. Instead, the vehicle dynamics are brought to a linear parameter varying form via a state ransformation. This framework is applied to the design of a coupled longitudinal/lateral bank-to-turn autopilot for a hypersonic vehicle. First, the linear parameter varying (LPV) model of the hypersonic vehicle for bank-to-turn is obtained using state ransformation.The pitch and yaw/roll dynamics are separately transformed to linear parameter varying form, where the cross axis states are treated as exogenous parameters. Because the scheduling variables include these endogenous variables, such a plant is called quasi-linear parameter varying system. Next, using the obtained LPV model, a family of robust controllers is designed for both the pitch and yaw/roll channels, which use angle of attack and roll rate as the scheduling variables. Finally,the closed-loop simulation of the LPV controller is conducted using the original nonlinear model and also using perturbed aerodynamic coefficients. The simulation results show that the desired performance and robustness objectives are achieved across the whole turn phase. Â© 2010 ASCE.

In this work, we propose a new method to design a cascade of boosted classifiers for fast object detection, which combines linear asymmetric classification (LAC) into the recent multi-exit cascade structure. Therefore, the proposed method takes advantages of both LAC and the multi-exit cascade. Namely, (1) the multi-exit cascade structure collects all the scores of prior nodes for decision making at the current node, which reduces the loss of decision information; (2) LAC considers the asymmetric nature of the node training. We also show that the multi-exit cascade better meets the assumption of LAC learning than the standard Viola-Jones'cascade, both theoretically and empirically.

The cascade boosting framework proposed by Viola and Jones has become the standard for this problem. In this framework, the learning goal for each node is asymmetric, which is required to achieve a high detection rate and a moderate false positive rate. We develop new boosting algorithms to address this asymmetric learning problem. We show that our methods explicitly optimize asymmetric loss objectives in a totally corrective fashion. The methods are totally corrective in the sense that the coefficients of all selected weak classifiers are updated at each iteration. In contract, conventional boosting like AdaBoost is stage-wise in that only the current weak classifier's coefficient is updated. At the heart of the totally corrective boosting is the column generation technique. Experiments on face detection show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art asymmetric boosting methods.

Unlike conventional aircraft, air-breathing hypersonic vehicles require the propulsion system to be highly integrated into the airframe. Furthermore, full-scale hypersonic vehicles tend to have very lightweight and flexible structures with low natural frequencies.

In particular, the algorithm is applied to finding two dimensional position deviations along X and Y axes and to finding the rotating angle of objects through comparing the shape numbers between the saved template and the pictures of static objects captured by a 'vision' element such as a CCD camera, while the shape numbers are obtained from critical points which are determined by using the so-called directional-flow-change(DFC) method.

The algorithm is implemented and tested in a CCD camera based position tracking sensor for a real sheet of foam barrier. The experiment results show that the sensor performs very well in obtaining the pattern and finding the deviations and hence could be potentially applied to the real assembly manufacturing process.

Estimation of the initial attitude angles accurately is the guarantee of precise determination of the position, velocity and attitude of a moving platform. For military aircrafts, the high precision and short time of initial alignment are key requirements. The required inertial signals (accelerometer specific force and gyro rates) are buried in high frequency measurement noise. When the aircraft engine is power on, the high frequency noise is introduced due to engine vibration and other disturbances. Kalman filter have been extensively used for initial fine alignment of Strapdown Inertial Navigation Systems (SINS). In this paper, Multi-resolution wavelet de-noising (MRWD) method is proposed to eliminate the high frequency noise from inertial sensor measurements before using for initial fine alignment. The proposed method is tested using real data sets collected when vehicle engine was power on. It has been observed that the accuracy of initial alignment can be improved through the proposed method.

84883522323	Gain-scheduling compensator synthesis for output regulation of nonlinear systems	This paper addresses the gain-scheduling output regulation synthesis problem for nonlinear systems. For gain-scheduling control, the linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is obtained from nonlinear plant by plant linearization about zero-error trajectories upon which an LPV controller is synthesized. In practical engineering application, a key issue is to find a nonlinear output feedback compensator related to the designed LPV controller which can guarantee that the closed-loop system of nonlinear plant and compensator linearizes to the interconnection of LPV model and LPV controller. So the stability and performance about the zero-error trajectories can be inherited when the nonlinear compensator is implemented. By incorporating equilibrium input and measured output into the auxiliary LPV model, the compensator synthesis problem is reformulated as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be solved efficiently using the interior-point method. Consequently the proposed output feedback compensator can satisfy the linearization requirement. Finally, the validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a ball and beam design example.

Finally, simulations are carried on to demonstrate the proposed algorithm.
