On the other hand, in engineering practice, the amount of fault samples is often limited, which thus decrease the performance of traditional classifiers like artificial neural networks (ANNs). Currently popular SVMs provide a favorable solution to small sample-sized problems. In this study, IMSE and SVMs were employed as fault feature extractor and classifier, respectively.

0035016504	A study on the needle heating in heavy industrial sewing Part 1: Analytical models	In heavy industrial sewing, needle heating has become a serious problem that limits the further increase of the sewing speed, and hence the productivity. The high temperature in the needle can degrade the strength of the thread. At the same, it may cause the wear of the needle eye, which would further damage the thread. It can also scorch the fabric, as well as temper and weaken the needle itself. Therefore, it is important to develop a model that can predict the needle heating and, hence, find remedies to minimize its effects. According to a literature survey, most research on needle heating focuses on experimental methods, such as infrared radiometry, infrared pyrometry, etc. This paper is the first part of our research on needle heating. In this paper, two analytical models are presented: the sliding contact model and the lumped variable model. These models are relatively simple and easy to use. Given needle geometry, sewing condition, and fabric characteristic, they can predict the needle temperature rise starting from initial heating to steady state. The simulation results are rather accurate. Hence, the models can be used to quickly identify the potential needle heating problems on the shop floor. In Part 2 of our study, a finite element analysis (FEA) model is presented together with the experiment results.

77951207585	Bearing fault diagnosis using multi-scale entropy and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference	A bearing fault diagnosis method has been proposed based on multi-scale entropy (MSE) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), in order to tackle the nonlinearity existing in bearing vibration as well as the uncertainty inherent in the diagnostic information. MSE refers to the calculation of entropies (e.g. appropriate entropy, sample entropy) across a sequence of scales, which takes into account not only the dynamic nonlinearity but also the interaction and coupling effects between mechanical components, thus providing much more information regarding machinery operating condition in comparison with traditional single scale-based entropy. ANFIS can benefit from the decision-making under uncertainty enabled by fuzzy logic as well as from learning and adaptation that neural networks provide. In this study, MSE and ANFIS are employed for feature extraction and fault recognition, respectively. Experiments were conducted on electrical motor bearings with three different fault categories and several levels of fault severity. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach cannot only reliably discriminate among different fault categories, but identify the level of fault severity. Thus, the proposed approach has possibility for bearing incipient fault diagnosis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Secondly, inspired by the multiscale sample entropy (multiscale SampEn) which is originally proposed to quantify the complexity of physiological time series, we placed approximate entropy (ApEn), fuzzy approximate entropy (FApEn) and the proposed FSampEn into the same multiscale framework. This led to the developments of multiscale ApEn, multiscale FApEn and multiscale FSampEn. Finally, all four multiscale entropies along with their single-scale counterparts were employed to extract discriminating features from bearing vibration signals, and their classification performance was evaluated using support vector machines (SVMs). Experimental results demonstrated that all four multiscale entropies outperformed single-scale ones, whilst multiscale FSampEn was superior to other multiscale methods, especially when analyzed signals were contaminated by heavy noise. Comparisons with statistical features in time domain also support the use of multiscale FSampEn. © 2010 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77953935313	Applying improved multi-scale entropy and support vector machines for bearing health condition identification	Considering the non-linearity existing in bearing vibration signals as well as the scarcity of fault samples, this paper presents a method for bearing health condition identification based on improved multi-scale entropy (IMSE) and support vector machines (SVMs). IMSE refers to the calculation of improved sample entropies (i.e. fuzzy sample entropies across a sequence of scales). Applying IMSE to mechanical vibration signals can take into account not only the non-linearity but also the interactions and coupling between mechanical components, thus providing much more information regarding the machine health condition than traditional single-scale entropy can be expected to. In engineering practice, the amount of fault samples is often limited for training a classifier, which thus decreases the performance of traditional classifiers like artificial neural networks (ANNs). SVMs are derived from statistical learning theory, which is different from the conventional statistical theory on which ANNs are based. SVMs provide a favourable solution to small sample-sized problems. In this study, IMSE and SVMs are employed as fault feature extractor and classifier, respectively. The experimental results verify that the proposed method has potential applications in bearing health condition identification. © 2010 Authors.

77955545935	Time-frequency representation based on time-varying autoregressive model with applications to non-stationary rotor vibration analysis	A parametric time-frequency representation is presented based on time-varying autoregressive model (TVAR), followed by applications to non-stationary vibration signal processing. The identification of time-varying model coefficients and the determination of model order, are addressed by means of neural networks and genetic algorithms, respectively. Firstly, a simulated signal which mimic the rotor vibration during run-up stages was processed for a comparative study on TVAR and other non-parametric time-frequency representations such as Short Time Fourier Transform, Continuous Wavelet Transform, Empirical Mode Decomposition, Wigner-Ville Distribution and Choi-Williams Distribution, in terms of their resolutions, accuracy, cross term suppression as well as noise resistance. Secondly, TVAR was applied to analyse non-stationary vibration signals collected from a rotor test rig during run-up stages, with an aim to extract fault symptoms under non-stationary operating conditions. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that TVAR is an effective solution to non-stationary signal analysis and has strong capability in signal time-frequency feature extraction. © 2010 Indian Academy of Sciences.

77956568473	Fault diagnosis based on optimized node entropy using lifting wavelet packet transform and genetic algorithms	The current paper presents a novel scheme for bearing fault diagnosis based on lifting wavelet packet transform (LWPT), sample entropy (SampEn), support vector machines (SVMs), and genetic algorithms (GAs). In the proposed scheme, bearing vibration signals were first decomposed into different frequency sub-bands through a four-level LWPT, resulting in a total of 31 node signal components throughout all layers of the LWPT decomposition tree. The SampEns of all 31 components were then calculated as an original feature pool to characterize the complexity of the bearing vibration signals within the corresponding frequency bands. For selecting the most informative features thus reducing the number of features, a GA was applied to simultaneously pick out the salient features and optimize the parameters of SVMs so as to avoid the curse of dimensionality, alleviate computational burden, and improve the subsequent classification. Experiments were conducted on an induction motor with respect to various bearing faults and a range of fault severities. As an example here, three salient features were selected from the original 31 features, with the dimension of features reduced dramatically. The selected three features were then presented into the optimized SVM to identify various bearing conditions. The scheme was compared with the widely used WPT-Energy method and with a neural network classifier with respect to feature extractions and fault classifications, respectively. The results are in favour of the proposed scheme in terms of the feature dimension, number of support vectors, robustness to the data partition, and classification rate. © 2010 Authors.

77957941763	Theory and method of mechanism system design	Conceptual design is the most critical and creative phase of design. Recently, increasing attention has been directed to supporting conceptual-level computer aided creative design and its theories and methodologies. Specifically, for conceptual design of mechanical products, this paper presents a novel function solving model for mechanical product design and highlights the importance of systematic synthesis to achieve creative design. Then it builds a framework as a function-effect-process-action-mechanisms (FEPAM) mapping process, which enables creative design on the basis of conceiving different action schemes. After that, several key points are elaborated including 1) representing and decomposition methods of functions and motion behaviors; 2) action scheme representing method based on network plan techniques; and 3) variation and creation methods based on action scheme transformations. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0036299938	Output motion control of variable-input-speed linkage mechanisms	The input link of a linkage mechanism is normally assumed to operate at a constant speed and the motion characteristics of the output link are determined once the mechanism is designed. This paper proposes a flexible method by varying speed trajectories of the input link actively to improve output motion characteristics of linkage mechanisms. Criteria are presented for selecting suitable input speed trajectories to meet various design requirements and constraints. Two approaches are developed, one based on inverse kinematics and one using optimal control theory. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the design procedure.

0042320480	Study on dynamics characteristics of an elastodynamic system	The system dynamics model has been done. The contracting process of the curved-surface of the rubber disc is analyzed carefully, which is the main research aspect of the elastodynamics in the system. The coupling equation of the elastic surface and fluid is resolved by inverse resolution method. The main characteristics of the system, for instance, the departing-tube velocity, with which a carrier is to depart a launch tube, are estimated through resolving the simulation model of the system dynamics. The simulation is based on some known parameters and the experiment outcome of the elasticity modulus of a special rubber. On the other hand, the influences on the system characteristics accompanying with the changing of some system parameters are discussed. Finally, the conclusions are given that the elastodynamic system has a superior performance and the system deserves to be developed further as a kind of launch device.

0042819866	Process presentation and reasoning of scheme design based on semantic network method	The presentation method of mechanical kinematic scheme should support the whole process of conceptual design. To meet the requirement, a computer-aided conceptual design system must represent a scheme, generate a scheme, or scheme variants and evaluate the variants. Based on the demand of basic functions of scheme representation methods, a semantic network method is selected to represent process level, action level, mechanism level and the relationship among them. Computer-aided motion cycle chart exploration can be realized by representation and adjustment of the mechanism time coordination and its effect on the design scheme. The uncertain reasoning technology based on semantic network is applied to construct a semantic network fragment. The closeness degree formula is determined by matching and comparison between value to value, value to range, range to range of the design cases and design requirements. It is applied in the mechanism types selection of needle driving mechanism of industrial sewing mechanism, and the application indicates it is correct, useful and advanced.

0242381216	Modeling of industrial sewing machines and the balancing of thread requirement and thread supply	A sewing machine consists of four basic mechanisms: a take-up mechanism, a needle-motion mechanism, a material-feeding mechanism, and a bobbin. Its proper operation requires a delicate balance of these mechanisms. This paper introduces a computer-simulation model that represents these mechanisms and uses the model to predict the kinetic behavior of sewing machines. Based on the simulation, a quantitative understanding of the sewing machine can be achieved that leads to improved sewing-machine design and better sewing-process control. In particular, the balance of thread supply and thread requirement is studied. The thread supply is defined as the amount of thread supplied by the take-up mechanism within one stitch. The thread requirement is defined as the amount of thread required in one stitch and is controlled primarily by the bobbin mechanism. Both properties change instantaneously. From a practical point of view, if the thread requirement were much larger than the thread supply, then there would be skip stitches (when the loop cannot be formed properly) or even thread breakage. On the other hand, if the thread requirement were much less than the thread supply, then there might be poor stitches (with too much thread in the loop) or even needle-jamming. By using the simulation model, the instantaneous balance of the thread supply and the thread requirement is quantitatively studied. It is shown that the balance of thread supply and thread requirement can be changed and optimized by changing the design parameters of the take-up mechanism. The model is validated experimentally by using a Pfaff lockstitch industrial sewing machine. © Textile Institute.
