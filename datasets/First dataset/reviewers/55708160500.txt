79952595184	Scaling factor quantization for LDPC codes	This paper proposes a quantization scheme for low density parity check(LDPC) codes based on scaling factor by analyzing message distribution and the effect of quantization saturation. Messages are scaled for the check nodes and variable nodes, and for the initial channel value. Using the scaling, the scheme allows the integer part of message to include more information, and can lower the effect of quantization saturation. Messages of nodes are quantized with (q, 0). Due to the application of integer part instead of floating point operation, the hardware complexity is significantly reduced.

First, We analyzed the characteristic impedance of the microwave coplanar waveguides (CPW) with a new similarity method in FEM, which is especially useful for research of the problems about the nonuniform and irregular region, such as the case of micromachined microwave coplanar waveguide. By using this method, we calculated the characteristic impedance of MEMS waveguide and analyzed the change with its different dimensions. Then the samples with characteristic impedances of 120 Ω and 50 Ω were fabricated through the surface micromachining and bulk micromachining. Measurements have been performed at frequencies from 1 to 40GHz. The insert loss of transmission-line showed great improvement after the structures were suspended. At 30GHz, the insert loss was about 7dB/cm, reduced by more than 10dB/cm compared with without suspended. To compare with the transmission lines on the low-resistivity silicon (low-R Si), we also fabricated the transmission lines directly on the high-resistivity Si substrate (high-R Si), the insert loss was only 1-4dB/cm at the frequencies from 1 to 40GHz.

84878691688	New heuristic algorithms for low-energy mapping and routing in 3D NoC	Three Dimensional Network on Chip (3D NoC), which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, can achieve better performance than the traditional 2D NoC. However, when routers deliver packets in 3D NoC, more energy consumption is needed. High-energy consumption and small packaging density will cause excessive heat, which increases vulnerability of the system in performance and reliability. In this paper, we present a low-energy consumption mapping algorithm based on the symmetry of the architecture and construct a deadlock-free routing algorithm using mapping result information. Our proposed algorithms can reduce the total energy consumption of communication and achieve a good system performance under the bandwidth constraints. To evaluate the efficacy of the algorithms, we perform experiments on several benchmarks and compare the proposed algorithms with other existing algorithms. Experimental results show that, for complex benchmarks, our proposed algorithms get better results than others. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

As a basic component in on-chip router, arbiter has a big impact on the performance of router. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamically adaptive arbiter which is based on the round robin mechanism. The proposed arbiter detects buffer status of input ports and changes priorities of the input port dynamically to enhance the performance of the router. Simulation results show that the proposed arbiter can achieve 7.3% improvement in saturation packet injection rate and 13.3% improvement in saturation throughput of NoC on average, when compared with round robin arbiter. Using Synopsys design tools with 0.18-μm technology, implementation results show that a router with the proposed arbiter needs additional 4.8% area compared to a router with round robin arbiter. © MIDEM Society.
