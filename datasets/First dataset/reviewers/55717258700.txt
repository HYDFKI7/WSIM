84943613866	Tracking control of a piezoelectric actuator based on experiment hysteretic modeling	Micro positioning systems using piezoelectric stack actuator (PEA) have a very wide range of applications including ultra-precision machine tools, diamond turning machines and motion stage with flexure hinge structure mechanism design. These positioning responses comprise with hysteretic behavior when voltage is actuated. The tracking control accuracy of PEA is therefore limited due to their inherent hysteresis nonlinearity. The dynamics of the PEA modeling in positioning available in literatures were revisited, compared and discussed with incorporating simulated and experimental implementation in this paper. This paper presents a new computer-based tracking control approach for PEA by facilitating a feedforward open loop control based on hysteretic modeling from experiments. Simulations and experiments on tracking control of several sinusoidal waveform of input frequency shows that the root mean square tracking error can be reduced to be less than 2% of the maximum traveling path.

8844234982	Motion stage design with scanning-by-probe AFM for imaging nanocrystals on sapphire surface	The Mg-Al spinel nanocrystals were successfully grown at the etching pits of sapphire single crystal surface by precipitation. However, observation for such nanocrystals requires the resolution of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Scanning distance by scanning-by-probe AFM is constrained when the sample size is large in comparison with the size of nanocrystal.

1442290956	Use of PID and iterative learning controls on improving intra-oral hydraulic loading system of dental implants	This study presents the control design and tests of an intra-oral hydraulic system for quantitatively loading of a dental implant. The computer-controlled system was developed and employed for better pressure error compensation by PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control and point-to-point iterative learning algorithm. In vitro experiments showed that implant loading is precisely controlled (error 3%) for 0.5 Hz loading without air inclusion, and reasonably performed (error< 10%) with air inclusion up to 20% of the total hydraulic volume. The PID controller maintains forces at the desired level while the learning controller eliminates overshoot/undershoot at the onset of each loading cycle. The system can be potentially used for in vivo animal studies for better understanding of how bone responds to implant loading. Quantitative information derived from this biomechanical model will add to improved designs of dental implants.

0005699934	The phenomenon of apparent convergence followed by divergence in learning and repetitive control	It is a common experimental experience with learning and repetitive control, that the error decreases very substantially in the first few repetitions or periods, and then starts to grow. In some cases this takes the form of a long term instability, for example in experiments cited here instability became evident only after 2,500 repetitions. Here we develop both time domain and frequency domain approaches to both learning and repetitive control, including use of root locus and Nyquist concepts. And these different viewpoints are used to explain in different ways this phenomenon of apparent initial convergence followed by divergence. It is seen that with typical distributions of tracking errors in the frequency spectrum relative to the bandwidth of the feedback controller, this phenomenon is easily generated. Three classes of approaches are summarized for addressing this problem, either by stopping the mechanism of divergence, or by causing the convergence to continue to zero tracking error.

25144523943	Tracking control of a piezo-actuated stage based on frictional model	The tracking control accuracy of the piezoelectric actuator (PEA) is limited due to their inherent hysteretic nonlinearity. Direct drive of PEA on a positioning stage with friction force causes control problems in static errors, varying dynamic frictional force, limit cycles and stick-slip, et al. An approximated PEA model is synthesized based on linear transfer function with two uncertainty parameters for time delay and frictional force effect. The frictional model of the motion stage in the presliding and sliding regimes is considered thoroughly. The H-infinite tracking controller is designed for compensating the hysteresis delay and frictional force in PEA actuated stage during positioning. The Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is implemented to reduce the unmodelled repetitive error from the frictional characteristics. Numerical simulations and experimental tests consolidate that the RMS positioning error can be close to the hardware reproducibility and accuracy level. Experimental results show the controlled piezo-stage can be potentially used for nano technology applications for precision engineering in industrial systems.

33646848400	The dependence between ultrasonic exposure time and biological reactions in the paramecium	The effects of ultrasonic irradiation at different frequencies, i.e. 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 5 MHz, on the activation of the single cell creature biological reaction have been investigated. The ability shown by ultrasound in promoting and/or accelerating many reactions has been shown to be a useful field. The resonance frequency of Paramecium by using the ultrasound irradiation is an important parameter in this study. All other parameters being keep constant, it has been ascertained that an appropriate frequency value of ultrasound can be selected, capable of driving a biological reaction to its suitable yield. The oscillation of the cells in response to the ultrasound radiation is simulated using Rayleigh-Plesset's bubble activation theory. The resonance frequency of the unicellular creature is then calculated. In our experiment, the resonance (0.5 and 1 MHz) and non-resonance (0.25 and 5 MHz) frequencies were employed. The resonance frequency of the Paramecium vacuole is among 0.5013-1.2703 MHz. When the 0.5 and 1 MHz frequencies of ultrasound was irradiated in the samples, the relative growth rate was about 30% higher than that of unexposed sample. It is obviously that the inhibition or enhancement growth conditions did not appear during irradiation the non-resonance frequency ultrasound. In addition, experimental evidence suggests that the sustaining growth effect can be expected, when the irradiation time is divided into parts.

In general, ultrasound of higher applied intensity resulted in greater depth of permeation than lower intensity.

The prestress mechanism is not only used to against the tensile stress but also used to improve the output performance of the actuator. The simulation of the structural behavior is constructed and analyzed in ATILA program by modifying the related parameters of the piezoelectric and the elastic materials, the modal and harmonic analysis are both established in the FEA model. The feasibility of the pre-stress experiment is determined by the simulation result subsequently in this paper. The comparison of the output force and the natural frequency of the pretress mechanism between the different settings of the actuator designed in this study and the commercial products reveal that the linearity of the output force can be maintain and the new prestress mechanism exhibits an extremely low natural frequency which approach to zero as height-to-thickness ratio of the Belleville springs equal to √2. It means our new mechanical concept of the actuator can effectively promote the output efficiency which preserves the output force linearity of the piezoelectric ceramic; the excitation of the PZT or external vibration cannot establish the resonant frequency condition due to the improved design of the prestress mechanism. ©2007 IEEE.

58149159448	A mechanism of ultrasonic irradiation to assist or inhibit the Paramecium cells	This paper investigates the biological reactions of unicellular creature irradiated to a low intensity of ultrasonic field. The current study attempts to anticipate the value of the ultrasonic driving frequency which will induce the most significant biological reactions by using the theoretical model. The theoretical model of the cells in response to the ultrasonic irradiation is simulated using Rayleigh-Plesset's bubble activation theory. The simulation results indicate that the resonant frequency of the Paramecium vacuoles considered in the present study lies in the range 0.54-1.24 MHz. Ultrasonic irradiation experiments are performed at various power level intensities at driving frequencies corresponding to resonant (0.5 and 1 MHz) and nonresonant (0.25 and 5 MHz) frequencies. It is found that samples irradiated under different ultrasonic conditions exhibit clear differences in their cell proliferation tendencies. For example, in samples irradiated with lower power intensities and driving frequencies of 0.5 and 1 MHz, the number of cells in the treated samples is found to be approximately 30% higher than that in the original unexposed samples. However, when resonant frequencies and higher intensities are applied, the ultrasonic irradiation causes a shape change of the cell organelles and a corresponding reduction in the total number of cells in the treated sample. For the samples exposed to nonresonant frequency ultrasonic irradiation, it is found that the cell proliferation is limited and appears to vary independently of the applied irradiation intensity. © 2008 National Taiwan University.

This model is based on a second-order transfer function with two parameterization terms. The first time delay term consists of the hysteresis of piezo effect combined with frictional force lag with varying velocity. The second term is comprised of both presliding and sliding regimes. The H-infinite tracking controller is designed to compensate for the structural uncertainty associated with time delay and the unstructured frictional force in the PEA stage. Iterative Learning Control is implemented to reduce the un-modeled repetitive error by a factor of 20.

0035945866	Erythrocytes damage by ultrasound at different hydrostatic pressures	The study of the biological effect of ultrasound on tissue has become an important branch of biophysical ultrasonics. Among the important biological effects, which have been discovered, are chromosomal anomalies, cell death, destruction of cellular structures. Although heating may be important in some results, nonthermal mechanics, such as cavitation, are often suggested as being responsible for the observed effects. In this paper, the biological subject of this study is the red blood cells (RBC); the relationship between the threshold lesion of RBC and frequency of ultrasound was studied. It has been concerned that a suitable frequency value of ultrasound was selected, capable of driving the bubbles to an interesting reaction. The effective mass of the bubble for the oscillating system is due to the motion of the surrounding medium. For the purposes, by using the approximate expressions for the effective stiffness and mass of a gas body, one can determine the resonance frequency of the gas body. In the closed system, three types of frequencies were employed with different pressure. The cell death threshold varies with the ultrasonic frequency of exposure, the minimum at about 10 MHz. This report is intended to provide a useful way for the study of the biological effect of ultrasound at medically relevant frequencies.

0036525566	Biological effect of paramecium in diffused ultrasonic fields	Since the cell structure or biophysical reaction includes in the interaction between ultrasound and living matter. When multi-cell creature is exposed to ultrasound, this reaction will lead the biological effect becomes complex. Therefore, in this paper, a single cell creature is chosen to study the biological effects induced by ultrasound exposure. The paramecium, which possesses many features typical of higher-order animal cells, was considered an appropriate choice for this study. The ability shown by ultrasound in promoting and/or accelerating many reactions has been shown to be a useful field. The growth phase of paramecium by using the ultrasound irradiation is an important parameter in this study. In our experiment, the exponential and stationary phases were employed. Three important factors must be taken into account when an ultrasonic biological reaction is investigated: the medium system, the bubbles' field, and the acoustic field. The medium system involves the physical parameters of the medium field. The bubbles' field includes the reacting bubble size of the liquid and the resonance frequency of the reaction bubbles. The oscillation of the cells in response to the ultrasound radiation is simulated using Rayleigh-Plesset's bubble activation theory. The resonance frequency of the unicellular creature is then calculated. The acoustic field is about using the diffuse field theory of Sabine to create a uniform sound field for the radiation experiment. The resonance frequency of the paramecium vacuole is among 0.54-1.09 MHz. When the 0.25 and 0.5 MHz frequencies of ultrasound was irradiated in the stationary phase of the paramecium, the relative growth rate was about 20% lower than that of unexposed sample. Therefore, the phenomenon of inhibition and destruction appeared during irradiation. The exponential phase of the paramecium samples appear to be different when irradiated with 1 MHz ultrasound. As can be seen in the results, the maximum relative growth rate was increasing 18% with 1 MHz ultrasound exposure. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a new slew-rate controlled (SRC) output stage is proposed to appropriately increase the rise and fall times of the PWM output by combining a feedback capacitor technique and a distributedand- weighted design. Therefore, the supply bouncing during PWM switching can be reduced. The SRC output stage is successfully integrated into a DC-DC converter implemented with a 0.35mm 1P4M 3.3V mixed-signal CMOS process for verification. With an input voltage of 3.3V, an output voltage of 1.8V, a switching frequency of 500 kHz, and a load current range of 700mA, the active area of the converter is 2.3mm2.

0038234933	Use of the second harmonic in strain imaging: A phantom study	The clinical images of an ultrasound system are normally obtained by analyzing the ultrasonic echoes from the discontinuities in a patient. Information such as wave speed, acoustic impedance, and the attenuation coefficient computed from the ultrasonic echoes are the primary parameters used in constructing an ultrasonic image. However, the traditional medical imaging is insensitive to identify the abnormal regions of small stiff change. It often fails to reveal the extent or existence of tumors, which are found to be more stiff than surrounding normal tissues. To overcome these problems, this research proposes an ultrasonic imaging method based on tissue elasticity through the harmonic filter to construct a strain-harmonic image. This technique is formed by a process involving two steps. First, the phatom is compressed extenally to generate an internal strain field. Second, ultrasonic transmitting signals before and after compression are acquired and processed by harmoni filter. The strain profiles of a soft sample are converted into two-dimensional gray images using MATLAB software. Experiments were conducted for the comparison between the strain and starin-harmonic image. It is observed that the strain-harmonic images can illustrate layer location of the phantoms better than those plotted in the strain images.

84867241398	Prognostic diagnosis of ball screw preload loss for machine tool through the Hilbert-Huang transform and multiscale entropy measure	Detection of ball screw preload loss for machine tool has great significances in modern manufacturing processes for unexpected failures. This paper proposes a diagnostic method for ball screw preload loss through the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and multiscale entropy(MSE) process. The method is used to diagnose a ball screw preload loss through the motor torque current signals when machine tool is in operation. Maximum dynamic preloads of 2%, 4%, and 6% ball screws were predesigned, manufactured, and conducted experimentally. Signal patterns are discussed and revealed by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with the Hilbert Spectrum. Different preload features are extracted and discriminated using HHT. The irregularity development of ball screw with preload loss is determined and abstracted via MSE based on complexity perception. The experiment results successfully show that the prognostic status of ball screw preload loss can be envisaged by the proposed methodology. The smart sensing for the health of the ball screw is available based on comparative evaluation of MSE by the signal processing and pattern matching of EMD/HHT. This diagnosis method realizes the purposes of prognostic effectiveness on knowing the preload loss and utilizing convenience.

84870619959	Theoretical and experimental design of a new flexible hinged positioning stage	In this paper, a new flexible hinge (FH) positioning monolithic stage has been designed to cooperate with Piezoelectric (PZT) actuator for ultra-fine position application. To improve the dynamic characterization of the stage in positioning, the leaf type and notch type springs are considered. The Castigliano theorem and Lagrange's equation are applied and dynamic characterization of the stage is obtained. Taguchi Orthogonal Array Table (L9) is performed to design the finite element numerical simulations by ANSYS. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with additive model confirms the optimal geometry parameters of FH stage thereof. When the stage is constrained, theoretical result of natural frequency is 14% different from ANSYS result. With free-free boundary, experimental mode shapes of the initial six natural frequencies are under 3% variation with ANSYS results. Design FH stage has been proposed to establish a new micro positioning stage achieving better dynamic characterization.

84881055792	Prognostic diagnosis of hollow ball screw pretension on preload loss through sensed vibration signals	The pretension for a ball screw is a way to improve the position accuracy. Hollow ball screw without a cooling system has the thermal deformation effect due to increase in temperature. It will reduce precision accuracy in machine tool when the ball screw nut preload or ball screw pretension is lost. The purpose of this study is to use vibration signals for the prognostic analysis for the ball screw pretension. Features of different pretension conditions by 0, 5, 10, and 20μm are discriminated by empirical mode decomposition (EMD), fast Fourier transform (FFT), and marginal frequency method. Temperature effects with long-term operation were discussed. This study experimentally extracts the characteristic frequencies for bettering pretension through the vibration signals.

84881064150	Simulation and experiment of langevin-type piezoelectric ultrasonic horn for micro tool motion	The principle of a piezoelectric transducer used in this chapter is to transfer the high frequency of electrical energy to mechanical energy. Since the output displacement of piezoelectric transducer is too small, the need of amplifying the displacement of the tool is based on the design of horn shape. Since resonance frequency of the horn should be compatible with the vibration frequency of the piezoelectric vibrator. This chapter is first to conduct experiment to measure the vibration frequency and amplitude of a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) for ultrasonic vibration. According to the experimental result, the resonant frequency of the horn for amplifying the displacement of the PZT is achieved thereafter. Theoretical calculation and ANSYS simulation can be used for figuring out the geometrical shape of the piezoelectric actuated horn. In the simulation, the horn modal frequency and harmonics analysis via the ANSYS simulation reach the error less than 3 %. Experimental results will be compared and validated with the simulated results. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84884735384	A quality monitoring online system using an early warning abnormal trend distribution: A thickness measurement case study using a LVDT	To assure product quality, an early warning and inspection system to predict the variation (trend) of a product's quality (i.e. the product thickness) in the manufacturing process is necessary. Here, a manual online measurement of a production line installed with an online automatic warning system that will prevent manually accumulated errors from occurring is presented. Using this system, a quality trend profile will be made. The abnormal trend distribution will be obtained by randomly selecting the period of the quality trend profile and translating it into a time distribution bar chart. The monitoring online system will be pre-warned via the abnormal trend distribution. A product's thickness can be obtained using a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The analogue signal will be transmitted to the AD converter of the PLC's analogue input channel. The digital signal will be transmitted from the series port to the remote PC via the web control unit. A profile of the product's thickness measured by the LVDT will be monitored online and dynamically exhibited in the web-based remote system by using an embedded Javascript, an HTML, and a web control unit. The upper/lower thresholds will be preset in the product thickness' profile. In addition, the quality monitoring system will be pre-warned via the time distribution bar chart when the abnormal trend distribution occurs. Consequently, the web-base monitoring system can be extended to remotely connect to all the LVDT devices. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Simulation results show that IPSO-ILC-PID controller without adaptive bandwidth filter tuning have the chance of producing high frequencies in the error signals when the filter bandwidth is fixed for every repetition. However the learnable and unlearnable error signals should b e separated for bettering control process. Thus the adaptive bandwidth of a zero phase filter in ILC-PID controller with IPSO tuning is applied to one single motion axis of a CNC tab le machine. Simulation results show that the developed controller can cancel the errors efficiently as repetition goes. The frequency response of the error signals is analyzed by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) method.

This study tested the bioeffects of ultrasound on cysts of the crustaceans Artemia salina in an attempt to identify ultrasonic driving frequencies which are capable of inducing a significant biological reaction. Oscillations were simulated in the outer cuticular membrane and embryonic cuticle channels in response to the ultrasonic irradiation based on the Rayleigh-Plesset bubble activation theory. The simulation results indicate that the resonant frequency of the outer cuticular membrane is from 0.22 to 0.23 MHz; the resonant frequency of the gas channels in the embryonic cuticle is in the range from 2.46 to 4.71 MHz. Ultrasonic irradiation was applied at driving frequencies corresponding to resonant (0.23 and 4.7 MHz) and non-resonant (0.5 and 1 MHz) frequencies at the intensities of 3.25 and 13.63 mW/cm

The conventional ILC learning process has the potential to excite rich frequency contents and try to learn the error signals. However the learnable and unlearnable error signals should be separated for bettering control process as repetition goes. Producing unlearnable frequencies for error compensation signals should be avoided when the filter bandwidth is not changed at every repetition. Thus the adaptive bandwidth in ILC with the aid of IPSO tuning is proposed here. Simulation results show the controller can cancel the errors as repetition goes. The frequency response of the error signals is verified by the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) method. Tracking errors are reduced and validated with application to positioning profile of the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tool and robot arm systems.

The conventional ILC learning process has the potential to excite rich frequency contents and try to learn the error signals. However the learnable and unlearnable error signals should be separated for bettering control process as repetition goes. Producing high frequency error condition should be avoided before the phase margin caused any trouble. The filter bandwidth should be changed at every repetition. Thus adaptive bandwidth in the ILC controller with the aid of IPSO tuning is proposed here. Simulation results show the new controller can cancel the errors efficiently as repetition goes. The correlation coefficient validates the learnable compensated error signal for the trajectory is adaptively decomposed from previous error history via the bandwidth tuning mechanism in next repetition. The learnable error signals of the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) through the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) correlate efficiently with reduced tracking error as repetition goes.

The PEA output hysteretic model is synthesized based on the two first-order transfer function (TF) systems in parallel with two tuned parameters determined from experimentation. Two open-loop tracking controllers cooperated with TF model are implemented to compensate the hysteresis of linear positioning. Experimental tests on tracking sinusoidal and triangular waveforms with signal frequencies of 7.5-20 Hz and PEA traveling amplitudes of 4.22-14.82 μm are revisited and compared with Bouc-Wen and Duhem models. Experimental results show that the RMS tracking error can be reduced to less than 2% of the PEA maximum traveling distance at predetermined frequency. Furthermore, using the model reference control for additive compensation in the loop, experimental results consolidate that the RMS tracking error can be reduced to less than 4% of the maximum traveling distance with signal amplitudes of 30-100 V and approximates 4.5% with signal frequencies of 7.5-20 Hz.
