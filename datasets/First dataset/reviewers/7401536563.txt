84861793700	Preliminary nondestructive tests by ultrasonic inspection on w-Cu plasma-facing components for east	With increases in the heating and driving power in EAST, the present SiC-C plasma-facing components (PFCs) will be replaced by W coatings on actively cooled Cu heat sinks in the lower-heat-flux zone (first wall), prepared by vacuum plasma spraying, and by ITER-like W-Cu monoblocks in the higher-heat-flux zone (divertor). These components are provided with thousands of joints that should be assessed to demonstrate their integrity. An ultrasonic method named pulse echo using highfrequency probes and normal incidence of the ultrasonic beam to the joint interface has been developed. For the W-coating PFC, although the existence of porous structure, shrinkage cracks, and delamination in W coating can adversely affect the sensibility of detecting interface defects, the ultrasonic technique is able to detect, locate, and size them in certain conditions; for the W-Cu monoblocks, the ultrasonic technique is also able to detect, locate, and size defects in the W-oxygen-free high conductivity (OFHC) Cu interface, but further detecting and analysis should be carried out for the OFHC Cu-CuCrZr interface based on the preliminary work.

84887429979	Sintering behavior of W-30Cu composite powder prepared by electroless plating	Powder metallurgy technique was employed to prepare W-30 wt.% Cu composite through a chemical procedure. This includes powder pre-treatment followed by deposition of electroless Cu plating on the surface of the pre-treated W powder. The composite powder and W-30Cu composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Cold compaction was carried out under pressures ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa while sintering at 850 C, 1000 C and 1200 C. The relative density, hardness, compressive strength, and electrical conductivity of the sintered samples were investigated. The results show that the relative sintered density of the titled composites increased with the sintering temperature. However, in solid sintering, the relative density increased with pressure. At 1200 C and 400 MPa, the liquid-sintered specimen exhibited optimum performance, with the relative density reaching as high as 95.04% and superior electrical conductivity of IACS 53.24%, which doubles the national average of 26.77%. The FE-SEM microstructure evaluation of the sintered compacts showed homogenous dispersion of Cu and W and a Cu network all over the structure. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84896986618	Effects of simplified pretreatment process on the morphology of W-Cu composite powder prepared by electroless plating and its sintering characterization	Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) composite powder was prepared by electroless plating with a simplified pretreatment. Morphologies and coposition of the original W, simply pretreated W, W-Cu composite powder, and sintered W-Cu samples were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS). Cold compaction was carried out under the pressure of 400. MPa while sintering at 1200. °C. The relative density and electrical conductivity of the sintered samples were investigated. The results show that the defect formed on the surface of the simply treated W powder favors the adsorption, nucleation, and growth of Cu grain in subsequent electroless copper plating. Cellular projection at the same conditions on the surface of the simply treated W powder increased with the increase in HF content up to a certain range. The W-Cu composite powder obtained after electroless copper plating became more even; however, continued increase in HF content to a certain value caused the decrease in the number of defects that formed on the surface of pretreated W powder as well as the decrease in the amount of Cu grains adsorbed on the surface of W powder during electroless copper plating, but the number of free and not be adsorbed Cu grains were increased. Lastly, the obtained evenness degree of the W-Cu composite powder was reduced. At 1200. °C and 400. MPa, the sintered specimen exhibited optimum performance, with the relative density reaching as high as 95.04% and superior electrical conductivity of IACS at 53.24%, which doubles the national average of 26.77%. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84907907777	Recrystallization kinetics of warm-rolled tungsten in the temperature range 1150-1350 °c	Pure tungsten is a potential candidate material for the plasma-facing first wall and the divertor of fusion reactors. Both parts have to withstand high temperatures during service. This will alter the microstructure of the material by recovery, recrystallization and grain growth and will cause degradation in material properties as a loss in mechanical strength and embrittlement. The thermal stability of a pure tungsten plate warm-rolled to 67% thickness reduction was investigated by long-term isothermal annealing in the temperature range between 1150 °C and 1350 °C up to 2200 h. Changes in the mechanical properties during annealing are quantified by Vickers hardness measurements. They are described concisely by classical kinetic models for recovery and recrystallization. The observed time spans for recrystallization and the obtained value for the activation energy of the recrystallization process indicate a sufficient thermal stability of the tungsten plate during operation below 1075 °C.

The binding energy between He and He cluster is shown to be positive, and thus, He is easy to form bubbles by self-trapping. The mean squared displacements (MSDs) were employed to determine the diffusivities of He clusters with different sizes at different temperatures. The He bubble formation at different temperatures with 1% He was also investigated. It is revealed that the formation of He bubbles is strongly associated with the temperature and the diffusivities of the He clusters in W. The results demonstrate the initial stage of the He bubble formation and growth in W.

The analysis results from SP test data indicate that the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of the ultrafine-grained tungsten decrease to 386 °C and 322 °C due to the ECAP processing at 800 °C and 950 °C, respectively. The reason of the improvement in both strength and ductility of the ultrafine-grained tungsten produced by ECAP is discussed.

Vacancy provides an isosurface of optimal charge density that induces collective H binding on its internal surface, a prerequisite for the formation of H2 molecule and nucleation of H bubble inside the vacancy. The critical H density on the vacancy surface before the H2 formation is found to be 1019 - 1020 H atoms per m2.

74949138629	Investigating behaviours of hydrogen in a tungsten grain boundary by first principles: From dissolution and diffusion to a trapping mechanism	We have investigated the dissolution, segregation and diffusion of hydrogen (H) in a tungsten (W) grain boundary (GB) using a first-principles method in order to understand the GB trapping mechanism of H. Optimal charge density plays an essential role in such a GB trapping mechanism. Dissolution and segregation of H are directly associated with the optimal charge density, which can be reflected by the H solution and segregation energy sequence for the different interstitial sites. To occupy the optimal-charge-density site, H can be easily trapped by the W GB with the solution and segregation energy of -0.23 eV and -1.11 eV, respectively. Kinetically, such a trapping is easier to realize due to the much lower diffusion barrier of 0.13-0.16 eV from the bulk to the GB in comparison with the segregation energy, suggesting that it is quite difficult for the trapped H to escape out of the GB. However, the GB can hold no more than 2 H atoms because the isosurface of optimal charge density almost disappears with the second H atom in, leading to the conclusion that H

We show that single H atom is energetically favorable sitting at the tetrahedral interstitial site (TIS) instead of octahedral interstitial site and diagonal interstitial site. This can be confirmed by the electron localization function result. Bader charge analysis suggests that the bonding between H and surrounding Mo is mainly ionic mixed with slight covalent component. Double H atoms tend to be paired up at the two neighboring TIS's along the 〈1 1 0〉 direction with the distance of ∼0.221 nm and the binding energy of 0.03 eV.

Here, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the stability of point defects and their complexes in tungsten carbide. Our results confirm that the defect formation energies of carbon are much lower than that of tungsten and reveal the carbon vacancy to be the dominant defect in tungsten carbide. The CC dimer configuration along the dense a direction is the most stable configuration of carbon interstitial defect. The results of carbon defect diffusion show that the carbon vacancy stay for a wide range of temperature because of extremely high diffusion barriers, while carbon interstitial migration is activated at lower temperatures for its considerably lower activation energy.

78349277638	Towards suppressing H blistering by investigating the physical origin of the H-He interaction in W	We investigate the physical origin of H-He interaction in W in terms of optimal charge density by calculating the energetics and diffusion properties using a first-principles method. On the one hand, we show a strong attraction between H and He in W originated from the charge density redistribution due to the presence of He, driving H segregation towards He. This can block the permeation of H into deeper bulk and thus suppress H blistering. On the other hand, we demonstrate that He, rather than H, energetically prefers to occupy the vacancy centre due to its closed-shell structure, which can blockH2 formation at the vacancy centre. This is because He causes a redistribution of charge density inside the vacancy to make it 'not optimal' for the formation of H2 molecules, which can be treated as a preliminary nucleation of the H bubbles. We thus propose that H retention and blistering inWcan be suppressed by doping the noble gas elements. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

78649716379	Features and initial results of the EAST divertor plasma experiments	The first dedicated divertor physics experiments were carried out on Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) in April 2009. Detailed measurements of plasma parameters at the divertor targets were made using an extensive array of divertor diagnostics, and some insights into several divertor physics issues were gained. This work was focused primarily on ohmic discharges. The behavior of divertor plasma, power asymmetry between inner and outer targets, and different fueling methods were investigated in both single null (SN) and double null (DN) divertor discharges. Divertor plasma detachment was achieved, for the first time on EAST, by ramping up the density during the discharge with well controlled, steady divertor configuration. The screening of carbon has been studied by puffing methane into the divertor. In addition, radiative divertor experiments were performed by localized argon injection, leading to a significant reduction in the heat flux on the target plates due to enhanced radiation in the divertor. This provides a means to avoid excess heat load on divertor components, specifically the divertor target tiles, which is essential for high power and long pulse operations, as envisioned for EAST. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

80053561546	First principles study of hydrogen behaviors in hexagonal tungsten carbide	Understanding the behaviors of hydrogen in hexagonal tungsten carbide (WC) is of particular interest for fusion reactor design due to the presence of WC in the divertor of fusion reactors. Here, we have used first principles calculations to study the hydrogen behavior in WC. It is found that the most stable interstitial site for the hydrogen atom is the projection of the octahedral interstitial site on tungsten basal plane, followed by the site near the projection of the octahedral interstitial site on carbon basal plane. The binding energy between two interstitial hydrogen atoms is negative, suggesting that hydrogen itself is not capable of trapping another hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen molecule. The calculated results on the interaction between hydrogen and vacancy indicate that hydrogen atom is preferably trapped by vacancy defects and hydrogen molecule can not be formed in mono-vacancy. In addition, the hydrogen atom bound to carbon is only found in tungsten vacancy. We also study the migrations of hydrogen in WC and find that the interstitial hydrogen atom prefers to diffuse along the c-axis. Our studies provide some explanations for the results of the thermal desorption process of energetic hydrogen ion implanted into WC. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Particle and heat fluxes are higher at outboard divertor targets than those at inboard divertor targets for both SN and DN. However, the DN divertor configuration exhibits a much stronger in-out asymmetry favoring outer divertors. DN operation also leads to an up-down asymmetry with higher particle fluxes to the divertors with their ∇B drift toward the X-point. Reversing toroidal field direction shows a strong influence on the divertor asymmetries. The plasma exhibits a large amplitude broadband turbulence in the outer divertors for both SN and DN, which is significantly reduced in the inner divertors, especially for DN. This coincides with a broad divertor SOL profile on the outboard side. Initial comparisons are also made with SOLPS-B2/EIRENE modeling. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The in-out asymmetry is reversed when changing the divertor configuration from LSN to USN, thus clearly demonstrating the effect of classical drifts. DN exhibits an even stronger in-out divertor asymmetry, favoring the outer divertor. A significant top-down asymmetry is also seen for DN, with greater particle and heat fluxes to the bottom divertor. In addition, the parallel plasma flow has been measured by a fast moving Mach probe at the outer midplane, which shows similar magnitude to the Pfirsch-Schlter flow. Its contribution to the poloidal particle flux is also assessed and comparison is made with that from the poloidal E × B drift. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84862027288	Particle and power deposition on divertor targets in EAST H-mode plasmas	The effects of edge-localized modes (ELMs) on divertor particle and heat fluxes were investigated for the first time in the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). The experiments were carried out with both double null and lower single null divertor configurations, and comparisons were made between the H-mode plasmas with lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) and those with combined ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH). The particle and heat flux profiles between and during ELMs were obtained from Langmuir triple-probe arrays embedded in the divertor target plates. And isolated ELMs were chosen for analysis in order to reduce the uncertainty resulting from the influence of fast electrons on Langmuir triple-probe evaluation during ELMs. The power deposition obtained from Langmuir triple probes was consistent with that from the divertor infra-red camera during an ELM-free period. It was demonstrated that ELM-induced radial transport predominantly originated from the low-field side region, in good agreement with the ballooning-like transport model and experimental results of other tokamaks. ELMs significantly enhanced the divertor particle and heat fluxes, without significantly broadening the SOL width and plasma-wetted area on the divertor target in both LHCD and LHCD+ICRH H-modes, thus posing a great challenge for the next-step high-power, long-pulse operation in EAST. Increasing the divertor-wetted area was also observed to reduce the peak heat flux and particle recycling at the divertor target, hence facilitating long-pulse H-mode operation. The particle and heat flux profiles during ELMs appeared to exhibit multiple peak structures, and were analysed in terms of the behaviour of ELM filaments and the flux tubes induced by modified magnetic topology during ELMs. © 2012 IAEA, Vienna.

84865490125	Overview of r&d on plasma-facing materials and components in China	A project to realize, in several years, a W/Cu divertor on Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) with ITER-like plasma-facing component (PFC) configuration was launched at Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP) in 2010. The ITER-like configuration should withstand the rapid increase in particle and power impact onto the divertor and demonstrate the feasibility of the ITER design under practical long-pulse tokamak plasmas. The project could help not only EAST experiments, but also realize ITER PFC technology validation and bring answers in a timely manner for the ITER full-W divertor for the nuclear phase. Southwest Institute of Physics (SWIP) will have 10% of the first wall (FW) procurement package of the enhanced heat flux (EHF) type. The materials have been developed and characterized according to the ITER-grade material specifications, including vacuum hot pressing (VHP)-Be, CuCrZr alloy, and 316L(N)-IG forged blocks, and qualification testing of the VHP-Be tiles joining to the CuCrZr heat sink by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) has been carried out. Some Chinese universities have started to explore new grades of Wmaterials, e.g., carbide or oxide dispersion strengthened fine grain W materials, and investigated their behavior under high heat loads.

84865754045	Tritium uptake in graphite tiles exposed to EAST plasma and then tritium gas	Tritium exposure experiments were carried out for three kinds of EAST SiC coated doped-graphite (SiC/C) samples, one from the original graphite tiles without being irradiated, and the other two from erosion and deposition areas of first wall after the 2009 campaign in EAST. β-ray-induced X-ray spectrometry (BIXS) was used to characterize the exposed samples. It is showed that the significant amount of tritium was absorbed in the surface of deposition sample in comparison with that of original sample, which was also supported by the results of imaging plate (IP) measurements. In addition, it was found that drastic decrease in tritium retention appeared by lowering exposure temperature, and the trapped tritium was maintained stably with time.

84867155202	First principles study of foreign interstitial atom (carbon, nitrogen) interactions with intrinsic defects in tungsten	We performed a series of first-principles calculations to investigate the foreign interstitial atom (FIA) interactions with intrinsic defects in tungsten. We found the following: (i) The introduction of the FIA reduces the vacancy formation energy, resulting in the increase of the equilibrium concentration of vacancies. (ii) The positive binding energy between two FIAs suggests that the FIA can attract other FIAs. (iii) The FIA is easily trapped by the vacancy, and a single vacancy can accommodate up to 4 and 6 atoms in a stable manner for carbon and nitrogen, respectively. (iv) There is an attraction interaction between the FIA and the self-interstitial atom (SIA), and the FIA can reduce the SIA jump frequency and enhance the formation of SIA clusters in tungsten. Moreover, the difference between carbon and nitrogen are also discussed with respect to the formation of FIA-FIA covalent bond and the accumulation around the saturated FIA

84867535654	The effects of electropulsing on the recrystallization behavior of rolled pure tungsten	Electropulsing treatment (EPT) has been first applied to the recrystallization of a refractory metal'tungsten (W). We have three major observations: (i) the recrystallization temperature of a rolled pure W under EPT is ∼900 K higher than its conventional recrystallization temperature (1603 K); (ii) the time required for recrystallization is significantly reduced compared with that of conventional heat treatment (CHT); (iii) the recrystallized grains are also much finer than the ones under CHT. Based on quantitative analysis, we conclude that the huge increase of the recrystallization temperature of the rolled pure W under EPT is due to the high heating rate generated by EPT and high activation energy for vacancy diffusion of W, and the accelerated recrystallization and grain refinement have resulted from the coupling of thermal and electromigration effects of EPT at relatively high temperatures. © Copyright 2012 Materials Research Society.

84867894883	Effect of vacancy on the dissolution and diffusion properties of hydrogen and helium in molybdenum	We present first-principles study of the stability and diffusion properties of H and He in Mo. The results show that diatomic H-H and He-He prefer 〈1 0 0〉 and 〈1 1 1〉 dumbbell configurations in single vacancy, respectively. The occupation and migration of H and He nearby a vacancy (or He-vacancy complex) are very different from that in bulk: both H and He are more preferable to occupy the tetrahedral interstitial sites closer to the vacancy (or He-vacancy complex), and the diffusion barriers of H and He into the vacancy (or He-vacancy complex) are slightly reduced but the diffusion barriers out of the defect are severely increased, especially for He. Besides, the presence of single He at tetrahedral interstitial site reduces the energy required for its nearby vacancy formation more considerably than that of H (the produced vacancy traps the H or He), contributing to the accumulation and different disposition depth of H and He in Mo. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84870160042	Observation of a new turbulence-driven limit-cycle state in H-modes with lower hybrid current drive and lithium-wall conditioning in the EAST superconducting tokamak	The first high confinement H-mode plasma has been obtained in the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) with about 1 MW lower hybrid current drive after wall conditioning by lithium evaporation and real-time injection of Li powder. Following the L-H transition, a small-amplitude, low-frequency oscillation, termed a limit-cycle state, appears at the edge during the quiescent phase with good energy and particle confinement. Detailed measurements by edge Langmuir probes show modulation interaction and strong three-wave coupling between the low-frequency oscillations and high-frequency-broadband (80-500 kHz) turbulences that emerge after the L-H transition or in the inter-ELM phase. The potential fluctuations at the plasma edge are correlated with the limit-cycle oscillations, and the fluctuations in the floating potential signals at different toroidal, poloidal and radial locations are strongly correlated with each other, with nearly no phase differences poloidally and toroidally, and finite phase difference radially, thus providing strong evidence for zonal flows. The growth, saturation and disappearance of the zonal flows are strongly correlated with those of the high-frequency turbulence. And the measurements demonstrate that the energy gain of zonal flows is of the same order as the energy loss of turbulence. This strongly suggests the interactions between zonal flows and high-frequency turbulences at the pedestal during the limit-cycle state. © 2012 IAEA, Vienna.

84870199064	The role of impurity oxygen in hydrogen bubble nucleation in tungsten	The impurity role for hydrogen bubble nucleation is investigated based on first-principles studies of the interaction between impurities (oxygen and carbon), hydrogen and vacancy in tungsten. A new mechanism of hydrogen bubble nucleation is proposed: the interstitial oxygen atom traps multiple hydrogen atoms inducing the appearance of some unstable lattice sites nearby, where the initial vacancy can be created to form vacancy-oxygen-hydrogen complex, whose formation energy is so low that abundant vacancy-oxygen-hydrogen complexes could survive and thus the hydrogen bubble nucleates. This mechanism could provide a sound explanation for the hydrogen bubble nucleation in tungsten (with quite low vacancy concentration) exposed to low-energy (far lower than displacement threshold energy) deuterium ions irradiation. The proposed mechanism should be generally applicable for hydrogen bubble nucleation in other metals with low vacancy concentration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The average grain size of W decreases with the increasing number of ECAP extrusion passes and can be refined from the initial value of about 6 μm to 0.9 μm after two ECAP extrusion passes at 800°C, while it is refined to 1.5 μm after three ECAP extrusion passes at 950°C. Small angle tilt grain boundaries consisting of edge dislocations are formed in the 950°C extrusion. Intergranular fracture mode dominates the fracture failure of the W after 800°C extrusion while transgranular facture mode together with intergranular fracture mode play an important role in the fracture failure of the W after 950°C extrusion. The Vickers microhardness increases from about 510 HV for the as-received W to about 560 HV for the W extruded at both 800°C and 950°C. However, the thermal conductivity was affected only a little by the ECAP processing. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The optical and TEM micrographs exhibit that the average grain size was refined from 20 μm for the initial sample to 200 nm for the sample ECAP extruded six passes and the martensitic laths were severely destroyed during ECAP processing. With the increasing number of the extrusion passes, the microhardness and the tensile strength increase from 2.7 GPa and 730 MPa for the initial sample to 3.8 GPa and 1160 MPa for the sample extruded six passes, while the uniform elongation decreases from 23% to 10%, respectively. After the annealing, the grains grow slightly to 300 nm, and the tensile strength of the samples extruded one and six passes decreases to 880 MPa and 1140 MPa while the elongation increases to 21% and 12%, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84874177564	Dissolving, trapping and detrapping mechanisms of hydrogen in bcc and fcc transition metals	First-principles calculations are performed to investigate the dissolving, trapping and detrapping of H in six bcc (V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo,W) and six fcc (Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au) metals. We find that the zero-point vibrations do not change the site-preference order of H at interstitial sites in these metals except Pt. One vacancy could trap a maximum of 4 H atoms in Au and Pt, 6 H atoms in V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Ni, Pd, Cu and Ag, and 12 H atoms in Mo and W. The zero-point vibrations never change the maximum number of H atoms trapped in a single vacancy in these metals. By calculating the formation energy of vacancy-H (Vac-Hn) complex, the superabundant vacancy in V, Nb, Ta, Pd and Ni is demonstrated to be much more easily formed than in the other metals, which has been found in many metals including Pd, Ni and Nb experimentally. Besides, we find that it is most energetically favorable to form Vac-H

84880164035	Effects of alloying and transmutation impurities on stability and mobility of helium in tungsten under a fusion environment	The behaviour of helium in metals is particularly significant in fusion research due to the He-induced degradation of materials. A small amount of impurities introduced either by intentional alloying or by transmutation reactions, will interact with He and lead the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials to change. In this paper, we present the results of first-principles calculations on the interactions of He with impurities and He diffusion around them in tungsten (W), including the interstitials Be, C, N, O, and substitutional solutes Re, Ta, Tc, Nb, V, Os, Ti, Si, Zr, Y and Sc. We find that the trapping radii of interstitial atoms on He are much larger than those of substitutional solutes. The binding energies between the substitutional impurities and He increase linearly with the relative charge densities at the He occupation site, indicating that He atoms easily aggregate at the low charge density site. The sequence of diffusion energy barriers of He around the possible alloying elements is Ti > V > Os > Ta > Re. The present results suggest that Ta might be chosen as a relatively suitable alloying element compared with other possible ones. © 2013 IAEA, Vienna.

84880861475	Preparation of ultrafine W-Cu composite powder using ultrasonic-assisted electroless plating	W-Cu ultrafine/nanocomposite powders have high sintering activity, so ultrafine/nanotechnology of W-Cu composite powders is one of the main methods to obtain fully dense, high-performance W-Cu composite materials. Cu-coated ultrafine W composite powders were synthesized by ultrasonic-assisted electroless plating process with non-noble metal activation pretreatment at room temperature in this paper. The growth mechanism of Cu layers and surface morphologies and composition of initial ultrafine W powders, pretreated W powders and Cu-coated W powders were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS). The results show that the uniformly Cu coated W composite powder is successfully synthesized without conventional sensitization and activation steps by ultrasonic-assisted electroless plating at room temperature. The Cu layers on the ultrafine W powders had cell structure with dense, uniform distribution. The growth mechanism of Cu layers appears as follows: the surfaces of pretreated W powders appear linear-like and lamellar-like surface defects which act as activated sites. The reactants in the plating solution were adsorbed on catalytic activity surfaces of powders and happened oxidation-reduction reaction. The growth and aggregation mechanisms of Cu particles after nucleation are stripy Cu-cells grew up, bend, bifurcated, and aggregated, then wounding into a cellular structure, like «wrapping wool clusters» in the life.

Detailed information of compositions at the superficial and in-depth positions of the first wall of divertor tiles can be obtained by analyzing the spectra from 200 to 980 nm. The decrease in concentrations of the depositional elements (such as D, Li) was clearly observed in the depth from 0 to 100 μm, but the concentrations of the substrate elements were found to be relatively uniform in the depth after dozens of laser pulses. The linear correlation approach has been applied for improving the impurity depth profile accuracy and identifying the interface boundary between the deposition layer and the substrate for the first time.

84885476125	Retention behavior of deuterium and oxygen in boronized VPS-W	Retention of deuterium implanted into boronized vacuum plasma spraying (VPS-W) and the corresponding oxygen effect have been studied via measurements of TDS, XPS, and SEM. It is found that for the VPS-W without boronization, oxygen is the main impurity. However, the oxygen has no influence on the deuterium retention. In the boronized VPS-W, the implanted deuterium would break some chemical bonds and be trapped by new bonds, such as B-O-D, resulting in increases of D retention and shift of D desorption to higher temperature. The XPS spectra show that most of the oxygen would be removed from the surfaces with boron during the thermal desorption at a rather high temperature, exceeding the wall temperature in EAST operation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

According to the effective lithium sputtering yields, for both cases the lithium erosion is mainly due to physical sputtering rather than evaporation. Furthermore, the modelled re-deposition fraction of evaporated lithium is much higher than that of sputtered lithium, which is due to the shorter ionisation mean free path of thermal lithium atoms. Therefore, the evaporation erosion effect can be neglected compared to physical sputtering when the surface temperature is below 450 °C.

84886681347	Principal physical parameters characterizing the interactions between irradiation-induced point defects and several tilt symmetric grain boundaries in Fe, Mo and W	Using molecular-statics, we investigate principal physical parameters characterizing the binding of vacancies and interstitials with grain boundaries (GBs), and their annihilation near GBs in iron, molybdenum and tungsten. Binding energies strongly correlate with GB energies averagely and have a general level when scaled by the bulk defect formation energy. Defect diffusion is enhanced near the GB. The diffusion barrier of the vacancy gradually decreases as it approaches to the GB. For interstitials, there exist several layers near the GB in which the absorption of interstitials is spontaneous and out of which orientation-dependent. For the interstitial-rich GB, the vacancy near the GB can be annihilated at a low barrier, independent of the system. The GB influence range is limited of 1.0-2.0 nm from the GB. Our obtained principal physical parameters may be applied to build the master framework for defects' generation, transport and fate and thus to evaluate the damage rate in nano/poly- crystalline materials. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84888991336	An energetic and kinetic perspective of the grain-boundary role in healing radiation damage in tungsten	Radiation-induced damage in tungsten (W) and W alloys has been considered as one of the most important issues in fusion research, because radiation-produced defects not only degrade the mechanical property but also change the behaviours of H and He in W significantly, such as the retention of H. Nano-structured W has been developed to reduce accumulation of defects within grains and further mitigate radiation-induced damage. However, the fundamental role of a grain boundary (GB) in healing radiation damage in W is not yet well understood. Using molecular dynamics and statics, we evaluate energetically and kinetically the role of a GB in defect evolution (vacancy and interstitial segregation and their annihilation) near the GB in W, by calculating the vacancy (interstitial) formation energy, segregation energy, diffusion barrier, vacancy-interstitial annihilation barrier near the GB and the corresponding influence range of the GB. We find that, as reported and expected, interstitials are preferentially trapped into GBs over vacancies during irradiation, with vacancies dominant near the GB and interstitials highly localized at the GB. On the one hand, the GB serves as a sink both for vacancies and interstitials near itself by reducing their formation energy and diffusion barrier. The formation energy of the vacancy decreases only by ∼0.86 eV, but 7.5 eV is reduced for the formation energy of the interstitial in the GB core, indicating that the sink is unexpectedly stronger for interstitials than vacancies. The average barrier of vacancy diffusion is 0.98 eV much less than 1.8 eV in the bulk; the interstitial migrates into the GB via a barrier-free process. On the other hand, the GB acts as a catalyst for the vacancy-interstitial recombination at the GB by lowering the annihilation barrier. The annihilation with the average barrier as low as 0.31 eV works even at a low temperature of 121 K; besides, the annihilation of a close vacancy-interstitial pair is spontaneous. Meanwhile, the annihilation mechanism near the GB is modified due to the exceptionally large reduction in the interstitial formation energy. The influence range of the GB is small (1-1.5 nm), leading to a small volume fraction of the GB region working as the sink and the catalyst. This indicates that GBs in fine W grains may play a limited role in improving radiation performance. © 2013 IAEA, Vienna.

In support of PSI studies, DIII-D uses the Divertor Materials Evaluation System (DiMES), which contains a removable probe where material samples can be exposed to as few as a single well-characterized plasma shot. Experiments, consisting of a carbon DiMES probe surface with metal coatings of Be, W, V, Mo or Al, have been exposed to the DIII-D lower divertor strike point plasma for cumulative discharge times of 4-20s. Extensive DIII-D divertor diagnostics provided well-characterized plasmas for modeling efforts.

The second is on the exposure to vertical displacement discharges and X-point plasma discharges of W-fuzz buttons, which were prepared by the PISCES (UCSD) laboratory. The surprising results are the robustness of the W-fuzz and that W impurity was not detected in the plasma core at the conditions studied. © 2013 IEEE.

The results show that dislocation strengthening rather than grain boundary strengthening plays a dominant role in the increase in microhardness. Upon annealing at different temperatures, it is found that there is an evident decrease in microhardness between 650 and 700. °C for the ECAPed specimens processed by 1 pass and 4 passes. An internal friction peak is also observed in the vicinity of 670. °C for the ECAPed specimens during the first heating but disappears during the second heating. The TEM observations indicate that there is no evident change in the grain size for the ECAPed specimens before and after the annealing at 700. °C for 1. h. It is concluded that the softening around 670. °C stems mainly from the dislocation annihilation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84891785092	First-principles calculations of transition metal-solute interactions with point defects in tungsten	The interactions of solute atoms with point defects can modify the microstructure of materials and affect microstructural evolution, ultimately leading to macroscopic changes in the mechanical properties of materials. In this paper, we performed a series of first-principles calculations to quantify the intrinsic properties of transition metal (TM) solutes and their interactions with point defects in W, including vacancies and 〈1 1 1〉-crowdions. This work provides good explanations for recent experimental results on the influence of solute on radiation response and might aid future material design regarding the choice of alloy composition. We find that the early TM elements do not segregate together while the late elements tend to accumulate to form small clusters in dilute W alloys. The solute-point defect interactions are mostly attractive with a few exceptions, and can be well understood in terms of the combination of, and competition between, electronic effects and strain-relief effects, which are characterized by the solute electronegativity and atomic size, respectively. Solute atoms with larger electronegativity more favorably bond to the vacancy and the smaller ones prefer to bind to the 〈1 1 1〉-crowdion, and vice versa. The present results, together with previous experimental results, suggest that Re might be a relatively suitable alloying element compared to other possible candidates, and Ta seems suitable for adding in W-Re alloy to adjust the concentration of Re and Os. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Many new and exciting physics results have been obtained in the quest for long-pulse operations. The key findings are as follows: (1) access to H-modes in EAST favours the divertor configuration with the ion ∇B drift directed away from the dominant X-point; (2) divertor asymmetry during edge-localized modes (ELMs) also appears to be dependent on the toroidal field direction, with preferential particle flow opposite to the ion ∇B drift; (3) LHCD induces a striated heat flux (SHF), enhancing heat deposition away from the strike point, and the degree of SHF can be modified by supersonic molecule beam injection; (4) the long-pulse H-modes in EAST exhibit a confinement quality between type-I and type-III ELMy H-modes, with H

The results show that the sample cut from the high field side (HF) tile has been intensely eroded due to deuterium bombardment on plasma facing surfaces in the initial phase of discharges and trapped highest amount of deuterium. Lower deuterium retention has been found in the inner divertor sample, which is presumably due to the particular exposure history in the 2010 spring campaign.

With first-principles method, we systemically calculate the binding energies of solute (3p, 4p, 5p and 6p alloying solutes are included) with vacancy, divacancy and solute in bcc Fe. The binding energy of Si with vacancy in the present work is in good consistent with experimental value available. All the solutes considered are able to form stable solute-vacancy, solute-divacancy complexes, and the binding strength of solute-divacancy is about two times larger than that of solute-vacancy. Most solutes could not form stable solute-solute complexes except S, Se, In and Tl. The factors controlling the binding energies are analyzed at last. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84901388140	In situ chemical imaging of lithiated tungsten using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy	Lithium conditioning can significantly improve the plasma confinement of EAST tokamak by reducing the amount of hydrogen and impurities recycled from the wall, but the details of this mechanism and approaches that reduce the concentrations of hydrogen and impurities recycle still remain unclear. In this paper, we studied lithiated tungsten via a cascaded-arc plasma simulator. An in situ laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) diagnostic system has been developed to chemically image the three-dimensional distribution of lithium and impurities on the surface of lithiated tungsten co-deposition layer for the first time. The results indicate that lithium has a strong ability to draw hydrogen and oxygen. The impurity components from the co-deposition processes present more intensity on the surface of co-deposition layer. This work improves the understanding of lithiated tungsten mechanism and is useful for using LIBS as a wall-diagnostic technique for EAST. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84901700004	The experimental consideration for TBM mock-up effect on plasma performance based on MAPES platform in east	EAST can provide better opportunities to contribute development of ITER-relevant plasma physics and engineering because it has ITER-like configuration, and has achieved 10s H-mode plasma, and aims steady-state operation of DD high performance plasma. The impact of Test blanket module (TBM) using RAFM (reduced activation ferritic/martensitic) steels on tokomak plasma is a major concern in ITER operations. In order to assess this effect due to TBM local ripple, an experiment plan of TBM mockup using RAFM steel is being planned on MAPES (Material and Plasma Evaluation System) in EAST. This paper reports experimental consideration on MAPES based on magnetic analysis and ripple calculation at separatrix point. The relevant experiments strategy and plan in EAST are also proposed.

84902149584	Experimental advanced superconducting Tokamak/material and plasma evaluation system material migration experiment	A test assembly of carbon coated molybdenum tiles was exposed to a sequence of well-diagnosed ohmic helium discharges in the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) using the material and plasma evaluation system. The test assembly was configured to approximate, on a reduced scale, the profile of a first-wall panel in ITER. Net erosion and deposition of carbon was determined from measurements of the thickness of a carbon surface layer by ion-beam analysis before and after the plasma exposure. The highest erosion of 800 nm, or about one third of the initial thickness, occurred near the EAST midplane on the side facing the ion-drift direction. Erosion decreased in toroidal and poloidal directions with increasing distance from the plasma. Net deposition was not observed anywhere above the limit of detection. This experiment provides data needed to benchmark codes being used to predict erosion/deposition in ITER. © 2014 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Mock-ups with an interlayer of oxygen-free Cu (OFC) made by vacuum hot pressing have been developed and the bonding strength was found to be over 100 MPa. The behavior of the mock-ups under steady-state high heat flux loads has been studied. No crack or exfoliation occurred on the W surface and W/OFC/CuCrZr interfaces after screening tests with heat fluxes of 2.24-7.73 MW m

84902174347	PIC-EDDY simulation of different impurities deposition in gaps of carbon tiles	A 3D Monte Carlo (MC) code PIC- EDDY, based on EDDY (erosion and deposition dynamic simulation) code, was used to investigate the redeposition of different impurities in the gaps of C tiles. By incorporating the rate coefficients of beryllium (Be) and tungsten (W) into the code, we obtain deposition profiles of hydrocarbon, beryllium and tungsten particles in the toroidal and poloidal gaps, respectively. The redeposition rate of tungsten was found to be higher than those of other impurities in the gaps, except at the bottom, due to its easier local deposition within one gyroradius. Due to the effect of reflection coefficients of hydrocarbon fragments on graphite, fewer hydrocarbons were resided at the entrance while more were deposited on the sides of the gap. At elevated plasma temperatures (such as 30 eV), asymmetric deposition distributions were observed between the toroidal and poloidal gaps due to the dominant ionized particles. Ions were mainly deposited within 1 mm depth inside gaps, and the bottom deposition particles were almost all neutrals.

84902658964	First principles study of helium trapping by solute elements in tungsten	The behavior of helium in metals is particularly important in fusion research due to the He induced degradation of materials. A small amount of impurities introduced by alloying or transmutation reactions will interact with He and lead the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials to change. In this paper, we present the results of first-principles calculations on the interactions of He with impurities in tungsten (W), including the interstitials C, N, O, and substitutional 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals. We find that the trapping radii of interstitial atoms for He are almost twice larger than those of substitutional solutes. A preliminary evaluation of the effective trapping of He is also given when considering the detrapping of He at high temperature. The binding energies between the substitutional impurities and He increase linearly with the relative charge densities at the He occupation site, implying that He atoms easily aggregate at low charge density sites. The present results suggest that Ta might be chosen as a relatively suitable alloying element compared to other possible choices. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84904013187	Study on activated W powders by chemical activation pretreatment and its sintering behavior	In this study, tungsten (W) powders were subjected to chemical activation pretreatment by immersion into an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid and ammonium fluoride, and then were reinforced with an ultrasonic wave at room temperature. A field emission electron microscope was utilized to observe the surface topography of the original W and simply pretreated W. The results showed the surface of the as-pretreated was more rough and had more surface defects than original W. Both as-received and pretreated W powders were sintered under identical conditions. Their sinterability was compared and analyzed in terms of their densification, hardness and microstructure. It was concluded that increased surface area and defects which facilitate atomic mobility during the sintering process were responsible for the improved densification. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84905018056	Molecular dynamics simulations of deposition and damage on tungsten plasma-facing materials by tungsten dust	Classical molecular dynamics has been used to study the interactions between tungsten (W) plasma-facing materials (PFMs) and dust grains. The impact velocity of dust grains is in the range from 324 m/s to 3240 m/s. The main effect of dust grains with low impact velocity is deposition. However, a material surface can be damaged by high velocity dust grains. The cumulative damage of impacting dust grains has also been take into account. When the impact velocity is low, no significant damage is detected but a porous firm forms on the surface. Serious damage can be produced on PFMs if the impact velocity is high.

84906493381	Nondestructive testing of east W/Cu divertor components	Recently, the EAST W/Cu divertor components, including the ITER-like monoblock W/Cu units and flattype W/Cu units, have been developed by Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP) in collaboration with Advanced Technology and Materials Co., Ltd. (AT&M). To detect the bonding quality in these multiple layer geometry W/Cu plasma-facing components (PFCs) at each step of their manufacture, special nondestructive testing techniques have been researched and developed. For monoblock W/Cu PFCs, the bonding at both W-Cu and Cu-C°CrZr interfaces was qualified by spiral ultrasonic testing (UT) with a focus probe, which was inserted into the C°CrZr tube with a flexible driving tube. Artificial defects with defined size have been measured by UT and compared with the results of high heat flux testing (HHFT). The HHFT demonstrated that the monoblock W/Cu mock-up qualified by this UT has withstood 1000 cycles of heat load at 10 MW/m

84906348337	Influence of TiN nanoparticles on the microstructure and properties of W matrix materials prepared by spark plasma sintering	W-(0.5, 1, 2, 4) wt.% TiN composite powders were formed by mechanical alloying for 5 h and sintered by spark plasma at 1800 °C. The effect of TiN nanoparticle content on the microstructure and properties of the composites were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, tensile test, microhardness test, and thermal conductivity test. With the addition of TiN ranging from 0.5 wt.% to 4 wt.%, SEM analysis results showed that TiN was distributed homogeneously and W grains were refined by TiN. The fracturing of pure W was intergranular, whereas cleavage fracture appeared in the W-TiN composites and increased with increased TiN content. The density was found to initially increase and then decrease with increased TiN content. The same trend was observed for the thermal conductivity. Microhardness increased with increased TiN content. The tensile strength reached 180 MPa when the content of TiN was 2 wt.%. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of 2 wt.% exceeded those of other alloys at different TiN weight percentages. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84909633196	Strengthening mechanism and thermal stability of severely deformed ferritic/martensitic steel	The strengthening mechanism of the ultrafine-grained ferritic/martensitic steel (T91) prepared by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) is studied by microhardness measurement, transmission electron microscopy and internal friction. The results show that dislocation strengthening rather than grain boundary strengthening plays a dominant role in the increase in microhardness. Upon annealing at different temperatures, it is found that there is an evident decrease in microhardness between 650 and 700. °C for the ECAPed specimens processed by 1 pass and 4 passes. An internal friction peak is also observed in the vicinity of 670. °C for the ECAPed specimens during the first heating but disappears during the second heating. The TEM observations indicate that there is no evident change in the grain size for the ECAPed specimens before and after the annealing at 700. °C for 1. h. It is concluded that the softening around 670. °C stems mainly from the dislocation annihilation.

84911486046	Synthesis of W-TiC composite powders by wet-chemical process and its sintering behavior by SPS	W-TiC composite powders were prepared by wet-chemical process, and ultra-fine grained W-TiC composites were fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The surface morphologies of W-TiC composite powders and the microstructure of W-TiC composites were studied. The results show that TiC powders are subjected to chemical activation pretreatment to obtain uniform distribution of defects on the surface of TiC powder, thus increasing the hydrophilicity of the TiC surface. The second phase TiC particles are homogeneously and dispersively distribute in the grains and grain boundaries by chemical reduction. The grain size, relative density and the Vicker hardness HV

84913570395	Axial strain localization of CuCrZr tubes during manufacturing of ITER-like mono-block W/Cu components using HIP	Two forms of axial strain localization of CuCrZr tubes, i.e.; cracking and denting, were observed during the manufacturing of ITER-like mono-block W/Cu components for EAST employing hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Microscopic investigations indicate that the occurrence of axial strain localization correlates to the heavily deformed Cu grains and elongated Cr-rich precipitates as well as highly anisotropic microstructures, which impair the circumferential ductility. Annealing the as-received tubes at 600°C alleviates cracking due to partial recrystallization of Cu grains. However, the annealed tubes are still sensitive to wall thinning (caused by non-uniform polishing or tube bending), which results in denting. Denting may cause bonding flaws at CuCrZr/Cu interfaces and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. To some extent, denting seems do not affect the high heat flux performance of components. In this paper, we demonstrate that testing only the axial mechanical properties is not enough for manufacturers who use HIP or hot radial pressing technologies, especially for those anisotropic tubes.

84921030010	Current status of design and manufacture on W/Cu interface of the fist wall material	This paper reviews the current method of solving the W/Cu interface connection and relieving the thermal stress by added adaptation layer. After analyzing the different adaptation layer, the best W/Cu adaptation layer is selected, and then the W/Cu layer structure optimization analysis is conducted. The results show that using W/Cu functionally graded materials as the combination of the adaptation layer has enough strength, and good thermal conductivity are more effective to alleviate thermal stress. In addition, this paper expounds the current method which utilizes the successfully prepared W/Cu functionally gradient materials as W/Cu adaptation layer used in the first wall materials. Finally, this paper has made the summary and prospect about that the functionally gradient materials of W/Cu used as the adaptation layer to solve the first wall material W/Cu interface connection.
