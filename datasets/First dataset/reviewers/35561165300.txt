14644387542	Biocompatibility of a titanium-aluminum nitride film coating on a dental alloy	The purpose of this investigation was to develop a coating technique and to study the characteristics of titanium-aluminum nitride [(Ti,Al)N] films deposited on a base-metal alloy (Wiron88®) substrate. Titanium-aluminum nitride thin films were deposited on the alloy surface using a reactive radiofrequency sputtering method. The electrochemical properties of three specimens with and without coating treatment were evaluated. The biocompatibility of the three specimens was tested using a subcutaneous implantation test. Data were analyzed using the t-test with a significance level of p<0.05. Specimens coated with (Ti,Al)N films exhibited significantly improved corrosion resistance (p<0.05). The results from biocompatibility testing, based on tissue reactions at 2 and 12 weeks, revealed substantially enhanced biocompatibility for (Ti,Al)N-coated samples when compared to uncoated samples. This demonstrates that the (Ti,Al)N film can significantly improve electrochemical and biocompatibility properties of the base metal alloy. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

14644403738	Nanomechanical properties evaluation of chromium nitride films by nanoindentation and nanowear techniques	Nanomechanical and nanotribological properties studies are needed to develop fundamental understanding of surface and interfacial phenomena on the nano scale. In this study, nanoindentation, nanoscratch and nanowear tests were employed to characterize the nanomechanical and nanotribological properties of both reactive r.f. magnetron sputtered and cathodic arc plasma deposited chromium nitride (CrN) thin films. Surface morphologies and roughness of CrN films on the nanoscale were explored. The nanohardness and elastic modulus of CrN films were evaluated using the nanoindentation method. Coefficient of friction of CrN films against a conical diamond tip was also calculated based on the nanoscratch data. Reciprocating nanowear tests on these two CrN films were conducted with 300,400 and 500 μN normal loads. Residual wear depths of the two CrN films were examined by an atomic force microscope (AFM). The residual wear depths of two CrN films after reciprocating nanowear tests ranged from 4 to 7.5 nm under 300 to 500 μN loads, respectively. It was found that the r.f. sputtered CrN film exhibited higher nanohardness and better surface roughness value. The r.f. sputtered CrN film showed more nanowear resistance and lower coefficient of friction than the cathodic arc plasma deposited one. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

14644405628	Microhardness of sputtered ternary Ni-P-W coating with extra-high phosphorous content from improved deposition rate-derived electroplated NiP targets	The ternary Ni-P-W alloy coating was fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering technique with dual targets of Ni-P/Cu and pure W. Electroplating Ni-P process was introduced to obtain the NiP compound target with extra-high phosphorous contents around 21 at.%. The deposition rate achieved as high as 20 μm/h after modification of the processing parameters. The Ni-P-W coating with a high P/Ni ratio of 0.25 was successfully derived by electroplating with a high P content Ni-P/Cu target. After heat treatment, the coating was strengthened by the precipitation of Ni-P compounds and solutioning of W in the crystallized Ni matrix. The Ni-P-W coating exhibited a relatively higher hardness with higher P codeposited after annealing at elevated temperature. The advantage of the composite target was also discussed by comparing with the ternary deposit fabricated by the electroless process. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To evaluate the effect of doping with a third element on the enhancement of thermal stability in Ni-P coatings, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to identify the onset temperature of phase transformation. The crystallization behavior at different stages of phase transition in the DSC plot was further evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructural evolution of the Ni-P based coating in the as-deposited and heat-treated states were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The broad peak in the DSC plot of both Ni-P and Ni-P-Cr deposits is attributed to the grain coarsening of nickel on the basis of XRD and TEM analyses.

14644435792	Mechanical properties of sputtered nickel-phosphorus-based hard coatings under thermal annealing	Ternary Ni-P-W and Ni-P-Cr alloy molding coatings were fabricated by radiofrequency (RF) magnetron sputtering onto steel substrate, AISI 420 tool steel. Cycling annealing up to 500 °C was performed on various Ni-P-based coatings to simulate the cycling injection or press-molding process in practical use. The mechanical properties, including hardness and Young's modulus of the alloy coatings, were evaluated by continuous stiffness measurement. It was observed that the ternary Ni-P-Cr and Ni-P-W coatings exhibited a maximum hardness up to 14 and 15.5 GPa under 8 and 12 h of annealing test at 500 °C, respectively. With long-term annealing up to 20 h at elevated temperature, the Ni-P-based coatings retained a steady hardness of 12 GPa. The influence of the third element introduction on the mechanical properties of the Ni-P-based coating was probed and discussed. The incorporation of W and Cr into the NiP-based coating exhibited superior mechanical behavior under elevated temperature environments as compared to Ni-P binary coating. In addition, the correlation between indentation penetration depth and mechanical behavior was also evaluated. Reliable hardness values of the coatings were extracted from the indentation range of 200-400 nm, while the gradual descent in hardness with increasing indentation depth was influenced by the substrate effect. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the influence of the doping element in Ni-P deposit, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis was employed to characterize the temperature of phase transformation. The phase transition during thermal evolution under heat-treatment was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Crystallization behavior in binary and ternary Ni-P-based coatings was quite distinct due to the addition of Cr and W. Microhardness tests indicated that the sputtered Ni-P-Cr and Ni-P-W coatings exhibited superior hardness and excellent thermal stability than the Ni-P coating. In addition, chromium exhibited compatible thermal characteristics with the tungsten for the ternary Ni-P-based system. The strengthening mechanism in the sputtered Ni-P-Cr and Ni-P-W deposits is also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0029657330	Corrosion characteristics of coloured films on stainless steel formed by chemical, INCO and a.c. processes	The corrosion behaviour of coloured films on stainless steel formed by chemical, INCO and a.c. processes were investigated in HCI solution. Anodic polarization and a.c. impedance measurements were employed to characterize the pitting corrosion of various coloured films. Experimental results showed that the pitting resistance of coloured films increase in the order of chemical, a.c. and INCO process. The cathodic hardening treatment in either the INCO or the a.c. process acted to restrict the diffusion of reactive species in the coloured film and to improve markedly the corrosion resistance of coloured stainless steel. The a.c. impedance technique is demonstrated to be a very useful tool for the in-situ measurements of localized corrosion of coloured films and for the evaluation of the characteristic parameters in the corrosion system.

The flexural strength ranged from 105.8 MPa to 129.5 MPa. Ceramic and alumina addition provided significant strength as tested by ANOVA and multiple range tests (P < 0.05). The range for the cemented bridge margins was from 48.9 μm to 80.4 μm. The tested ceramics had no statistically significant differences in margin openings for the same sites (P < 0.05). However, the openings on the mesial side of the premolar abutment and the distal end of the molar abutment of the fixed partial denture did have statistically significant differences (P < 0.01). Appropriate addition of alumina led to an increase in bending strength. The alumina stabilizes and strengthens the glass-ceramic material by incorporation into the silicone network. © 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd.

0031223942	The use of X-ray line profile analysis in the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation of ball milled, as-sintered and thermally aged zirconia powders	The martensitic tetragonal to monoclinic (t → m) transformation in zirconia plays an important role in determining the mechanical properties and low temperature degradation of this ceramic. The analysis of X-ray data using the Warren-Averbach procedure can supply reliable information about crystallite size and microstrain under various conditions. The X-ray line profile analysis results can shed light on the martensitic transformation and the microstructural evolution of the t and m phases. The presence of m plates causing the formation of partially transformed t crystals reduces the mean size of the t crystals. The ball milling process also affects the mean size of the produced monoclinic crystals. The microstrain of the t and m phases can also be influenced by the ball milling and also by matrix constraints. Zirconia powders doped with low contents of CeO

0031237109	Adhesion strength and microstructural evaluation in electroless Ni-P metallized A1N substrate	The adhesion strength of the electroless Ni (EN)-plated AlN substrates is studied through investigation of the microstructural morphologies at the AlN-EN interfaces. Etching sites around the Al-Y-O compounds on the etched AlN substrate provide the anchor acceptors for interlocking the EN film to achieve a high adhesion strength. Separation of the EN film from the AlN substrate under the action of force leaves the fracture cracks propagating along the AIN/EN interface, cutting through the anchors and making the fragmental EN films around the etching sites resided on the AIN fracture surface. However, the polished AIN substrate lacks the interlocking sites and fails to obstruct the cracks propagating along the AlN/EN interface, and thus results in a poor adhesion strength. An appropriate adhesion strength of 13.7 MPa with a small standard deviation (±2.3 MPa) can be obtained for the previously etched and 10 μm thick EN-plated AlN substrate. © 1997 IEEE.

0031274155	The use of X-ray line profile analysis to investigate crystallite size and microstrain for zirconia powders	X-ray line profile analysis is a powerful and convenient method to probe the microstructural characteristics of ceramics. Zirconia based ceramics possess a martensitic tetragonal to monoclinic transformation that is induced by size and strain factors. The selection of a suitable and reliable analysis method is critical to accurately derive the correct material property values. The procedures involved in an X-ray line profile broadening analysis are described in this study, which includes two simplified single peak methods. In all three different line profile analysis are employed to study the validity of derived data at various conditions for zirconia ceramics. The Warren Averbach approach gives a reliable and reasonable crystallite size and microstrain. Crystallite sizes evaluated from different formulae or methods are compared with those measured by the Brunauer Emmett Teller method and transmission electron microscopy observation. The crystallite size distributions and particle size are also probed. It is found that the evaluated crystallite size distribution is similar to the measured particle size distribution. Since it is impossible to obtain the crystallite size distribution from the single peak method, the ratios of the volume-weighted mean crystallite size, 〈D〉

0032090460	Bonding mechanism of electroless Ni-P film with AlN substrate and Cu foil	Electroless Ni (EN) plating method is employed to metallize Y2O3-doped AlN ceramic substrates with different surface morphologies, including the as-received, polished, and etched AlN. The EN-plated AlN substrate is bonded with the Cu foil to form a sandwich-like AlN-EN/Cu/EN-AlN assembly by hot pressing in vacuum with a pressure of 6.5 MPa for 30 min. The bonding strength of the joint is determined by the adhesive abilities of EN/AlN and EN/Cu interfaces. Bonding between the Cu foil and the EN film is achieved by the interdiffusion of Cu and Ni atoms to form a solid solution interlayer, while the EN film is adhered on the AlN substrate mainly by the mechanical interlocking through the rough interface, etched holes, and open pores. At the bonding temperatures lower than 400°C, no reaction occurs between the Cu foil and the EN film. Increasing bonding temperature enhances the interdiffusion of Cu and Ni to form a strong bonded solid solution interlayer. However, the depletion of the element Ni in EN film results in the formation and enlargement of the pores at EN/AlN interface, which makes a poor adhesion between EN film and AlN substrate. An optimum bonding temperature is observed around 600 and 700°C for various surface conditions of AlN substrates. Theoretical calculations of the residual thermal stresses in AlN, EN, and Cu layers with respect to the bonding temperatures are related to the variation of the bonding strengths. The relations of the adhesion strengths, interfacial morphologies, elemental distribution, and calculated residual stresses is proposed. © 1998 IEEE.

The bilayer periods of CrN/AlN were controlled from 4 nm to 20 nm by the use of shutters, which were adjusted by a programmable logic control (PLC). To evaluate the thermal stability, the films were annealed at 500 °C, 600°C, 700°C, 800°C, and 850°C, for 1 h in both vacuum and air environments. The phase transformation during thermal evolution was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microstructure of CrN/AlN multilayer coatings as-deposited and after annealing was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The hardness of as-deposited CrN/AlN coating with a period of 4 nm was 28.2 GPa, which was 60% higher than that predicted by the rule of mixtures. The hardness of CrN/AlN multilayer coatings annealed at 850°C in vacuum remained similar to the as-deposited state, and the nano-layered structure still persisted. The thermal stability of CrN/AlN coatings was better than that of CrN coating. The hardness degradation ratio of CrN/AlN coating with modulation period of 4 nm was only 8.1% at 700°C, which was superior to that of a simple CrN coating. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights resrved.

The mixture powders were then calcined at 870°C for 10 h to synthesize LiCux Mn2-x O4 -coated LiMn2 O4 composite. The phase transformation of both base LiMn2 O4 and LiCux Mn2-x O4 -coated LiMn2 O4 during charging at 0.1, 0.5, and 1 C rate from 3 to 4.5 V was confirmed by the in situ synchrotron X-ray diffractometer. The plateau potential difference between the base LiMn2 O4 and LiCux Mn2-x O4 -coated LiMn2 O4 composite was 50 mV. The decrease of the plateau can be related to the fact that the kinetics of the LiCux Mn2-x O4 -coated LiMn2 O4 composite cathode material was faster than that of the uncoated material. The cyclic voltammograms of two cells using the LiCux Mn2-x O4 -coated LiMn2 O4 composite and the base composite as the working electrodes and lithium metal as the counter electrode was applied to measure the oxidation and reduction reaction of the 2016 coin cell during charge and discharge with a rate of 0.1 mVs from 3 to 4.5 V.

The bilayer period of these coatings was controlled at 8 nm and 30 nm. The cross-sectional morphology of nanoscaled multilayer coatings was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The wear resistance of CrN/WN multilayer coatings and CrN monolayer coating was investigated using a pin-on-disc tribometer. The surface roughness (Ra) of the coatings was evaluated by atomic force microscopy, and that of CrN and WN monolayer coating was 6.7 and 5.9 nm, respectively. The employment of multilayer configuration in CrN/WN coating with bilayer period of 8 nm and 30 nm effectively reduced the surface roughness down to 1.9 and 2.2 nm, respectively. The friction coefficient of CrN monolayer coating and CrN/WN multilayer film with a bilayer period of 30 nm was 0.63 and 0.31, respectively. Owing to the high hardness/elastic modulus ratio, as well as the dense structure and the smooth surface roughness, the CrN/WN multilayer coatings exhibited better wear resistance in the consideration of friction coefficient and the worn surface morphology. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33750816253	Mo-Ru coatings on tungsten carbide by direct current magnetron sputtering	To extend lifetime and enhance the properties of the molding dies for glass molding, functional protective coatings have been applied on the core material with cost effectiveness during mass production. In this study, the Mo-Ru hard and protective coatings with the Ni interlayer were deposited on tungsten carbide substrate by direct current (DC) sputtering technique to improve the characteristics of molding die material. Intensive investigations on composition control through sputtering parameters were conducted. The surface hardness of the Mo-Ru films was measured by nanoindentation testing. In practice, the molding dies need to endure a thermal cycle of the temperature range from room temperature to around 600 °C. Under heat treatment at 600 °C for 4 h, the grain size was evaluated by X-ray diffractometry. It was demonstrated that the surface roughness, Ra, of Mo-Ru protective thin films was in the nanoscale through atomic force microscopy even under high temperature treatment. In addition, nanohardness test indicated that the annealed Mo-Ru films exhibited a high hardness over 11 GPa, which was compatible with those of the as-deposited films, and no significant degradation was revealed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The modulation periods of the multilayer coatings was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To evaluate the oxidation behavior of CrN/AlN multilayer coatings, the CrN and CrN/AlN coatings were annealed at elevated temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 900 °C in air for 1 h. For the multilayer CrN/AlN with the modulation period of 4 nm, no oxide peak was revealed in the XRD spectra, yet amorphous oxide layer was visible at 900 °C. It exhibited better anti-oxidation behavior than either the monolayered CrN or multilayered CrN/AlN coating with modulation period of 20 nm. Furthermore, the microstructure of the CrN/AlN coatings exhibited a dense columnar structure and the surface roughness of the multilayer coating retained below 5 nm, which was much smoother than that of CrN coating at 800 °C. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the LiNiO2 or LiCoO2 systems, there was no new H2 phase formed during the whole charge-discharge process. With Li-deintercalated from LiNi0.6 Co0.25 Mn0.15 O2, a single-phase reaction prevailed. It was reveled that both the a and c axes varied with different Li contents in this material system. Besides, the volumetric change after the first charge was only 4%; which was much smaller compared with those of LiNiO2, LiCoO2, and LiMnO2 electrode materials.

The Ti-Al-Cr-Si-V multi-component target introduced in this study was fabricated by conventional metallurgical method with atomic ratio of each selected element at 1:1:1:1:1. Different coatings were fabricated under various working pressure by adjusting nitrogen flux from 0 to 30 sccm during sputtering. Compositions of the target and the sputtered films were measured by FE-EPMA, and both of them were near equi-molar. According to XRD patterns, amorphous structures were revealed for the metallic and nitride 1 (N = 46.2 at.%) films. The face centered cubic phases were exhibited by nitride 2 and nitride 3 with nitrogen contents around 58 at.%. Two different surface morphologies were investigated by the AFM, and they were consistent with the nanostructure observed in the XRD pattern. In addition, microhardness of the nitride coatings was measured by nanoindentation, and hardness higher than 30 GPa was exhibited in both nitride 2 and nitride 3.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) were applied to observe morphology of the surface film and elemental distribution, respectively, prior to and after immersion in 0.9% NaCl solution. The concentration of dissolved Ni from Ni-Ti-Al thin films in the electrolyte, measured with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES), was significantly lower after immersion for 7 days, as compared to Ni-Ti thin film. This demonstrated that a better corrosion resistance and lower corrosion current density were revealed for Ni-Ti-Al thin films than that for Ni-Ti thin film. The improved corrosion performance of Ni-Ti-Al thin films would be potentially beneficial for related biological applications. This was attributed to the introduction of aluminum after exposure to an aqueous environment. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through X-ray phase identification, the coatings exhibited an amorphous/nanocrystalline feature in the as-deposited state, while the W and Ni crystallites and NiP precipitates were found for the heat treated Ni-P-Al-W coatings. The transforming of coating surface from smooth to wavy contour represented the phase evolution phenomenon by the crystallization and precipitation in the Ni-P-Al-W coating. The introduction of the alloying components of Al and W into Ni-P to form the multicomponent coatings gave rise to the increase in thermal stability and surface hardness of the Ni-P-based coatings. A peak hardness of 15.5 GPa was evaluated for the Ni-P-Al-W coating under 500 °C annealing. The nanocrystallites of Ni and W and the precipitation of NiP compounds were the strengthening mechanisms for the Ni-P-Al-W coatings.

33644980410	Global and local residual stress in silicon carbide films produced by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition	Residual stress in films is normally created in the process and results in the unwanted deformation or fail of structures. It could be characterized by measuring the changes in the radius of curvature of an overall stressed film on a substrate, i.e. global residual stress or by the curvature change of locally micromachined suspended cantilever beams, i.e. local residual stress. In this study, global and local residual stress behavior of PECVD silicon carbide films is investigated by deposition parameters and post rapid thermal annealing to obtain low stress and flat free-standing microstructure. In the as-deposited state, a low global compressive film with a stress level of -160 MPa has been obtained at medium pressure of 147 Pa and at low substrate temperature of 250 °C. Then the stress can be further reduced to less than 100 MPa with low local gradient stress by a post annealing at 420 °C. The final stress could be effectively controlled by a discrete annealing method, approaching a steady state only after several minutes. It is comparable with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. As the annealing temperature increases, a stress transition from the compressive region to the tensile one takes place. The stress relaxation is attributed to the dissociation of Si-H and C-H bonds, and incorporation of hydrogen molecules in the film for the formation of tensile Si-C bonds with large electronegativity difference or the outdiffusion of hydrogen molecules to increase the bond length between atoms for a more tensile stress. Self-deformed micromachined cantilevers are fabricated to exhibit the local gradient stress from the curvature of beams. The gradient stress is negative for the cantilevers with negative or downward curvature in the as-deposited state and then transforms to positive for the cantilevers with positive or upward curvature after annealing. The gradient stress varied from negative to positive is attributed to the difference of stress variation between the free surface and the interface of the film and substrate. A low stress film of less than 100 MPa with a near-zero gradient component could be adjusted by as-deposited process parameters and post annealing for the fabrication of the flat suspended MEMS structure. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, microstructure, adhesion strength, fracture surface and contact resistance of the solder joints are also evaluated. The results of the wetting balance show that the addition of 1 wt% Cu has little effect on the contact angle of the eutectic SnBi solder alloy with various metallization layers. The adhesion strength of solder joints degrades abruptly after 2000 thermal cycles. In addition, thermal cycling would result in cracking in the solder joints, which is due to the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients.

Bright-argentine and light-brown surfaces were observed for AV and AO, respectively. The average O composition of samples AV and AO was 5.3 and 14.6 at%, respectively. Comparing with sample AV, evidently enhanced anisotropy field, resistivity and ferromagnetic resonance frequency over 3 GHz were achieved in AO.

52449108370	Interfacial reaction and failure mechanism for SnAgCu solder bump with Ni(V)/Cu under bump metallization during aging	In flip chip technology, under bump metallization (UBM) composing multi metallic thin-films is usually used to improve the bonding between solder and pad on chip. The Cr/Cu/Au UBM is commonly used to joint with SnPb solder. [1] However, the Sn-Cu intermetallic compounds (IMC) spalled rapidly from interface, due to the quick reaction between Cu and Sn. Therefore the Ni-based UBM, such as Ti/Cu/Ni and Al/Ni(V)/Cu, is advanced to replace Cr/Cu/Au UBM. The primary advantage of Ni-based UBM is slower reaction rate with Sn-Pb solder and Pb-free solder than Cu-based UBM, so the spalling of IMC would be eliminated. Nevertheless, sputtering a pure Ni target is more difficult because of magnetic interference. In order to overcome the magnetic interference, the Delco process which adds 7 at.% V into Ni target is applied. Only a few literatures were focused on the interface reaction between Al/Ni(V)/Cu UBM and solder. [2-7] Li et al. [3] indicated that (Cu,Ni)

53849098412	Employment of oriental philosophy in the establishment of framework for probing nanoscale science and technology	The current nanotechnology is not only the scale down of the feature size for the things of interest, but also envisages it as a functional set of conceptual and spiritual essence. This study is aimed to demonstrate the striking identify between the utilization of nano-world and the concept of oriental philosophy. The theory of Yin and Yang in the book Yi-Jing(I-Ching) describe system of cosmology and philosophy on the ideas of dynamic balance of opposite, and the evolution of events as a process. Being and non-being are two special aspects of Taoism by Lao-tzu and Chuang-tzu. The spirit of Zen in Buddhism and the Confucianism taught by Confucius all reflect the internal constancy and wisdom to identify order and the inevitability of change. It will be revealed that the development of nano-science and technology is indeed originated from Yi-Jing, Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. Take the diffusion process as an example, and the "vacancy" and the "matrix atom" in material science and engineering can be considered as "non-being" and "being" in Taoism. Especially, the phase transformation encountered in materials science is just like chance events in Yi-Jing.

The high-frequency ferromagnetic properties of the films were dramatically enhanced by annealing at 350(C for 1 hour. In comparison with the as-deposited film, the resonance frequency increased from 1.32 to over 3 GHz, while relative permeability still maintained at a high value of 10O. Magnetic force microscope (MFM) revealed strip domains in the FeNdBO films. The domain width of (100 nm for the annealed film was smaller than that for the as-deposited film, implying the enhancement of anisotropy field due to annealing. Promising high-frequency ferromagnetic properties of FeNdBO films can be attributed to the high values of Ms (15.7 kG), 11k (over 1000 Qe), and ( (more than 10 (m).

It was noted that V in the Ni(V) layer did not react with solders and intermetallic compounds (IMC) during reflow and aging process, yet a Sn-rich phase, as the so-called "Sn-patch", would form in the Ni(V) layer [3]. The possible reason of Sn-patch formation may be the fast Sn diffusion from the solder matrix to the Ni(V) layer. However, the formation mechanism of Sn-patch and the detailed composition variation and structure evolution in Sn-patch were not fully discussed yet. In this study, Sn-patch would be analyzed by a field emission electron probe X-ray microanalyzer (FE-EPMA) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to elucidate the composition redistribution and the microstructure evolution, respectively. There existed concentration redistribution of the constituent element in Sn-patch, and its microstructure also varied with the aging time.

0034474675	Fabrication of low-stress plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition silicon carbide films	Low stress silicon carbide films with good uniformity in thickness and composition were deposited by varying the deposition parameters in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) unit. The effects of deposition parameters on structure, chemical state and stress distribution of these films in the as-deposited state were investigated. The as-deposited films were typically amorphous and under compressive stress. A low compressive film with a stress level of -160 MPa was obtained at low substrate temperature (250°C) under an appropriate deposition pressure of 1100 mTorr. The chemical state and stress distribution were studied as a function of annealing temperatures in the range from 400°C to 650°C. The hydrogenated bonds decreased with the increase in annealing temperatures around 500-600°C, causing the outdiffusion of hydrogen. Owing to the breakage of the hydrogenated bonds, the recombination of unsaturated bonds on silicon and carbon atoms was promoted, enhancing the bond density of the Si-C stretching mode. Meanwhile, the stress could be further reduced to achieve a stress-free film (0.7 MPa) by post deposition annealing and shifting from the compressive region to the tensile region. The stress relaxation was ascribed to the dissociation of the hydrogenated bonds and the incorporation of hydrogen. As a result, Si-C bonds were created, leading to the formation of tensile stress. ©2000 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

Mechanical properties and tribological behavior of the duplex and single coating assemblies, including CrN, as-deposited EN and heat-treated EN on mild steel were examined. A significant increase of the surface hardness of the CrN on mild steel (CrN/MS) assembly was achieved by the addition of the EN interlayer. The strengthening of the CrN/MS coating system by the modification of the interlayer was evidenced through the indentation behavior analysis. It was also observed that the EN interlayer acted as a suitable underlying material beneath chromium nitride film to provide the required load-supporting ability for the CrN/MS coating composite during the dry pin-on-disc sliding process.

The thermal stability of electroless Ni-W-P deposits, analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), could be enhanced by the co-deposition of tungsten as compared to binary electroless Ni-P films. The phase and composition of Ni-W-P and Ni-P were evaluated by X-ray diffraction technique and electron probe microanalysis, respectively. The co-deposition of tungsten enabled the deposits to exhibit an amorphous structure with lower phosphorus content. Adhesion strength of the deposits on the substrates were assessed by a scratch test. The introduction of the tungsten in the Ni-P coating effectively reduced the linear crack length and delayed the cracking formation.

Material as well as package structure are the critical issues with respect to these problems. The objective of this research is to investigate how shape memory alloy (SMA) applied in the under bump metallization (UBM) can affect solder joint reliability under thermal mechanical stress. Joint strength tests revealed the better strength of solder joints with SMA UBM after accelerated thermal cycling test. Finite element modeling as well as multilayer stress calculations revealed less strain accumulated in the solder and more stress concentrated in Si in the solder joint with SMA UBM. A mechanism by which the SMA accommodates most of the stress and strain caused by the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients was proposed to explain the reinforcement of the solder joint by the SMA UBM. © 2009 TMS.

However, a Sn-rich phase ("Sn-patch" herein) can form in the Ni(V) layer after reflow and aging. In lead-free solder, Sn-patches form and grow more quickly than in Sn-Pb solder. Thus, the effect of Sn-patches on solder joint reliability becomes critical. In this study, Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder was reflowed with Ti/Ni(V)/Cu UBM at 250°C for 60 s, and then aged at 150°C for various durations. A high-speed impact test was introduced to evaluate solder joint reliability. After impact testing, it was found that, the larger the Sn-patch, the greater the propensity of the solder joint to suffer brittle fracture.

In addition, a Cr-Zr-N film without Si addition was fabricated as a reference. The influence of Zr on the constitution, microstructure, mechanical, tribological and electrochemical properties of Cr-Zr-Si-N films was investigated. The microstructure of thin films was determined by a glancing angle X-ray diffractometer (GA-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. A nanoindenter, a Vickers micro hardness tester and pin-on-disk wear tests were adopted to evaluate the hardness, toughness and tribological properties of thin films, respectively. The electrochemical properties of thin films were also evaluated in 3.5. wt.% NaCl aqueous solution. In case of the Cr-Zr-Si-N films, the Si content was fixed around 6-8. at.% and various Zr contents ranging from 0.5 to 13.6. at.% were achieved by changing the Zr target power density. In comparison to the Cr-Zr-N reference film, the addition of ~. 7.0. at.% Si in Cr-Zr-Si-N films resulted in a refined columnar structure and enhanced mechanical and anti-corrosion properties. A lattice constant expansion of these films was observed with increasing Zr content. A nanostructured thin film with around 5-10. nm grain size was obtained in case of a Cr-13.6. at.% Zr-6.8. at.% Si-N film.

For advanced industrial applications, it is essential to promote the crystallization temperature of Ni-P deposits. In this study, Cu is introduced in Ni-P to improve its thermal stability. An alternative coating technique by r.f. magnetron sputtering is applied to deposit Ni-Cu-P coatings to solve the problem of composition control in the conventional chemical solution method. The Ni-Cu-P coatings were deposited by r.f. magnetron sputtering on 420 tool steel substrates with Cu + Ni-P compound targets. A novel design of compound targets with Cu and Ni-P by consideration of the surface ratio of constituents exhibits a controllable composition in the deposited film. The compositions of the Ni-Cu-P coating can be modified by the original Ni-P deposits of the compound target along with the Cu area ratio in the compound target.

In conventional thought, the metal interlayer gives rise to a high eddy current loss and therefore a deteriorated HFFMP. However, it is found that HFFMPs depend on the thickness of Cr interlayer. The HFFPMs are improved by Cr-interlayer with a thickness less than 12 nm (sample C1). Comparing with the Cr-interlayer-free FeCoHf single layered film (sample C0), the magnetic anisotropy field of C1 dramatically increases from 185 Oe for C0 to 558 Oe for C1. As a consequence, a high ferromagnetic resonance frequency over than 3 GHz is achieved for sample C1.

80053644257	Improved strength of boron-doped Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu solder joints under aging conditions	The mechanical properties of new lead-free Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys containing 0.05-0.1 wt.% boron were investigated under a range of isothermal aging and reflow conditions. The boron-doped solder joints showed higher ball pull strength than the baseline Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu solder joint under all isothermal aging and reflow conditions examined. In particular, the high-speed ball pull strength of the 0.05 wt.% B-doped solder joint was approximately 2.5 times greater than that of the baseline Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu solder joint aged at 150 °C for 200 h, which is attributed mainly to the reduced rate of grain growth in the intermetallic compound (IMC) layers of B-doped solder joints under aging conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The interfacial reaction under liquid reactions of Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) joints with Ni-Zn films will be evaluated. Various kinds of Ni-Zn films were fabricated by sputtering. The surface roughness and residual stress of the Ni-Zn film was evaluated using atomic force microscope (AFM) and the curvature technique. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD) was used to further identify the structure and phases in the films. Detailed morphology of the interfacial reaction in SAC305/Ni-xZn joints was performed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with low angle backscattered electrons detector (LABE). Different structure growth in sputtered deposition might lead to distinct IMC formation. The microstructure evolution and phase formation in the SAC305/Ni-7Zn and SAC305/Ni-20Zn joints varied with reflow time. This study demonstrated that the binary Ni-Zn film might be a potential alternative for under-bump metallization application.

The structures and bilayer period of the multilayer coatings were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer. The microstructures of thin films were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Nanoindentation, scratch tests, Daimler-Benz Rockwell-C (HRC-DB) adhesion tests, microhardness and pin-on-disk wear tests were used to evaluate the hardness, adhesion, indentation toughness and tribological properties of thin films, respectively. It was found that the hardness and tribological properties were strongly influenced by the bilayer period of the CrN/ZrN multilayer coatings.

The thickness ratio of CrSiN to TiAlN layers was fixed at 1:1. The bilayer periods of the coatings were controlled to be from 6 to 40. nm. Furthermore, two CrSiN/TiAlN multilayer coatings with the same bilayer period (20. nm) but different CrSiN/TiAlN thickness ratios (2:8 and 8:2) were also deposited to explore the influence of thickness ratio on the mechanical properties of the multilayer coatings. The crystalline structures of the coatings were determined by a glancing angle X-ray diffractometer. The microstructures of thin films were examined by a scanning electron microscopy and a transmission electron microscopy, respectively. A nanoindenter, a micro Vickers hardness tester, and a pin-on-disk wear tester were used to evaluate the hardness, the toughness and the tribological properties of the thin films, respectively. The maximum hardness of the multilayers was obtained when the bilayer period was at 10. nm for the coating with the same thickness ratio of CrSiN to TiAlN layers (1:1). Meanwhile, the thickness ratio of CrSiN to TiAlN layer had great influence on the hardness and the toughness properties of the multilayer coatings. The hardness and the toughness of the CrSiN/TiAlN multilayer coatings increased as the individual TiAlN layer thickness increased. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84855469158	Application of nanocrystalline FeHfN soft magnetic films to power inductors	In the communications industry, miniaturization is a requirement for inductor devices. To miniaturize power inductors, high inductance is necessary. To this end, high-permeability FeHfN magnetic films are used to enhance the inductance of power inductors. These nanocrystalline FeHfN soft magnetic films, each roughly 700 nm thick, were deposited onto Si substrates using nitrogen reactive sputtering. In this study, planar sandwiched power inductors containing FeHfN films have a higher inductance than air-core power inductors. Inductance (L) of high-permeability FeHfN films is enhanced significantly by roughly 13% compared with that of air-core inductors at 5 MHz. Integrating power inductors with FeHfN films may increase extra parasitic capacitance. Moreover, the increased eddy current loss is created by the low resistivity of FeHfN films. Therefore, the quality factor (Q) of sandwiched power inductors decreases at 5 MHz. Conversely, saturation current (I

84862815280	Suppressing Sn-patch growth in Ti/Ni(V)/Cu under bump metallization with Sn-Ag-Cu solder after reflow and aging	Sputtered Ti/Ni(V)/Cu under bump metallization (UBM) is widely used in flip chip technology because the metals are nonmagnetic and the consumption of the Ni(V) layer is low. It is noted that V does not react with solders and intermetallic compounds (IMC) during reflow and aging; however, a Sn-patch forms in the Ni(V) layer, and the Sn-patch growth may cause the IMCs to detach from the interface of solder joints. In this study, Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu solder was reflowed on Ti/Ni(V)/Cu UBM with different Cu thicknesses at 250°C for 60 s, and then aged at 150°C for various periods of time. It was revealed that the Sn-patch growth could be controlled by increasing the Cu thickness in the Ti/Ni(V)/Cu UBM. A feasible approach to suppress Sn-patch formation after reflow and aging is discussed. © 2012 TMS.

The composition of both the alloy deposited and the sputtered targets were evaluated by electron probe microanalysis. The homogeneity of Ni-P targets fabricated by electroless nickel plating on copper plates was revealed from cross-sectional line profile analysis. Transitions in microstructure, in terms of the tungsten content in the as-deposited alloy deposit, were discussed using X-ray diffraction analysis. Results of microhardness tests showed that the surface hardness could be engineered by controlling the composition and microstructure in the Ni-P-W coating. A relatively high microhardness of approximately 1900 HK was observed for the ternary coating with high tungsten contents of 65 wt.%.

Because of the high energy induced by repeated fracturing and welding, the grinding media played an important role during the MA process. A ceramic container was used to provide stronger impact force, which could induce phase transformation better than a Teflon container. In addition, it was found that 1-cm balls could fracture Bi particles and promote their dissolution into the Sn matrix. On the contrary, the milling process tended to achieve homogeneous mixing when using 3-mm balls. The MA powders, after milling with 3-mm balls, showed a small endothermic peak from the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile at around 138°C, which was the eutectic temperature of Sn-Bi. The melting points of the MA powders in the ceramic container were measured to be 221°C and 203°C, respectively, for Sn-3.5Ag and Sn-3.5Ag-4Bi from the DSC curves.

The ingots were cracked and torn apart on hot rolling. Blue flames erupted from the cracks and became red. A white powder was observed adjacent to the cracks in ingots. The white powder was identified as magnesia. Concentrations of Mg and Ca were high in the centre of the ingot, implying the segregation of impurities. Quantitative elemental analysis and microstructural investigation revealed Mg, Si, Ca and S containing impurities and Cr, Mo and Si carbides were segregated within grain boundaries. The segregation was the main cause of ingot cracking. The 1600°C static cup test for carbon containing MgO-C refractories exhibited the reduction reaction, which raised the Mg concentration up to 0.017 wt% in Fe-Mn-Al alloy steel, whereas the pure MgO refractory cup test showed inertness to Fe-Mn-Al alloy.

During solidification step of reflow process, the solder joints were annealed under various heating time and temperature. A high speed shear tester was used to evaluate the impact reliability of these solder joints. Noteworthily, the annealing at higher temperature (210 C) for a short time (100 s) can enhance the average impact toughness of SAC305/Cu solder joints up to 30%. The improvement of impact toughness was attributed to the evolution of microstructure in the solder alloys. In the annealed solder, the phase precipitation within the solder varied from a dot type toward a network type.

84901258355	Antimicrobial properties of Zr-Cu-Al-Ag thin film metallic glass	Metallic glass as a prominent class of structure and multifunctional materials exhibits several unique properties in mechanical, electrochemical, and thermal properties. This study aimed to realize the advantage of biomedical application and to promote the attainable size of metallic glasses by the physical vapor deposition. The Zr-Cu-Al-Ag thin film metallic glass (TFMG) was deposited on silicon wafer and SUS304 stainless steel substrates by magnetron sputtering with single target. For X-ray diffraction analysis, all TFMGs revealed typical broad peaks around the incident angle of 30 to 50°, suggesting that coatings possess amorphous structure. In addition, diffuse halo ring patterns of transmission electron microscopy indicated a fine amorphorization for TFMG via sputtering process. The variation of surface roughness showed that TFMG derived from higher power of metallic targets revealed rougher morphology. Besides, the roughness of SUS304 stainless steel substrate significantly reduced from 7 nm to about 1 nm after TFMGs were deposited. The microbes of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used and cultivated on the TFMG coatings with medium to investigate the antimicrobial properties. In the incubation experiment, the growth of each microbe was recorded by a digital photography system and the growth area was calculated by image processing software. The growth area of the microbes on the TFMG was mostly smaller than that on SUS304 stainless steel ones within incubation time of 72 h, indicating that the TFMGs reveal better antimicrobial capability. Moreover, the coatings exhibit a particularly long-term antimicrobial effect for P. aeruginosa. In summary, the Zr-Cu-Al-Ag prepared by sputtering with a single target device presented superior glass forming ability, and coatings with copper and silver constituents revealed significantly antimicrobial properties. Besides, the surface roughness is another factor to affect the biological activities, suggesting that microbes are difficult to attach and move on an ultra-smooth surface. It is demonstrated in this study that the TFMGs extend attainable size of the metallic glass and show a potential application in medical related field. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

All the coatings exhibit similar structural and thermal properties, yet the hardness increases with processing temperature. It is demonstrated that amorphous matrix and cluster structure are slightly affected by the processing temperatures due to high cooling rate during deposition and superior glass-forming ability. Besides, atoms and clusters can acquire extra energy via heating substrate to stabilize each cluster, and the amount of free volume is reduced. Thus, the hardness increases with substrate temperature owing to the resistance to the shear band propagation. In summary, this study integrates the correlations among microstructure, thermal and mechanical properties, providing a convenient approach to tune TFMG coating performance. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that the B content had strong influences on the structures and mechanical properties of Cr-Ti-B-N coatings. When the boron content reached 17 at.%, the microstructure changed from the nanocolumnar structure to a nanocomposite structure with nanograins around 4 nm in diameter embedded in the amorphous matrix. As compared with Cr-B-N coating, the solution hardening effect was found to result from the addition of Ti element.

During the solidification step of the reflow process, solder joints were annealed at 210°C for 50s and 100s, respectively. Network-type precipitations formed within the SAC/Cu joint, while dot-type precipitations distributed within the SAC/Ni joint. With the increase of annealing time, these precipitations grew larger; the interfacial intermetallic compounds (IMCs) became slightly thicker, and the hardness of solder alloys gradually decreased. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis indicates that the β-Sn grain structure depended on the distribution of precipitations. A high speed shear tester was used to evaluate the impact toughness of solder joints. Noteworthily, the short-time annealing can improve the impact reliability of solder joints.

84904179798	Improving the shear strength of Sn-Ag-Cu-Ni/Cu-Zn solder joints via modifying the microstructure and phase stability of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds	This study focuses on the correlation between high-speed impact tests and the interfacial reaction in Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-0.1Ni/Cu (wt%) and Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-0.1Ni/Cu-15Zn solder joints. Adding Ni into the Sn-Ag-Cu solder alters the interfacial morphology from scallop type to layer type and exhibits high shear strength after reflow in both solder joints. However, the shear strength of Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-0.1Ni/Cu solder joints degrades significantly after thermal aging at 150 °C for 500 h. It is notable that Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-0.1Ni/ Cu-15Zn solder joints still present higher shear strength after aging at 150 °C. The weakened shear strength in Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu-0.1Ni/Cu solder joints is due to stress accumulation in the interfacial (Cu,Ni)

84905639901	Growth orientation of Cu-Sn IMC in Cu/Sn-3.5Ag/Cu-xZn microbumps and Zn-doped solder joints	In this study, the evolution of grain structures in Cu/Sn-3.5Ag/Cu-xZn (x=0 or 15 wt%) microbumps and SAC305/Cu-xZn solder joints was investigated. Due to the small size of microbumps, impingement of interface IMCs easily occur. In a Cu/Sn-3.5Ag/Cu (wt%) microbump, the grain orientation of combined intermetallic compounds (IMCs) tends to be homogenous and closely-grouped, allowing cracks to more easily propagate. In order to examine the grain evolution of Cu-Sn IMCs, EBSD analysis was applied to microbumps and conventional-sized solder joints. Replacing the Cu substrate with Cu-Zn causes the grain orientation of Cu-Sn IMCs to become more random and dispersed, which may hinder crack propagation. It is thus expected that the reliability of Zn-doped microbumps and solder joints is superior to that of Cu substrate joints. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84910657225	Exploration of surface hydrophilic properties on AISI 304 stainless steel and silicon wafer against aging after atmospheric pressure plasma treatment	The aim of this work is to seek the enhanced surface hydrophilic properties on AISI 304 stainless steel and silicon wafer after atmospheric pressure plasma treatment using a specifically designed atmospheric pressure plasma jet. The aging tendency of surface hydrophilic property under air is highlighted. It is concluded that both of the silicon wafer and stainless steel treated with plasma generated from supply gas of argon 15 slm mixed with oxygen 40 sccm shows a better tendency on remaining high water contact angle as compared to that with pure argon and nitrogen addition. Additional peaks of O I (777, 844 nm), O II (408 nm) are detected by optical emission spectroscope indicating the presence of the oxygen radicals and ionic species, which interact with surfaces and thus contribute to low water contact angle (WCA) surfaces. Moreover, the result acquired from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that the increase in the oxygen-related bonding exhibits a better contribution on remaining high surface energy over a period of time.

84920034988	Antimicrobial characteristics in Cu-containing Zr-based thin film metallic glass	Zr-based thin film metallic glass (TFMG), exhibiting the unique properties of good glass forming ability (GFA), corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility, can be applied in various novel fields of industries. An ultra-smooth surface is obtained with the TFMG coatings, which is beneficial to modify the work surface. Thus, TFMG can be extended to medical appliances, such as surgical blades and micro-surgery scissors. The aims of this study are to fabricate the Cu-containing Zr-based TFMG onto SUS304 plates and to investigate the surface physical properties and their antimicrobial effects. The chemical compositions of Zr-Cu-Ni-Al coatings are examined by a field emission electron probe micro-analyzer (FE-EPMA). The amorphous structures of all TFMG are characterized by the X-ray diffractometry. The surface properties are analyzed by an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a water contact angle goniometer for the 304 stainless steel substrate and Zr-Cu-Ni-Al TFMG. Liquid culture methods and plate counting methods are used to assess the antimicrobial performance of specimens. The antimicrobial rate against Escherichia coli (. E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (. S. aureus) under the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS Z2801: 2000 is over 99%. The release of copper ion from TFMG specimen is determined by the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Cu-containing Zr-based TFMG. The results show that the surface of SUS 304 stainless steel substrate can be modified with deposited Zr-Cu-Ni-Al TFMG, and their improved antimicrobial efficacy against those bacteria is attributed to their amorphous rough surface, hydrophobic properties and released copper ion. The TFMG developed in this study with adequate hardness, good adhesion ability and antimicrobial efficiencies can be used as a promising candidate to improve the surface properties of the medical appliances and also to reduce the possibility of nosocomial infection.

10044242478	Thermal reliability of electroless Ni-P-W coating during the aging treatment	The Ni-P-W coating was fabricated by electroless technique in the alkaline solution. The phase transition temperature of Ni-P compound analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was 406°C. To evaluate the thermal stability of Ni-P-W coating under long-term aging treatment, the operation temperature below and above the crystallization temperature of Ni-P compound was chosen at 375 and 450°C, respectively. The phase transformation during thermal evolution was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microstructure and grain size at different stages of aging time were identified by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The surface roughness at as-deposited and final heat treatment states were explored by atomic force microscope (AFM). During the long-term heat treatment at 375°C, the microhardness firstly increased owing to the crystallization of nickel as well as Ni

10044254383	The influence of thermal treatment on the microstructure and hardness in electroless Ni-P-W deposit	Ni-P-W alloy deposit on the mild steel substrate was obtained by the electroless process. Various thermal heat-treatment temperatures from 350 to 600°C for 4 h were performed on the coating to evaluate the effect of crystallization behavior and grain size on the mechanical properties. The microstructure at as-deposited and heat-treatment states were investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The hardness at all depths of the coating on the substrate could be acquired by the nanoindentation. The Ni-P-W coating showed an amorphous structure in the as-deposited state and exhibited a relatively low hardness of approximately 6.8 GPa. As temperature was raised to 380°C, the hardness was slightly increased to 8.7 GPa due to the partial precipitation of Ni and Ni

84923327483	Driving ferromagnetic resonance frequency of FeCoB/PZN-PT multiferroic heterostructures to Ku-band via two-step climbing: Composition gradient sputtering and magnetoelectric coupling	RF/microwave soft magnetic films (SMFs) are key materials for miniaturization and multifunctionalization of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and their components, which demand that the SMFs should have higher self-bias ferromagnetic resonance frequency f FMR, and can be fabricated in an IC compatible process. However, self-biased metallic SMFs working at X-band or higher frequency were rarely reported, even though there are urgent demands. In this paper, we report an IC compatible process with two-step superposition to prepare SMFs, where the FeCoB SMFs were deposited on (011) lead zinc niobate-lead titanate substrates using a composition gradient sputtering method. As a result, a giant magnetic anisotropy field of 1498 Oe, 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than that by conventional magnetic annealing method, and an ultrahigh f FMR of up to 12.96 GHz reaching Ku-band, were obtained at zero magnetic bias field in the as-deposited films. These ultrahigh microwave performances can be attributed to the superposition of two effects: uniaxial stress induced by composition gradient and magnetoelectric coupling. This two-step superposition method paves a way for SMFs to surpass X-band by two-step or multi-step, where a variety of magnetic anisotropy field enhancing methods can be cumulated together to get higher ferromagnetic resonance frequency.

84923479187	The fabrication and property evaluation of Zr-Ti-B-Si thin film metallic glass materials	Recently, the thin film metallic glass materials have attracted much attention due to their amorphous structure and unique properties. In this work, four Zr-Ti-B-Si thin film metal glasses (TFMGs) were fabricated on Si wafer and AISI 420 stainless steel disk substrates using four pure targets by a co-sputtering system. The power of Si target was adjusted to achieve TFMGs with different Si contents. The amorphous phase of TFMG was determined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When the Si content was higher than 12.9. at.%, the dense and featureless microstructures of thin films were produced. Very high hardness, beyond 10. GPa, was obtained for Zr-Ti-B-Si TFMG containing high Si content. The excellence in corrosion resistance of Zr-Ti-B-Si TFMGs was confirmed by the potentiodynamic polarization test in 5.0. wt.% NaCl aqueous solution. It can be concluded that the Si content showed a positive influence on the hardness, adhesion and anti-corrosion performance of the Zr-Ti-B-Si thin film metallic glass.
