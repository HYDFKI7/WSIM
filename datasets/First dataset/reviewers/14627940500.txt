84937127277	NO<inf>2</inf> gas sensor based on polyvinylpyrrolidone/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite	Pure polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) film, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) film and PVP/RGO composite film were coated on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for nitrogen oxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) sensing at room temperature. These films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Because only a few RGO were deposited on QCM, the sensor based on RGO almost had no response to NO<inf>2</inf>. In addition, compared with the response of pure PVP film, an increase in the response of PVP/RGO composite film may be caused by the more absorption area for NO<inf>2</inf> molecule adsorption.

33748941748	Gas quantitative analysis based on the gas sensor array	The semiconductor gas sensors sensitive to carbon monoxide and hydrogen were chosen to compose the gas sensor array, and an on-line data acquisition system was constructed. Combining with the pattern recognition techniques of back-propagation (BP) neuron network, the system was used to carry out the quantitative analysis of the partial gas concentration in a mixture. The main effect factors to the outputs of BP neuron network, such as array outputs under different response time, the different pre-processing algorithms and the different structures of the neural network, are discussed in this paper. It is shown that the best prediction results are obtained when the array output under 3 min response time is processed using RRD pre-processing algorithm and used as the actual input of the neural network, then the training and testing of this three-layer BP neuron network with 12 neurons in hidden layer are performed.

Both conductive and non-conductive polymers were characterized on the surface of the modified QCM electrode. Operating at the resonant frequency ranging from 10 to 20 Hz, the QCMs coated with non-conductive polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), were sensitive to DDVP. The results showed that the resonant frequency range of QCMs increased by the coating with conductive polymers, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and a copolymer of PEDOT with poly(styrene sulphonic acid) (PEDOT/PSS), which was from 20 to 115 Hz and 18 to 60 Hz, respectively. The mechanism and corresponding equivalent circuit model of the QCM-based sensor were presented. The capacitance was calculated in the range of 0.199-0.194 pF for the PEDOT/PSS film and 0.198-0.187 pF for the PEDOT film. In the range of 6.5-32.5 ppm DDVP concentration, the relationship between the response of the sensor coated with PEDOT and the concentration was linear.

34248551280	Quantitative evaluation of film thickness uniformity: Application to off-axis magnetron source onto a rotating substrate	To predict the thin film thickness distribution in a quantitative way, a theoretical calculation was conducted according to the cosine law approach for off-axis sputtering. The numerical calculation was focused on the optimal geometry instead of the thickness distribution itself, which took into account several variables including the target-to-substrate distance, the off-axis displacement, the emission characteristic, the width of the erosion groove, and the film thickness requirement. The effects of these variables on the optimal geometry were analyzed individually and the subsequent combined equations for optimal geometry were summarized. Thus, the combined equations were multivariable functions. These equations were simple and general and could be applied directly. For many situations, these equations eliminate the need to perform the complex, detailed calculation otherwise needed for each deposition geometry variant. © 2007 American Vacuum Society.

PVP films were distributed onto the electrode surfaces of quartz crystal by drop-coating. The electrical characteristics of the devices as a function of relative humidity (RH %) measured in the airtight testing chamber to generate the controlled humidity were tested. The change in frequency of QCM with sensitive film was in situ monitored. Result shows when the polymer-coated QCM exposed to certain humidity circumstance, the change of mass on crystal sensitive surface results in the decrease of resonant frequency. It was found that the increase of shift frequency is proportional to the thickness of polymeric film. In low humidity range less than 50% RH, all of the sensors showed linear characteristics to humidity and mild frequency shift. In high humidity, the frequency shift changed dramatically.

The interactions between target analyte and the sensor surface cause changes in the mechanical, electrical, dielectric properties of the sensing coating deposited onto acoustic transducer. The changes in these properties will lead to changes in the velocity and amplitude of wave modes, which can be measured by frequency and insertion loss (IL) changes when the acoustic element is realized as a delay line or resonator. Among the different sensing coatings, the supermolecules are of considerable interest because the host molecules can be thought as original receptors allowing a specific recognition of guest molecules based on "key-lock" system. In this paper, SAW ethanol gas sensors that utilize the supermolecule of cryptophane-A as sensitive layer have been studied. We synthesized cryptophane-A from vanillyl alcohol using a double trimerisation method and deposited it on the SAW devices to fabricate cryptophane-A based SAW gas sensors. The SAW frequency and insertion loss (IL) were measured using a network analyzer. The frequency shift as the response of the cryptophane-A based SAW sensors to different concentration ethanol was measured at room temperature. It is found that the cryptophane-A based SAW sensor has high sensitivity and good reproductivity to ethanol. The frequency response increased linearly with the concentration of the ethanol. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

84866737521	Humidity sensing properties of different single-walled carbon nanotube composite films fabricated by layer-by-layer self-assembly technique	Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)/single-walled carbon nanotube (PDDA/SWNT) multilayered thin films were prepared on quartz crystal microbalance by layer-by-layer self-assembly technique, and their sensing properties to humidity were studied. The SWNTs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The composite films were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscope. Two types of SWNT humidity sensors were fabricated using SWNTs and carboxyl (COOH) modified SWNTs as sensitive material, respectively. The results showed that the sensitivity of the PDDA/SWNT-COOH humidity sensor was 20.23 % higher than that of the PDDA/SWNT sensor. In contrast, the latter had a much superior hysteresis property, and the reason to cause this phenomenon was discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84901193781	Gas sensors for CO	In this paper, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were selected as sensing materials for carbon dioxide detection. Two kinds of sensors with different sensitive film structures, i.e., RGO-PEI composite film and RGO-PEI bi-layer film were fabricated by airbrushing the sensitive films on interdigitated electrodes. Response performances of both sensors at room temperature were investigated. Results showed that sensors with bi-layer film exhibited smaller baseline drift and more stable sensing characteristics than the counterparts with composite film. Furthermore, bi-layer film sensors with different quantity of PEI solution deposited were studied. Performances of long-time stability, repeatability, low concentration of detection for carbon dioxide, and measurements of response time and recovery time were investigated. It was found that appropriate weight ratio of RGO and PEI was critical for sensing response. In addition, the sensor with bi-layer film exhibited a better repeatability but had longer response time and recovery time than RGO single-layer sensor, and both of them could detect as low as 20 parts per million carbon dioxide gas. Sensing responses of the prepared sensors to carbon dioxide under dry air or nitrogen were compared.
