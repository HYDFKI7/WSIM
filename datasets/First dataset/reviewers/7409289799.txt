17544405025	Directional histogram model for three-dimensional shape similarity	In this paper, we propose a novel shape representation we call Directional Histogram Model (DHM). It captures the shape variation of an object and is invariant to scaling and rigid transforms. The DHM is computed by first extracting a directional distribution of thickness histogram signatures, which are translation invariant. We show how the extraction of the thickness histogram distribution can be accelerated using conventional graphics hardware. Orientation invariance is achieved by computing the spherical harmonic transform of this distribution. Extensive experiments show that the DHM is capable of high discrimination power and is robust to noise.

2142815758	Synthesis and Rendering of Bidirectional Texture Functions on Arbitrary Surfaces	The bidirectional texture function (BTF) is a 6D function that describes the appearance of a real-world surface as a function of lighting and viewing directions. The BTF can model the fine-scale shadows, occlusions, and specularities caused by surface mesostructures. In this paper, we present algorithms for efficient synthesis of BTFs on arbitrary surfaces and for hardware-accelerated rendering. For both synthesis and rendering, a main challenge is handling the large amount of data in a BTF sample. To addresses this challenge, we approximate the BTF sample by a small number of 4D point appearance functions (PAFs) multiplied by 2D geometry maps. The geometry maps and PAFs lead to efficient synthesis and fast rendering of BTFs on arbitrary surfaces. For synthesis, a surface BTF can be generated by applying a texton-based sysnthesis algorithm to a small set of 2D geometry maps while leaving the companion 4D PAFs untouched. As for rendering, a surface BTF synthesized using geometry maps is well-suited for leveraging the programmable vertex and pixel shaders on the graphics hardware. We present a real-time BTF rendering algorithm that runs at the speed of about 30 frames/second on a mid-level PC with an ATI Radeon 8500 graphics card. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthesis and rendering algorithms using both real and synthetic BTF samples.

30944446430	Clustering method for fast deformation with constraints	We present a fast deformation method for flexible objects. The deformation of the object is physically modeled using a linear elasticity model with a displacement based finite elements method, yielding a linear system at each time step of simulation. We solve this linear system using a precomputed force-displacement matrix, which describes the object response in terms of displacement accelerations to the forces acting on each vertex. We exploit the spatial coherence to effectively compress the force-displacement matrix to make this method practical and efficient by applying the clustered principal component analysis method. And we developed a method to efficiently handle the additional constraints for interactive user manipulation. At last large deformations are addressed based upon the compressed force-displacement matrix by combining a domain decomposition method and tracking the rotational motions. The experimental results demonstrate fast performances on complex large scale objects under interactive user manipulations. Copyright © 2005 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

33645149191	Large mesh deformation using the volumetric graph Laplacian	We present a novel technique for large deformations on 3D meshes using the volumetric graph Laplacian. We first construct a graph representing the volume inside the input mesh. The graph need not form a solid meshing of the input mesh's interior; its edges simply connect nearby points in the volume. This graph's Laplacian encodes volumetric details as the difference between each point in the graph and the average of its neighbors. Preserving these volumetric details during deformation imposes a volumetric constraint that prevents unnatural changes in volume. We also include in the graph points a short distance outside the mesh to avoid local self-intersections. Volumetric detail preservation is represented by a quadric energy function. Minimizing it preserves details in a least-squares sense, distributing error uniformly over the whole deformed mesh. It can also be combined with conventional constraints involving surface positions, details or smoothness, and efficiently minimized by solving a sparse linear system. We apply this technique in a 2D curve-based deformation system allowing novice users to create pleasing deformations with little effort. A novel application of this system is to apply nonrigid and exaggerated deformations of 2D cartoon characters to 3D meshes. We demonstrate our system's potential with several examples.

33646047160	Bi-scale radiance transfer	Radiance transfer represents how generic source lighting is shadowed and scattered by an object to produce view-dependent appearance. We generalize by rendering transfer at two scales. A macro-scale is coarsely sampled over an object's surface, providing global effects like shadows cast from an arm onto a body. A meso-scale is finely sampled over a small patch to provide local texture. Low-order (25D) spherical harmonics represent lowfrequency lighting dependence for both scales. To render, a coefficient vector representing distant source lighting is first transformed at the macro-scale by a matrix at each vertex of a coarse mesh. The resulting vectors represent a spatially-varying hemisphere of lighting incident to the meso-scale. A 4D function, called a radiance transfer texture (RTT), then specifies the surface's meso-scale response to each lighting basis component, as a function of a spatial index and a view direction. Finally, a 25D dot product of the macro-scale result vector with the vector looked up from the RTT performs the correct shading integral. We use an id map to place RTT samples from a small patch over the entire object; only two scalars are specified at high spatial resolution. Results show that bi-scale decomposition makes preprocessing practical and efficiently renders self-shadowing and interreflection effects from dynamic, low-frequency light sources at both scales. © 2003 ACM.

33745254211	Computing variation modes for point set surfaces	Point sets have become a popular shape representation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to computing variation modes for point set surfaces, and represent the point set surface as a linear combination of the variation modes, called a generative representation for the point set surface. Given a point set, our approach consists of two steps: The first is to produce a set of new samples with increasing smoothness and less detailed features. We use a modified smoothing method based on moving least squares (MLS) surface to produce the samples. The second is to arrange the shape vectors of the new samples together with the original point set into a matrix, and then compute the singular value decomposition of the matrix, producing a set of variation modes (the eigen vectors). Using the variation modes and the generative representation, we can easily synthesize new shapes. Typical applications are low/high/band pass filtering as well as denoising and detail enhancement in multiple scales. © The Eurographics Association 2005.

33745834733	Interactive mesh deformation with pseudo material effects	This paper presents a novel interactive mesh deformation method that can achieve various dynamic material effects, including elastic membrane and cloth effects. In our framework, a mesh is encoded by some differential quantities based on edge length and dihedral angle; and the deformation is formulated as a least square problem for preserving the edge length and dihedral angle via the differential quantities. In order to obtain anisotropic material effects, we further propose an edge-weighting scheme based on a user-specified vector field. To avoid specifying the local transformations, we set up an iterative scheme for solving the deformation. At last, several examples are presented to show that our approach can interactively generate visually pleasing deformations. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

33748520816	Real-time soft shadows in dynamic scenes using spherical harmonic exponentiation	Previous methods for soft shadows numerically integrate over many light directions at each receiver point, testing blocker visibility in each direction. We introduce a method for real-time soft shadows in dynamic scenes illuminated by large, low-frequency light sources where such integration is impractical. Our method operates on vectors representing low-frequency visibility of blockers in the spherical harmonic basis. Blocking geometry is modeled as a set of spheres; relatively few spheres capture the low-frequency blocking effect of complicated geometry. At each receiver point, we compute the product of visibility vectors for these blocker spheres as seen from the point. Instead of computing an expensive SH product per blocker as in previous work, we perform inexpensive vector sums to accumulate the log of blocker visibility. SH exponentiation then yields the product visibility vector over all blockers. We show how the SH exponentiation required can be approximated accurately and efficiently for low-order SH, accelerating previous CPU-based methods by a factor of 10 or more, depending on blocker complexity, and allowing real-time GPU implementation.

33748530340	Variational sphere set approximation for solid objects	We approximate a solid object represented as a triangle mesh by a bounding set of spheres having minimal summed volume outside the object. We show how outside volume for a single sphere can be computed using a simple integration over the object's triangles. We then minimize the total outside volume over all spheres in the set using a variant of iterative Lloyd clustering that splits the mesh points into sets and bounds each with an outside volume-minimizing sphere. The resulting sphere sets are tighter than those of previous methods. In experiments comparing against a state-of-the-art alternative (adaptive medial axis), our method often requires half as many spheres, or fewer, to obtain the same error, under a variety of error metrics including total outside volume, shadowing fidelity, and proximity measurement.

33748557383	Subspace gradient domain mesh deformation	In this paper we present a general framework for performing constrained mesh deformation tasks with gradient domain techniques. We present a gradient domain technique that works well with a wide variety of linear and nonlinear constraints. The constraints we introduce include the nonlinear volume constraint for volume preservation, the nonlinear skeleton constraint for maintaining the rigidity of limb segments of articulated figures, and the projection constraint for easy manipulation of the mesh without having to frequently switch between multiple viewpoints. To handle nonlinear constraints, we cast mesh deformation as a nonlinear energy minimization problem and solve the problem using an iterative algorithm. The main challenges in solving this nonlinear problem are the slow convergence and numerical instability of the iterative solver. To address these issues, we develop a subspace technique that builds a coarse control mesh around the original mesh and projects the deformation energy and constraints onto the control mesh vertices using the mean value interpolation. The energy minimization is then carried out in the subspace formed by the control mesh vertices. Running in this subspace, our energy minimization solver is both fast and stable and it provides interactive responses. We demonstrate our deformation constraints and subspace deformation technique with a variety of constrained deformation examples. Copyright © 2006 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

33751028483	An efficient large deformation method using domain decomposition	Efficiently simulating large deformations of flexible objects is a challenging problem in computer graphics. In this paper, we present a physically based approach to this problem, using the linear elasticity model and a finite elements method. To handle large deformations in the linear elasticity model, we exploit the domain decomposition method, based on the observation that each sub-domain undergoes a relatively small local deformation, involving a global rigid transformation. In order to efficiently solve the deformation at each simulation time step, we pre-compute the object responses in terms of displacement accelerations to the forces acting on each node, yielding a force-displacement matrix. However, the force-displacement matrix could be too large to handle for densely tessellated objects. To address this problem, we present two methods. The first method exploits spatial coherence to compress the force-displacement matrix using the clustered principal component analysis method; and the second method pre-computes only the force-displacement vectors for the boundary vertices of the sub-domains and resorts to the Cholesky factorization to solve the acceleration for the internal vertices of the sub-domains. Finally, we present some experimental results to show the large deformation effects and fast performance on complex large scale objects under interactive user manipulations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

35348981346	Gradient-based shell generation and deformation	Shell becomes popular in a variety of modeling techniques for representing small-scale features and increasing visual complexity. Current shell generation algorithms do not measure the volume distortion for geometric texture mapping. And when the object deforms, it is very challenging for existing algorithms to wrap the space inside the shell without large artifacts. We propose an approach to these problems by minimizing the difference between the deformation gradient of the space in the shell and the rotation component of it. Because the shell space is warped as rigid as possible, small features embedded in the shell can be preserved well. Furthermore, our algorithm can achieve shell-like object deformation. We introduce a novel hierarchical dimension reduction method to solve the involved nonlinear optimization problem efficiently. Finally, several examples are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

35349031743	Precomputed radiance transfer field for rendering interreflections in dynamic scenes	In this paper, we introduce a new representation - radiance transfer fields (RTF) - for rendering interreflections in dynamic scenes under low frequency illumination. The RTF describes the radiance transferred by an individual object to its surrounding space as a function of the incident radiance. An important property of RTF is its independence of the scene configuration, enabling interreflection computation in dynamic scenes. Secondly, RTFs naturally fit in with the rendering framework of precomputed shadow fields, incurring negligible cost to add interreflection effects. In addition, RTFs can be used to compute interreflections for both diffuse and glossy objects. We also show that RTF data can be highly compressed by clustered principal component analysis (CPCA), which not only reduces the memory cost but also accelerates rendering. Finally, we present some experimental results demonstrating our techniques. © 2007 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Experimental results show that it takes only an average of 1.42 bits per triangle. Additionally, a non-linear geometry predictor is designed to compress the geometric information. Compared with the previous work, this algorithm is of linear complexity and high compression ratio, and can be implemented effectively.

79952351494	GPU based parallel rendering of single scattering	This paper presents a GPU based algorithm for rendering participating media with single scattering. First, the algorithm efficiently determines the ray marching path using the intersection points list of ray tracing and intersection points of the ray and the bounding box of the media, and then it calculates single scattering lighting through ray marching, which parallelizes the media single scattering rendering procedure. Based on the parallel algorithm, this paper proposes an image space interpolation approach to accelerate the rendering process. Based on the observation that rendering single scattering only depends on the depth of ray marching, the distance from the sample to the light source, and the local property of media, we make an interpolation approximation in image space by choosing a proper interpolating function, which can decrease times of ray marching and save rendering cost. Without any pre-computation, our algorithm achieves an interactive performance. Moreover, the algorithm supports changing the property of the lighting and the media property on the fly. In addition, the algorithm can handle various materials of media including homogeneous and heterogeneous with anisotropic phase function.

84887355277	Templateless quasi-rigid shape modeling with implicit loop-closure	This paper presents a method for quasi-rigid objects modeling from a sequence of depth scans captured at different time instances. As quasi-rigid objects, such as human bodies, usually have shape motions during the capture procedure, it is difficult to reconstruct their geometries. We represent the shape motion by a deformation graph, and propose a model-to-part method to gradually integrate sampled points of depth scans into the deformation graph. Under an as-rigid-as-possible assumption, the model-to-part method can adjust the deformation graph non-rigidly, so as to avoid error accumulation in alignment, which also implicitly achieves loop-closure. To handle the drift and topological error for the deformation graph, two algorithms are introduced. First, we use a two-stage registration to largely keep the rigid motion part. Second, in the step of graph integration, we topology-adaptively integrate new parts and dynamically control the regularization effect of the deformation graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by several depth sequences of quasi-rigid objects, and an application in human shape modeling. © 2013 IEEE.

46749125678	Caustic spot light for rendering caustics	It is difficult to render caustic patterns at interactive frame rates. This paper introduces new rendering techniques that relax current constraints, allowing scenes with moving, non-rigid scene objects, rigid caustic objects, and rotating directional light sources to be rendered in real-time with GPU hardware acceleration. Because our algorithm estimates the intensity and the direction of caustic light, rendering of non-Lambertian surfaces is supported. Previous caustics algorithms have separated the problem into pre-rendering and rendering phases, storing intermediate results in data structures such as photon maps or radiance transfer functions. Our central idea is to use specially parameterized spot lights, called caustic spot lights (CSLs), as the intermediate representation of a two-phase algorithm. CSLs are flexible enough that a small number can approximate the light leaving a caustic object, yet simple enough that they can be efficiently evaluated by a pixel shader program during accelerated rendering.We extend our approach to support changing lighting direction by further dividing the pre-rendering phase into per-scene and per-frame components: the per-frame phase computes frame-specific CSLs by interpolating between CSLs that were pre-computed with differing light directions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

54749086821	Shape deformation based on tetrahedral control mesh	A robust shape deformation algorithm with the feature of both volume and surface detail preserving is presented. First, the input model is embedded into a coarse tetrahedral control mesh, and the modified barycentric coordinates are employed to establish their relationship. Then according to users editing, the control mesh is deformed by solving a quadric nonlinear energy minimization problem, and the deformation is passed to the embedded model by interpolation. As the optimization process is applied to the control mesh composed of sparse vertices, the efficiency is greatly improved. Meantime, we incorporate a new energy, called Laplacian energy, into the energy equation to make the tetrahedral control mesh deform as rigidly as possible, thus avoiding shape degenerations even under extreme editing. Our algorithm accommodates various shape representations, such as triangular meshes, point clouds etc. Experiments demonstrate that the Laplacian energy is very effective in preserving geometric details and preventing unreasonable volume changes.

This paper proposed an easy but efficient approach to it by using coarse control meshes to embed the target objects. The control mesh can be efficiently deformed by various existing methods, and then the target object can be accordingly deformed by interpolation. One of the most simplest interpolation methods is to use the barycentric coordinates, which however generates apparent first-order discontinuity artifacts across the boundary due to its piecewise linear property. To avoid such artifacts, this paper introduced a modified barycentric interpolation (modified-BI) technique. The central idea is to add a local transformation at each control vertex for interpolation, so that we can minimize the first-order discontinuity by optimizing the local transformations. We also minimize the second order derivatives of the interpolation function to avoid undesired vibrations.

In contrast to the original scheme, we provide flexible explicit controls of the shape, size, orientation and feature alignment of the quadrangular faces. We achieve this by proper selection of the optimal eigenvalue (shape), by adaption of the area term in the Laplacian operator (size), and by adding special constraints to the Laplace eigenproblem (orientation and alignment). By solving a generalized eigen-problem we can generate a scalar field on the mesh whose Morse-Smale complex is of high quality and satisfies all the user requirements. The final quadrilateral mesh is generated from the Morse-Smale complex by computing a globally smooth parametrization. Here we additionally introduce edge constraints to preserve user specified feature lines accurately. © 2008 ACM.

The user interactively specifies the cubes in the regions which are prone to volumetric distortions, and the rigidity constraints could make the mesh behave like a solid object during deformation.

We introduce a method for real-time soft shadows in dynamic scenes illuminated by large, low-frequency light sources where such integration is impractical. Our method operates on vectors representing low-frequency visibility of blockers in the spherical harmonic basis. Blocking geometry is modeled as a set of spheres; relatively few spheres capture the low-frequency blocking effect of complicated geometry. At each receiver point, we compute the product of visibility vectors for these blocker spheres as seen from the point. Instead of computing an expensive SH product per blocker as in previous work, we perform inexpensive vector sums to accumulate the log of blocker visibility. SH exponentiation then yields the product visibility vector over all blockers. We show how the SH exponentiation required can be approximated accurately and efficiently for low-order SH, accelerating previous CPU-based methods by a factor of 10 or more, depending on blocker complexity, and allowing real-time GPU implementation.

Based upon periodic characteristics of the codes, a new adaptive multi-pixel line drawing algorithm is put forward. Both experimental results and analysis show that this algorithm greatly reduces the computation of line drawing and accelerates the line drawing process.

80052457166	SAH KD-tree construction on GPU	KD-tree is one of the most efficient acceleration data structures for ray tracing. In this paper, we present a kd-tree construction algorithm that is precisely SAH-optimized and runs entirely on GPU. We construct the tree nodes in breadth-first order. In order to precisely evaluate the SAH cost, we design a parallel scheme based on the standard parallel scan primitive to count the triangle numbers for all split candidates, and a bucket-based algorithm to sort the AABBs (axis-aligned bounding box) of the clipped triangles of the child nodes. The proposed parallel algorithms can be mapped well to GPU's streaming architecture. The experiments showed that our algorithm can produce the highest quality kd-tree as the off-line CPU algorithms, but runs faster than multi-core CPU algorithms and the GPU SAH BVH-Tree algorithm. © 2011 ACM.

81255179248	Structure preserving mesh parameterization	The traditional parameterization methods focused on preserving the local geometry properties by minimizing the distortions of angle and stretch. In this paper, we present a mesh parameterization method to preserve some global geometry properties, such as symmetry structure, of the input mesh. Given an input triangular mesh, the symmetry regions can be automatically detected using shape analysis method or manually specified by the users. For each vertex in the symmetry regions, we can identify the symmetric point and represent it as a triangle index and the corresponding bary centric coordinates. We extend the harmonic map to parameterize the input mesh by adding new error metric to measure how the symmetry property of the point pairs are preserved. Since the new error metric is non-linear, we develop an iterative update method to solve the parameterization problem. At last, we show some structure preservation parameterization results, and compare them with the results of the traditional harmonic map. © 2011 IEEE.

84862853064	Video-driven state-aware facial animation	It is important in computer animation to synthesize expressive facial animation for avatars from videos. Some traditional methods track a set of semantic feature points on the face to drive the avatar. However, these methods usually suffer from inaccurate detection and sparseness of the feature points and fail to obtain high-level understanding of facial expressions, leading to less expressive and even wrong expressions on the avatar. In this paper, we propose a state-aware synthesis framework. Instead of simply fitting 3D face to the 2D feature points, we use expression states obtained by a set of low-cost classifiers (based on local binary pattern and support vector machine) on the face texture to guide the face fitting procedure. Our experimental results show that the proposed hybrid framework enjoys the advantages of the original methods based on feature point and the awareness of the expression states of the classifiers and thus vivifies and enriches the face expressions of the avatar.

0036756709	Progressive geometry compression for meshes	A progressive geometry compression scheme is presented. In this scheme, a mesh is represented as a base mesh followed by some groups of vertex split operations using an improved simplification method, in which each level of the mesh can be refined into the next level by carrying out a group of vertex split operations in any order. Consequently, the PM representation can be effectively encoded by permuting the vertex split operations in each group. Meanwhile, a Laplacian geometry predicator is designed to predict each new vertex position using its neighbors. The correction is quantized and encoded using Huffman coding scheme. Experimental results show that the algorithm can obtain higher compression ratios than the previous work. It is very suitable for progressive transmission of geometry models over Internet.

84868309304	A memory-efficient KinectFusion using octree	KinectFusion is a real time 3D reconstruction system based on a low-cost moving depth camera and commodity graphics hardware. It represents the reconstructed surface as a signed distance function, and stores it in uniform volumetric grids. Though the uniform grid representation has advantages for parallel computation on GPU, it requires a huge amount of GPU memory. This paper presents a memory-efficient implementation of KinectFusion. The basic idea is to design an octree-based data structure on GPU, and store the signed distance function on data nodes. Based on the octree structure, we redesign reconstruction update and surface prediction to highly utilize parallelism of GPU. In the reconstruction update step, we first perform "add nodes" operations in a level-order manner, and then update the signed distance function. In the surface prediction step, we adopt a top-down ray tracing method to estimate the surface of the scene. In our experiments, our method costs less than 10% memory of KinectFusion while still being fast. Consequently, our method can reconstruct scenes 8 times larger than the original KinectFusion on the same hardware setup. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84869211968	Spectral quadrangulation with orientation and alignment control	This paper presents a new quadrangulation algorithm, extending the spectral surface quadrangulation approach where the coarse quadrangular structure is derived from the Morse-Smale complex of an eigenfunction of the Laplacian operator on the input mesh. In contrast to the original scheme, we provide flexible explicit controls of the shape, size, orientation and feature alignment of the quadrangular faces. We achieve this by proper selection of the optimal eigenvalue (shape), by adaption of the area term in the Laplacian operator (size), and by adding special constraints to the Laplace eigenproblem (orientation and alignment). By solving a generalized eigenproblem we can generate a scalar field on the mesh whose Morse- Smale complex is of high quality and satisfies all the user requirements. The final quadrilateral mesh is generated from the Morse- Smale complex by computing a globally smooth parametrization. Here we additionally introduce edge constraints to preserve user specified feature lines accurately. © 2008 ACM.

84876115060	A divide-and-conquer approach to quad remeshing	Many natural and man-made objects consist of simple primitives, similar components, and various symmetry structures. This paper presents a divide-and-conquer quadrangulation approach that exploits such global structural information. Given a model represented in triangular mesh, we first segment it into a set of submeshes, and compare them with some predefined quad mesh templates. For the submeshes that are similar to a predefined template, we remesh them as the template up to a number of subdivisions. For the others, we adopt the wave-based quadrangulation technique to remesh them with extensions to preserve symmetric structure and generate compatible quad mesh boundary. To ensure that the individually remeshed submeshes can be seamlessly stitched together, we formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem and design a heuristic solver to optimize the subdivision numbers and the size fields on the submesh boundaries. With this divider-and-conquer quadrangulation framework, we are able to process very large models that are very difficult for the previous techniques. Since the submeshes can be remeshed individually in any order, the remeshing procedure can run in parallel. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can preserve the high-level structures, and process large complex surfaces robustly and efficiently. © 1995-2012 IEEE.

84878132251	A unified spectral embedding for shape correspondence	Spectral embedding, as one of shape representative techniques, takes hold of many researchers' attention in field of shape correspondence. One of the biggest challenges of spectral correspondence method is that embeddings of different shapes need to be aligned in the embedding space in order to eliminate sign flip and ordering ambiguity of their eigenfunctions, before seeking for correspondence. In this paper, we introduce a spectral correspondence method by embedding shapes in a unified space simultaneously. In the unified embedding space, the sample points of the same shape with small intrinsic distances, and from different shapes with high similarity, are close to each other. Our unified embedding can be used for correspondence directly, without need of alignment. Furthermore, the unified embedding captures both the spatial arrangement and the feature similarity. Shape correspondence is achieved with such embedding by minimizing an objective function. Results show the efficiency of our method.

84879908450	Unsupervised co-segmentation of 3D shapes via affinity aggregation spectral clustering	Many shape co-segmentation methods employ multiple descriptors to measure the similarities between parts of a set of shapes in a descriptor space. Different shape descriptors characterize a shape in different aspects. Simply concatenating them into a single vector might greatly degrade the performance of the co-analysis in the presence of irrelevant and redundant information. In this paper, we propose an approach to fuse multiple descriptors for unsupervised co-segmentation of a set of shapes from the same family. Starting from the over-segmentations of shapes, our approach generates the consistent segmentation by performing the spectral clustering in a fused space of shape descriptors. The core of our approach is to seek for an optimal combination of affinity matrices of different descriptors so as to alleviate the impact of unreliable and irrelevant features. More specially, we introduce a local similarity based affinity aggregation spectral clustering algorithm, which assumes the local similarities are more reliable than far-away ones. Experimental results show the efficiency of our approach and improvements over the state-of-the-art algorithms on the benchmark datasets. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84883813169	3D material style extraction from a single image	Material design is an important component of 3D scene modeling, which however costs a lot of time and labors. In this paper, we present a new method for automatically extracting the material style from a sample image for 3D scenes. Given a 3D scene and a sample image, we first obtain some candidate materials using inverse rendering techniques under a set of pre-determined views. Then, we define an objective function to estimate the difference of the material style between the sample image and the synthesized images rendered with candidate materials. This objective function takes into account the difference of the mean, the variance and the histogram of the chromatic distribution. Finally, we select best materials as candidate materials by optimizing the objective function using the Tabu Search method. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we compare our results with those obtained with user assistances to demonstrate our method.

84883821799	An upright orientation detection algorithm for 3D man-made objects based on shape properties	To handle the challenging problem for inferring the upright orientation of 3D models only from geometry, we propose an automatic upright orientation detection algorithm for man-made objects in this paper. The proposed method takes advantages of the orientation clues from the shape properties, such as the facet orientation, symmetry and 3D convex hull facet orientation. We first use these clues to extract candidate orientations and get those orientation triplets that the orientations are pairwise orthogonal to form a frame. Next, we rotate the frame to the canonical coordinate and select the best one that aligns the model with canonical coordinate using model facet normal and area. Finally, we use various criterions on static stability and visibility to choose the correct upright orientation from the six axis-aligned candidates of canonical coordinate orientation. We have tested the proposed method on a 3D model database, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

84889646612	Interactive shape co-segmentation via label propagation	In this paper, we present an interactive approach for shape co-segmentation via label propagation. Our intuitive approach is able to produce error-free results and is very effective at handling out-of-sample data. Specifically, we start by over-segmenting a set of shapes into primitive patches. Then, we allow the users to assign labels to some patches and propagate the label information from these patches to the unlabeled ones. We iterate the last two steps until the error-free consistent segmentations are obtained. Additionally, we provide an inductive extension of our framework, which effectively addresses the out-of-sample data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84888586941	SCAPE-based human performance reconstruction	This paper presents an automatic approach to reconstruct human motion using noisy depth data from multiple views. Although multi-view constraints are provided by this setup, it still exhibits great challenges to robustly reconstruct dynamic human performances due to inherent complexity and self-occlusion of human motion. In the insight that the semantics of human motion will supply strong prior in motion reconstruction, we therefore propose a SCAPE-based motion reconstruction algorithm. As the building blocks of this main algorithm, we (1) re-train a SCAPE model based on an expanded human pose database containing human poses collected from different databases to enlarge the tracking space, (2) develop a correspondence estimation method based on articulated ICP to improve the robustness of SCAPE tracking. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and show that our system is able to capture and reconstruct accurate human motion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84891510532	A divide-and-conquer approach to large scene reconstruction with interactive scene analysis and segmentation	3D reconstruction of real world objects is a fundamental problem in computer vision and computer graphics. It is a challenge for high fidelity reconstruction with consumer-grade depth camera, e.g. Microsoft Kinect on large scale scene. A divide-and-conquer approach could both preserve local geometry details of scene objects and global consistency of the whole scene, thus is superior to existing GPU based real-time/global optimization based offline methods. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art in two folds. First, more fine grit scene segmentation is conducted for better local details preservation. Second, a scene analysis procedure is proposed for more reasonable global error spread. Preliminary experiments show that our method achieves more convincing reconstruction results. © 2013 Authors.

84891547779	Render synthetic fog into interior and exterior photographs	In this paper, we propose a framework for rendering synthetic fog into interior and exterior photographs. Given a single photograph as input, our approach first obtains an approximation of the illumination and geometry for the underlying scene with a few user assistance, then generates a Transmittance Map (TMap) and a Volumetric Map (VMap) for the input photograph according to a decomposition of reflective radiance and transmittance, finally synthesizes the foggy photograph by combining the input photograph, the Transmittance Map and the Volumetric Map. Our approach employs physically based rendering technique and take into account not only the effect of increasing illumination in shadow areas and desaturation of surface reflection but also glow around the area lights and light shafts for directional lights. Compared with the previous image processing method, our approach can produce more realistic results. In addition, we demonstrate in a user study that synthetic images produced by our approach are confusable with real photographs. © 2013 ACM.

84893691094	Octree-based fusion for realtime 3D reconstruction	This paper proposes an octree-based surface representation for KinectFusion, a realtime reconstruction technique of in-door scenes using a low-cost moving depth camera and a commodity graphics hardware. In KinectFusion, the scene is represented as a signed distance function (SDF) and stored as an uniform grid of voxels. Though the grid-based SDF is suitable for parallel computation in graphics hardware, most of the storage are wasted, because the geometry is very sparse in the scene volume. In order to reduce the memory cost and save the computation time, we represent the SDF in an octree, and developed several octree-based algorithms for reconstruction update and surface prediction that are suitable for parallel computation in graphics hardware. In the reconstruction update step, the octree nodes are adaptively split in breath-first order. To handle scenes with moving objects, the corresponding nodes are automatically detected and removed to avoid storage overflow. In the surface prediction step, an octree-based ray tracing method is adopted and parallelized for graphic hardware. To further reduce the computation time, the octree is organized into four layers, called top layer, branch layer, middle layer and data layer. The experiments showed that, the proposed method consumes only less than 10% memory of original KinectFusion method, and achieves faster performance. Consequently, it can reconstruct scenes with more than 10 times larger size than the original KinectFusion on the same hardware setup. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84893732616	3D gradient enhancement	Enhancement can exaggerate visual details in both image processing and 3D rendering. In this paper, we adapt the gradient enhancement technique from image processing to 3D rendering through differentiating the rendering result with respect to the image space coordinates under point lighting. In this way, we can achieve 3D enhancement taking into account the gradient of geometry, projection transform, visibility and highlight. We also propose a tunable shape descriptor for users to achieve rendering results in different enhancement extent. Moreover, we extend this method to the environment lighting with some simplifications. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can handle the grazing angle area and the edges of sharp slope better than the previous method due to the gradient of the projection transform. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84895063384	Observation-oriented silhouette-aware fast full body tracking with Kinect	We present a novel approach to track full human body mesh with a single depth camera, e.g. Microsoft Kinect, using a template body model. The proposed observation-oriented tracking mainly targets at fitting the body mesh silhouette to the 2D user boundary in video stream by deforming the body. It is fast to be integrated into real-time or interactive applications, which is impossible with traditional iterative optimization based approaches. Our method is a composite of two main stages: user-specific body shape estimation and on-line body tracking. We first develop a novel method to fit a 3D morphable human model to the actual body shape of the user in front of the depth camera. A strategy, making use of two constrains, i.e. point clouds from depth images and correspondence between foreground user mask contour and the boundary of projected body model, is designed. On-line tracking is made possible in successive steps. At each frame, the joint angles of template skeleton are optimized towards the captured Kinect skeleton. Then, the aforementioned contour correspondence is adopted to adjust the projected body model vertices towards the contour points of foreground user mask, using a Laplacian deformation technique. Experimental results show that our method achieves fast and high quality tracking. We also show that the proposed method is benefit to three applications: virtual try-on, full human body scanning and applications in manufacturing systems. © 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

84901399369	High quality binocular facial performance capture from partially blurred image sequence	Existing methods on passive facial performance capture assume that the input images are well captured. They merely consider how to deal with motion blurred images in the input sequence, which is very common in the image capture process. This paper presents a collection of novel algorithms and a thereby resulting system to reconstruct high quality facial dynamic geometry even from a partially blurred image sequence. In our method, we adopt binocular cameras to capture a stereo sequence. With this sequence, we first estimate depth map for each frame using a state-of-The-art stereo matching method. Then, based on the estimated depth map sequence, we track facial motion by leveraging constraints of both optical flow and geometry. In this step, a blur detection and regularization algorithm are devised to adaptively keep both shape and details. Finally, we synthesize temporal mesoscopic geometry on the blurred region from clear image texture of neighboring frames. We conduct extensive experiments on several sequences containing facial performance with blurred region, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.

84901447223	Dynamic human surface reconstruction using a single kinect	This paper presents a system for robust dynamic human surface reconstruction using a single Kinect. The single Kinect provides a self-occluded and noisy RGBD data. Thus it is challenging to track the whole human surface robustly. To overcome both incompleteness and data noise, we adopt a template to confine the shape in the un-seen part, and propose a two-stage tracking pipeline. The first stage tracks the articulated motion of the human, which improves robustness of tracking by introducing more constraints between the surface points. The second stage tracks movements of non-articulated motion. For long sequences, we stabilize the human surface in the un-seen part by directly warping the surface from the first frame to the current frame according to sequentially tracked correspondences, preventing surface from collapsing caused by error accumulation. We demonstrate our method by several real captured RGBD data, containing complex human motion. The reconstruction results show the effectiveness and robustness of our method. © 2013 IEEE.

12244257525	A novel volume constrained smoothing method for meshes	In general, mesh smoothing is performed by minimizing the discrete energy function for the surface. One of the major problems in mesh smoothing is to prevent the mesh from shrinking. In this paper, we propose a novel volume constraint to address the shrinking problem in mesh smoothing. Our key observation is that the mesh can be efficiently smoothed patch by patch in a signal processing manner, and then a local volume preserving constraint can be easily imposed to the energy minimization problem associated with the small patch, called the smoothing stencil, so as to effectively avoid the mesh shrinkage. In our implementation, the smoothing stencil is the 1-ring neighboring region of an edge or a triangle. And the constrained minimization problem is solved by a 2-step approximation method for efficiency. A series of examples demonstrate that the proposed smoothing method can be applied to remove noise from a mesh or remove rough detail from an original mesh to generate a smooth model in object reconstruction and geometry modeling.
