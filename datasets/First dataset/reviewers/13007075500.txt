84928402926	The effect of two novel amino acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles on survival in vascular endothelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and macrophages	Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been popularly used in many fields. Recently, many kinds of MNPs are modified as new absorbents, which have attracted considerable attention and are promising to be applied in waste water. In our previous study, we synthesized two novel MNPs surface-coated with glycine or lysine, which could efficiently remove many anionic and cationic dyes under severe conditions. It should be considered that MNP residues in water may exert some side effects on human health. In the present study, we evaluated the potential nanotoxicity of MNPs in human endothelial cells, macrophages, and rat bone marrow stromal cells. The results showed that the two kinds of nanoparticles were consistently absorbed into the cell cytoplasm. The concentration of MNPs@Gly that could distinctly decrease survival was 15 μg/ml in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and 10 μg/ml in macrophages. While the concentration of MNPs@Lys that obviously reduced viability was 15 μg/ml in HUVECs or macrophages and 50 μg/ml in BMSCs. Furthermore, cell nucleus staining and cell integrity assay indicated that the nanoparticles induced cell apoptosis, but not necrosis even at a high concentration. Altogether, these data suggest that the amino acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles exert relatively high cytotoxicity. By contrast, lysine-coated magnetic nanoparticles are more secure than glycine-coated magnetic nanoparticles.

20444474605	Safrole oxide inhibits angiogenesis by inducing apoptosis	Our previous studies indicate that 3, 4-(methylenedioxy)-1-(2′, 3′-epoxypropyl)-benzene (safrole oxide), a newly synthesized compound, induces apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and A549 lung cancer cells. To our knowledge, the inhibition of angiogenesis by safrole oxide has not been reported yet. We report here that cultured rat aorta treated with safrole oxide exhibited a significant microvessel reduction as determined by counting the number of microvessels in a phase contrast microscope. There were more microvessels formed in the presence of A549 lung cancer cells in rat aorta model, while a dramatic inhibition of angiogenesis was obtained by adding 220-450 μmol l

32844462043	Safrole oxide induces apoptosis by up-regulating Fas and FasL instead of integrin β4 in A549 human lung cancer cells	Previously, we found that 3,4-(methylenedioxy)-1-(2′,3′- epoxypropyl)-benzene (safrole oxide) induced a typical apoptosis in A549 human lung cancer cells by activating caspase-3, -8, and -9. In this study, we further investigated which upstream pathways were activated by safrole oxide during the apoptosis. Immunofluorescence assay combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that both Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) were up-regulated by the small molecule. In addition, Fas protein distribution was altered, showing a clustering distribution instead of a homogeneous one. Subsequently, Western blot analysis confirmed the up-regulations of Fas and its membrane-binding form of FasL (m-FasL), as well as P53 protein. Conversely, safrole oxide hardly affected integrin β4 subunit expression or distribution, which was reflected from the data obtained by immunofluorescence assay combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results suggested that Fas/FasL pathway might be involved in safrole oxide-induced apoptosis of A549 cells, while integrin β4 might be irrelevant to the apoptosis. Nevertheless, we first found the strong expression of integrin β4 in A549 cells. The study first suggested that safrole oxide might be used as a small molecular promoter of Fas/FasL pathway to elicit apoptosis in A549 cells, which would lay the foundation for us to insight into the new strategies for lung cancer therapy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

33646554212	Suppressing Akt phosphorylation and activating Fas by safrole oxide inhibited angiogenesis and induced vascular endothelial cell apoptosis in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 and serum	At present, vascular endothelial cell (VEC) apoptosis induced by deprivation of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and serum has been well studied. But how to trigger VEC apoptosis in the presence of FGF-2 and serum is not well known. To address this question, in this study, the effects of safrole oxide on angiogenesis and VEC growth stimulated by FGF-2 were investigated. The results showed that safrole oxide inhibited angiogenesis and induced VEC apoptosis in the presence of FGF-2 and serum. To understand the possible mechanism of safrole oxide acting, we first examined the phosphorylation of Akt and the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS); secondly, we analyzed the expressions and distributions of Fas and P53; then we measured the activity of phosphatidylcholine specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) in the VECs treated with and without safrole oxide. The results showed that this small molecule obviously suppressed Akt phosphorylation and the activity of NOS, and promoted the expressions of Fas and P53 markedly. Simultaneously, Fas protein clumped on cell membrane, instead of homogenously distributed. The activity of PC-PLC was not changed obviously. The data suggested that safrole oxide effectively inhibited angiogenesis and triggered VEC apoptosis in the presence of FGF-2 and serum, and it might perform its functions by suppressing Akt/NOS signal pathway, upregulating the expressions of Fas and P53 and modifying the distributing pattern of Fas in VEC. This finding provided a powerful chemical probe for promoting VEC apoptosis during angiogenesis stimulated by FGF-2. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33746820602	D609 blocks cell survival and induces apoptosis in neural stem cells	In order to investigate the effects of tricyclodecane-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609) on the survival of neural stem cells (NSCs), which were isolated from rat forebrain, we treated the NSCs with D609 in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). We found that when NSCs were exposed to 18.76-56.29 μM D609, the viability of the cells remarkably declined and apoptosis occurred. At the same time, the ROS level in NSCs was depressed. The data suggested that D609 was a powerful growth inhibitor and apoptosis inducer in NSCs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results showed that 3BDO (20-60 μg/ml) increased VEC viability and inhibited VEC apoptosis induced by deprivation of serum and FGF-2 in a very weak dose-dependent manner. During this process, integrin β4 expression was depressed, but the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not changed. The data suggested that 3BDO (20-60 μg/ml) could inhibit VEC apoptosis and suppress integrin β4 expression, but it could not depress the ROS level induced by deprivation of serum and FGF-2. © 2006.

33846810093	Safrole oxide induces neuronal apoptosis through inhibition of integrin β4/SOD activity and elevation of ROS/NADPH oxidase activity	Neuronal apoptosis is a very important event in the development of the central nervous system (CNS), but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that safrole oxide, a small molecule, induces integrin β4 expression and promotes apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells. In this study, the effects of safrole oxide on cell growth and apoptosis have been examined in primary cultures of mouse neurons. Safrole oxide was found to significantly inhibit neuronal cell growth and to induce apoptosis. The inhibitory and apoptotic activities of safrole oxide followed a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, the expression of integrin β4 was significantly inhibited with safrole oxide treatment. Furthermore, safrole oxide dramatically increases the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activity of NADPH oxidase. Moreover, manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity was decreased significantly with safrole oxide treatment. Our study thus demonstrates that safrole oxide induces neuronal apoptosis through integrin β4, ROS, NADPH, and MnSOD. © 2006.

34247335043	Novel morpholin-3-one derivatives induced apoptosis and elevated the level of P53 and Fas in A549 lung cancer cells	Previously, we found that nine kinds of new morpholin-3-one derivatives could inhibit the growth of A549 lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, but how they performed their function remained unknown. In this paper, we studied the effects of the three more effective morpholin-3-one derivatives {4-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-((4-nitrophenoxy) methyl) morpholin-3-one (1); 6-(4-chlorophenoxy)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) morpholin-3-one (2); and 6-((4-nitrophenoxy) methyl)-4-phenylmorpholin-3-one (3)} on the cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and the level of P53 and Fas that are two kinds of important proteins in the regulation of A549 cell growth and apoptosis. According to the results of cell viability, we selected 40 μg/ml of morpholin-3-one derivatives as the most appropriate concentration for the following study. The results showed that the morpholin-3-one derivatives partly blocked the cells at G1 phase, induced apoptosis, and elevated the level of P53 and Fas proteins significantly. The effect of the morpholin-3-one derivates was associated with translocation of P53 and clustering of Fas. Our data suggested that the morpholin-3-one derivates might be promising tools for elucidating the molecular mechanism of lung cancer cell apoptosis and they will be very potential candidates for developing anti-cancer drugs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

35548967625	Multi-level recording of photochromic indolylfulgide	The photon-mode multi-level optical storage properties using a photochromic indolylfulgide compound named 2-(1-benzyl-3-methyl-2-indolylmethylene)-3-isoproplidene succinic anhaydride have been investigated. It has been found that this compound possesses an absorption maximum at 400 nm and undergoes a photocyclization upon irradiation with UV light at 365 nm, leading to the formation of a pinkish product with absorption maximum at 505 nm. By irradiation with visible light at 514.5 nm, the original absorption spectrum was recovered completely. The transmittance of this photochromic material was found to change nonlinearly along with the exposure energy, indicating the potential of this compound as multi-level optical storage material. Eight-level optical storage of amplitude modulation is experimentally realized using the indolylfulgide dispersed PMMA film for the first time. By employing the laser beam at 514.5 nm with power of 3 mW for recording and readout, multi-level signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) have been detected. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

37549006759	Both senescence and apoptosis induced by deprivation of growth factors were inhibited by a novel butyrolactone derivative through depressing integrin β4 in vascular endothelial cells	Both senescence and apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) are involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. To understand the association between senescence and apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells, the authors first explored whether senescence and apoptosis took place at the same time in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) deprived of the growth factors. Integrin β4 is a key factor in HUVEC apoptosis, to know whether this integrin is implicated in VEC senescence, the authors checked the changes of integrin β4 level during HUVEC aging. Then the authors investigated the effects of 3BDO (3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy)methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one) on the senescence induced by deprivation of serum and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. The results showed that deprivation of growth factors not only induced apoptosis, but also triggered senescence in HUVECs. The authors found that the level of integrin β4 was increased markedly during HUVEC senescence. 3BDO (20 to 60 μg/mL) could inhibit both senescence and apoptosis and depress integrin β4 level. The data suggested that integrin β4 might be a pivotal factor in the relationship between senescence and apoptosis.

39849098427	Toll-like receptor 4 mediates chronic restraint stress-induced immune suppression	Stress, either physical or psychological, can have a dramatic impact on the immune system. Little progress, however, has been made in understanding stress-induced immune suppression. We report here that mice subjected to chronic 12-hour daily physical restraint for two days significantly increased the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Interestingly, TLR4-deficient mice are resistant to stress-induced lymphocyte reduction. In addition, restraint stress caused dramatic decrease in T help 1 (Th1) cytokine IFN-γ and IL-2 levels but increase in Th2 cytokine IL-4 in wild type mice. Moreover, the restraint stress significantly inhibits changes of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in TLR4-deficient mice compared with the wild type mice. Therefore, stress modulates the immune system through a TLR4-dependent mechanism. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

40149108424	A novel isochroman derivative inhibited apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells through depressing the levels of integrin β4, p53 and ROS	A new derivative of isochroman, 7-(isopropoxymethyl)-5-phenyl-7,8-dihydro-5H-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isochromene (ISO-9), was synthesized in our laboratory. In this study, we investigated the effect of ISO-9 on the apoptosis induced by deprivation of serum and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results of MTT assay showed that 40 μM ISO-9 prevented the reduction of cell viability induced by the deprivation of serum and FGF-2 at 24 h or 48 h, respectively. To further study the correlated mechanism, the levels of integrin β4, p53 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed. The results showed that the high levels of integrin β4, p53 and ROS induced by the deprivation of serum and FGF-2 could be inhibited by the treatment of 40 μM ISO-9. The data suggested that ISO-9 was a promising anti-apoptotic agent and could be served as a useful tool to study the molecular mechanism of apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (VECs). © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

33644970102	Chloroquine inhibits cell growth and induces cell death in A549 lung cancer cells	To investigate the effects of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) on lung cancer cell growth, we treated A549 cells, a lung cancer cell line, with the drug at various concentrations (0.25-128 μM) for 24-72 h. The results showed that, at lower concentrations (from 0.25 to 32 μM), CQ inhibited the growth of A549 cells and, at the same time, it induced vacuolation with increased volume of acidic compartments (VAC). On the other hand, at higher concentrations (64-128 μM), CQ induced apoptosis at 24 h, while its effect of inducing vacuolation declined. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay showed that with the treatment of CQ 32-64 μM for 72 h or 128 μM for 48 h, CQ induced necrosis of A549 cells. To understand the possible mechanism by which CQ acts in A549 cells, we further incubated the cells with this drug at the concentrations of 32 or 128 μM in the presence of D609, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine- specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC). The results showed that D609 (50 μM) could inhibit the effects of CQ 32 μM on the viability and VAC, but it could not change the effects of CQ 128 μM on the same. Our data suggested that CQ inhibited A549 lung cancer cell growth at lower concentrations by increasing the volume of lysosomes and that PC-PLC might be involved in this process. The data also indicated that, at higher concentrations, CQ induced apoptosis and necrosis, but at this time its ability to increase the volume of lysosome gradually declined, and PC-PLC might not be implicated in the process. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33644974189	Safrole oxide induced human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cell differentiation into neuron-like cells by depressing the reactive oxygen species level at the low concentration	Previously, we found that 5-25 μg/ml safrole oxide could inhibit apoptosis and dramatically make a morphological change in human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). But the possible mechanism by which safrole oxide function is unknown. To answer this question, in this study, we first investigated the effects of it on the activity of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS), the expressions of Fas and integrin β4, which play important roles in HUVEC growth and apoptosis, respectively. The results showed that, at the low concentration (10 μg/ml), safrole oxide had no effects on NOS activity and the expressions of Fas and integrin β4. Then, we investigated whether HUVECs underwent differentiation. We examined the expressions of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neurofilament-L (NF-L). Furthermore, we analyzed the changes of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). After 10 h of treatment with 10 μg/ml safrole oxide, some HUVECs became neuron-like cells in morphology, and intensively displayed positive NSE and NF-L. Simultaneously, ROS levels dramatically decreased during HUVECs differentiation towards neuron-like cells. At the low concentration, safrole oxide induced HUVECs differentiation into neuron-like cells. Furthermore, our data suggested that safrole oxide might perform this function by depressing intracellular ROS levels instead of by affecting cell growth or apoptosis signal pathways. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34247855035	Safrole oxide is a useful tool for investigating the effect of apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells on neural stem cell survival and differentiation in vitro	Previously, we found safrole oxide could promote VEC apoptosis, however, it is not known whether it can induce NSC apoptosis. It is reported that neural stem cells (NSCs) are localized in a vascular niche. But the effects of apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (VEC) on NSC growth and differentiation are not clear. To answer these questions, in this study, we co-cultured NSCs with VECs in order to imitate the situation in vivo, in which NSCs are associated with the endothelium, and treated the single-cultured NSCs and the co-cultured NSCs with safrole oxide. The results showed that safrole oxide (10-100 μg/mL) had no effects on NSC growth. Based on these results, we treated the co-culture system with this small molecule. The results showed that the NSCs differentiation, into neurons and gliacytes was induced by VECs untreated with safrole oxide. But in the co-culture system treated with safrole oxide, the NSCs underwent apoptosis. The data suggested that when VEC apoptosis occurred in the co-culture system, the NSC survival and differentiation could not be maintained, and NSCs died by apoptosis. Our finding provided a useful tool for investigating the effect of apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells on neural stem cell survival and differentiation in vitro. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our previous study showed that ethyl 3-(o-chlorophenyl)-5-methyl-1- phenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate (MPD) could inhibit apoptosis of HUVECs in this model. In this study, we investigated the effect of MPD on angiogenesis and the possible mechanisms. Capillary-like tube formation assay on Matrigel and cell migration assay were performed to investigate the effect of MPD on angiogenesis. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) levels were respectively evaluated by intracellular ROS assay and western blot analysis. MPD at 5 and 10 μM promoted vascular structure formation and HUVEC migration in an in vitro ischemic model. MPD promoted angiogenesis through elevating ROS levels and depressing IP-10 level. ROS seemed to be necessary for angiogenesis, and a high level of IP-10 inhibited angiogenesis in ischemic state. ROS provide clues for seeking new key factors involved in angiogenesis. IP-10 may become a new target for future therapeutic intervention. MPD is a good tool for investigating the mechanism of angiogenesis, and MPD might be useful in the development of new drugs in therapy of ischemic diseases. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

80052265745	Safrole oxide induces human umbilical vein endothelial cell transdifferentiation to 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neuron-like cells through tropomyosin receptor kinase A/cyclooxygenase 2/nuclear factor-kappa B/interleukin 8 signaling	The phenomenon of endothelial-neural transdifferentiation has been observed for a long time, but the mechanism is not clear. We previously found that safrole oxide induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell transdifferentiation into neuron-like cells. In this study, we first validated that these cells induced by safrole oxide were functional 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neuron-like cells. Then, we performed microarray analysis of safrole oxide-treated and -untreated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Safrole oxide elevated the levels of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was accompanied by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation during the transdifferentiation. Blockade of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) by an inhibitor or short hairpin RNA inhibited the levels of COX-2/IL-8 and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB but did not suppress the increased ROS level. As a result, cells underwent apoptosis. Therefore, via TrkA, safrole oxide may induce endothelial cell transdifferentiation into functional neuron-like cells. During this process, the increased levels of COX-2/IL-8 and the subsequent elevation of ROS production induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and IL-8 secretion. With the activity of TrkA inhibited, the inactive NF-κB regulated the ROS level in a negative feedback manner. Finally, the transdifferentiation pathway was blocked and cells became apoptotic. The TrkA/COX-2/IL-8 signal pathway may have an important role in endothelial-neural transdifferentiation, and safrole oxide may trigger this process by activating TrkA. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, our purpose was to investigate whether 3BDO could modulate angiogenesis and its possible acting mechanism. The effect of 3BDO on angiogenesis was investigated by capillary-like tubule formation and rat aortic ring assay. Proliferation and migration of cells were detected by counting living cell number and scraping cell monolayer, respectively. Na, K-ATPase activity was measured spectrophotometrically. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed using tetramethylrhodamine methylester fluorescence by confocal microscopy. Our results showed that 3BDO inhibited migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but maintained migration and tubule formation of HUVECs. In HUVECs, 3BDO inhibited Na, K-ATPase activity, but had no effect on mitochondria membrane potential. In VSMCs, it did not affect Na, K-ATPase activity, but depressed mitochondria membrane potential obviously. The data showed that 3BDO had selective effects on HUVECs and VSMCs, it might perform its role through the selective effects on the activity of Na, K-ATPase and the mitochondria membrane potential in HUVECs and VSMCs. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The measurement on the volume of acidic compartments (VAC) and autophagy analysis by acridine orange (AO) staining and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3) process revealed that 3BDO was an effective inhibitor of autophagic vesicle accumulation (vacuolation) induced by CQ in VECs. 5, 5′, 6, 6′-tetrachloro-1, 1′, 3, 3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) was used for mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) measurement.

68049083546	A benzoxazine derivative induces vascular endothelial cell apoptosis in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 by elevating NADPH oxidase activity and reactive oxygen species levels	Previously, we found that 6,8-dichloro-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (DBO) promoted apoptosis of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) deprived of growth factors. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of DBO and its mechanism of action on angiogenesis and apoptosis of HUVECs in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), which promotes angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. DBO significantly inhibited capillary-like tube formation by promoting apoptosis of HUVECs in the presence of FGF-2 in vitro. Furthermore, DBO elevated the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) and increased the activity of NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in promoting apoptosis under this condition. Moreover, when NADPH oxidase was inhibited by its specific inhibitor, dibenziodolium chloride (DPI), DBO could not elevate ROS and NO levels in HUVECs. The data suggest that DBO is a new modulator of apoptosis in vitro, and it might function by increasing the activity of NADPH oxidase and iNOS, subsequently elevating the levels of ROS and NO in HUVECs. The findings of this study provide a new small molecule for investigating the FGF-2/NADPH oxidase/iNOS signaling pathway in apoptosis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

70349304396	Novel complex of copper and a salicylaldehyde pyrazole hydrazone derivative induces apoptosis through up-regulating integrin β4 in vascular endothelial cells	To determine apoptosis modulators of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we prepared 9 novel complexes of copper (Cu) and salicylaldehyde pyrazole hydrazone (SPH) derivatives (Cu-SPHs). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay revealed that all of the SPHs and Cu-SPHs effectively inhibited cell growth. Six of the 9 Cu-SPHs induced apoptosis in HUVECs. Among the 9 Cu-SPHs, the complex of Cu and (E)-N′-(2- hydroxybenzylidene)-1-benzyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carbohydrazide, named Cu-15, was one of the most effective apoptosis inducers and inhibited angiogenesis on Matrigel and HUVEC migration in vitro. We further studied the mechanism of Cu-15 action and found that the protein level of integrin β4 increased with 10 μM Cu-15 treatment for 12 or 24 h. Knockdown of integrin β4 by RNA interference significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by Cu-15 in HUVECs. Thus, high level of integrin β4 could promote apoptosis induced by Cu-15. Cu-15 might be a useful tool for further investigating the functions of integrin β4 in regulating angiogenesis and HUVEC apoptosis. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

77349100137	A novel copper complex of salicylaldehyde pyrazole hydrazone induces apoptosis through up-regulating integrin β4 in H322 lung carcinoma cells	In light of the increased anticancer activities of some reported copper complexes and our previous finding of nine novel anti-proliferative salicylaldehyde pyrazole hydrazone (SPH) derivatives, we prepared copper complexes of these SPH derivatives (Cu-SPHs), which turned out to be stronger growth inhibitors to A549 cells than their corresponding SPHs via inducing apoptosis. Among them, the copper complex of (E)-N′-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-1-(4-tert-butylbenzyl)-3-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-5-carbohydrazide, termed Cu-16, exhibited an advantage in selectivity and efficacy over the others. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses showed an elevated protein level of integrin β4 upon Cu-16 treatment, and knockdown of integrin β4 significantly inhibited Cu-16 induced apoptosis in H322 cells. Taken together, the results indicate that Cu-16 promotes apoptosis in H322 cells through elevating the protein level of integrin β4. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

75749105043	Discovery of a benzoxazine derivative promoting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo	Angiogenesis is a multi-step process that refers to the growth of new vessels from pre-existing ones. Endothelial proliferation, migration, and tube formation constitute a critical step in angiogenesis. Recently, we demonstrated that a novel benzoxazine derivative, 6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4- benzoxazine (ABO) could improve the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and serum. In this study, we further tested its effect on endothelial angiogenesis with Matrigel assay, migration assay, and in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Our results showed that ABO effectively facilitated cell migration and promoted capillary-like tube formation in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, nitric oxide (NO) level/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Our data indicated that ABO depressed ROS with inhibition of NADPH oxidase instead of SOD activity, stimulated NO production and eNOS activation, and restored MMP in HUVECs. Our findings suggest that ABO is a promising tool for exploring the mechanisms of angiogenesis and may have a therapeutic potential in ischemic pathologies. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

78649679713	Role of Hmbox1 in endothelial differentiation of bone-marrow stromal cells by a small molecule	Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) play critical roles in repairing endothelium damage. However, the mechanisms underlying BMSC differentiation into vascular endothelial cells (VECs) is not well understood. We aimed to find new factors involved in this process by exploiting a novel chemical inducer in a gene microarray assay. We first identified a novel benzoxazine derivative (6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine; ABO) that can induce BMSC differentiation to VECs in a capillary-like tube formation assay, promote analysis of endothelial cell-specific marker expression, and facilitate uptake of 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-acetylated low-density lipoprotein (Dil-Ac-LDL). Microarray analysis of BMSCs treated with ABO for 4 h revealed changes in only a handful of genes. The only one upregulated was homeobox-containing 1 (Hmbox1) gene, whereas six genes, including IP-10 and others, were downregulated. The upregulation of Hmbox1 and downregulation of IP-10 were confirmed by RT-PCR, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and Western blot analysis. It is reported that IP-10 could suppresse EC differentiation into capillary structures. In this study ABO could not induce BMSC differentiation to VECs in the presence of IP-10. Small interfering RNA knockdown of Hmbox1 blocked ABO-induced BMSC differentiation and increased the level of IP-10 but decreased Ets-1. Thus, ABO is a novel inducer for BMSC differentiation to VECs, and Hmbox1 is a key factor in the differentiation. IP-10 and Ets-1 might be relevant targets of Hmbox1 in BMSC differentiation to VECs. These findings provide information on a novel target and a new platform for further investigating the gene control of BMSC differentiation to VECs. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

78649273537	Distinct patterns of autophagy evoked by two benzoxazine derivatives in vascular endothelial cells	Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved, bulk-destruction process in eukaryotes. During this process, the cytoplasm containing long-lived proteins and organelles is engulfed into double-membrane autophagosomes, and ultimately undergoes enzymatic degradation within lysosomes. Autophagy serves as a prosurvival machinery, or it may contribute to cell death. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis and intervention of various human diseases. Pharmacological autophagy modulators are arousing interest from biologists and clinical physicians in light of their potential for disease therapy and increasing our understanding of the mechanism of autophagy. In this study, we identified two autophagy enhancers, 6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (ABO) and 6,8-dichloro-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (DBO), in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC s) by autophagy assays, and demonstrate that ABO and DBO could stimulate autophagy in an mtor-independent and mtor-dependent manner, respectively; ABO-stimulated autophagy was attributed to the elevation of the Ca

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using a fluorescent probe, 2′, 7′- dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCHF). The nitric oxide (NO) production of HUVECs was examined using a NO detection kit. Morphological observation under a phase contrast microscope, a viability assay using 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity analysis by a detection kit were performed to evaluate the toxicity of BPC on HUVECs in the presence of serum and FGF-2. The level of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured by Western blot and ELISA, respectively.Results:In the absence of serum and FGF-2, cells treated with BPC (5-20 μmol/L) rapidly aligned with one another and formed tube-like structures within 12 h. In the presence of serum and FGF-2, cells treated with BPC for 24, 48 and 72 h had no changes in morphology, viability or LDH release compared with the control group. Cell migration in the BPC-treated group was significantly increased compared with the control group. During this process, NO production and ROS level were elevated dramatically, and the levels of HIF-1α and VEGF were increased dependent on the generation of ROS.Conclusion:BPC most effectively promoted angiogenesis and migration in HUVECs in the absence of FGF-2 and serum. © 2011 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.

METHODS: Morphological changes were observed by light microscopy. Cell growth was determined by MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium) method. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorescence microscopy. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: The cells deprived of FGF were exposed to safrole oxide 5 - 25 mg/L for 24 h. Cells spreading and growth were promoted (P < 0. 01), detachment and DNA fragmentation of these cells were suppressed (P < 0. 01), safrole oxide 10 mg/L had no obvious effect on cell cycle distribution (P > 0. 05).

84855595493	A butyrolactone derivative suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced autophagic injury through inhibiting the autoregulatory loop of p8 and p53 in vascular endothelial cells	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular endothelial cell (VEC) dysfunction is an important contributing factor in vascular diseases. Recently, we found that LPS impaired VEC by inducing autophagy. Our previous researches showed that a butyrolactone derivative, 3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy) methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO) selectively protected VEC function. The objective of the present study is to investigate whether and how 3BDO inhibits LPS-induced VEC autophagic injury. Our results showed that LPS induced autophagy and led to increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in Human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, LPS significantly increased p8 and p53 protein levels and the nuclear translocation of p53. All of these effects of LPS on HUVECs were strongly inhibited by 3BDO. Importantly, the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could inhibited LPS-induced autophagy and knockdown of p8 by RNA interference inhibited the autophagy, p53 protein level increase, the translocation of p53 into nuclei and the ROS level increase induced by LPS in HUVECs. The data suggested that 3BDO inhibited LPS-induced autophagy in HUVECs through inhibiting the ROS overproduction, the increase of p8 and p53 expression and the nuclear translocation of p53. Our findings provide a potential tool for understanding the mechanism underlying LPS-induced autophagy in HUVECs and open the door to a novel therapeutic drug for LPS-induced vascular diseases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The noval magnetic nanoparticles was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infra-red spectra and thermogravimetric analysis.

84866157760	Safrole oxide induced neuronal differentiation of rat bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells by elevating Hsp70	In a previous study, we found that at low concentrations, safrole oxide (SFO) could induce vascular endothelial cell (VEC) transdifferentiation into neuron-like cells; however, whether SFO could induce bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) neural differentiation was unknown. Here, we found that SFO could effectively induce BMSC neural differentiation in the presence of serum and fibroblast growth factor 2 and did not affect cell viability at low concentrations. The levels of neuron-specific enolase and neurofilament-L were increased greatly, but that of glial fibrillary acidic protein was absent with SFO treatment for 48. h. Furthermore, SFO could increase the level of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), an important factor in neuronal differentiation. Knockdown of Hsp70 by its small interfering RNA blocked SFO-induced BMSC differentiation. Thus, SFO is a novel inducer of BMSC differentiation to neuron-like cells and Hsp70 is implicated in the differentiation process. We provide a new tool for obtaining neuron-like cells from BMSCs and for further investigating the new effect of Hsp70 on BMSC neuronal differentiation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84865798219	The effect of novel magnetic nanoparticles on vascular endothelial cell function in vitro and in vivo	Manufactured nanoparticles are currently used for many fields. However, their potential toxicity provides a growing concern for human health. In our previous study, we prepared novel magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which could effectively remove heavy metal ions and cationic dyes from aqueous solution. To understand its biocompatibility, we investigated the effect of the nanoparticles on the function of vascular endothelial cells. The results showed that the nanoparticles were taken up by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and could inhibit cell proliferation at 400. μg/ml. An increase in nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity were induced, which companied with the decrease in caveolin-1 level. The endothelium in the aortic root was damaged and the NO level in serum was elevated after treated mice with 20. mg/kg nanoparticles for 3. days, but it was integrated after treated with 5. mg/kg nanoparticles. Meanwhile, an increase in eNOS activity and decrease in caveolin-1 level were induced in the endothelium. The data suggested that the low concentration of nanoparticles could not affect the function and viability of VECs. The high concentration of nanoparticles could inhibit VEC proliferation through elevation of the eNOS activity and NO production and thus present toxicity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84870407336	A chemical small molecule induces mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation into functional vascular endothelial cells via Hmbox1	Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate to endothelial progenitor cells and vascular endothelial cells (VECs), but the mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized 2 chiral compounds (R-ABO and S-ABO) and identified R-ABO as an effective inducer of ESC differentiation into VECs. Furthermore, we found that R-ABO induced ESC differentiation into VECs via homeobox containing 1 (Hmbox1) that acted upstream of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). The data suggest that R-ABO is a novel tool for ESC differentiation into VECs, and Hmbox1 is a key regulator in this differentiation process. These findings provide information on a novel target and a new platform for further investigating the gene control of ESC differentiation to VECs. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

Cell viability was analyzed with MTT assay. Cell apoptosis and senescence were examined using Hoechst 33258 and senescence-Associated-β- galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, respectively. LDH release was measured using a detection kit. Cell cycle was analyzed using a flow cytometer. Intracellular ROS level was measured with the 2′,7′- dichlorodihydrofluorescein probe. Phosphorylation of p38 was determined using Western blot.Results:Compounds 5b, 5d, and 5e (40 and 80 μmol/L) caused significant decrease of A549 cell viability, while other 4 compounds had no effect on the cells. Compounds 5b, 5d, and 5e (80 μmol/L) induced G 1 -phase arrest (increased the G 1 population by 22.6%, 24.23%, and 26.53%, respectively), and markedly increased SA-β-gal-positive cells. However, the compounds did not cause nuclear DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation in A549 cells. Nor did they affect the release of LDH from the cells. The compounds significantly elevated the intracellular ROS level, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased p38 phosphorylation in the cells. In the presence of the antioxidant and free radical scavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (10 mmol/L), above effects of compounds 5b, 5d, and 5e were abolished.Conclusion:The compounds 5b, 5d, and 5e cause neither apoptosis nor necrosis of A549 cells, but exert anti-cancer effect via inducing G 1 -phase arrest and senescence through ROS/p38 MAP-kinase pathway. © 2013 CPS and SIMM.

84881477273	Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of integrin β4 induced by a chemical small molecule contribute to apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells	Integrin β4 and its Y-1494 phosphorylation play an important role in cell signaling. We found a small molecule, ethyl1-(3-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2- hydroxypropyl)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate (ECPC), that could elevate the levels of KIT ligand (KITLG), interleukin 8 (IL-8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and promote apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) through integrin β4. We investigated the underlying mechanism of integrin β4 participating in this process. ECPC treatment increased the phosphorylation of Y-1494 in the integrin β4 cytoplasmic domain via a well-known receptor tyrosine kinase, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and integrin β4 translocated from the cytoplasm to nucleus. With suppression of Y-1494 phosphorylation by FGF-2 or siRNA of FGFR1, ECPC failed to promote integrin β4 nuclear translocation and could not increase the expression of KITLG, IL-8, PTGS2 or ATF3. Y-1494 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of integrin β4 may be important during ECPC-induced apoptosis in VECs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84883062827	Identification of a small molecule targeting annexin A7	Autophagy involves multiple membrane trafficking and fusion events. Annexin A7 (ANXA7) is postulated to play a role in membrane fusion during exocytosis, while the contribution of ANXA7 to autophagy is poorly understood. Our recent studies demonstrated that ABO could promote autophagy via elevation of ANXA7 and triggering ANXA7 subcellular redistribution. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms how ANXA7 regulates autophagy. As molecular disruption of ANXA7 inmice results in several unwished phenotypes, small molecule modulators may be efficacious in defining the mechanisms of ANXA7 action. However, so far no compounds that selectively target ANXA7 have been identified. So, we hypothesize that ABO might be a potent modulator of ANXA7. We also have detected the colocalization of ANXA7 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and ANXA7 was essential for LC3 accumulation in VEC autophagy. As a GTPase, whether ANXA7 affects the phosphorylation of LC3 or other proteins needs further investigation. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and found that ABO directly bound to Thr286 of ANXA7 and inhibited its phosphorylation. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that ANXA7 could interact with grancalcin (GCA). ABO promoted the interaction and inhibited GCA phosphorylation, leading to the decrease of intracellular Ca

Adsorption of acid dyes onto this new adsorbent was further studied in terms of pH, contact time and initial dye concentration. Maximum adsorption capacity reached from pH 1.3 to 2.5 for different dyes. The adsorption can be better described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model compared to pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The adsorption behavior fits quite well with the Langmuir rather than the Freundlich model. The mean energy of adsorption (E) calculated from the Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model confirmed the involvement of chemical adsorption. This adsorbent could remove acid dyes with different structures rapidly with high adsorption capacity. Moreover, the adsorbent possesses good reusability. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84884265174	Relationship between annexin A7 and integrin β4 in autophagy	We recently found that both annexin A7 and integrin β4 were involved in autophagy of vascular endothelial cells. But, their relation is not clear. In this study, we addressed this question by using a small molecule ABO that promoted autophagy by targeting annexin A7. The results showed that knockdown of integrin β4 partly inhibited ABO-induced autophagy in vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, in HEK293 cells that express integrin β4 too low to detect by western blot, ABO could not induce autophagy. If integrin β4 was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, ABO could evoke autophagy. On the other hand, knockdown of annexin A7 also blocked ABO-induced autophagy although the level of integrin β4 was elevated. Moreover, by co-immunoprecipitation, we identified the interaction of integrin β4 and annexin A7, and found that ABO could modulate the interaction, at the same time, the phosphorylation of Y-1494 in integrin β4 cytoplasmic domain was inhibited significantly in vitro and in vivo. Hence, by identifying the interaction between integrin β4 and annexin A7, we demonstrated that both annexin A7 and integrin β4 were essential for small molecule ABO-induced autophagy and targeting annexin A7 by ABO could modulate integrin β4 phosphorylation, while Y-1494 phosphorylation of integrin β4 may negatively regulate autophagy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To further investigate the mechanism of PC-PLC action, we initially identified phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 (PEBP1) as a binding partner of PC-PLC by using mass spectrometry (MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF). We found that PEBP1 positively regulated PC-PLC activity in HUVECs, and inhibition of PC-PLC by its inhibitor D609 suppressed PEBP1 expression dramatically. Moreover, both PC-PLC and PEBP1 negatively regulated HUVEC autophagy independently of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, the PEBP1 level was elevated during the development of atherosclerosis, while D609 significantly decreased the upregulated PEBP1 level in apoE

Modulating the MTOR signaling balance could be of great significance for numerous diseases. No chemical activators of MTOR have been found, and the urgent challenge is to find novel MTOR downstream components. In previous studies, we found a chemical small molecule, 3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy) methyl).dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO), that inhibited autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC s) and neuronal cells. Here, we found that 3BDO activated MTOR by targeting FKBP1A (FK506-binding protein 1A, 12 kDa). We next used 3BDO to detect novel factors downstream of the MTOR signaling pathway. Activation of MTOR by 3BDO increased the phosphorylation of TIA1 (TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein/T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1). Finally, we used gene microarray, RNA interference, RNA-ChIP assay, bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assay, and other assays and found that 3BDO greatly decreased the level of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) derived from the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of TGFB2, known as FLJ11812. TIA1 was responsible for processing FLJ11812. Further experiments results showed that FLJ11812 could bind with MIR4459 targeting ATG13 (autophagy-related 13), and ATG13 protein level was decreased along with 3BDO-decreased FLJ11812 level. Here, we provide a new activator of MTOR, and our findings highlight the role of the lncRNA in autophagy. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

The results showed that the majority of derivatives had inhibitory effects on the growth of A549 cancer cells in dose and time-dependent manners, in which the compounds 4b, 4f, 4h and 4j (10 μM) exerted more effective anti-proliferation activity. However, it should be noted that 4j may result in necrosis at 10 μM. Furthermore, the three compounds 4b, 4f and 4h induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and triggered autophagy, but could not obviously induce apoptosis and necrosis under the stimulatory condition. Therefore, the pyrazolyl hydroxamic acid derivatives 4b, 4f and 4h can be used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of autophagy and offer new approaches to the prevention of lung cancer. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84905692238	Progress of the synthesis of condensed pyrazole derivatives (from 2010 to mid-2013)	Condensed pyrazole derivatives are important heterocyclic compounds due to their excellent biological activities and have been widely applied in pharmaceutical and agromedical fields. In recent years, numerous condensed pyrazole derivatives have been synthesized and advanced to clinic studies with various biological activities. In this review, we summarized the reported synthesis methods of condensed pyrazole derivatives from 2010 until now. All compounds are divided into three parts according to the rings connected to pyrazole-ring, i.e. [5, 5], [5,F 6], and [5, 7]-condensed pyrazole derivatives. The biological activities and applications in pharmaceutical fields are briefly introduced to offer an orientation for the design and synthesis of condensed pyrazole derivatives with good biological activities. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84908637529	Identification of a small molecule preventing BMSC senescence in vitro by improving intracellular homeostasis via ANXA7 and Hmbox1	Recently, small chemical molecules have been proved to be ideal and promising interventions for bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-based tissue regeneration therapies. In this study, we discovered the huge anti-aging potential of a bioactive small molecule, 6-amino-3,4-dihydro-2H-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (ABO), which can suppress a series of senescent phenotypes, enhancing the proliferation and differentiation capacities in cultured rat BMSCs. We further illustrated that those beneficial effects were attributed to an improvement in cellular homeostasis, from the intracellular degradation system to cytoskeleton organization. ABO could enhance autophagy and reduce intracellular oxidative stress, by facilitating lysosomal degradation. The direct target protein of ABO, ANXA7, was elevated and proved essential for autophagy induction and lysosomal protection against Baf-A1 upon ABO treatment. Hmbox1 was another critical protein elevated by ABO, and probably downstream ANXA7. Intriguingly, the subcellular distribution of Hmbox1 largely overlapped with cytoskeletal microfilaments and this might lead to a microfilament reorganization. ABO could decrease the level of Caveolin-1, indicating a remodeling of the F-actin assembly and has attracted our interest to investigate the interaction between Hmbox1, Caveolin-1 and ANXA7 in microfilament formation at the cell membrane in a future study.

84908386585	TIA1 interacts with annexin A7 in regulating vascular endothelial cell autophagy	T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1) is a DNA/RNA binding protein broadly expressed in eukaryotic cells, participating in multiple aspects of cellular metabolism. TIA1 phosphorylation was related with cell apoptosis and its RNA binding activity, however, the regulator and other functions of TIA1 phosphorylation were very little known. To find the modulator of TIA1 phosphorylation, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified annexin A7 (ANXA7) as an interaction protein of TIA1. Recent study showed that a small molecule ABO could directly target ANXA7 and inhibit ANXA7 activity and its targets' phosphorylation. As a GTPase, ANXA7 was speculated to modulate TIA1 phosphorylation. Our results showed that ABO treatment promoted the interaction between TIA1 and ANXA7, and then greatly inhibited phosphorylation of TIA1 in HUVECs. Further results showed that ABO-increased interaction between ANXA7 and TIA1 significantly promoted the processing of a pro-autophagic factor FLJ11812 and the expression of ATG13. Moreover, we found that ABO increased TIA1 protein level, co-localization of ANXA7 and TIA1, and ATG13 expression in the aortic endothelium of apoE

0347616217	An ab inito Study on the 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of C-Methyl Nitron and Acrylonitrile	The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of C-methyl nitron and acrylonitrile has been calculated at MP2/6-31G(d) levels by using ab initio molecular orbital theory. This reaction can lead to four products of endo-4,exo-4,endo-5 and exo-5 and the energy barriers of four reactions are 20. 2,26. 0,4. 4 and 8. 4 kJ/mol respectively. Three H-bond complexes were produced first when C-methyl nitron approaching to Acrylonitril, and their relative energies are -33. 1, -45. 8 and -28. 8 kJ/mol. These H-bond complexes lead to four different transition states and produce four different products.
