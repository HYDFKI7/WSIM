9144231248	BGI-RIS: An integrated information resource and comparative analysis workbench for rice genomics	Rice is a major food staple for the world's population and serves as a model species in cereal genome research. The Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) has long been devoting itself to sequencing, information analysis and biological research of the rice and other crop genomes. In order to facilitate the application of the rice genomic information and to provide a foundation for functional and evolutionary studies of other important cereal crops, we implemented our Rice Information System (BGI-RIS), the most up-to-date integrated information resource as well as a workbench for comparative genomic analysis. In addition to comprehensive data from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica sequenced by BGI, BGI-RIS also hosts carefully curated genome information from Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica and EST sequences available from other cereal crops. In this resource, sequence contigs of indica (93-11) have been further assembled into Mbp-sized scaffolds and anchored onto the rice chromosomes referenced to physical/genetic markers, cDNAs and BAC-end sequences. We have annotated the rice genomes for gene content, repetitive elements, gene duplications (tandem and segmental) and single nucleotide polymorphisms between rice subspecies. Designed as a basic platform, BGI-RIS presents the sequenced genomes and related information in systematic and graphical ways for the convenience of in-depth comparative studies (http://rise.genomics.org.cn/).

20144366003	The genomes of Oryza sativa: A history of duplications	We report improved whole-genome shotgun sequences for the genomes of indica and japonica rice, both with multimegabase contiguity, or almost 1,000-fold improvement over the drafts of 2002. Tested against a nonredundant collection of 19,079 full-length cDNAs, 97.7% of the genes are aligned, without fragmentation, to the mapped superscaffolds of one or the other genome. We introduce a gene identification procedure for plants that does not rely on similarity to known genes to remove erroneous predictions resulting from transposable elements. Using the available EST data to adjust for residual errors in the predictions, the estimated gene count is at least 38,000-40,000. Only 2%-3% of the genes are unique to any one subspecies, comparable to the amount of sequence that might still be missing. Despite this lack of variation in gene content, there is enormous variation in the intergenic regions. At least a quarter of the two sequences could not be aligned, and where they could be aligned, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates varied from as little as 3.0 SNP/kb in the coding regions to 27.6 SNP/kb in the transposable elements. A more inclusive new approach for analyzing duplication history is introduced here. It reveals an ancient whole-genome duplication, a recent segmental duplication on Chromosomes 11 and 12, and massive ongoing individual gene duplications.Wefind 18 distinct pairs of duplicated segments that cover 65.7% of the genome; 17 of these pairs date back to a common time before the divergence of the grasses. More important, ongoing individual gene duplications provide a never-ending source of raw material for gene genesis and are major contributors to the differences between members of the grass family.

0030183104	Density, survival and dispersal of Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes in a West African Sudan savanna village	To obtain information on adult populations of Afrotropical malaria vector mosquitoes, mark-release-recapture experiments were performed with Anopheles females collected from indoor resting-sites in a savanna area near Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, during September 1991 and 1992. Results were used to estimate the absolute population densities, daily survival rates, and dispersal parameters of malaria vectors in that area. In 1991 a total of 7260 female Anopheles were marked and released, of which 106 were recaptured in the release village and 6 in the neighbouring villages, a total recapture rate of 1.5%. The following year 13,854 female Anopheles were released and 116 recaptured in Goundri and 8 in the neighbouring villages, a total recapture rate of 0.9%. Recaptures were found in three of eight villages near Goundri. Nearly all of the recaptured mosquitoes were An.gambiae s.l. Of these, molecular determination revealed that An.gambiae s.s. and An.arabiensis were present in a ratio of ~2:3. Two simple random models of dispersal were simulated and the parameters of the models determined by searching for the least-squared fit between simulated and observed distributions. The mean distance moved by individual mosquitoes, estimated in this way, ranged 350-650 m day

24044482635	Applications of the double-barreled data in whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly and analysis	Double-barreled (DB) data have been widely used for the assembly of large genomes. Based on the experience of building the whole-genome working draft of Oryza sativa L. ssp. Indica, we present here the prevailing and improved uses of DB data in the assembly procedure and report on novel applications during the following data-mining processes such as acquiring precise insert fragment information of each clone across the genome, and a new kind of low-cost whole-genome microarray. With the increasing number of organisms being sequenced, we believe that DB data will play an important role both in other assembly procedures and in future genomic studies.

23844457036	Comparative study of apoptosis-related gene loci in human, mouse and rat genomes	Many genes are involved in mammalian cell apoptosis pathway. These apoptosis genes often contain characteristic functional domains, and can be classified into at least 15 functional groups, according to previous reports. Using an integrated bioinformatics platform for motif or domain search from three public mammalian proteomes (International Protein Index database for human, mouse, and rat), we systematically cataloged all of the proteins involved in mammalian apoptosis pathway. By localizing those proteins onto the genomes, we obtained a gene locus centric apoptosis gene catalog for human, mouse and rat. Further phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the apoptosis related gene loci are conserved among these three mammals. Interestingly, about one-third of apoptosis gene loci form gene clusters on mammal chromosomes, and exist in the three species, which indicated that mammalian apoptosis gene orders are also conserved. In addition, some tandem duplicated gene loci were revealed by comparing gene loci clusters in the three species. All data produced in this work were stored in a relational database and may be viewed at http://pcas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/database/apd.php. ©Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

33747596636	Molecular analysis of early rice stamen development using organ-specific gene expression profiling	Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of plant organ formation is an important component of plant developmental biology and will be useful for crop improvement applications. Plant organ formation, or organogenesis, occurs when a group of primordial cells differentiates into an organ, through a well-orchestrated series of events, with a given shape, structure and function. Research over the past two decades has elucidated the molecular mechanisms of organ identity and dorsalventral axis determinations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the successive processes. To develop an effective approach for studying organ formation at the molecular level, we generated organ-specific gene expression profiles (GEPs) reflecting early development in rice stamen. In this study, we demonstrated that the GEPs are highly correlated with early stamen development, suggesting that this analysis is useful for dissecting stamen development regulation. Based on the molecular and morphological correlation, we found that over 26 genes, that were preferentially up-regulated during early stamen development, may participate in stamen development regulation. In addition, we found that differentially expressed genes during early stamen development are clustered into two clades, suggesting that stamen development may comprise of two distinct phases of pattern formation and cellular differentiation. Moreover, the organ-specific quantitative changes in gene expression levels may play a critical role for regulating plant organ formation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.

33748761629	Genome comparison using Gene Ontology (GO) with statistical testing	Background: Automated comparison of complete sets of genes encoded in two genomes can provide insight on the genetic basis of differences in biological traits between species. Gene ontology (GO) is used as a common vocabulary to annotate genes for comparison. Current approaches calculate the fold of unweighted or weighted differences between two species at the high-level GO functional categories. However, to ensure the reliability of the differences detected, it is important to evaluate their statistical significance. It is also useful to search for differences at all levels of GO. Results: We propose a statistical approach to find reliable differences between the complete sets of genes encoded in two genomes at all levels of GO. The genes are first assigned GO terms from BLAST searches against genes with known GO assignments, and for each GO term the abundance of genes in the two genomes is compared using a chi-squared test followed by false discovery rate (FDR) correction. We applied this method to find statistically significant differences between two cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC7120. We then studied how the set of identified differences vary when different BLAST cutoffs are used. We also studied how the results vary when only subsets of the genes were used in the comparison of human vs. mouse and that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae vs. Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Conclusion: There is a surprising lack of statistical approaches for comparing complete genomes at all levels of GO. With the rapid increase of the number of sequenced genomes, we hope that the approach we proposed and tested can make valuable contribution to comparative genomics. © 2006 Cai et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33749034704	Identification of genes regulated by Wnt/β-catenin pathway and involved in apoptosis via microarray analysis	Background: Wnt/β-catenin pathway has critical roles in development and oncogenesis. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the downstream signaling cascade of this pathway, little is known regarding Wnt/β-catenin pathway modification of the cellular apoptosis. Methods: To identify potential genes regulated by Wnt/β-catenin pathway and involved in apoptosis, we used a stably integnated, inducible RNA interference (RNAi) vector to specific inhibit the expression and the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in HeLa cells. Meanwhile, we designed an oligonucleotide microarray covering 1384 apoptosis-related genes. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, a series of differential expression of genes was identified and further confirmed by RT-PCR. Results: Stably integrated inducible RNAi vector could effectively suppress β-catenin expression and the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF. Meanwhile, depletion of β-catenin in this manner made the cells more sensitive to apoptosis. 130 genes involved in some important cell-apoptotic pathways, such as PTEN-P13K-AKT pathway, NF-κB pathway and p53 pathway, showed significant alteration in their expression level after the knockdown of β-catenin. Conclusion: Coupling RNAi knockdown with microarray and RT-PCR analyses proves to be a versatile strategy for identifying genes regulated by Wnt/ β-catenin pathway and for a better understanding the role of this pathway in apoptosis. Some of the identified β-catenin/TCF directed or indirected target genes may represent excellent targets to limit tumor growth. © 2006 Huang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

58249102100	Characterization of the genome expression trends in the heading-stage panicle of six rice lineages	To study how changes in gene regulation shape phenotypic variations in rice, we performed a comparative analysis of genome expression in the heading-stage panicle from six lineages of cultivated and wild rice, including Oryza sativa subsp. indica, japonica and javanica, O. nivara, O. rufipogon and O. glaberrima. While nearly three-quarters of the genes are expressed at a constant level in all six lineages, a large portion of the genome, ranging from 1767 to 4489 genes, exhibited differential expression between Asian domesticated and wild rice with repression or down-regulation of genome expression in Asian cultivated rice as the dominant trend. Importantly, we found this repression was achieved to a large extent by the differential expression of a single member of paralogous gene families. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that genes related to catabolism are repressed while genes related to anabolism up-regulated. Finally, we observed that distinct evolutionary forces may have acted on gene expression and the coding sequences in the examined rice lineages.

77954319020	Sequencing of 50 human exomes reveals adaptation to high altitude	Residents of the Tibetan Plateau show heritable adaptations to extreme altitude. We sequenced 50 exornes of ethnic Tibetans, encompassing coding sequences of 92% of human genes, with an average coverage of 18x per individual. Genes showing population-specific allele frequency changes, which represent strong candidates for altitude adaptation, were identified. The strongest signal of natural selection came from endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (EPAS1), a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia. One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at EPASl shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and Han samples, representing the fastest allele frequency change observed at any human gene to date. This SNP's association with erythrocyte abundance supports the role of EPASl in adaptation to hypoxia. Thus, a population genomic survey has revealed a functionally important locus in genetic adaptation to high altitude.

79952253494	Fabrication of porous scaffolds with a controllable microstructure and mechanical properties by porogen fusion technique	Macroporous scaffolds with controllable pore structure and mechanical properties were fabricated by a porogen fusion technique. Biodegradable material poly (D, L-lactide) (PDLLA) was used as the scaffold matrix. The effects of porogen size, PDLLA concentration and hydroxyapatite (HA) content on the scaffold morphology, porosity and mechanical properties were investigated. High porosity (90% and above) and highly interconnected structures were easily obtained and the pore size could be adjusted by varying the porogen size. With the increasing porogen size and PDLLA concentration, the porosity of scaffolds decreases, while its mechanical properties increase. The introduction of HA greatly increases the impact on pore structure, mechanical properties and water absorption ability of scaffolds, while it has comparatively little influence on its porosity under low HA contents. These results show that by adjusting processing parameters, scaffolds could afford a controllable pore size, exhibit suitable pore structure and high porosity, as well as good mechanical properties, and may serve as an excellent substrate for bone tissue engineering. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

79952287365	Evolutionary Transients in the Rice Transcriptome	In the canonical version of evolution by gene duplication, one copy is kept unaltered while the other is free to evolve. This process of evolutionary experimentation can persist for millions of years. Since it is so short lived in comparison to the lifetime of the core genes that make up the majority of most genomes, a substantial fraction of the genome and the transcriptome may-in principle-be attributable to what we will refer to as " evolutionary transients", referring here to both the process and the genes that have gone or are undergoing this process. Using the rice gene set as a test case, we argue that this phenomenon goes a long way towards explaining why there are so many more rice genes than Arabidopsis genes, and why most excess rice genes show low similarity to eudicots. © 2010 Beijing Genomics Institute.

80052266351	Frequent mutations of chromatin remodeling genes in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder	Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is the most common type of bladder cancer. Here we sequenced the exomes of nine individuals with TCC and screened all the somatically mutated genes in a prevalence set of 88 additional individuals with TCC with different tumor stages and grades. In our study, we discovered a variety of genes previously unknown to be mutated in TCC. Notably, we identified genetic aberrations of the chromatin remodeling genes (UTX, MLL-MLL3, CREBBP-EP300, NCOR1, ARID1A and CHD6) in 59% of our 97 subjects with TCC. Of these genes, we showed UTX to be altered substantially more frequently in tumors of low stages and grades, highlighting its potential role in the classification and diagnosis of bladder cancer. Our results provide an overview of the genetic basis of TCC and suggest that aberration of chromatin regulation might be a hallmark of bladder cancer. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

84861815153	Effects of matrine on proliferation and apoptosis in gallbladder carcinoma cells (GBC-SD)	Although matrine, a primary active component of dried Sophora flavescens root (ku shen), is known to induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells in vitro, the molecular mechanism of such apoptosis remains elusive. This analysis of the cell cycle and apoptosis in matrine-treated human gallbladder carcinoma cells (GBC-SD) showed that matrine can indeed inhibit cell proliferation and induce G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. An additional western blot analysis of matrine-treated cells also showed caspase-3 and Bcl-2 activation, as well as cyclinE down-regulation. Overall, the results indicate that matrine perturbs gallbladder cancer cell progression during the G1 phase by down-regulating cyclinE and induces apoptosis by decreasing the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increasing expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax.

84867074831	A metagenome-wide association study of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes	Assessment and characterization of gut microbiota has become a major research area in human disease, including type 2 diabetes, the most prevalent endocrine disease worldwide. To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

42549090878	High-resolution mapping of epigenetic modifications of the rice genome uncovers interplay between DNA methylation, histone methylation, and gene expression	We present high-resolution maps of DNA methylation and H3K4 di- and trimethylation of two entire chromosomes and two fully sequenced centromeres in rice (Oryza sativa) shoots and cultured cells. This analysis reveals combinatorial interactions between these epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure and gene expression. Cytologically densely stained heterochromatin had less H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 and more methylated DNA than the less densely stained euchromatin, whereas centromeres had a unique epigenetic composition. Most transposable elements had highly methylated DNA but no H3K4 methylation, whereas more than half of protein-coding genes had both methylated DNA and di- and/or trimethylated H3K4. Methylation of DNA but not H3K4 was correlated with suppressed transcription. By contrast, when both DNA and H3K4 were methylated, transcription was only slightly reduced. Transcriptional activity was positively correlated with the ratio of H3K4me3/H3K4me2: genes with predominantly H3K4me3 were actively transcribed, whereas genes with predominantly H3K4me2 were transcribed at moderate levels. More protein-coding genes contained all three modifications, and more transposons contained DNA methylation in shoots than cultured cells. Differential epigenetic modifications correlated to tissue-specific expression between shoots and cultured cells. Collectively, this study provides insights into the rice epigenomes and their effect on gene expression and plant development. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.

43249091960	Positive correlation between recombination rate and nucleotide diversity is shown under domestication selection in the chicken genome	Positive correlation between recombination rate and nucleotide diversity has been observed in a wide variety of eukaryotes on megabase scale. On the basis of genome-wide chicken genetic variation map generated by comparing three domestic breeds with wild ancestor and the positions of markers on the genetic linkage map, we found that SNPs rates were similar for all chromosomes while the recombination rates increased in micro chromosomes. In other words no correlation exists in chromosome size. Nevertheless, when we scanned the genome by calculating the values of each characteristic within non-overlapping windows, instead of single value for each chromosomes, the nucleotide diversity was found to be significantly correlated with the recombination rate (r=0.27, P<0.0005). Furthermore, the significant association not only existed between these two features, but also existed between all 6 pairwise combinations of nucleotide diversity, recombination rate, GC content and average gene length. This co-variation is very meaningful for the studies of sequence evolution. © 2008 Science in China Press.

The main assumptions are that these TEs must exist at high copy numbers across the genome and must not be so old that they are no longer recognizable in comparison to their ancestral sequences. Tested on the japonica rice genome, ReAS was able to reconstruct all of the high copy sequences in the Repbase repository of known TEs, and increase the effectiveness of RepeatMasker in identifying TEs from genome sequences. © 2005 Li et al.

55549097849	The diploid genome sequence of an Asian individual	Here we present the first diploid genome sequence of an Asian individual. The genome was sequenced to 36-fold average coverage using massively parallel sequencing technology. We aligned the short reads onto the NCBI human reference genome to 99.97% coverage, and guided by the reference genome, we used uniquely mapped reads to assemble a high-quality consensus sequence for 92% of the Asian individual's genome. We identified approximately 3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inside this region, of which 13.6% were not in the dbSNP database. Genotyping analysis showed that SNP identification had high accuracy and consistency, indicating the high sequence quality of this assembly. We also carried out heterozygote phasing and haplotype prediction against HapMap CHB and JPT haplotypes (Chinese and Japanese, respectively), sequence comparison with the two available individual genomes (J. D. Watson and J. C. Venter), and structural variation identification. These variations were considered for their potential biological impact. Our sequence data and analyses demonstrate the potential usefulness of next-generation sequencing technologies for personal genomics. ©2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

56749180708	Rational therapy for elderly patients aged over 80 with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis	AIM: To evaluate the curative effect and safety of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for patients aged over 80 with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis (AOSC) and to propose the rational therapy. METHODS: Four hundred and thirty nine AOSC patients aged over 80 from January 2001 to December 2007 in our hospital were enrolled and assigned to endoscopic treatment group (n = 279), operative treatment group (n = 94) and conservative treatment group(n = 66) based on their way of management. Data of these three groups regarding complication incidence, mortality rate, hospital stay and admission fee were retrospectively analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The mortality rates were 16.7% and 8.5% in conservative treatment group and operative treatment group, respectively, while 2 cases died and 14 cases lost follow-up in endoscopic treatment group. Complication rate was significantly lower in endoscopic treatment group than operative treatment group (3.9% vs 34.0%, P < 0.01). The mortality rate, hospital stay and admission fee in endoscopic treatment group were significantly lower than operative treatment group and conservative treatment group (0.72% vs 8.5%, 16.7%; 7.3 ± 2.8 d vs 11.4 ± 3.7 d, 15.3 ± 4.9 d; 1.23 ± 0.54 vs 1.55 ± 0.79,1.56 ± 0.84, all P < 0.05). The mortality rate and hospital stay were lower in operative treatment group than conservative treatment group(both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, effective and safe for AOSC patients aged over 80, is a treatment of first choice.

58149204056	Arabidopsis hormone database: A comprehensive genetic and phenotypic information database for plant hormone research in Arabidopsis	Plant hormones are small organic molecules that influence almost every aspect of plant growth and development. Genetic and molecular studies have revealed a large number of genes that are involved in responses to numerous plant hormones, including auxin, gibberellin, cytokinin, abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and brassinosteroid. Here, we develop an Arabidopsis hormone database, which aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive view of genes participating in plant hormonal regulation, as well as morphological phenotypes controlled by plant hormones. Based on data from mutant studies, transgenic analysis and gene ontology (GO) annotation, we have identified a total of 1026 genes in the Arabidopsis genome that participate in plant hormone functions. Meanwhile, a phenotype ontology is developed to precisely describe myriad hormone-regulated morphological processes with standardized vocabularies. A web interface (http://ahd.cbi.pku.edu.cn) would allow users to quickly get access to information about these hormone-related genes, including sequences, functional category, mutant information, phenotypic description, microarray data and linked publications. Several applications of this database in studying plant hormonal regulation and hormone cross-talk will be presented and discussed. © 2008 The Author(s).

Those putative rice P450s are thought to belong to 40 families classified in Arabidopsis thaliana. We compared distributions of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa P450s and found the two species have similar distribution patterns. However, family distributions of two species also have some differences. For example, in rice, the gene number in families of CYP71, CYP72, CYP76, CYP89, CYP94 and CYP709 is more than twice that in Arabidopsis thaliana; and there are 33 CYP705 members in Arabidopsis thaliana but none in rice. We also found gene members in CYP71 and CYP81 are organized as tandem arrays repeated in the rice genome; maybe they are duplications in the evolutionary event. Furthermore, we accumulated expression sequence tag (EST) evidence for 263 putative rice P450s, which are expressed at transcriptional level and more likely to be true P450s.

62749143473	Role of dissection of secondary branches of splenic pedicle in portal hypertension cases undergoing splenectomy	Background: It is well known that conventional splenectomy, which requires careful handling and ligation of tissue of the splenic hilum, can easily cause complications such as splenic fever and pancreatic fistula. Here, we use the technique of dissection of the secondary branches of the splenic pedicle to handle the hilum in the portal hypertension patients who are subjected to splenectomy. Methods: We retrospectively compared and analyzed the complications, postoperative hospital stay, operative time, and occurrence of hemorrhage in 121 patients with portal hypertension undergoing splenectomy and devascularization of the gastric cardia from January 1999 to December 2007. The selected cases consisted of 51 patients undergoing conventional splenectomy and 70 patients undergoing dissection of secondary branches of the splenic pedicle. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between size of the spleen and occurrence of complications. Results: The incidence of pancreatic fistula and splenic fever (0/70 and 9/70) was lower in patients undergoing dissection of secondary branches of the splenic pedicle as compared with that of the conventional group (5/51 and 18/51 respectively). In addition, there was no significant difference in operative time and volume of blood loss between two groups. The spleen thickness of those patients who had pancreatic fistula and splenic fever was significantly greater than those without complications. Conclusions: These results indicate that dissection of secondary branches of the splenic pedicle in portal hypertension patients undergoing splenectomy can decrease the incidence of splenic fever and pancreatic fistula, and shorten the postoperative hospital stay, especially in the patients with a large spleen. So dissection of secondary branches of the splenic pedicle is a valuable technique for splenectomy.

67349125420	Identification of metastasis-associated proteins involved in gallbladder carcinoma metastasis by proteomic analysis and functional exploration of chloride intracellular channel 1	Advanced gallbladder cancer has an extremely poor prognosis because of metastasis. Identification of metastasis-related biomarkers is essential to improve patient survival. In the present study, metastasis-associated proteins were identified by comparative proteomic analysis and the metastasis-related function of the candidate protein, chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1), was further elucidated. Two cell lines with high or low metastatic potential (termed GBC-SD18H and GBC-SD18L, respectively), originating from the same parental gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cell line, were identified by spontaneous metastasis in vivo and characterized by metastatic phenotypes analysis in vitro. Subsequently, a proteomic approach comprised of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis and mass spectroscopy was used to identify and compare the protein expression patterns between GBC-SD18L and GBC-SD18H. Twenty-six proteins were identified and further verified by one-dimensional Western blotting and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. It was determined that CLIC1, ezrin, vimentin, annexin A3, WD repeat domain 1, triosephosphate isomerase, C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, T-complex protein 1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, glutamate dehydrogenase 1, proteasome activator complex subunit 3 and Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor beta were significantly up-regulated in the highly metastatic GBC-SD18H cell line compared to the poorly metastatic GBC-SD18L cell line. However, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 and programmed cell death protein 8 were significantly down-regulated in the highly metastatic GBC-SD18H cell line compared to GBC-SD18L. Considering that CLIC1 was profuse in highly metastatic GBC-SD18H but scarce in poorly metastatic GBC-SD18L, the association of CLIC1 with metastasis was further elucidated by the overexpression and RNA interference of CLIC1 in GBC-SD18L cells and GBC-SD18H cells, respectively. The results demonstrated that the overexpression of CLIC1 promoted cell motility and invasion of GBC-SD18L in vitro, while RNA interference of CLIC1 remarkably decreased cell motility and invasive potency of GBC-SD18H in vitro, indicating that CLIC1 might play an important role in metastasis of gallbladder carcinoma. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

67651227181	Role of regional lymphadenectomy in different stage of gallbladder carcinoma	Background/Aims: Lymph node spread is the most common pattern of progression in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) and is a prognostic factor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the curative effects of radical surgery including different extent of regional lymphadenectomy for patients with different stage of GBC. Methodology: A retrospective study was made of 91 patients who had undergone radical resection and regional lymphadenectomy from January 2001 to December 2006. The curative effects of radical surgery and survival rate were elucidated by different extent of regional lymphadenectomy according to the classification of lymph nodes according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) which is classified into two grades, standard regional lymphadenectomy and extended regional lymphadenectomy. The extent of standard regional lymphadenectomy includes lymph nodes around the cystic duct, pericholedochal and hepatoduodenal ligament. The extent of extended regional lymphadenectomy includes retroportal, posterosuperior pancreaticoduodenal, posteroinferior pancreaticoduodenal, along the common hepatic artery, celiac, superior mesenteric and interaorticocaval lymph nodes. Results: There was no significant difference of survival rates in patients with stage II between the standard regional lymphadenectomy and extended regional lymphadenectomy groups (P=0.109). However, to the patients with stage III and stage IV without distant metastases, when extended regional lymphadenectomy was performed, survival rates were significantly higher than those who received standard regional lymphadenectomy (P=0.009 and P=0.029, respectively). Conclusions: The standard regional lymphadenectomy is enough for the patients with stage II. The extended regional lymphadenectomy should be performed to the patients with stage III and stage IV without distant metastases if the primary lesions can be dissected radically. © H.G.E.

70350134644	Complete resequencing of 40 genomes reveals domestication events and genes in silkworm (Bombyx)	A single-base pair resolution silkworm genetic variation map was constructed from 40 domesticated and wild silkworms, each sequenced to approximately threefold coverage, representing 99.88% of the genome. We identified ∼16 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, many indels, and structural variations. We find that the domesticated silkworms are clearly genetically differentiated from the wild ones, but they have maintained large levels of genetic variability, suggesting a short domestication event involving a large number of individuals. We also identified signals of selection at 354 candidate genes that may have been important during domestication, some of which have enriched expression in the silk gland, midgut, and testis. These data add to our understanding of the domestication processes and may have applications in devising pest control strategies and advancing the use of silkworms as efficient bioreactors.

70649085835	The genome of the cucumber, Cucumis sativus L.	Cucumber is an economically important crop as well as a model system for sex determination studies and plant vascular biology. Here we report the draft genome sequence of Cucumis sativus var. sativus L., assembled using a novel combination of traditional Sanger and next-generation Illumina GA sequencing technologies to obtain 72.2-fold genome coverage. The absence of recent whole-genome duplication, along with the presence of few tandem duplications, explains the small number of genes in the cucumber. Our study establishes that five of the cucumber's seven chromosomes arose from fusions of ten ancestral chromosomes after divergence from Cucumis melo. The sequenced cucumber genome affords insight into traits such as its sex expression, disease resistance, biosynthesis of cucurbitacin and 'fresh green' odor. We also identify 686 gene clusters related to phloem function. The cucumber genome provides a valuable resource for developing elite cultivars and for studying the evolution and function of the plant vascular system. © 2009 Nature America, Inc.

71949084182	Somatostatin enhances the chemosensitivity of GBC-SD cell line to doxorubicin through arresting the cell cycle to S phase rather than through the p53/Bax-depended apoptosis way in vitro	Background/Aims: As one of the mostly aggressive and fatal malignancy, gallbladder carcinoma has been known to be resistant to many anticancer drugs. Although it is under active investigation, it is still difficult to achieve satisfactory effect for most chemo-drugs on this tumor. It has previously reported that somatostatin could increase the chemosensitivity of gallbladder carcinoma cells (GBC-SD) and reduce the therapeutic dose of Doxorubicin in killing GBC-SD cells. SST could enhance the chemosensitivity of gallbladder carcinoma to Doxorubincin (DOX) by transient arresting cell cycle to S phase. We tried to clarify the mechanism by which SST utilized to enhance the chemosensitivity of GBC-SD cells to DOX. We further investigated whether the enhanced chemosensitivity of GBC-SD cells to DOX in the presence of SST is via apoptosis or cell cycle regulation. In addition, we also looked into related factors involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Methodology: Twenty-four hours after somatostatin treatment, doxorubicin was gradually added and the growth curve of GBC-SD cells was determined according to MTT test. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry (FCM) using Annexin V/ Propidium Iodide Binding. Cell cycle was also examined by FCM. The somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes in GBC-SD cells were identified using immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR assay. The expressions of p53, Bax and phosphorylated RB (pRB) protein were examined using western blotting assay. Results: When GBC-SD cells were treated with SST alone, no significant cell growth inhibition and cell apoptosis were observed. SST could induce a transient S phase arrest in GBC-SD cells. The mRNA expression of SSTR1, 2, 3, 4, 5 were all detected in GBC-SD cells, whereas only SSTR1, 2, 3 were detected in GBC-SD cells using immunocytochemistry assay. After GBC-SD cells were treated with SST for 24h, the expression level of p53 and Bax protein in GBC-SD cells was similar to that of the control group, however up-regulated pRB protein expression was observed (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggested that the synergistic inhibitory effect of somatostatin and doxorubicin co-treatment on GBC-SD cells was not due to SST induced apoptosis concerning the expression of p53 and Bax protein. Our data clearly showed all 5 SST receptor subtypes expressed in GBC-SD cells by RT-PCR and 3 SST receptors by immunocytochemistry. Accumulated evidence has been proved the relationship between cell cycle regulation and RB protein phosphorylation. In the chemosensitized GBC-SD cell line treated with SST, phosphorylated RB and cell cycle arrest were simultaneously manifested. We reasoned that somatostatin might enhance the chemosensitivity of GBC-SD cells to doxorubin through arresting the cell cycle at S phase, but not P53 and Bax protein induced cell apoptosis. © H.G.E.

74049090046	Building the sequence map of the human pan-genome	Here we integrate the de novo assembly of an Asian and an African genome with the NCBI reference human genome, as a step toward constructing the human pan-genome. We identified ∼5 Mb of novel sequences not present in the reference genome in each of these assemblies. Most novel sequences are individual or population specific, as revealed by their comparison to all available human DNA sequence and by PCR validation using the human genome diversity cell line panel. We found novel sequences present in patterns consistent with known human migration paths. Cross-species conservation analysis of predicted genes indicated that the novel sequences contain potentially functional coding regions. We estimate that a complete human pan-genome would contain 19-40Mb of novel sequence not present in the extant reference genome. The extensive amount of novel sequence contributing to the genetic variation of the pan-genome indicates the importance of using complete genome sequencing and de novo assembly. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.

75149155568	The sequence and de novo assembly of the giant panda genome	Using next-generation sequencing technology alone, we have successfully generated and assembled a draft sequence of the giant panda genome. The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

75649124547	De novo assembly of human genomes with massively parallel short read sequencing	Next-generation massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies provide ultrahigh throughput at a substantially lower unit data cost; however, the data are very short read length sequences, making de novo assembly extremely challenging. Here, we describe a novel method for de novo assembly of large genomes from short read sequences. We successfully assembled both the Asian and African human genome sequences, achieving an N50 contig size of 7.4 and 5.9 kilobases (kb) and scaffold of 446.3 and 61.9 kb, respectively. The development of this de novo short read assembly method creates new opportunities for building reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost-effective way. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

77950251400	A human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing	To understand the impact of gut microbes on human health and well-being it is crucial to assess their genetic potential. Here we describe the Illumina-based metagenomic sequencing, assembly and characterization of 3.3 million non-redundant microbial genes, derived from 576.7 gigabases of sequence, from faecal samples of 124 European individuals. The gene set, 150 times larger than the human gene complement, contains an overwhelming majority of the prevalent (more frequent) microbial genes of the cohort and probably includes a large proportion of the prevalent human intestinal microbial genes. The genes are largely shared among individuals of the cohort. Over 99% of the genes are bacterial, indicating that the entire cohort harbours between 1,000 and 1,150 prevalent bacterial species and each individual at least 160 such species, which are also largely shared. We define and describe the minimal gut metagenome and the minimal gut bacterial genome in terms of functions present in all individuals and most bacteria, respectively. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

77951871117	Deep RNA sequencing at single base-pair resolution reveals high complexity of the rice transcriptome	Understanding the dynamics of eukaryotic transcriptome is essential for studying the complexity of transcriptional regulation and its impact on phenotype. However, comprehensive studies of transcriptomes at single base resolution are rare, even for modern organisms, and lacking for rice. Here, we present the first transcriptome atlas for eight organs of cultivated rice. Using high-throughput paired-end RNA-seq, we unambiguously detected transcripts expressing at an extremely low level, as well as a substantial number of novel transcripts, exons, and untranslated regions. An analysis of alternative splicing in the rice transcriptome revealed that alternative cis-splicing occurred in ;33% of all rice genes. This is far more than previously reported. In addition, we also identified 234 putative chimeric transcripts that seem to be produced by transsplicing, indicating that transcript fusion events are more common than expected. In-depth analysis revealed a multitude of fusion transcripts that might be by-products of alternative splicing. Validation and chimeric transcript structural analysis provided evidence that some of these transcripts are likely to be functional in the cell. Taken together, our data provide extensive evidence that transcriptional regulation in rice is vastly more complex than previously believed. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

77954032171	Reactive oxygen species-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to cirsimaritin-induced apoptosis in human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells	In this study, the anticancer effect of cirsimaritin, a natural flavonoid, against human gallbladder carcinoma cell line GBC-SD and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Cirsimaritin inhibited the growth of tumor cells and induced mitochondrial apoptosis in GBC-SD cells. In addition, cirsimaritin triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and down-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt, while knock-down of CHOP dramatically abrogated the inactivation of Akt and reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of cirsimaritin. Furthermore, cirsimaritin provoked the generation of reactive oxygen species in GBC-SD cells, while the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine almost completely blocked the activation of ER stress and apoptosis, suggesting cirsimaritin-induced reactive oxygen species is an early event that triggers ER stress mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in GBC-SD cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77956436169	The mechanisms of somatostatin induced enhanced chemosensitivity of gallbladder cancer cell line to doxorubicin: Cell cycle modulation plus target enzyme up-regulation	Background: Gallbladder carcinoma is known to be an aggressive malignancy and nonsensitive to routine chemotherapy. Its prognosis is quite poor. We have illustrated that somatostatin (SST) can enhance chemosensitivity of gallbladder cancer to Doxorubicin (DOX) in our precious studies. Here, we explored the possible mechanisms by which SST used to enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX on gallbladder carcinoma cell line. Methods: Human gallbladder cancer cells line (GBC-SD cell line) were divided into four groups: control group, SST group, DOX group, SST. +. DOX co-treated-group. Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell apoptosis index was detected by using Annexin V/Propidium Iodide Binding on FCM. The expressions of certain key cell cycle-related factors, including retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and E2F-1 protein were investigated by western blotting. ICBP90 protein, which could be a new downstream effector of E2F-1, was also detected by western blotting. The expression of Topo IIα protein, target enzyme of DOX, was assessed in synchronized GBC-SD cells by western blotting. Results: After 24 h treatment with SST alone, cell cycle was arrested at S phase in GBC-SD cells line, followed by indistinctive increment of apoptosis index. After 24 h treatment with SST and DOX, apoptosis index significantly increased than that of DOX alone (P<0.05). Compared with control group, the expressions of Rb and E2F-1 protein were significantly up-regulated at 24 h after treatment with SST. Similarly, the expressions of ICBP90 and Topo IIα protein were also enhanced at 24 h after treatment with SST. Conclusion: These results suggested that SST could induce cell cycle block in S phase in GBC-SD cells line, the most sensitive phase of the cell cycle for DOX, through up-regulating Rb, E2F-1 and ICBP90 protein expression. Furthermore, ICBP90 induced the enhanced expression of Topo IIα protein which is the target enzyme of DOX and enhanced its cytotoxic effect on GBC-SD cells. We concluded that the mechanisms of SST enhanced chemosensitivity of GBC-SD cell line to DOX might be cell cycle arrest plus up-regulated target enzyme. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

77957932118	Icariin, a natural flavonol glycoside, induces apoptosis in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells via a ROS/JNK-dependent mitochondrial pathway	In this study, the anticancer effect of icariin, a natural flavonol glycoside, against human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Icariin triggered the mitochondrial/caspase apoptotic pathway indicated by enhanced Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase cascade. Moreover, icariin induced a sustained activation of the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 and ERK1/2, and SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) almost reversed icariin-induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. In addition, icariin provoked the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SMMC-7721 cells, while the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine almost completely blocked icariin-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that icariin induces apoptosis through a ROS/JNK-dependent mitochondrial pathway. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77958481575	Correlation between sequence conservation and structural thermodynamics of microRNA precursors from human, mouse, and chicken genomes	Abstract. Background. Previous studies have shown that microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) have considerably more stable secondary structures than other native RNAs (tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA) and artificial RNA sequences. However, pre-miRNAs with ultra stable secondary structures have not been investigated. It is not known if there is a tendency in pre-miRNA sequences towards or against ultra stable structures? Furthermore, the relationship between the structural thermodynamic stability of pre-miRNA and their evolution remains unclear. Results. We investigated the correlation between pre-miRNA sequence conservation and structural stability as measured by adjusted minimum folding free energies in pre-miRNAs isolated from human, mouse, and chicken. The analysis revealed that conserved and non-conserved pre-miRNA sequences had structures with similar average stabilities. However, the relatively ultra stable and unstable pre-miRNAs were more likely to be non-conserved than pre-miRNAs with moderate stability. Non-conserved pre-miRNAs had more G+C than A+U nucleotides, while conserved pre-miRNAs contained more A+U nucleotides. Notably, the U content of conserved pre-miRNAs was especially higher than that of non-conserved pre-miRNAs. Further investigations showed that conserved and non-conserved pre-miRNAs exhibited different structural element features, even though they had comparable levels of stability. Conclusions. We proposed that there is a correlation between structural thermodynamic stability and sequence conservation for pre-miRNAs from human, mouse, and chicken genomes. Our analyses suggested that pre-miRNAs with relatively ultra stable or unstable structures were less favoured by natural selection than those with moderately stable structures. Comparison of nucleotide compositions between non-conserved and conserved pre-miRNAs indicated the importance of U nucleotides in the pre-miRNA evolutionary process. Several characteristic structural elements were also detected in conserved pre-miRNAs. © 2010 Ni et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78650719843	Mda-7/IL-24 induces apoptosis in human GBC-SD gallbladder carcinoma cells via mitochondrial apoptotic pathway	mda-7/IL-24 has tumor-suppressor activity in a broad spectrum of human cancer cells. However, the therapeutic effect of the recombinant human IL-24 protein on human gallbladder carcinoma has rarely been explored. In this study, we used a human gallbladder carcinoma cell line (GBC-SD) to explore the effect of adenovirus-mediated IL-24 (Ad-IL24) gene therapy on GBC-SD cells. We show that Ad-IL24 treatment of GBC-SD cells in vitro conspicuously induced apoptosis of GBC-SD cells. We also demonstrate that the in vivo treatment of GBC tumor-bearing athymic nude mice intratumorally injected with Ad-IL24 significantly suppressed GBC growth. To further explore the mechanism that mda-7/IL-24 utilized in tumor cell apoptosis, we examined molecules and pathways involved in apoptotic regulation and found that Ad-IL24 induced the downregulation of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and the release of cytochrome c, which subsequently activated caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP to induce apoptosis. In summary, adenovirus (AdV)-mediated IL-24 overexpression exerted potent antitumor activity via stimulating mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in GBC-SD. Therefore, mda-7/IL-24 has the potential to serve as a tool for targeted gene therapy in the treatment of gallbladder cancer.

0035677334	A draft sequence of the rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica) genome	The sequence of the rice genome holds fundamental information for its biology, including physiology, genetics, development, and evolution, as well as information on many beneficial phenotypes of economic significance. Using a "whole genome shotgun" approach, we have produced a draft rice genome sequence of Oryza sativa ssp. indica, the major crop rice subspecies in China and many other regions of Asia. The draft genome sequence is constructed from over4.3 million successful sequencing traces with an accumulative total length of 2214.9 Mb. The initial assembly of the non-redundant sequences reached 409.76 Mb in length, based on3.30 million successful sequencing traces with a total length of 1797.4 Mb from an indica variant cultivar 93-11, giving an estimated coverage of 95.29% of the rice genome with an average base accuracy of higher than 99%. The coverage of the draft sequence, the randomness of the sequence distribution, and the consistency of BIG-ASSEMBLER, a custom-designed software package used for the initial assembly, were verified rigorously by comparisons against finished BAC clone sequences from both indica and japanica strains, available from the public databases. Over all, 96.3% of full-length cDNAs, 96.4% of STS, STR, RFLP markers, 94.0% of ESTs and 94.9% unigene clusters were identified from the draft sequence. Our preliminary analysis on the data set shows that our rice draft sequence is consistent with the comman standard accepted by the genome sequencing community. The unconditional release of the draft to the public also undoubtedly provides a fundamental resource to the international scientific communities to facilitate genomic and genetic studies on rice biology.

79961181124	Structural variation in two human genomes mapped at single-nucleotide resolution by whole genome de novo assembly	Here we use whole-genome de novo assembly of second-generation sequencing reads to map structural variation (SV) in an Asian genome and an African genome. Our approach identifies small-and intermediate-size homozygous variants (1-50 kb) including insertions, deletions, inversions and their precise breakpoints, and in contrast to other methods, can resolve complex rearrangements. In total, we identified 277,243 SVs ranging in length from 1-23 kb. Validation using computational and experimental methods suggests that we achieve overall <6% false-positive rate and <10% false-negative rate in genomic regions that can be assembled, which outperforms other methods. Analysis of the SVs in the genomes of 106 individuals sequenced as part of the 1000 Genomes Project suggests that SVs account for a greater fraction of the diversity between individuals than do single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These findings demonstrate that whole-genome de novo assembly is a feasible approach to deriving more comprehensive maps of genetic variation. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

80054952939	Wogonin, an active ingredient of Chinese herb medicine Scutellaria baicalensis, inhibits the mobility and invasion of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells by inducing the expression of maspin	Ethnopharmacological relevance: A traditional Chinese medicine Scutellaria baicalensis is prescribed for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases and tumors in clinic in China. However, the detailed mechanism of anti-metastasis effect of wogonin, a main active ingredient of Scutellaria baicalensis, remains elusive. Aim of the study: The present study was designed to investigate the action and mechanism of wogonin on the mobility and invasion of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells. Materials and methods: Viability, apoptosis, mRNA and protein expression of tumor cells were analyzed by MTT, Annexin V staining, real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The migration and invasion assay was used to evaluate the anti-metastasis effect of wogonin. Knockdown of maspin was performed by specific small interference RNA. Results: Wogonin at the dose of 1-10 μM, which did not induce apoptosis, significantly inhibited the mobility and invasion activity of human gallbladder carcinoma GBC-SD cells. In addition, the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) but not phosphorylated Akt were dramatically suppressed by wogonin in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the metastasis suppressor maspin was confirmed as the downstream target of wogonin. Both maspin mRNA and protein were upregulated by wogonin. Interestingly, the knockdown of maspin resulted in almost completely blocking of wogonin-induced inhibition of MMP-2, MMP-9 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 as well as the mobility and invasion activity of GBC-SD cells. Conclusions: These findings suggest that wogonin inhibits cell mobility and invasion by upregulating the metastasis suppressor maspin. Together, these data provide novel insights into the chemoprotective effect of wogonin, a main active ingredient of Chinese medicine Scutellaria baicalensis. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Notably, we detected frequent mutations in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (UMPP), and alterations in the UMPP were significantly associated with overexpression of HIF1α and HIF2α in the tumors (P = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). Our findings highlight the potential contribution of UMPP to ccRCC tumorigenesis through the activation of the hypoxia regulatory network.

84655176663	Evaluation of two modified ECF regimens in the treatment of advanced gallbladder cancer	Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease and it is associated with a poor clinical outcome and survival. A standard therapy for it has not been established yet. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of two modified ECF regimens in advanced gallbladder cancer patients. Clinical data of 38 patients with advanced gallbladder cancer treated with modified ECF regimen were reviewed retrospectively. Of them, 21 patients received an epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU/LV combination therapy. Seventeen patients received a chemotherapy of epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine. Partial response was achieved in fourteen (36.84%) patients with a median duration of 5 months (range, 3-13 months), while stable disease was achieved in eight patients (21.05%). The median time to progression was 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.62-4.58 months). And the median overall survival was 9.8 months (95% CI, 7.26-12.34 months). Responders demonstrated better survival than non-responders (median survival time: 16 vs. 6.9 months, P = 0.008). The median survival time for epirubicin-, cisplatin- and capecitabine-treated patients was 9.2 versus 8.9 months for epirubicin-, cisplatin- and 5-FU/LV-treated patients. There was no statistical difference between both treatment groups in terms of survival time (P = 0.769). Regimen-related toxicity resulted in at least one treatment delay or dosage reduction in 63.2 and 34.2% patients, respectively. There were no chemotherapy-related deaths during the study. Modified ECF regimen with epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU/LV or substituting capecitabine for 5-FU/LV is still a potentially effective therapeutic chemotherapy for patients with advanced gallbladder cancer, and toxicity was manageable. There was no remarkable difference in efficacy between the two regimens. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84862929921	Vimentin significantly promoted gallbladder carcinoma metastasis	Background The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) metastasis has not been fully elucidated. Methods In the present study, metastasis-associated proteins were identified by comparative proteomic analysis. The functional study of the candidate protein vimentin was further investigated. First, a pair of higher and lower metastatic sublines (termed GBC-SD/M3 and GBC-SD, respectively), originated from the same parental cell line, was screened by spontaneous tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo in animal study and further characterized by metastatic phenotypes analysis in vitro. Subsequently, a proteomic approach comprised two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis and mass spectroscopy was used to identify and compare the protein expression patterns between higher metastatic GBC-SD/M3 and lower metastatic GBC-SD cell lines. Then twenty-six proteins were identified. Results Among the 26 proteins identified, fourteen proteins were up-regulated and 12 proteins were down-regulated in GBC-SD/M3. Vimentin was identified and found to be overexpressed in GBC-SD/M3 as compared with GBC-SD. This result was further confirmed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis. Furthermore, the cell migration and invasion potency of GBC-SD/M3 in vitro was remarkably suppressed after small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of vimentin. Moreover, immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis on 12 human GBC specimens showed consistently increased vimentin expression in metastases compared with primary tumors. Conclusion Tumor vimentin level may reflect the pathological progression in some GBC and may be a useful marker for predicting tumor metastasis and a therapeutic target for the treatment of GBC patients with metastases.

84865266794	Self-organizing approach for the human gut meta-genome	We extend the self-organizing approach for annotation of a bacterial genome to analyzing the raw sequencing data of the human gut metagenome without sequence assembling. The original approach divides the genomic sequence of a bacterium into non-overlapping segments of equal length and assigns to each segment one of seven 'phases', among which one is for the noncoding regions, three for the direct coding regions to indicate the three possible codon positions of the segment starting site, and three for the reverse coding regions. The noncoding phase and the six coding phases are described by two frequency tables of the 64 triplet types or 'codon usages'. A set of codon usages can be used to update the phase assignment and vice versa. After an initialization of phase assignment or codon usage tables, an iteration leads to a convergent phase assignment to give an annotation of the genome. In the extension of the approach to a metagenome, we consider a mixture model of a number of categories of genomes. The Illumina Genome Analyzer sequencing data of the total DNA from faecal samples are then examined to understand the diversity of the human gut microbiome. © Zhu et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

The genome was 466 megabases in size, with an estimated 46,022 to 55,615 genes. Functional coverage in the assembled sequences was 92.0%. About 42.2% of the genome was in exact 20-nucleotide oligomer repeats, and most of the transposons were in the intergenic regions between genes. Although 80.6% of predicted Arabidopsis thaliana genes had a homolog in rice, only 49.4% of predicted rice genes had a homolog in A. thaliana. The large proportion of rice genes with no recognizable homologs is due to a gradient in the GC content of rice coding sequences.

It is composed of a stable region encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (composed of 2 ORFs) and a variable region representing 4 CDSs (coding sequences) for viral structural genes (the S, E, M, N proteins) and 5 PUPs (putative uncharacterized proteins). Its gene order is identical to that of other known coronaviruses. The sequence alignment with all known RNA viruses places this virus as a member in the family of Coronaviridae. Thirty putative substitutions have been identified by comparative analysis of the 5 SARS-associatcd virus genome sequences in GenBank. Fifteen of them lead to possible amino acid changes (non-synonymous mutations) in the proteins. Three amino acid changes, with predicted alteration of physical and chemical features, have been detected in the S protein that is postulated to be involved in the immunoreactions between the virus and its host. Two amino acid changes have been detected in the M protein, which could be related to viral envelope formation. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the possibility of non-human origin of the SARS-associated viruses but provides no evidence that they are man-made. Further efforts should focus on identifying the etiology of the SARS-associated virus and ruling out conclusively the existence of other possible SARS-related pathogen(s).

84868693127	Differential gene expression profiles of gastric cancer	Objective: To explore the different gene expressions of normal versus tumor tissues of gastric cancer at molecular levels. Methods: Gene chip technology was used to determine the differentially expressed genes between gastric cancer (n = 12) and normal tissues (n = 12) from December 2009 to June 2010 of Xinhua Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. And reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed to validate the results of gene chip analysis. Results: Sixty-nine up-regulated genes and 80 down-regulated genes were identified by significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). And these genes were correlated with cell adhesion, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis, et al. They were also closely correlated with the signaling pathways of Wnt (1/151, 0.66%) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (2/76, 2.63%). The differential expressions of ATP4A, CLDN10, OLFM4, SAA1 and PROK2 were confirmed by RT-PCR (0.94 ± 0.19 vs 4.33 ± 0.39, 1.00 ± 0.14 vs 3.04 ± 0.26, 5.37 ± 0.30 vs 1.02 ± 0.14, 4.37 ± 0.30 vs 0.95 ± 0.29, 2.62 ± 0.54 vs 1.35 ± 0.35, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: The classifier genes identified in this study may be closely correlated with the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.

84870175220	Noninvasive Fetal Trisomy (NIFTY) test: An advanced noninvasive prenatal diagnosis methodology for fetal autosomal and sex chromosomal aneuploidies	Background: Conventional prenatal screening tests, such as maternal serum tests and ultrasound scan, have limited resolution and accuracy. Methods. We developed an advanced noninvasive prenatal diagnosis method based on massively parallel sequencing. The Noninvasive Fetal Trisomy (NIFTY) test, combines an optimized Student's t-test with a locally weighted polynomial regression and binary hypotheses. We applied the NIFTY test to 903 pregnancies and compared the diagnostic results with those of full karyotyping. Results: 16 of 16 trisomy 21, 12 of 12 trisomy 18, two of two trisomy 13, three of four 45, X, one of one XYY and two of two XXY abnormalities were correctly identified. But one false positive case of trisomy 18 and one false negative case of 45, X were observed. The test performed with 100% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity for autosomal aneuploidies and 85.7% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity for sex chromosomal aneuploidies. Compared with three previously reported z-score approaches with/without GC-bias removal and with internal control, the NIFTY test was more accurate and robust for the detection of both autosomal and sex chromosomal aneuploidies in fetuses. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a powerful and reliable methodology for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. © 2012 Jiang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84870688045	Clinical application of massively parallel sequencing-based prenatal noninvasive fetal trisomy test for trisomies 21 and 18 in 11105 pregnancies with mixed risk factors	Objective: To report the performance of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) based prenatal noninvasive fetal trisomy test based on cell-free DNA sequencing from maternal plasma in a routine clinical setting in China. Method: The MPS-based test was offered as a prenatal screening test for trisomies 21 and 18 to pregnant women in 49 medical centers over 2years. A total of 11263 participants were recruited and the MPS-based test was performed in 11105 pregnancies. Fetal outcome data were obtained after the expected date of confinement. Results: One hundred ninety cases were classified as positive, including 143 cases of trisomy 21 and 47 cases of trisomy 18. With the karyotyping results and the feedback of fetal outcome data, we observed one false positive case of trisomy 21, one false positive case of trisomy 18 and no false negative cases, indicating 100% sensitivity and 99.96% specificity for the detection of trisomies 21 and 18. Conclusion: Our large-scale multicenter study proved that the MPS-based test is of high sensitivity and specificity in detecting fetal trisomies 21 and 18. The introduction of this screening test into a routine clinical setting could avoid about 98% of invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84870364608	The Combined Effects of Hematoporphyrin Monomethyl Ether-SDT and Doxorubicin on the Proliferation of QBC939 Cell Lines	It is well established that both hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether-sonodynamic therapy (HMME-SDT) and doxorubicin (DOX) can induce cell apoptosis but each alone has its own limitations. To date, the combined effects of HMME-SDT and DOX on inducing cell apoptosis are little known and the mechanism for the combined effects remains poorly understood. In the present study, we reported the synergistic effects of HMME-SDT and DOX on inhibiting the proliferation of human cholangiocarcinoma QBC939 cells and investigated the mechanism of this synergy. The data from MTT assay, flow cytometer, Hoechst staining and cell arrest analysis showed that the combination of HMME-SDT and DOX exhibited higher inhibiting effects on proliferation of QBC939 cells than the sole application of HMME-SDT or DOX. In addition, the synergistic effects were shown to result from the DNA damage as demonstrated by single cell gel electrophoresis and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, the expression of p53, Fas, Bax and activated caspase-3 protein was significantly upregulated in cells treated with HMME-SDT and DOX, whereas Bcl-2 protein was downregulated. Taken together, our data suggested that the application of HMME-SDT combined with DOX had better inhibiting effects on QBC939 cells and the effects were caused mainly by DNA damage. © 2013 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84871692397	Characteristic gene expression profiles in the progression from normal gastric epithelial cells to moderate gastric epithelial dysplasia and to gastric cancer	Background Gastric cancer ranks high among the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. This study was designed to explore key genes involved in the progression of normal gastric epithelial cells to moderate gastric epithelial dysplasia (mGED) and to gastric cancer. Methods Twelve pairs of mGED tissues, gastric cancer tissues, and normal gastric tissues were collected by gastroscopy Total RNA was then extracted and purified. After the addition of fluorescent tags, hybridization was carried out on a Gene chip microarray slide. Significance analysis of microarrays was performed to determine significant differences in gene expression between the different tissue types. Results Microarray data analysis revealed totally 34 genes that were expressed differently: 18 highly expressed (fold change >2; P <0.01) and 16 down-regulated (fold change >2; P <0.01). Of the 34 genes, 24 belonged to several different functional categories such as structural molecule activity, extracellular regions, structural formation, cell death, biological adhesion, developmental processes, locomotion, and biological regulation that were associated with cancer. The remaining 10 genes were not involved in cancer research. Of these genes, the expression levels of Matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12), Caspase-associated recruitment domain 14 (CARD14), and Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) were confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. A two-way clustering algorithm divided the 36 samples into three categories and the overall correct classification efficiency was 80.6% (29/36). Almost all of these genes (31/34) showed constant changes in the process of normal gastric epithelial cells to mGED to gastric cancer. Conclusions The results of this study provided global gene expression profiles during the development and progression from normal gastric epithelial cells to mGED to gastric cancer. These data may provide new insights into the molecular pathology of gastric cancer which may be useful for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

84871461165	Somatostatin enhanced anti-tumor effect of doxorubicin on gallbladder caner cells through the regulation of intracellular drug concentration	Objective: To investigate the possible mechanisms by which Somatostatin (SST) enhances the anti-tumor effect of doxorubicin (DOX) on gallbladder cancer cells. Methods: GBC-SD cells were grouped into 4 groups: SST-treated group, DOX-treated group, SST + DOX co-treated group and control group. The concentrations of SST and DOX were 75 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml based on our previous studies. In control group, cells were cultivated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In experimental groups, cells were cultivated with medium and the corresponding drugs. After drug treatment, cell viability was examined by MTT assay at 6, 12, 24 and 36 h respectively. Meanwhile, intracellular concentrations of doxorubicin in each group was determined by microspectrofluorimetry; Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the expressions of MDR1 mRNA in the cells at different time points and the expressions of P-gp protein, a product of MDR1 mRNA, were determined by Western blot analysis. Results: SST did not exhibit significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of GBC-SD cells as compared to that of control group (P > 0.05). SST + DOX co-treatment group and DOX showed significantly inhibitory effect on the growth of GBC-SD cells at Hour 12 post-treatment. However no statistical difference was found between SST + DOX and DOX groups. Interestingly, at Hour 24 post-treatment, SST + DOX group showed more robust inhibitory effect on GBC-SD cells as compared to DOX alone group. Moreover, SST could significantly down-regulate the expressions of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp protein. SST could increase intracellular DOX concentration. And the difference of intracellular DOX concentration between SST + DOX group and DOX group at Hour 24 was statistically significant. Conclusions: In our experiment, SST decreases the expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp protein so as to reduce the efflux of DOX and elevate DOX concentrations in GBC-SD cells. This eventually leads to enhanced cytotoxic effects of DOX on GBC-SD cells.

84872014533	A role for p21-activated kinase 7 in the development of gastric cancer	p21-activated kinase (PAK)7 (also known as PAK5) is a member of the group B PAK family of serine/threonine protein kinases, which are effectors of the small GTPases Rac and CDC42. PAK7 can promote neurite outgrowth, induce microtubule stabilization, and activate cell survival signaling pathways. However, the role of PAK7 in cancer is still poorly understood. Here, we showed that PAK7 expression was upregulated in different gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues, as compared with human embryonic kidney 293 cells and adjacent normal tissues, respectively. The results suggested that PAK7 expression was related to gastric cancer progression. Thus, we employed lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA to inhibit PAK7 expression, to investigate the role of PAK7 in human gastric carcinogenesis. RNA interference efficiently downregulated expression of PAK7 in SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of PAK7 inhibited human gastric cancer cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest in G

84874937689	Comparative genomics of parasitic silkworm microsporidia reveal an association between genome expansion and host adaptation	Background: Microsporidian Nosema bombycis has received much attention because the pébrine disease of domesticated silkworms results in great economic losses in the silkworm industry. So far, no effective treatment could be found for pébrine. Compared to other known Nosema parasites, N. bombycis can unusually parasitize a broad range of hosts. To gain some insights into the underlying genetic mechanism of pathological ability and host range expansion in this parasite, a comparative genomic approach is conducted. The genome of two Nosema parasites, N. bombycis and N. antheraeae (an obligatory parasite to undomesticated silkworms Antheraea pernyi), were sequenced and compared with their distantly related species, N. ceranae (an obligatory parasite to honey bees).Results: Our comparative genomics analysis show that the N. bombycis genome has greatly expanded due to the following three molecular mechanisms: 1) the proliferation of host-derived transposable elements, 2) the acquisition of many horizontally transferred genes from bacteria, and 3) the production of abundnant gene duplications. To our knowledge, duplicated genes derived not only from small-scale events (e.g., tandem duplications) but also from large-scale events (e.g., segmental duplications) have never been seen so abundant in any reported microsporidia genomes. Our relative dating analysis further indicated that these duplication events have arisen recently over very short evolutionary time. Furthermore, several duplicated genes involving in the cytotoxic metabolic pathway were found to undergo positive selection, suggestive of the role of duplicated genes on the adaptive evolution of pathogenic ability.Conclusions: Genome expansion is rarely considered as the evolutionary outcome acting on those highly reduced and compact parasitic microsporidian genomes. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that the parasitic genomes can expand, instead of shrink, through several common molecular mechanisms such as gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and transposable element expansion. We also showed that the duplicated genes can serve as raw materials for evolutionary innovations possibly contributing to the increase of pathologenic ability. Based on our research, we propose that duplicated genes of N. bombycis should be treated as primary targets for treatment designs against pébrine. © 2013 Pan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84876100471	Haplotype-assisted accurate non-invasive fetal whole genome recovery through maternal plasma sequencing	Background: The applications of massively parallel sequencing technology to fetal cell-free DNA (cff-DNA) have brought new insight to non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. However, most previous research based on maternal plasma sequencing has been restricted to fetal aneuploidies. To detect specific parentally inherited mutations, invasive approaches to obtain fetal DNA are the current standard in the clinic because of the experimental complexity and resource consumption of previously reported non-invasive approaches.Methods: Here, we present a simple and effective non-invasive method for accurate fetal genome recovery-assisted with parental haplotypes. The parental haplotype were firstly inferred using a combination strategy of trio and unrelated individuals. Assisted with the parental haplotype, we then employed a hidden Markov model to non-invasively recover the fetal genome through maternal plasma sequencing.Results: Using a sequence depth of approximately 44X against a an approximate 5.69% cff-DNA concentration, we non-invasively inferred fetal genotype and haplotype under different situations of parental heterozygosity. Our data show that 98.57%, 95.37%, and 98.45% of paternal autosome alleles, maternal autosome alleles, and maternal chromosome X in the fetal haplotypes, respectively, were recovered accurately. Additionally, we obtained efficient coverage or strong linkage of 96.65% of reported Mendelian-disorder genes and 98.90% of complex disease-associated markers.Conclusions: Our method provides a useful strategy for non-invasive whole fetal genome recovery. © 2013 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84878135436	A method for noninvasive detection of fetal large deletions/duplications by low coverage massively parallel sequencing	Objective: To report the feasibility of fetal chromosomal deletion/duplication detection using a novel bioinformatic method of low coverage whole genome sequencing of maternal plasma. Method: A practical method Fetal Copy-number Analysis through Maternal Plasma Sequencing (FCAPS), integrated with GC-bias correction, binary segmentation algorithm and dynamic threshold strategy, was developed to detect fetal chromosomal deletions/duplications of >10Mb by low coverage whole genome sequencing (about 0.08-fold). The sensitivity/specificity of the resultant FCAPS algorithm in detecting deletions/duplications was firstly assessed in silico and then tested in 1311 maternal plasma samples from those with known G-banding karyotyping results of the fetus. Results: Deletions/duplications, ranged from 9.01 to 28.46Mb, were suspected in four of the 1311 samples, of which three were consistent with the results of fetal karyotyping. In one case, the suspected abnormality was not confirmed by karyotyping, representing a false positive case. No false negative case was observed in the remaining 1307 low-risk samples. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of >10-Mb chromosomal deletions/duplications were100% and 99.92%, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated FCAPS has the potential to detect fetal large deletions/duplications (>10Mb) with low coverage maternal plasma DNA sequencing currently used for fetal aneuploidy detection. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84886258354	HIVID: An efficient method to detect HBV integration using low coverage sequencing	We reported HIVID (high-throughput Viral Integration Detection), a novel experimental and computational method to detect the location of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) integration breakpoints in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) genome. In this method, the fragments with HBV sequence were enriched by a set of HBV probes and then processed to high-throughput sequencing. In order to evaluate the performance of HIVID, we compared the results of HIVID with that of whole genome sequencing method (WGS) in 28 HCC tumors. We detected a total of 246 HBV integration breakpoints in HCC genome, 113 out of which were within 400. bp upstream or downstream of 125 breakpoints identified by WGS method, covering 89.3% (125/140) of total breakpoints. The integration was located in the gene TERT, MLL4, and CCNE1. In addition, we discovered 133 novel breakpoints missed by WGS method, with 66.7% (10/15) of validation rate. Our study shows HIVID is a cost-effective methodology with high specificity and sensitivity to identify viral integration in human genome. © 2013.

84893166349	Investigation of thermo-sensitive amphiphilic micelles as drug carriers for chemotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo	Cholangiocarcinoma is an epithelial cancer of the bile ducts with poor prognosis and, in recent years, a rapidly increasing incidence. In this study, nano-sized thermo-sensitive micelles were investigated as drug carriers to improve chemotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma. Thermo-sensitive amphiphilic block copolymer, P-(N,N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-hydroxymethylacrylamide)-b- caprolactone [P-(NIPAAm-co-NHMAAm)-b-PCL] with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at about 38 C was synthesized. Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded micelles were prepared by dialysis method. The micelles exhibited a sustained and temperature-dependent DOX release. Toxicity of the blank micelles for human cholangiocarcinoma (QBC939) cells was minimal both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the DOX-loaded micelles effectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of QBC939 cells in vitro (p < 0.05) and inhibited tumor growth in nude mice by 21.49%. These results indicated that thermo-sensitive amphiphilic micelles are a promising and effective drug carrier, and show potential for improving chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84894634225	The sequence and analysis of a Chinese pig genome	Background: The pig is an economically important food source, amounting to approximately 40% of all meat consumed worldwide. Pigs also serve as an important model organism because of their similarity to humans at the anatomical, physiological and genetic level, making them very useful for studying a variety of human diseases. A pig strain of particular interest is the miniature pig, specifically the Wuzhishan pig (WZSP), as it has been extensively inbred. Its high level of homozygosity offers increased ease for selective breeding for specific traits and a more straightforward understanding of the genetic changes that underlie its biological characteristics. WZSP also serves as a promising means for applications in surgery, tissue engineering, and xenotransplantation. Here, we report the sequencing and analysis of an inbreeding WZSP genome.Results: Our results reveal some unique genomic features, including a relatively high level of homozygosity in the diploid genome, an unusual distribution of heterozygosity, an over-representation of tRNA-derived transposable elements, a small amount of porcine endogenous retrovirus, and a lack of type C retroviruses. In addition, we carried out systematic research on gene evolution, together with a detailed investigation of the counterparts of human drug target genes.Conclusion: Our results provide the opportunity to more clearly define the genomic character of pig, which could enhance our ability to create more useful pig models. © 2012 Fang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

13444312068	ChickVD: A sequence variation database for the chicken genome	Working in parallel with the efforts to sequence the chicken (Gallus gallus) genome, the Beijing Genomics Institute led an international team of scientists from China, USA, UK, Sweden, The Netherlands and Germany to map extensive DNA sequence variation throughout the chicken genome by sampling DNA from domestic breeds. Using the Red Jungle Fowl genome sequence as a reference, we identified 3.1 million non-redundant DNA sequence variants. To facilitate the application of our data to avian genetics and to provide a foundation for functional and evolutionary studies, we created the 'Chicken Variation Database' (ChickVD). A graphical MapView shows variants mapped onto the chicken genome in the context of gene annotations and other features, including genetic markers, trait loci, cDNAs, chicken orthologs of human disease genes and raw sequence traces. ChickVD also stores information on quantitative trait loci using data from collaborating institutions and public resources. Our data can be queried by search engine and homology-based BLAST searches.
