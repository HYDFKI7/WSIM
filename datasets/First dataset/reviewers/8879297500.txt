17044428098	Molecular dynamics simulation on the mechanism of nanometric machining of single-crystal silicon	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation can play a significant role in addressing a number of machining problems at the atomic scale. This simulation, unlike other simulation techniques, can provide new data and insights on nanometric machining; which cannot be obtained readily in any other theory or experiment. In this paper, some fundamental problems of mechanism are investigated in the nanometric cutting with the aid of molecular dynamics simulation, and the single-crystal silicon is chosen as the material. The study showed that the purely elastic deformation took place in a very narrow range in the initial stage of process of nanometric cutting. Shortly after that, dislocation appeared. And then, amorphous silicon came into being under high hydrostatic pressure. Significant change of volume of silicon specimen is observed, and it is considered that the change occur attribute to phase transition from a diamond silicon to a body-centered tetragonal silicon. The study also indicated that the temperature distributing of silicon in nanometric machining exhibited similarity to conventional machining. © 2004 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The complicated velocity field and vectorgraph of the flow in the abrasive water jet nozzle was obtained. In the course of the simulation, the Syamlal-O'Brien model was used to decide the inter-phase drag exchange coefficient. The velocity vectorgraph simulation results indicate that the highest flow speed is occurred at the inlet of the mixing chamber and the flow speed is gradually decreased along the direction of the nozzle axis and got to the lowest speed at the outlet of the nozzle. And also the flow speed in the cross section of the mixing chamber is gradually reduced along the radial direction of the cross section and got to the lowest speed in the verge of the chamber. The comparison of simulation result for the velocity field of water and abrasive exhibits that the velocity of water in the mixing chamber is three or four times higher than that of abrasive.

34147217131	Discussion on inspection of track alignment irregularities according to method of chord measuring and its 'using small fetch big'	The method of chord measuring is a basic method of measuring track alignment irregularity. Its main disadvantage is that the amplitude gains vary with the irregular wavelengths in the spatial frequency domain, which makes the application of the method have its limitation. This paper mainly discusses the basic principle of the method of chord measuring and consequently concludes the formula of 'Using small fetch big'. On this basis, this paper analyses the systematic and random errors in the' Using small fetch big' formula; the track geometry inspection device uses the method of chord measuring to detect track alignment irregularities, and conducts computer simulation. The result proves that the formula of 'Using small fetch big' can curvefit the original irregularities of tracks where the wavelengths are integral times of chord lengths. In the end, this paper gives the method of Newton interpolation as the solution for inspection of the track alignment irregularities of tracks where the wavelengths are nonintegral times of chord lengths.

The complicated velocity field of the flow in the abrasive water jet (AWJ) nozzle and the abrasive track in the nozzle were obtained. In the course of the simulation, the inter-phase drag exchange coefficient model uses Gidaspow model (gas-solid), Wen-yu model (water-solid), Schiller-Naumann model (water-gas) respectively. The simulation results indicate that the swirl is produced in the nozzle and the abrasives are accelerated and moved around the swirl, and they are all distributed along the inner surface of the nozzle, the gas is mostly distributed in the center of swirl. The dispersion of the flow happens when it flows out of the nozzle, it can be divided into three zones, that is core zone, middle zone and border zone. At the core zone the velocity changes little while the velocity changes greatly at the middle zone, the velocity fluctuates greatly at the border zone.

79951585162	Association of the D repeat polymorphism in the ASPN gene with developmental dysplasia of the hip: A case-control study in Han Chinese	Introduction: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common skeletal disease, which is characterized by abnormal seating of the femoral head in the acetabulum. Genetic factors play a considerable role in the etiology of DDH. Asporin (ASPN) is an ECM protein which can bind to TGF-β1 and sequentially inhibit TGF-β/Smad signaling. A functional aspartic acid (D) repeat polymorphism of ASPN was first described as an osteoarthritis-associated polymorphism. As TGF-β is well known as an important regulator in the development of skeletal components, ASPN may also be involved in the etiology of DDH. Our objective is to evaluate whether the D repeat polymorphism of ASPN is associated with DDH in Han Chinese.Methods: The D repeat polymorphism was genotyped in 370 DDH patients and 445 control subjects, and the allelic association of the D repeat was examined.Results: From D11 to D18, eight alleles were identified. D13 allele is the most common allele both in control and DDH groups, the frequencies are 67.3% and 58.1% respectively. In the DDH group, a significantly higher frequency of the D14 allele and significantly lower frequency of D13 was observed. The association of D14 and D13 was found in both females and males after stratification by gender. There was no significant difference in any other alleles we examined.Conclusions: Our results show an obvious association between the D repeat polymorphism of ASPN and DDH. It indicates that ASPN is an important regulator in the etiology of DDH. © 2011 Shi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79951898423	Mechanism of material removal by high pressure abrasive water-jet	High pressure abrasive water jet machining is considered as a promising technique in hard and brittle material processing. In this paper, tin: mechanism of hole formation on stone by high pressure water jet (HPWJ) and high pressure abrasive water jet ( HPAWJ ) are studied based on brittle and plastic fracture theories. It is shown that only the center core of HPWJ has the ability to remove materials. The cross-section of the hole is characterized by a "reverse - bell" shape on stone by a HPAWJ,and the material is eroded by an action of indenting forces, shearing forces and water-wedge action, in a brittle and plastic fracture mode. The eroded area by HPAWJ is constituted by a center-jet impact zone,an indenting zone and a sand-spraying zone , and the main material removal is found in the indenting zone. The diameter and depth of the holes eroded by HPAWJ increase with the increase of stand-off-distance. The jet velocity of HPAWJ gets lower from the center to the margin of the jet, and the concentration of abrasive grits becomes higher from the center to the margin of the jet. The largest kinetic energy is located neither in the center nor in the margin of the jet, but in the indenting zone.

52149102503	A sequence stratigraphic model for reservoir sand-body distribution in the Lower Permian Shanxi Formation in the Ordos Basin, northern China	The Lower Permian Shanxi Formation is the main gas-bearing stratigraphic unit in the northeastern Ordos Basin, China. Based on an integrated investigation of well logs, seismic data, cores and outcrops, the lower member of the Shanxi Formation has been subdivided into three third-order sequences from base to top, namely SQ1, SQ2, and SQ3. The three sequences consist primarily of stacked lowstand systems tracts with little deposition of transgressive systems tracts and/or highstand systems tracts. Detailed sedimentological and stratigraphic analyses indicated that the entire sequence is characterized by a regional transgression with incised valleys and channel fills marking the bases of each retro-gradational sequence, and swamp or inter-channel bay mudstone and coal deposits capping each sequence. The three sequences retracted source-ward sequentially from the sandstone-dominated SQ1 to the mudstone-dominated SQ3. The spatial and temporal distributions of the reservoir sandstones was primarily controlled by retro-gradational stacking patterns. Channel sand-bodies formed during the lowstand systems tracts of SQ1, SQ2 and SQ3 are excellent reservoirs, which form excellent reservoir-cap-rock assemblages with the overlying fine-grained sediments. The unique sequence stacking patterns control the accumulation of hydrocarbons. The reservoir quality of the SQ1, SQ2, and SQ3 sequences become worse gradually from base to top. Within each sequence, channel or incised valley fill of the lowstand systems tracts remain potential good expiration targets. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

55649089437	Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in growth differentiate factor 5 with congenital dysplasia of the hip: A case-control study	Introduction: Congenital dysplasia of the hip is an abnormal seating of the femoral head in the acetabulum, mainly caused by shallow acetabulum and lax joint capsule. Genetic factors play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of congenital dysplasia of the hip. The gene growth differentiate factor 5 (GDF5) has been implicated in skeletal development and joint morphogenesis in humans and mice. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′-untranslated region of GDF5 (rs143383) was reported to be associated with osteoarthritis susceptibility. As a key regulator in morphogenesis of skeletal components and soft tissues in and around the joints, GDF5 may be involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of congenital dysplasia of the hip. Our objective is to evaluate if the GDF5 SNP is associated with congenital dysplasia of the hip in people of Han Chinese origin. Methods: The GDF5 SNP was genotyped in 338 children with congenital dysplasia of the hip and 622 control subjects. Results: The SNP was significantly associated with congenital dysplasia of the hip (p = 0.0037; odds ration (OR) = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11 to 1.75). A significant difference was detected in female samples when stratified by gender (p = 0.0053; OR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.91), and in hip dislocation when stratified by severity (p = 0.0078; OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.85). Conclusions: Our results indicate that GDF5 is important in the aetiology of congenital dysplasia of the hip. To the authors' knowledge this is the first time that a definite association with the congenital dysplasia of the hip susceptibility has been detected. © 2008 Dai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The polished surfaces were characterized by surface roughometer and scanning electron microscopy. The main factors affecting the surface roughness and the erosion mechanisms related to material removal were analysed. It is found that abrasive mesh, water pressure and jet incidence angle are the main factors affecting the surface roughness. By contrast, the influence of traverse speed on the surface roughness is small. Under certain controlled conditions, the erosion mechanisms of synthetic quartz crystals are plastic flow, leaving a crack-free surface by low-middle pressure micro abrasive waterjet.

64449086353	Experimental study on abrasive waterjet polishing for hard-brittle materials	The rapid growth of hard-brittle materials necessitates the development of compatible machining techniques, especially for the precision machining. The abrasive waterjet (AWJ) machining is a powerful tool in processing hard-brittle materials. In the last decades, some of AWJ machining technologies, such as AWJ cutting, AWJ milling and AWJ drilling have gradually become mature and steady. However, a few investigations on precision surface machining for hard-brittle materials by AWJ had been carried out. In this research, the ductile erosion mechanism of hard-brittle materials by AWJ in small erosion angle has been analyzed. In theory, the ductile erosion can achieve micromaterial removal and the surface eroded is smooth and without any fracture. Based on the ductile erosion mechanism, the feasibility of polishing for hard-brittle materials by the AWJ has been investigated. A group of polishing experiments is performed. The polished surfaces of workpieces were observed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of these polishing experiments indicate that AWJ has a great potential to be used as a precision surface machining technology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

70349991430	Quantitative simulation and new consideration on the transformation system of the accommodation space	To discuss the non-synchronous change of accommodation space and sequence stacking patterns in both sides of a basin, using the SEDPAK two-dimensional stratigraphic modelling program, the "transformation system of the accommodation space" within a basin was simulated by considering the various parameters controlling the deposition of a sequence. The simulation results indicate that isochronous sequence stratigraphy within a basin may exhibit both synchronous and non-synchronous stacking patterns at different part of the basin. Synchronous stacking patterns were observed to be primarily developed during the lowstand system tracts and the late highstand system tracts. Non-synchronous stacking patterns were found to be often associated with the transgressive system tracts and the early highstand system tracts. The development of non-synchronous stacking patterns may occur under a number of circumstances within a basin with the right combination of various parameters. Non-synchronous stacking patterns of isochronous sequence stratigraphy may provide new reference to identify system tracts interface and develop sequence stratigraphic correlation.

72449156607	Differential interformational velocity analysis as an effective direct hydrocarbon indicator under velocity reversal conditions, an example from the anomalously high temperature and over-pressured DF1-1 Gas Field in the Yinggehai Basin, South China Sea	In the DF1-1 Gas Field in the Yinggehai Basin, South China Sea, the velocity-depth plot and velocity spectra show significant variations from a linear trend, exhibiting a distinct reversal phenomenon. Velocity parameters derived from velocity spectral analysis of the seismic data and sonic logs indicate that the interval velocity reverses below 2,100 m (2.2 s two-way time (TWT)) in the DF1-1 Gas Field. Some direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs) models developed for the shallow strata cannot be simply applied to the moderately to deeply buried strata for direct exploration target recognition because the velocity reversal has caused the middle-deep gas reservoirs to exhibit a moderate or weak seismic amplitude. The hydrocarbon indicator method of "Differential Interformational Velocity Analysis (DIVA)" with the aid of other hydrocarbon indicating techniques was employed to effectively identify DHIs in the middle-deep strata under velocity inversion. The result has shown that the DIVA technique can be effectively used as a DHI in both the shallow and the middle-deep strata in the study area with the shallow strata characterized by Type I DIVA anomaly and the middle-deep strata characterized by the Type II DIVA anomaly. © 2009 China University of Petroleum (Beijing) and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

77951582540	Demographic histories of four spruce (picea) species of the qinghai-tibetan plateau and neighboring areas inferred from multiple nuclear loci	Nucleotide variation at 12-16 nuclear loci was studied in three spruce species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), Picea likiangensis, P. wilsonii, and P. purpurea, and one species from the Tian Shan mountain range, P. schrenkiana. Silent nucleotide diversity was limited in P. schrenkiana and high in the three species from the QTP, with values higher than in boreal spruce species, despite their much more restricted distributions compared with that of the boreal species. In contrast to European boreal species that have experienced severe bottlenecks in the past, coalescent-based analysis suggests that DNA polymorphism in the species from the QTP and adjacent areas is compatible with the standard neutral model (P. likiangensis, P. wilsonii, and P. schrenkiana) or with population growth (P. purpurea). In order to test if P. purpurea is a diploid hybrid of P. likiangensis and P. wilsonii, we used a combination of approaches, including model-based inference of population structure, isolation-with-migration models, and recent theoretical results on the effect of introgression on the geographic distribution of diversity. In contrast to the three other species, each of which was predominantly assigned to a single cluster in the Structure analysis, P. purpurea individuals were scattered over the three main clusters and not, as we had expected, confined to the P. likiangensis and P. wilsonii clusters. Furthermore, the contribution of P. schrenkiana was by far the largest one. In agreement with this, the divergence between P. purpurea and P. schrenkiana was lower than the divergence of either P. likiangensis or P. wilsonii from P. schrenkiana. These results, together with previous ones showing that P. purpurea and P. wilsonii share the same haplotypes at both chloroplast and mitochondrial markers, suggest that P. purpurea has a complex origin, possibly involving additional species. © 2010 The Author.

The comparison result indicates that the value of the simulation is changing similarly with the experiment value, and both value is almost the same, which proves that the simulation method is successful, the simulation model and the boundary conditions are right.

77955125603	High-resolution transgressive-regressive sequence stratigraphy of Chang 8 Member of Yanchang Formation in southwestern Ordos basin, northern China	The reservoirs within the Chang 8 Member of Yanchang (Chinese Source) Formation in the southwestern Ordos basin are characterized by low permeability. It is significant to build a high-resolution sequence stratigraphic framework for the exploration and development of these reservoirs. Based on an integrated investigation of well logs, seismic data, cores and outcrops, the Chang 8 Member is interpreted as a 3rd-order transgressive-regressive (T-R) sequence, which consists of six 4th-order T-R sequences, namely, K1, K2, K3, K4, K5 and K6, respectively, from base to top. Each 4th-order sequence comprises a transgressive systems tract overlain by a regressive systems tract. From K1 to transgressive systems tract of K4, it is characterized by the landward shifts of facies and overall retrogradational sequence stacking pattern due to accommodation increase more than sediment supply during the 3rd-order base-level rise. The distributary channels are mainly deposited in the transgressive systems tracts, and the interdistributary bays, sheet sands, and small-scale mouth bars are primarily developed in the regressive systems tracts in response to the 4th-order base-level fluctuations. From the regressive systems tracts of K4 to K6, it is characterized by the basinward shifts of facies and overall progradational sequence stacking pattern because of accommodation increase less than sediment supply during a fall in 3rd-order base level. The distributary channels are mainly accumulated in the transgressive systems tracts, and distributary channels and mouth bars are deposited in the regressive systems tracts as a result of the 4th-order base-level changes. Detailed stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses indicate that sequences K1, K2, K5 and K6, as well as the basin edge of K3 and K4, remain potential for exploration and development due to their high reservoir quality in response to the low accommodation and more sediment supply. © 2010 China University of Geosciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77957601405	Numerical analysis of frictional contact condition between tire and cement concrete pavement	For the lack of quantitative analysis and reasonable evaluation methods on skid-resistant performance of cement concrete pavement, this paper adopts the finite element method to simulate the frictional contact condition between tire and cement concrete pavement and then analyzes the impact of load, pavement surface structure, tire pressure, speed and other factors on adhesional coefficient between tire and pavement. The results indicate that: the load, groove width and groove space significantly affect adhesional coefficient, but groove depth has hardly effect on adhesional coefficient; the lower the inflation pressure of tire, the greater the adhesional coefficient between tire and pavement is; the faster the speed, the smaller the adhesional coefficient is. At last, the relationship among pavement adhesional coefficient and inflation pressure, load, speed, and surface structure parameters is acquired.

78649692441	Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in Tbx4 with developmental dysplasia of the hip: A case-control study	Objective: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), formerly known as congenital dislocation of the hip, comprises a spectrum of abnormalities, including abnormal acetabular shape (dysplasia) and malposition of the femoral head during embryonic, fetal and infantile growth periods. Genetic factors play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of DDH. As a key regulator for the hindlimb outgrowth and identification, Tbx4 may be involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of DDH. Our objective is to evaluate whether the Tbx4 (rs3744438 and rs3744448) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with DDH in Chinese. Method: The Tbx4 SNPs were genotyped in 505 children with DDH and 551 control subjects and their association was evaluated statistically. Results: Rs3744438 was not associated with DDH. Rs3744448 was significantly associated with DDH in the dominant genetic model of males (P=0.039; odds ratio (OR)=0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.32-0.97) and allele G was significantly lower in patients than controls compared with allele C (P=0.02; OR=0.59; 95% CI=0.37-0.92). After adjusted for gender, we discovered a significant association with hip dislocation in the dominant genetic model when stratified by severity (P=0.03; OR=0.73; 95% CI=0.55-0.97), but not with subluxation and instability. Conclusions: Tbx4 tends to play an important role in the aetiology of DDH. © 2010.

In this paper, an experimental study on the kerf characteristics, especially for the effect of cutting parameters on the top edge definition, is presented. It shows that the top kerf edge is straight but not sharp. The top edge definition of the kerf improves with a decrease in the air pressure, while the effect of abrasive flow rate and nozzle traverse speed are hardly discernible. The optimum jet incidence angle for highest top edge definition of the kerf is 60°.

80052033160	Three dimensional simulation of microstructure evolution for ceramic tool materials	The observation and scientific quantitative characterization of three dimensional microstructure evolution during sintering process of ceramic tool materials is important to investigate the influence of nano-particles on mechanical properties. The relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties of ceramic tool materials can be established to direct the development of nano-composite ceramic tool materials by the research of the grain growth, grain boundary migration, distribution of nano-particles and microstructure densification at the different sintering temperature and pressure. In this paper, a 3D Monte Carlo model of three-phase nano-composite ceramic tool material is built and applied to simulate the microstructure evolution during sintering process. In this model, the grain boundary energy of each phase and interfacial energy between two phases are taken into consideration as the driving forces for grain growth. The sintering temperature and pressure are successfully coupled into the Monte Carlo simulation model. The microstructure evolution of defect free three-phase nano-composite ceramic tool materials is successfully simulated at different sintering temperature and pressure. The simulation results show that the higher the sintering temperature is, the faster the grain growth. However, the sintering pressure has little effect on the grain growth. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

So far, two-phase composites materials have been widely investigated. However, materials with two-kinds of particles are seldom researched. In this paper, microstructure evolution of two-phase and three-phase nano-ceramic materials are simulated and compared. The effects of particle volume fraction, radius, distributions and grain boundary energy ratios on microstructure evolution are analyzed respectively. It shows that adding two kinds of particles can receive better grain refinement than just adding one kind of particles. The higher volume fraction and smaller-sized nano-particles have stronger pinning force on matrix grain growth. The nano-particles located around grain boundaries have better inhibition effect than those distributed randomly on matrix grain growth. Grain boundary energy ratio has significant influence on pinning effect of particles. The nano-particles not only restrain grain boundary migration, but also prevent the elimination of small grains and refine matrix grains. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The relationship between the systems with petroleum accumulation is also discussed from the perspectives of hydrocarbon generation, preservation and distribution. This research comes to the following results: The Banghu and Zhouji syncline belts have higher geothermal gradient, which is favorable to the maturation of the Qianjiang Formation source rock expulsion. The present pressures of the Qianjiang Formation and stones mostly belong to normal range, whereas the deep Qianjiang Formation mudstones present uncompaction which enhanced its seal ability. In vertical, the T-P system of the Qianjiang Formation includes two kinds of static pressure and overpressure. The static pressure systems mainly distribute at the Qianbei steep slope belt, the eastern slope belt and the western slope belt where the reservoirs were formed by self-generation and self-storage, whereas the overpressure systems exist in the Banghu and Zhouji syncline belts where the reservoirs are distributed mostly at the top of the deep overpressure system and within the shallower normal pressure system. The lateral T-P systems can be divided into 8 subareas, namely, NTHP, LTHP, HTNP, NTNP, LTNP, HTLP, NTLP and LTLP, and the NTNP is the place where petroleum mainly accumulated.

The results show that there are three types of sediment transport pathway in Dongying formation of the western slope of Bozhong sag, including sediment transport pathway of Paleo-channel, faulted trough and structural transfer zones. The deposits of study area were controlled mainly by faulted trough sediment transport pathway derived from Shaleitian uplift, with the belted distribution in NEE direction. The deposits controlled by paleo-channel sediment transport pathway occurred in the local area of southern Shijiutuo uplift. The deposits controlled by structural transfer zones sediment transport pathway are focused on the local area of southeast Shaleitian uplift. Three types of sediment transport pathway display the overall sediment transport methods from the source area to the deposits area in the continental lacustrine basins, and formed three types corresponding coupling patterns of the source area- transport pathway-deposit area. Structural transfer zones sediment transport pathway is considered one special style of faulted trough sediment transport pathway. The presence of faulted trough sediment transport pathway derived from the Shaleitian uplift changes the past understanding that it is the fan delta with proximal and rapid deposit in the eastern Shaleitian uplift, and provides an effective model for seeking potential reservoir.

Based on the basic geological parameters (initial topography, lake-level curve, and sediment supply) originated from the Lower Permian Shanxi Formation of the Ordos Basin, we simulated quantitatively and validated the source-ward retrogradational sequence stratigraphic pattern of intra-cartonic siliciclastic basin, and demonstrated the use of numerical simulation to replicate and extend a particular flume experiment. In Run 1 (SQ1) the result of numerical simulation was characterized by the fan-shaped distribution, Sequence SQ2 retrograded landwards and overlaid the deposits of Sequence SQ1 after Run 2, and Sequence SQ3 retrograded further landwards and overlaid the deposits of Sequence SQ2 after Run 3. The simulation results indicated that fan-shaped deposits of Sequences SQ1, SQ2, and SQ3 retrograded sequentially landwards. The sediment distribution of three sequences in the numerical simulation is in accordance with the deposits observed in the physical experiment. The simulated sequence stratigraphic pattern of three sequences also matches that from the geological model quite well.

84876003817	Numerical simulation of multiphase flow field in abrasive waterjet machining	Simulation of the velocity field of solid-liquid flow inside and outside the abrasive waterjet (AWJ) nozzle is studied by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The flow field of the flow inside and outside the AWJ nozzle is obtained. The simulation results indicate that there is a sudden increase in the jet velocity near the corner inside the nozzle, and then it remains steady in the focus tube. When AWJ ejects from nozzle, the diffusion happens and the velocity of the flow is slowly decaying. The simulation results also indicate that AWJ flow field is affected by the impact angle on the target. The higher impact angle becomes, the more obvious effect on the flow field is. The simulation results show that there are a large eddy and negative pressure zone in the flow field when AWJ impacts on the wall, and which will help to entrainment removal of the material. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

84877015913	Quantitative recognition of seismic sequence stratigraphic units in Wenchang Formation, Paleogene, Enping Sag, Pearl River Mouth Basin	The technology of quantitative recognition was applied in seismic sequence stratigraphic unit. Using the seismic attribute information, the sequence interfaces under the control of the steering cube were auto-track, and the quantitative subdue sequence units in virtue of Wheeler-transformed domain was realized. With the limitation of insufficient well, based on the technique of quantitative recognition, the geological models of basic unit and combined form of isochronous stratum were established. Two sub-second-order sequences which can be subdivided into six three-order sequences SQ1-SQ6 from base to top can be recognized in the strata of Wenchang Formation, Paleogene, Enping sag. As an example, based on the quantitative recognition of maximum flooding surface within the sequence SQ6, the progradational complex of highstand system tracts can be subdivided into two stages (I and II) and four sub-order sedimentary bodies. The results show that quantitative recognition technology can provide a good way to identify three-order sequence boundaries, system tract boundaries and the inner stages of a typical deposition.

84878246195	Sedimentary controls on the sequence stratigraphic architecture in intra-cratonic basins: An example from the Lower Permian Shanxi Formation, Ordos Basin, northern China	Intra-cratonic basins are characterized by stable tectonic regimes, closed depositional systems, finite sizes of receiving basins and extremely low morphological gradients. This paper examines the effect of sediment accumulation on the sequence stratigraphic architecture and quantitatively evaluates its controls on the development of intra-cratonic sedimentary sequences using numerical modelling. A well documented intra-cratonic sedimentary sequence, the Lower Permian Shanxi Formation in the Ordos Basin, northern China, was used to illustrate a sequence stratigraphic model developed for intra-cratonic sedimentary basins. The studied sequence is characterized by a typical backstepping or source-ward retrogradation. A 2-D simulation software (SEDPAK) and a 3-D simulation software (SEDSIM) were used to model the intra-cratonic sequence. The modelling results indicated that sediment accumulation alone can produce the classical retrogradational stratigraphic stacking patterns. The sediment accumulation can (1) increase the retrogradational range of the original retrogradational stacking sequences, (2) change an original aggradational stacking sequence to a retrogradational stacking one, and (3) decrease the progradational range of an original progradational stacking sequence, or (4) even change an original progradational stacking sequence to a retrogradational stacking sequence. Understanding the relationship between the sediment accumulation and the stratigraphic development in an intra-cratonic basin is essential for interpreting the sequence stratigraphic framework and stacking patterns, and for predicting the distribution of potential reservoir sand-bodies within such basins. This work enriches the classic sequence stratigraphic models by providing a new model for intra-continental basins, and offers new insight on hydrocarbon exploration in intra-cratonic basins. •Intra-cratonic basin has the retrogradational sequence stratigraphic pattern.•The observed cyclothemic sequences were simulated by numerical simulation.•Sediment accumulation can control stratigraphic architecture of intra-cratonic basin. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84881350919	A quantitative simulation study of asymmetrical tectonic subsidence control on non-synchronous sequence stacking patterns of Eocene lacustrine sediments in Bohai Bay Basin, China	Compared with large-scale passive margin marine basins, continental basins are susceptive to local or regional tectonic, geomorphologic and climatic influences and can form complicated sequence stratigraphic architectures, configurations and sedimentary facies. We report herein a quantitative simulation study on the influences of asymmetrical tectonic subsidence on sequence stratigraphic stacking patterns in rift basins by varying tectonic subsidence, sediment supply, and intra-rift lake levels. It has been demonstrated that isochronous sequences within a rift basin can exhibit both synchronous and non-synchronous stacking patterns as a result of differential asymmetric tectonic subsidence. In sequence stratigraphy, synchronous stacking patterns refer to isochronous sequences at any parts of a basin, which are either all retrogradational or all progradational. We propose the concept of non-synchronous stacking patterns of isochronous sequence stratigraphy for rift basins. Non-synchronous stacking patterns refer to the fact that, within the same basin, some parts may concomitantly exhibit stacking patterns that are exactly opposite to that of other parts. Non-synchronous stacking patterns can form when the accommodation space increment ({increment}A) is less than that of sedimentary supply ({increment}S) in one area, but larger than or equal to that of {increment}S in another. Moreover, the duration of non-synchronous stacking patterns is controlled by both {increment}A and {increment}S. Recognition of non-synchronous stacking patterns within isochronous sequence stratigraphy provides a conceptual model for correlation of sequence stratigraphic units in tectonically asymmetric rift basins in eastern China and similar basins around the world. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Before observing cracks and determining the ductile to brittle transition penetration depth, the samples were etched with hydrofluoric acid to expose cracks. The typical damage morphology of fused silica was discussed by observing the surface and cross-section of indentations, and the depth of SSD was found to be determined by the cone cracks or borderline cracks in the different load range. The ductile to brittle transition penetration depth of fused silica under Vickers indentation was 180 nm. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84886880267	An experimental study on radial-mode abrasive waterjet turning of alumina ceramics	A study on the radial-mode abrasive waterjet turning (AWJT) process is presented and discussed. An experimental investigation is carried out to explore the influence of process parameters on the depth of turning and material removal rate (MRR) when turning 96% alumina ceramics. The experiment is designed by the multifactor orthogonal experiment methods. The effect of feed speed, water pressure, abrasive mass flow rate, nozzle tilted angle and surface speed are investigated by the range analysis and variance analysis. The results show that the feed speed is the most significant variables affecting the depth of turning. Based on the test conditions, it is found that the most efficient conditions to maximize depth of turning are at a jet angle of 105 degree, a water pressure of 3 10MPa, an abrasive mass flow rate of 11.5 g/s, a surface speed of 5.5m/s and a feed speed of 0.05mm/s. At last, the effect mechanism of process variables on the depth of turning is analyzed qualitatively. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

In this research, the AlN ceramics was polished using an AWJ machining system. A considerable processing quality has been achieved and a reduction up to 62% of the surface roughness has been obtained.

84886932815	A study on erosion performance of monocrystalline silicon in ultrasonic vibration-assisted abrasive water jet machining	Ultrasonic vibration-assisted machining (UVAM) is an effective and promising technology for processing hard and brittle materials, it has been explored in many experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, a study on the erosion performance of monocrystalline silicon with UVAM is presented and discussed. In the erosion experiments, monocrystalline silicon wafers were eroded by the abrasive water jet machine assisted with an ultrasonic vibration system. A contrast experiment was carried out firstly to study the influence of the ultrasonic vibration, and then an orthogonal experiment investigation was carried out to understand the effect of process variables (the abrasive particle diameter, jet impact angle, standoff distance, abrasive mass flow rate and ultrasonic vibration power) on the depth of erosion and material removal rate (MRR). The experimental results revealed that ultrasonic vibration-assisted abrasive water jet erosion (UVA-AWJE) can obviously improve the depth of the erosion and MRR compared with those in traditional AWJE and the variation trends of the effect of the abrasive particle diameter, jet impact angle, standoff distance and abrasive mass flow rate on the erosion performance in UVA-AWJE are very similar to those effect in the traditional AWJ machining. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

A statistically designed experiment is conducted to study the effects of process parameters on the development of the cutting front, considering the change of water pressure, nozzle feed speed and nozzle tilt angle. It is found that the most significant parameters affecting the cutting front development are feed speed and water pressure. Further, the actual jet impact angle is dependent on both the water pressure and feed speed, but at higher water pressures the actual impact angle tends to become independent of feed speed, while water pressure becomes the dominating factor. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84886740189	Source-ward retro-gradational stacking patterns of sequence stratigraphic architectures of intra-cratonic basin: one example from Shanxi Formatin of Ordos basin	Intra-cratonic basins are the important hydrocarbon-bearing basins in China. However, the previous research of sequence stratigraphy is insufficient to intra-cratonic basin. Based on the sequence stratigraphic research of Shanxi Formation of Ordos basin, one typical intra-cratonic basins of China, the authors develop the source-ward retro-gradational stacking patterns with long-term retrogradation and short-term progradation. The model indicates that (1) sequence stratigraphic architecture of third-order sequence within intra-cratonic basins mainly consists of lowstand systems tract (LST), and lack of transgressive systems tract (TST) and highstand systems tract (HST); (2) the third-order base level cycle has the characteristics of long term transgression and short term regression; (3) the sand-bodies controlled by various order sequence stratigraphic framework show the model of source-ward retro-gradational stacking patterns from base to top.

84890052913	Three-dimensional facies architecture analysis using sequence stratigraphy and seismic sedimentology: Example from the Paleogene Dongying Formation in the BZ3-1 block of the Bozhong Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China	The Bohai Bay Basin is a classic non-marine rift basin in eastern China. The Paleogene Dongying sequences are the main hydrocarbon-bearing stratigraphic unit in the basin. Using three-dimensional (3-D) seismic data and one well control in the BZ3-1 Block in the western slope of the Bozhong Sag, we analyzed 3-D facies architectures of the Dongying sequences. The Dongying Formation, a second-order sequence, can be subdivided into four third-order sequences (from base to top: SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, and SQ4). The facies architecture was analyzed by using the seismic sedimentology approach based on 3-D seismic data. Sediment of the Dongying sequences was derived from the northern Shijiutuo Uplift via four major configurations of incised valleys, namely "V", "U", "W", and composite shaped incised valleys. Seismic stratal slices reveal branching and converging characteristics of the channels from upstream to downstream. On the basis of an integrated analysis of well log, core data, seismic facies based on multi-seismic attributes, three sedimentary facies (e.g., "delta", "fan-delta", and "shore" or "shallow lacustrine" facies) have been recognized. The four types of incised valleys and their evolution control the sedimentary systems in the sedimentation area. The numbers and sizes of the fans are controlled by the sedimentary systems at various scales. Incised valley-fill and deltaic sand bodies are excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs and potentially good exploration targets for the study area. The reservoir quality of sequences SQ1, SQ2, and SQ3 become better gradually from base to top. The proposed sediment dispersal patterns may aid in the prediction of potential reservoir distribution. This study also demonstrates that facies architecture analysis using sequence stratigraphy and seismic sedimentology may serve as an effective approach for constructing 3D facies models for petroleum exploration in areas lacking of well or outcrop data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84888360330	On ultrahigh velocity micro-particle impact on steels - A multiple impact study	A computational model is presented to investigate the ultrahigh-velocity multiple particle impact process on steels. It uses a Monte Carlo framework to model the stochastic nature of the particle flow and the finite element (FE) method to model the individual particle impact process, while considering the thermal diffusion process. The model predictions show a reasonably good agreement with the corresponding experimental data using a high-tensile steel specimen at various conditions. A simulation study using the model is then conducted and shows that it is essential to consider thermal diffusion which causes the temperature at the impact site to rapidly cool down in a multiple particle impact process. As a consequence, the impact result is impact-sequence and impact-time dependent. The study reveals that inertia-induced fracture is the primary material removal mechanism at the normal impacts, while the thermal instability-driven failure, or specifically the adiabatic shear banding (ASB) induced failure, as well as the elongation-induced fractures are the two major material removal mechanisms at oblique impact angles. These failures occur at the pile-up lips (at normal and oblique impact angles) and the crater bottom (at oblique impact angles). It is the thermal-instability-driven failure that contributes to the higher material removal rate at oblique impact angles. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84891333890	A universal algorithm for bias-chord offset based on MCO and its characteristics analyses	Research purposes: There are two methods for alignment and profile irregularities evaluation of HSR ballastless track, i. e. mid-chord offset (MCO) method and bias-chord offset differential method. MCO method has been applied in track survey field widely, but the application of bias-chord offset differential method was limited due to its dependence of absolute survey. From the mathematical model of two methods, this paper analyzed the geometric interpretations of two methods to provide the theoretical basis for HSR ballastless track irregularity evaluation. Research conclusions: (1) On this basis, a universal algorithm for chord deflection offset was established which is based on short chord MCO data. The result of computer simulation has verified the accuracy of the universal algorithm. (2) By means of frequency characteristics and error characteristics analysis, this paper argued that: contrast with bias-chord offset differential method, MCO method has some characteristics in the same chord length, e.g. zero phase shifting, richness of irregularities information, location convenience and characterization of dynamic properties. Not only that, the MCO method is able to extract the information of long wave irregularities with extended algorithm. (3) The universal algorithm established in this paper should provide a new method for the measurement of chord deflection offset in HSR survey.

The velocity field of the flow inside the WJ nozzle is obtained. The influence of vibration parameters, such as amplitude and frequency on the flow field are studied. The results of investigation indicate that the flow velocity at the WJ nozzle outlet has almost the same vibrating type with the inlet velocity vibration. During a vibration cycle, the velocity field of the flow is changing greatly. The serials value of the vibration frequency and amplitude are taken to test their influence on the flow field. The simulation results show that the flow field also changes greatly with the different frequency and amplitude. Based on the obtained results, the mechanism of system pressure vibration influence on the water jet flow field inside the WJ nozzle is obtained, and a new method is provided to optimize the machining process with the aim to improve the machine efficiency and surface quality of the work piece. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

84901670286	Distribution of middle-deep lacustrine source rocks within sequence stratigraphic framework of Wenchang formation in Enping depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin	The main prerequisite for the development of middle-deep lacustrine source rocks has been deduced on the basis of the comprehensive analysis of lake forming conditions, core analysis, oil-source correlation and seismic reflection characteristics in the Enping depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin. Compared with the seismic facies of source rocks of Paleogene Wenchang Formation in the proven hydrocarbon-rich sag (Panyu 4 and Lufeng 13 sags of Huizhou depression), the distribution and model of middle-deep lacustrine source rocks had been reconstructed in the Enping depression. In the study area the source rocks which are characterized by continuous seismic reflections with low frequency and high amplitude are occurred in every third-order sequence. In the Enping 17 sag they are mainly distributed in the central and west parts, while vertically the scope in the Upper Wenchang Formation was smaller than that of Lower Wenchang Formation and the sedimentation center is to the side of Fault 1 that controlled depression. In the Enping 18 sag the source rocks are mainly located in the central part close to Fault 2 that controlled sag, while vertically the scope in the the Upper Wenchang Formation is bigger than that in the Lower Wenchang Formation and the sedimentation center almost remained unchanged. The source rocks that has sheet-like seismic reflections with weak amplitude to blank are primarily distributed in the third-order sequences SQ3-SQ5. In the Enping 17 sag they are restricted in a small negative tectonic unit located south of the internal low uplift. In the Enping 18 sag they are distributed in the deep sag. Based on the distribution of middle-deep lacustrine source rocks, three developmental models are established namely: (1) the widespread source rocks in the transgressive system tracts and highstand system tracts; (2) source rocks developed in the lowstand system tracts, for example in SQ5 in the Wenchang Formation; (3) source rocks developed south of the internal low uplift, restricted in a small negative tectonic unit.

84905858092	Experimental study on turning nickel-based superalloy GH4033 with coated cemented carbide tools	The nickel-based superalloy GH4033 is one of the difficult-to-cut materials. In order to investigate the machinability of GH4033, the tool cutting performance, tool failure modes, tool life and the relationships between surface roughness and tool flank wear were studied by using different coated cemented carbide cutting tools under dry cutting. Aiming at the amount of metal removal combining with the tool life and surface quality, the better cutting tool coating type and optimal cutting parameters were obtained through the orthogonal experiments. The results showed that the cutting performance of TiCN coated tool (GC4235) was better than that of TiAlN coated tool (JC450V). With these two kinds of tools, the machined surface roughness decreased to a minimum value and then increased with the increase of flank wear. When cutting GH4033, the main wear mechanism for both of the two types of tools included adhesive wear, diffusive wear, abrasive wear, edge wear and coating peeling. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84913539041	High efficiency abrasive waterjet dressing of diamond grinding wheel	A grinding wheel wears rapidly during ultrasonic assisted surface generation of a large aperture aspherical RB-SiC mirror, which leads to an increase of grinding force and profile error. In this paper, different types of resinoid bonded diamond grinding wheel with a same grit size were dressed with high-pressure abrasive water jet. The dressing effects of abrasive water jet were assessed through comparing the 3D roughness of the grinding wheel topographies before and after dressing. The experimental results show that diamond grits of a worn grinding wheel are protruding from bond after dressing. The feed rate of nozzle and the bond materials have significant impact on the 3D surface roughness of the wheel and dressing efficient. The softer binder and the decrease of the feed rates and lead to deeper grooves during dressing of grinding wheel. However, too low feed rate will make a large number of abrasive particles drop from binder, which worsens the wheel topography. Therefore, to dress grinding wheel well and efficiently, optimized feed rate must be chosen.

84913546819	An SPH simulation on vibration assisted abrasive erosion of hard brittle material in abrasive waterjet machining	Abrasive waterjet machining (AWJ) is one of the fastest growing non-conventional machining methods. However, low pressure and fine abrasive implemented in AWJ precision machining for reducing the surface damage reduce the efficiency. Therefore ultrasonic vibration is considered to apply on the workpiece to improve the machining efficiency. In order to analyze the effect of the vibration on erosion in AWJ machining, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is used to simulate the erosion process for avoiding the mesh distortion in finite element method (FEM) when simulating large deformation and high strain rate problems. The results show that the application of ultrasonic vibration can effectively improve the erosion rate due to the dynamics variation of the erosion process.

84914150083	Material removal analysis in the radial-mode abrasive waterjet turning of ceramic materials	An experimental investigation on the radial-mode abrasive waterjet turning (AWJT) of ceramic materials, with particular attention to 96% alumina and 95% zirconia ceramics, is presented and discussed. The results show that similar tendencies exist in the dependence of material removal rate (MRR) on water pressure and abrasive mass flow rate, as well as the dependence of the turning depth on jet feed speed when turning different ceramic materials using abrasive waterjet (AWJ). The properties of the target material have a great impact on the material removal mechanism and MRR. The MRR of 96% alumina is considerably larger than that of 95% zirconia ceramics. Microscopic analysis of the eroded surface after turning reveals that the material removal mechanism of 96% alumina mainly involves brittle facture damages featured by intergranular cracks and fragmentation, while for 95% zirconia the erosive process is primarily characterised by plastic deformation accompanied with some pits.

84916910305	Seismic-based sediment provenance analysis in continental lacustrine rift basins: An example from the Bohai Bay Basin, China	By using recently acquired three-dimensional seismic data, a seismic-based sediment provenance analysis was conducted in the late Paleogene sequence of the western slope of the Bozhong sag, Bohai Bay Basin, where the main depositional center was between the Shaleitian uplift and the Shijiutuo uplift. Three styles of sediment-transport pathways were identified in the study area, including sediment transport via (1) faulted troughs, (2) incised valleys, and (3) structural transfer zones. The Paleogene deposits in the study area were primarily controlled by the faulted-trough pathways, which are northeast-southwest oriented in between different northeast-southwest-trending faults with sediments derived primarily from the Shaleitian uplift. The sediments to the east of the Shaleitian uplift were interpreted to have sourced via relatively long-distance transportation and deposited along the northeast-southwest-trending faulted troughs, forming a deltaic sediment belt. In contrast, sediments derived from the Shijiutuo uplift, which were transported by the incised-valley pathways and deposited in the southern margin of the uplift, formed proximal fan-deltas. The depositional systems in the study area are characterized by the coupling of source-faulted-trough pathway-deltaic-lacustrine deposits in the eastern margin of the Shaleitian uplift and that of source-incised-valley-pathway-fan-deltaic-lacustrine deposits near the southern margin of the Shijiutuo uplift. The proposed spatial distribution of the sand bodies extends the distribution range for potential reservoir sand bodies beyond the currently exploration area. This work may serve as a useful reference for sedimentary provenance analysis in other types of sedimentary basins.
