16344384586	Transcranial color-coded sonography for the detection of middle cerebral artery stenosis	Objective. The purpose of this study was to validate the accuracy and criteria of transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) in detecting severe middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis. Methods. One hundred ninety-three patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease who received both TCCS and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) examinations were evaluated. Middle cerebral artery stenosis assessed by MRA was graded as follows: grade 0, normal to mild (<50%); grade 1, focal severe stenosis (≥50% and stenotic length within the M1 prebifurcation segment); and grade 2, diffuse severe stenosis (≥50% and stenotic length greater than the M1 prebifurcation segment).

16844370454	Carotid duplex sonography in the follow-up of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulae	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies to determine the value of noninvasive neurovascular studies for the effectiveness of treatment and long-term follow-up of dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are of clinical importance. We determined whether the serial changes of carotid duplex sonography (CDS) were correlated with the evolution of dural AVF status after treatment or follow-up. METHODS: Four parameters of CDS were studied in two groups of patients with dural AVF: resistance index, end diastolic velocity, peak systolic velocity, and flow volume of the external carotid artery (ECA). The first group included 13 patients who received endovascular therapy, the efficacy of which was determined by the results of postembolization angiography. In the second group, 16 patients received only clinical and CDS follow-up. Evolution of clinical symptoms was recorded and classified as deteriorating, stationary, or improving. Patients underwent CDS before and after treatment (group 1) or at long-term follow-up (group 2). RESULTS: In the first group, the resistance index of the ECA increased in patients with occluded or nearly occluded dural AVF after embolization (n = 7, P = .01), but it did not change significantly in patients with partial treatment (H = 6, P = .11). Of patients with occluded or nearly occluded dural AVF after embolization, the ECA resistance index increased in patients with noncavernous sinus dural AVF (n = 5, P = .003) but not in patients with cavernous sinus dural AVF (n = 2, P = .48). In the second group, CDS parameters-particularly the resistance index-were well correlated with clinical status during follow-up. CONCLUSION: The resistance index of the ECA is correlated with the effectiveness of treatment and clinical evolution of dural AVF. © American Society of Neuroradiology.

1842785649	Migrainous Infarction Involving Two Different Arterial Territories: Report of Two Cases	It is reasonab to speculate that migrainous infarction may develop in different territories of cerebral arteries. However, this condition was rarely reported before. Here we described two patients (one woman, 29 year-old; one man, 47 year-old) with a history of migraine with aura, had ischemic strokes during the migraine attack. The ischemic stroke of the female patient involved the territories of the posterior cerebral and anterior choroidal arteries; whereas the male patient had two episodes of ischemic strokes, involving the territories of the middle and posterior cerebral arteries sequentially. Both patients recovered well during the follow-up periods. We suggest that migrainous infarction can involve different arterial territories.

22844441886	Middle cerebral artery dissections: Differences between isolated and extended dissections of internal carotid artery	Isolated middle cerebral artery dissection (MCAD) has rarely been encountered clinically and few have reviewed it systemically. The etiologies, clinical manifestations, natural clinical course and prognosis of MCAD remain poorly understood. From 1995 to 2004, there were 5 cases diagnosed clinically and angiographically to have MCAD (isolated MCAD in 1, ICAD-MCAD in 4) from a medical center in Taiwan. MEDLINE (1966-2003) was searched for published articles in English that concerned the diagnosis of MCAD. Clinical presentations, stroke types, angiographic findings, etiologies, treatment strategies and outcomes were compared between cases with isolated MCAD or ICAD-MCAD. There were 23 cases (male, 46%; mean age, 22.9 ± 19.5 years) with 24 events of isolated MCAD and 31 cases (male, 47%; mean age, 22.2 ± 12.9 years) with 35 events of ICAD-MCAD. The types of stroke in isolated MCAD group included subarachnoid hemorrhage (12%) and cerebral infarction (88%); and in ICAD-MCAD group were subarachnoid hemorrhage (6%) and cerebral infarction (94%). The presenting symptoms were similar between both groups. Fluctuating course was more often in isolated MCAD than in ICAD-MCAD (17% vs. 3%, p = 0.061). Recurrence of dissection events in both groups was infrequent (4% vs. 9%, p = 0.56). Both groups had high case-fatality rates (MCAD, 48%; ICAD-MCAD, 58%). The cause of dissection in both groups was idiopathic in the majority. Congenital vessel wall defects were found in 26% of ICAD-MCAD, but in only 4% of isolated MCAD (p = 0.066). In contrast, preceded trauma was more often found in isolated MCAD than ICAD-MCAD (35% vs. 19%, p = 0.085). Arteritis was noted in 16% of ICAD-MCAD patients, but none in isolated MCAD. Angiography revealed segmental stenosis in 72% of isolated MCAD and 96% of ICAD-MCAD. Aneurysmal dilatation of the involved cerebral arteries was noted in 28% of isolated MCAD, but none in MCAD-ICAD. Both isolated MCAD and ICAD-MCAD can cause vascular events with high mortality rates. Several aspects differed between 2 groups, including clinical course, underlying etiologies and angiographic findings. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0029995027	Evaluation of intracranial and extracranial carotid steno-occlusive diseases in Taiwan Chinese patients with MR angiography: Preliminary experience	Background and Purpose: We attempted to evaluate the location of vascular lesions in cases of cerebrovascular steno-occlusive diseases in Chinese persons living in Taiwan. Methods: With three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) as a screening tool, 108 symptomatic patients with cerebrovascular steno-occlusive diseases were examined. Cardioembolic disease and cerebral hemorrhage cases were evaluated. The degrees of stenosis of bilateral cervical carotid arteries and their major intracranial tributaries were recorded. They were categorized as nonsignificant stenosis (0% to 49%), significant stenosis (50% to 99%), and total occlusion. Results: Our data revealed that 32.4% of the cases were normal in either cervical carotid arteries or their intracranial tributaries. In 24.1% of the cases, significant extracranial-carotid stenosis or occlusion was the only finding on MRA. In 25.9% of the cases, only significant intracranial-tributary stenosis was found. In 17.6% of them, significant lesions were found in both extracranial and intracranial carotid artery tributaries. Conclusions: A racial difference between Chinese and white patients in location of lesion in cerebrovascular steno-occlusive diseases was confirmed. About one third of symptomatic Chinese patients living in Taiwan showed small-vessel disease. Approximately 24% of patients had only extracranial carotid disease, and about 26% had only intracranial carotid tributary disease. We need a larger series of patients to confirm these findings. However, MRA might be a good screening tool for steno-occlusive cerebrovascular diseases, especially in persons of a race with more- intracranial carotid disease, such as the Chinese.

0030016049	Reverse jugular flow in a case of thrombosis of the brachiocephalic vein with an artificial arteriovenous fistula - A case report	Thrombosis of the thoracic inlet veins following placement of a central venous catheter is a well-known complication, and several findings have been reported by color Doppler sonography. However, reverse jugular flow resulting from this complication is rarely mentioned and should be differentiated from another complication of iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula between neck vessels. The authors here describe a uremic patient with an artificial arteriovenous fistula in the forearm complicated with thrombosis of the ipsilateral brachiocephalic vein. Factors permitting the differential diagnosis by color Doppler sonography and clinical conditions are proposed.

0030038382	In hypercholesterolemia, lower peripheral monocyte count is unique among the major predictors of atherosclerosis	Many studies have shown that enhanced monocyte adherence is an important factor in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Because the relationships between circulating monocyte count and atherosclerosis or its major predictors have received little attention, we conducted this study with the aim of clarifying these relationships. The study included 409 men and women who underwent a carotid artery duplex study and white blood cell analysis (Sysmex Cell Counter) during a 2-day health check at our hospital in 1994. We found no correlation between preexisting carotid atherosclerosis and monocyte count. After adjustment for age and sex, hypercholesterolemia, among the major predictors of atherosclerosis, showed a unique correlation with both lower monocyte count and percentage (P<.001, P<.0001, respectively), whereas smoking was correlated with a higher monocyte count (P<.001). There was a slight but nonsignificant increase in monocyte count in hypertension, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Our results imply that: (1) hypercholesterolemia has a strong, peripheral monocyte-reducing effect, probably due to direct enhancement of monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, which subsequently initiates the atherosclerotic process, and (2) the mechanisms of other predictor(s)-induced atherosclerosis may be quite different from that of hypercholesterolemia. Another possible explanation for the inverse correlation between monocyte count and serum cholesterol level is that decreased monocyte levels might lead to hypercholesterolemia because of decreased uptake of cholesterol from the plasma by less monocyte-derived macrophages. The reasons why preexisting carotid atherosclerosis did not correlate with monocyte count are also discussed.

0029737928	Color Doppler ultrasonography in deep vein thrombosis of the legs: A comparison with contrast venography	Background: Symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a life-threatening disease. Recently, color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) has been used as a substitution for contrast venography (CV) in diagnosing DVT because of its convenience and safety. In this study, the findings of CDU are compared to those of CV in symptomatic DVT patients. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one legs of 21 patients with symptomatic lower limb DVT, having received CDU and CV concomitantly, were included in this study. CDU was assessed on the proximal femoropopliteal (proximal) and the distal calf (distal) veins. The detection rate of CDU was estimated by comparing its findings to those of CV. Results: Of 21 legs studied, DVT was found by both CV and CDU in 17. Based on CV as a standard, the detection rate using CDU was 100% and 75% in proximal and distal DVT, respectively. Conclusion: For detection of lower limb DVT, CDU is reliable. The value of CDU in DVT screening is stressed for its convenience and safety.

0030245916	Is ataxic gait the predominant presenting manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease? Experience of 14 Chinese cases from Taiwan	Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is caused by an unusual prion protein. Rare CJD cases have been reported in Chinese individuals. This report describes the clinical manifestations of 14 Chinese individuals with clinically definite CJD from the National Taiwan University Hospital during the period 1976-1995. it is the largest case series of Chinese CJD up to now. All these patients fulfil the clinical definite diagnosis of CJD proposed by Brown et al. (1986), including rapidly evolving dementia, myoclonus, periodic electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (0.5-2 Hz) and death within 12 months. The clinical characteristics of the present series, including age at onset, sex ratio, duration, initial symptoms, neurological signs, EEG abnormalities, and neuroimaging studies were similar to those reported in other countries. However, there is a high incidence of initial ataxic gait as the presentation in our patients. Eight (57%) out of 14 patients initially had gait ataxia alone or in association with dementia. CJD should be considered in the differential provisional diagnosis of any middle-aged patient with a progressive ataxic syndrome.

0030442989	Diagnosis and follow-up of carotid-cavernous fistulas by carotid duplex sonography and transcranial color Doppler imaging	To investigate the suitability of extracranial carotid duplex (ECD) and transcranial color Doppler imaging (TCDI) in the diagnosis and follow-up of treatment in patients with carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCF), combined ECD and TCDI examinations were studied in seven patients with traumatic CCF. According to angiography, four patients had direct CCF, two indirect CCF and one both direct and indirect CCF. In ECD, hemodynamic parameters of the feeding artery showed an abnormally increased flow volume and decreased resistivity indices in five direct CCFs from the internal carotid artery and one indirect CCF from the external carotid artery. Direct visualization of the CCF was achieved in patients with direct CCF only, and revealed itself as a heterogeneous mosaic flash resulting from high flow velocities and turbulence. Patterns of venous drainage were detected via the transorbital and transforaminal windows in seven and five patients (four direct and one indirect CCF patients), respectively. These abnormal findings were improved or even normalized after successful treatment. In conclusion, combined ECD and TCDI examinations appear to be useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of CCF.

0030482185	Ultrasonographic study and long-term follow-up of Takayasu's arteritis	Background and Purpose: Takayasu's arteritis is an inflammatory vasculopathy involving the aorta and its major branches. Little information is available on the natural history and temporal profile of changes in the carotid vessels, the major vessels involved in Takayasu's arteritis. Duplex ultrasonography may provide a reliable and efficient tool for the characterization and follow-up of the brachiocephalic vascular changes in Takayasu's arteritis. Methods: Sixteen female patients fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria for Takayasu's arteritis were studied. Mean age at onset was 23.6 years (SD=6.0), and mean duration of follow-up was 17.1 years (SD=11.9). The clinical features were analyzed. Only one patient had had a stroke. They had undergone at least one duplex scanning examination to evaluate the brachiocephalic vessels, including the extracranial carotid, vertebral, and subclavian arteries. Six patients underwent sequential duplex examination and long-term clinical follow-up. Results: All the studied patients had subclavian artery involvement, and 11 (69%) had common carotid artery involvement. The percentage of bilateral concomitant involvement was 100% in the common carotid artery and 33% in the subclavian artery. Homogeneous circumferential intima-media thickening was commonly seen in stenotic common carotid arteries (89%). Four patients had internal carotid artery involvement (all on the left side). In the serial duplex follow-up study, 2 of 6 patients had progressive vascular stenosis with concentric thickening, rather than longitudinal spreading, in the bilateral common carotid arteries. Left-side lesions were more prominent. Most were clinically stationary, despite severe stenosis or occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Conclusions: The characteristic vascular lesions and progression changes in Takayasu's arteritis detected by duplex ultrasonography are quite different from those seen in ordinary atherosclerosis. Homogeneous circumferential intima-media thickening of the common carotid arteries is a highly specific ultrasonographic finding in patients with Takayasu's arteritis, particularly young women. Sequential duplex scanning showed vascular progression to be unpredictable and unrelated to medication in our patients. Further clinical investigations of vascular progression are warranted, and duplex scanning may provide a simple, safe, and accurate long- term means of follow-up.

0031754699	Aetiologies and prognosis of Chinese patients with deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities	Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities is not frequently encountered in Oriental patients. We investigated its aetiology and prognosis in 143 patients (65 males, 78 females), presenting to the National Taiwan University Hospital over 4.3 years, diagnosed by colour Doppler ultrasonography. Swelling and pain of the lower extremities were the most frequent presenting symptoms. The left femoropopliteal veins were more frequently involved than other parts of the lower extremities. In these patients, malignancy with or without intravenous catheterization was the most frequent cause (39 patients, 27%). Other common aetiologies included coagulopathy (29 patients, 20%), immobilization (24 patients, 17%) and catheter-related (13 patients, 9%). No definite aetiology could be determined in 37 patients (26%). During follow-up, 27 patients (19%) died, mostly with malignancy. Pulmonary embolism was noted in 16 patients and was not significantly directly related to death. Compared to similar studies in Caucasian patients, there were significant differences in the aetiology of DVT, with malignancy and coagulopathy more common in these Chinese patients.

0031411538	The Stroke and Cerebral Atherosclerosis Study of National Taiwan University Hospital (SCAN): Background and methodology	Extensive epidemiological studies of cerebrovascular diseases can provide important background information to develop effective strategies for treatment and prevention of stroke. In Taiwan, detailed information concerning stroke classification, subtypes of ischemic stroke, in-hospital stroke, case-fatality rate, characteristics and pattern of cerebral atherosclerosis, and risk factors for stroke and atherosclerosis are still poorly understood. The 'Stroke and Cerebral Atherosclerosis Study of National Taiwan University Hospital' (SCAN) project has therefore been designed as a longitudinal hospital-based study to investigate some of these issues. We apply case series and stroke registry methods to study the various epidemiological and pathophysiological characteristics of different types of stroke. Data bank of duplex sonographic study of physical check-up subjects serves as a source of observation in the pattern and severity of atherosclerosis in carotid arteries. Base-line information concerning study design, characteristics of studied subjects, definitions of diagnosis and parameters of different investigations are presented. The interrater reliability of ischemic stroke classification is good among 3 major raters (Kappa [K]= 0.72 and 0.73). The SCAN project is thought to disclose many important aspects of epidemiological features of cerebrovascular diseases in Taiwan.

The study was carried out in Ta-an District of Taipei City and Chin-shan Hsiang of Taipei County. They represented an urban and a rural area of northern Taiwan respectively. We employed two-phase and three-phase procedures for case finding and case confirmation for patients with dementia. The prevalence rates of dementia, subtypes of dementia, and behavioral problems were studied for the patients. The caregiver experiences and burden were also investigated. The present study involved multidisciplinary groups of researchers. This may partially give insight into the multidimensional problems of dementia in Taiwan.

0031440089	Subtypes of ischemic stroke: A hospital-based stroke registry in Taiwan (SCAN-IV)	Background and Purpose: To better understand the clinical pattern and further elucidate the risk factors and outcome in different subtypes of cerebral infarction (CI) of the Chinese in Taiwan, we analyzed the National Taiwan University Hospital Stroke Registry in 1995 and performed an ethnic comparison with similar data banks. Methods: From the National Taiwan University Hospital Stroke Registry in 1995, 676 patients (383 men and 293 women; mean age, 64.9 years; SD, 13.8 years; range, 1 to 98 years) with CI were recruited for this analysis. CI was classified into five subtypes based on clinical manifestations, ultrasonographic studies, and neuroimaging findings: large-artery atherosclerosis, lacunae, cardioembolism, other less common determined causes, and undetermined cause. Vascular risk factors, extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis, and 30-day case-fatality rates were investigated in each subtype of CI. Results: Of all CI patients, 17%, 29%, 20%, 6%, and 29% were classified as large-artery atherosclerosis, lacunae, cardioembolism, other determined causes, and undetermined cause subtypes, respectively. The present results were compared with those from eight similar Western stroke registries. The relative incidence of lacunar CI in Chinese patients was more common, but large-artery atherosclerotic CI was less common than in whites. Hypertension was frequently seen in CI patients, especially in those with lacunae (85%) and large-artery atherosclerosis (69%). Patients with cardioembolism had a higher percentage of atrial fibrillation (69%), left ventricular hypertrophy, and ischemic heart disease than the other patients. Patients with large-artery atherosclerosis had more vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and carotid stenosis. Cardioembolic patients had higher case-fatality rates than other CI patients. Of the cardioembolic patients, 173% and 21.8% died within 30 days and during hospitalization, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of CI subtypes varied in different stroke registries. This may be partly due to applied classification criteria and racial-ethnic differences. Awareness of the risk factors and outcome in each subtype of stroke may afford further insights into the surveillance and treatment of cerebrovascular disease.

0032054346	Subtypes and case-fatality rates of stroke: A hospital-based stroke registry in Taiwan (SCAN-IV)	Stroke data bank can afford important information regarding risk factors, pathogenesis, prognosis, etc. By means of hospital-based stroke registry, we investigated the risk factors and case-fatality rates in different types of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients at the National Taiwan University Hospital in 1995. After excluding ineligible patients, 995 patients aged 1-98 years (575 men and 420 women) were recruited. Men predominated in all age groups for stroke and TIA in general except for cerebral hemorrhage (CH) in patients aged <35 years and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in patients aged ≤45 years. Of these, 676 (67.9%), 41 (4.1%), 228 (22.9%) and 50 (5%) patients were classified in the categories of cerebral infarction (CI), TIA, CH and SAH, respectively. The CI/CH ratio was 2.96. Hypertension remained one of the most important risk factors for CI, CH and TIA patients. Severe extracranial carotid artery stenosis (≤50%) was found in 12% of the CI patients and 27% of the TIA patients, but not found in the CH and SAH patients. Of these patients, the 30-day case-fatality rate was 10.9%, highest in SAH (30%), followed by CH (24.1%) and CI (5.6%). There were 41 in-hospital stroke patients who had significantly higher case-fatality rates than the other stroke patients (P<0.001 for all stroke, CI and CH patients by χ

We report a case who showed constructional impairment with clinical and neuroimaging features of CBD. The patient, a 64-year-old right-handed woman, presented with an insidious onset and slow progression of myoclonic jerks and dystonic contracture of her left hand within a year prior to this presentation. On examination, there were cortical sensory deficits and ideomotor apraxia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an asymmetrical fronto-parietal cortical atrophy with more severity in the right parietal region. In the study of single photon emission computer tomography, regions of hypoperfusion were shown in the right parietal lobe as well as in the right basal ganglion. Although she achieved a full score for the Mini-mental State Examination and showed no impairments in simple figure copying, she presented constructional impairment in such psychometry items as Block Design, Object Assembly, and Digital-Symbol(table). In addition, she showed difficulties in global level perception of the global-local analysis and visuopraxic errors in Bender-Gestalt test.

2442701755	QTc dispersion as a prognostic factor in intracerebral hemorrhage	QTc dispersion in the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a new important prognostic factor for many diseases, but its role in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is not clear. This study was performed to investigate the prognostic significance of QTc dispersion in the acute ICH patients. We studied the differences of QTc dispersion from the initial ECG in the ED between the survival to discharge and nonsurvival patients retrospectively. We found that the patients had lesser chance to survival to discharge if they had increased QTc dispersion, longer maximal QTc interval, lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and brainstem involvement in the univariate analyses. The QTc dispersion and GCS were the statistically significant independent predictors in the multiple logistic analyses. Increased QTc dispersion in the initial ED electrocardiograph is an important prognostic factor for ICH patients. More attention to the disposition and intensive care should be given for these patients. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

2642543895	Stroke in women of reproductive age: Comparison between stroke related and unrelated to pregnancy	Pregnancy may increase the risk of stroke. However, few studies have compared strokes in women of reproductive age that occur in pregnancy or the puerperium (pregnancy-related stroke, PRS) with those unrelated to pregnancy. This study assesses risk factors and etiologies of stroke in these women based on relationship to pregnancy. From 1984 to 2002, all female patients 15 through 40 years of age with a first-ever stroke at National Taiwan University Hospital were included in this study. PRS was defined as patients who had stroke occurrence during pregnancy or within 6 weeks postpartum. Stroke was categorized as cerebral infarction (CI), cerebral hemorrhage (CH), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and divided into subtype according to etiology. Risk factors and etiologies were compared for patients with PRS and stroke unrelated to pregnancy. We identified 49 patients with PRS, and 353 patients with stroke unrelated to pregnancy. There was no statistically significant difference in distribution of CI subtypes. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) was more common in PRS than stroke unrelated to pregnancy (39% vs. 7%, P<0.001), and 73% of these cases occurred postpartum. Preeclampsia-eclampsia was an important cause of peripartum CH (37%), but not CI (4%). Among PRS cases, postpartum cerebral venous thrombosis and preeclampsia-eclampsia were the major causes of CI and CH, respectively. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

27744566043	Hypotensive spinal cord infarction associated with vertebral body infarction after treatment with short-acting antihypertensive agent	Spinal cord infarction is a rare condition with heterogeneous causes. An 80-year-old diabetic woman was brought to the emergency department because of retrosternal pain and high blood pressure. Twenty minutes after treatment with sublingual nitroglycerin and short-acting oral antihypertensive agent, blood pressure had dropped from 201/91 mm Hg to 158/68 mm Hg, followed by abrupt onset of weakness in lower limbs, urinary retention and sensory loss in bilateral T4-L1 levels and the left lower limb at two hours after treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed contrast-enhanced and high-intensity lesions in the mid and lower thoracic cord, which were consistent with ischemic changes within the spinal cord and in the T4 vertebral body. After rehabilitation therapy for 2 months, she became able to ambulate with the aid of a walker. To reduce the risk of hypotensive sequelae such as spinal cord infarction, blood pressure should be closely monitored in elderly patients presenting with retrosternal chest pain who are treated with short-acting oral antihypertensive agent, particularly when additional risk factors such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus or hypertension are present.

2942596166	Evaluation of vertebral artery hypoplasia and asymmetry by color-coded duplex ultrasonography	Distinguishing stenosis and hypoplasia of the extracranial vertebral artery (VA) is clinically important, but there is no agreement in defining VA hypoplasia. We endeavored to attain reference values for VA flow volume by color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU), analyze age and gender effects on VA flow volume and develop a definition of VA hypoplasia. CDU was performed in 447 subjects free of cerebrovascular diseases or carotid stenosis. The VA diameter, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, time-averaged mean velocity, resistance index (RI) and flow volume were recorded bilaterally. We found significant asymmetries in diameter, flow velocities and flow volume with left-sided dominance. Diameters were different on left (0.297 ± 0.052 cm) and right (0.323 ± 0.057) sides (p < 0.001). Flow volume was different on right (83.0 ± 36.9 mL/min) and left (96.6 ± 42.4) sides (p < 0.001). Women had significantly smaller diameters, higher flow velocities and lower RIs than men. VA flow volume did not change with aging. We defined hypoplasia as a significant decrease in flow velocities and increase in RI for VA diameters < 0.22 cm. This definition is supported by findings of an increase in ipsilateral flow resistance (RI ≥ 0.75), contralateral diameter (side-to-side diameter difference ≥ 0.12 cm), and flow volume (side-to-side flow volume ratio ≥ 5). This definition and these reference values may lead to better differentiation between congenital variation and steno-occlusion clinically.

2942619982	Diagnosis of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas by carotid duplex sonography	Objective. To validate carotid duplex sonography (CDS) in diagnosis of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) against the standard of cerebral catheter angiography. Methods. We investigated 35 patients with dural AVFs and 64 patients without dural AVFs confirmed by the catheter angiographic studies. Twenty CDS parameters in 4 categories, including resistive index (RI), flow volume, peak systolic velocity, and end-diastolic velocity, were evaluated. Abnormal CDS findings were defined as the data above 95th percentile or below 5th percentile values from 180 control subjects. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy in each CDS parameter. Results. The parameter of RI of the external carotid artery (ECA; cutoff points: right, 0.72; left, 0.71) yielded the highest sensitivity (74%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (79%), negative predictive value (86%), and accuracy (84%) for predicting dural AVFs. All other ECA-related parameters yielded sensitivity lower than 70%, and those related to the internal carotid artery were lower than 30%. The sensitivity values for the parameter of RI of the ECA in different locations of dural AVFs were 54% (7 of 13 patients) in cavernous sinus dural AVFs and 86% (19 of 22 patients) in non-cavernous sinus dural AVFs (P = .05). Conclusions. The RI of the ECA is the best CDS parameter for predicting intracranial dural AVFs. Carotid duplex sonography can be used as the initial screening tool for diagnosis in patients having symptoms related to dural AVFs.

Here we report the case of a young female patient with NF1 who suffered from a fatal middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct. In addition to the MCA infarct, head MRI also disclosed old infarcts at bilateral cerebella and multiple intracranial arterial steno-occlusions. Stroke related to NF1 cerebral vasculopathy was highly suggested after other diseases were excluded. Additionally, genetic analysis of the patient identified a novel mutation at the splicing donor site, c. 2409 + 2T > G that resulted in a splicing aberration. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33645653272	The development and validation of a dementia behavior disturbance inventory	Objective: To develop an instrument that measures observable problematic behaviors in patients with dementia. Methodology: We used focus group interviews to identify the problematic behaviors of patients with dementia. Eighty-two behaviors grouped into 12 domains were generated from the data collected from five different focus groups. After conducting a content validation process, a 72-item Dementia Behavior Disturbance Inventory (DBDI) rated by a frequency and a disturbance scale was formed. The DBDI was administered to 200 institutionalized elderly patients with dementia by formal caregivers for psychometric evaluation. Results: Inter-item correlation of items in each domain was performed for item reduction. Forty-eight items remained after this procedure. Exploratory factor analysis obtained nine factors that explained 59.2% and 59.6% of the total variance in the frequency and disturbance scales, respectively. Cronbach's α of the entire 48-item frequency and disturbance scales was 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. Most of the factors had acceptable internal consistency reliability. Test-re-test reliability coefficients of the frequency and disturbance scales were 0.78 and 0.64, respectively. The DBDI was weakly but positively related to functions of daily activities and ambulation. Conclusion: The DBDI demonstrates promising psychometrical properties as an instrument to assess problematic behaviors in elderly people with dementia. © 2005 International Psychogeriatric Association.

33746974380	Behavioral and psychologic symptoms in different types of dementia	Background/Purpose: Behavioral and psychologic symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are major sources of a caregiver's burden and also the most important factor when considering the need for institutionalization of dementia patients. BPSD occur in about 90% of patients with dementia. Studies comparing the BPSD in the major types of dementia using unitary behavioral rating scales are limited. We studied BPSD in patients with four major types of dementias from a memory clinic. Methods: We recruited patients with dementia from our memory clinic from January 2003 to February 2004. The Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) was used to measure BPSD severity. Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini Mental State Examination were used to determine dementia severity. Results: A total of 137 patients with four major types of dementia were recruited from 155 patients with dementia who attended the clinic during the study period. The main dementia types identified were Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in 54.8%, vascular dementia (VaD) in 20.6%, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in 8.4%, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in 4.5%, and other dementias in 11.6%. BPSD were found in 92.0% of the patients but only 43.1% received psychotropic treatment. The relative risk of receiving psychotropic treatment for BPSD subscales paralleled the extent of caregivers' burden as assessed by the BEHAVE-AD global rating. Type-specific BPSD, e.g. hallucination was identified for DLB, activity disturbances for FTD, anxiety and phobias for AD and affective disturbance for VaD. Conclusion: A strategy of targeting type-specific BPSD may be beneficial, such as environmental stimulus control for DLB patients who are prone to have hallucinations, design of a pacing path for patients with FTD who need support for symptoms of wandering and emotional support for patients with VaD who are susceptible to depression. © 2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33748436981	The Impact of Lesion Length on Angiographic Restenosis after Vertebral Artery Origin Stenting	Objective: To evaluate the effect of lesion length on in-stent restenosis (ISR) of vertebral artery (VA) origin stenting. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical and radiological records of patients receiving VA origin stenting from March 1999 to June 2005. They were subdivided according to lesion length. ISR was defined as >50% diameter narrowing in stent. Results: Eighty symptomatic patients (64 male, mean age 72 years) with 90 lesions treated with balloon expandable tubular coronary stents were enrolled. There were 34 patients with 38 short lesions (length ≤ 5 mm, group 1), 37 patients with 42 medium lesions (length > 5 mm, <10 mm, group 2) and 9 patients with 10 long lesions (length ≥ 10 mm, group 3). Eighty seven bare-metal stents and 3 drug-eluting stents were implanted. Repeat angiography was done in 40 lesions (44%) at 11.7 ± 9.6 months. The ISR rate in group 1, 2, 3 is 21%, 29%, and 50% (p = 0.486). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed lesion length was the only significant independent predictor of ISR (hazard ratio: 1.19, p = 0.039). Conclusion: ISR of VA origin stenting is common. Lesion length is an important predictor of ISR in VA origin stenting. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33845905521	Semantic memory deficits in low-educated patients with Alzheimer's disease	Background/Purpose: Although a deficit of semantic memory is evident in the dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), the underlying neuropsychologic mechanism remains controversial. Breakdown of the semantic network during the course of DAT and an inability to access semantic information have been postulated as possible explanations, but supporting data are limited, particularly in low-educated patients. This study examined semantic memory in low-educated patients with different degrees of dementia severity. Methods: In total, 197 adult subjects were recruited, including 165 DAT patients and 32 normal controls. Subjects were divided into four subgroups according to their dementia severity. All subjects completed an episodic memory task, the Six-Object Memory Test, and semantic memory tasks including the Object Naming Test, the Remote Memory Test and the Semantic Association of Verbal Fluency Test. One-way ANOVA and ANCOVA with a post hoc Scheffe's procedure were used to evaluate differences between groups. Results: All patients, irrespective of the degree of dementia, showed impaired performance on the Six-Object Memory Test [F(4, 163)=69.95, p<0.0001 for immediate recall; F(4, 163)=41.34, p<0.0001 for delayed recall]. On the semantic memory tasks, patients with moderate to severe dementia showed impaired performances on the Object Naming Test [F(4, 180)=28.25, p<0.0001] and the Remote Memory Test [F(4, 167)=26.22, p<0.0001 for recall; F(4, 167)=34.80, p<0.0001 for recognition], while all patients performed defectively on the Semantic Association of Verbal Fluency Test [F(4, 194)=70.43, p<0.0001]. Conclusion: Our results thus partially support the hypotheses that a loss of semantic structure and an inability to access semantic knowledge occur in the pathogenesis of DAT. ©2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33846860205	Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: A follow-up study in Taiwan	Background: Acute-disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, whose epidemiology, clinical presentations and functional outcome are incompletely understood in Asian populations. Objective: To assess the clinical presentations, predisposing factors and functional outcome of ADEM in Taiwan. Methods: 50 patients initially diagnosed with ADEM (male, 19; female, 31) were enrolled from 1991 to 2005. Diagnosis of ADEM or multiple sclerosis was established during a follow-up period of 2-120 months. 8 adult patients were noted to have taken the immunomodulatory drug, levamisole, within 3 months before onset of symptoms. The remaining 42 patients (male, 17; female, 25) were categorised by age as children (<16 years, n = 12), young adults (16-49 years, n = 21) and elderly adults (≥50 years, n = 9). The clinical manifestations, predisposing factors and radiological findings were compared between different age groups and adult patients with or without levamisole use. Functional outcome was compared by a log-rank test. Results: Preceding upper respiratory tract infection was evident in 21 (50%) patients and only one young-adult patient had received Rubella vaccine immunisation. The frequency of fever was higher in children (p = 0.04) and psychiatric symptoms were more prevalent in elderly patients (p = 0.03). Functional recovery was faster in children than in adults (p = 0.002). Initial Expanded Disability Status Scale score (odds ratio (OR) 1.9, p = 0.03) and no fever (OR 0.04, p = 0.06) were associated with poor outcome (modified Rankin scale ≥2). After a mean (SD) follow-up of 31.8 (9.9) months, 4 (9.5%) patients developed multiple sclerosis (3 (25%) children, 1 (4.7%) young adult, p = 0.03). The neurological disability, radiological and cerebrospinal fluid findings did not differ between patients with and without levamisole use. One elderly adult patient previously receiving levamisole developed multiple sclerosis of relapse-remitting type after a mean follow-up period of 36.9 months. Conclusion: The clinical presentations, functional outcome and risk of developing multiple sclerosis differed between different age groups. Functional recovery was faster in children than in adults. Poor functional outcome was related to initial high Expanded Disability Status Scale score and absence of fever.

33846973372	Feasibility of Endovascular Recanalization for Symptomatic Cervical Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion	Objectives: This study sought to report technical details and clinical results of the first series of endovascular recanalization for cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. Background: Cervical ICA occlusion is associated with impaired cerebral perfusion, which may lead to ischemic cerebral symptoms and hemodynamic infarcts. Neither surgical nor endovascular revascularization has been shown to benefit this population. Methods: Endovascular recanalization was attempted in 30 patients with ICA occlusions (27 men; age 72.1 ± 8.0 years, range 48 to 85 years). Recurrent neurologic deficit or cerebral ischemia by perfusion study, after known ICA occlusion, was noted in all patients. Strategies and devices for coronary occlusion intervention were applied, including microcatheter-supported tapered-tip stiff coronary guidewires. Contralateral ICA stenosis was found in 9 patients (30%). All patients underwent independent neurologic and duplex ultrasound follow-up. Results: The overall technical success rate was 73% (22 of 30). No neck hematoma, intracranial hemorrhage, or hyperperfusion was noted. One (3.3%) fatal brainstem infarction occurred 1 day after a successful ICA procedure, with angiographically proven acute basilar artery occlusion and patent ICA stent. Baseline ophthalmic artery flow was reversed in 15 of the 22 successfully recanalized patients, and was normalized in 12 after the procedure. There was no new cerebral ischemic event or neurologic death for a mean follow-up of 16.1 ± 18.5 months. Conclusions: Endovascular recanalization for cervical ICA occlusion is feasible with acceptable midterm clinical results. © 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

34547891523	Underrecognition and undertreatment of atherothrombotic diseases: REACH registry Taiwan baseline data	Background/Purpose: Atherothrombosis is a generalized disease affecting different vascular beds, making it the leading cause of death worldwide. To evaluate the long-term risk of atherothrombotic risk factors and determine the predictors for atherothrombotic events, an international, prospective, observational study was initiated, in which Taiwan was involved. Methods: The REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry recruited outpatients with either symptomatic atherothrombotic diseases or multiple risk factors. Baseline data were collected using a universal standard case report form. All subjects were followed to document future outcomes. In this paper, we analyzed the baseline data of the participants from Taiwan. Results: In the REACH Registry, a total of 67,888 subjects from 44 countries were recruited. Among the 1062 Taiwanese participants, 971 were symptomatic subjects and 91 subjects were with risk factors only (RFO). In comparison with the global participants, the Taiwan patients were younger, with a higher prevalence of males, lower prevalence of hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, former smokers, and a greater prevalence of non-smokers. The baseline prevalence rates were: hypertension, 46.5%; fasting hyperglycemia, 38.4%; hypercholesterolemia, 45.8%; and hypertriglyceridemia, 42.8%. All these prevalence were higher than the global data, indicating an undertreatment status for the Taiwanese patients. Only 29 (2.7%) peripheral arterial disease (PAD) subjects were recruited in Taiwan, suggesting underrecognition of this disease. The RFO Taiwanese patients had fewer former smokers and more non-smokers than the symptomatic patients, suggesting that smoking may be an important factor contributing to atherothrombotic diseases. Conclusion: In Taiwan, atherothrombotic outpatients were generally undertreated and PAD was underdiagnosed. © 2007 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

0033005946	Changes in hemodynamics of the carotid and middle cerebral arteries before and after endoscopic sympathectomy in patients with palmar hyperhidrosis: Preliminary results	Object. The purpose of this study was to analyze the change in carotid and middle cerebral artery (MCA) hemo-dynamics before and after endoscopic upper thoracic sympathectomy in patients with palmar hyperhidrosis (PH). Methods. Sixty-eight patients with PH (35 males and 33 females) for whom the average age was 24.5 ± 10.7 years (± standard deviation) were recruited into this study. These patients all underwent routine upper T-2 sympathectomy to treat their PH. Ultrasonography studies of the carotid arteries (CAs) and MCA were obtained in each patient before and after T-2 sympathectomy. The blood flow volume, flow velocity, and resistivity index (RI) in the bilateral common CAs (CCAs), internal CAs (ICAs), and external CAs (ECAs) were evaluated using duplex ultrasonography. The systolic peak velocity, mean velocity, diastolic peak velocity, pulsatility index, and RI of the bilateral MCAs were evaluated using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded during this study. The Student paired t-test was used to analyze the differences between studies before and after bilateral T-2 sympathectomy. There was a significant reduction in diastolic pressure after T-2 sympathectomy (p = 0.003), but not in systolic pressure or heart rate. The vessel diameter was increased after sympathectomy in the left CAs and right CCA. The T-2 sympathectomy led to significant elevation of blood flow volume and RI in the left CCA, ICA, and ECA (p < 0.05). The authors found significant increases in maximum flow velocity and RI in the left MCA (p < 0.05). Conclusions. Patients who underwent T-2 sympathectomy demonstrated a significant increase in blood flow volume and flow velocities of the CAs and MCA, especially on the left side. Asymmetry of sympathetic influence on the hemodynamics of the CAs and MCA was noted. The usefulness of sympathectomy for the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease deserves further investigation.

0032735067	Primary progressive aphasia: A case report and review of the literature	A 69-year-old female patient had shown slowly progressive aphasia for seven years. During the disease course, daily life functions and other domains of cognitive faculties were relatively well preserved and there were no behavioral or emotional problems reported by the family. On the contrary, this previously hot-tempered woman had become more tolerant of her family members. The mental status examination showed severe language disturbance, including verbal comprehension and expression, but other domains were relatively intact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies revealed predominantly left-side disturbance. Combined with thorough clinical observation, a clinical diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia was made. As a valid diagnosis, the correlation between clinical features and neuropathological findings have been controversial in the published literature, and the relationship with other global degenerative diseases are still under debate.

0033459481	Spontaneous oscillations of cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries of normal subjects and schizophrenic patients	Although many regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies of schizophrenic patients have been carried out, only a few studies have investigated real-time hemodynamic changes in schizophrenic patients. In the present study, we used long-term monitoring of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by non-invasive transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to obtain real- time CBF data in 55 schizophrenic patients and 20 normal comparison subjects. The mean blood flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) of the MCA were not constant during long-term monitoring. They showed sinusoidal oscillations similar to those described in previous reports. The amplitude variations of these oscillations in both drug-naive and medicated schizophrenic patients were significantly decreased compared with findings in normal control subjects. The averaged PI values were found to be decreased in patients with illness durations of more than 10 years. After withdrawal of antipsychotic medication, both the amplitude variations of oscillations and the PI values in the drug-withdrawn patients were significantly decreased relative to findings in normal control subjects. Our results show a decreased adjustment ability of cerebral vessel resistance not only in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients but also in patients with longer illness duration. Neuroleptics could affect the adjustment ability of vessel resistance.

0032926013	Common carotid artery thrombosis causing ischemic stroke in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus	Stroke due to major cerebral vessel occlusion in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is well known, but stroke due to recurrent common carotid artery (CCA) thrombosis is rarely reported. We describe a case of a 49-year- old woman with SLE who presented with recurrent weakness and numbness of the left side of her face and limbs. This was shown on extracranial ultrasound imaging and transcranial Doppler emboli recording to have resulted from a fresh thrombus on the right CCA. Some thrombotic risk factors (increased anticardiolipin antibody concentration, decreased free protein S concentration and nephrotic syndrome) were identified and anticoagulant and corticosteroid therapy was initiated.

0032945004	Cerebral venous thrombosis in patients with nephrotic syndrome - Case reports	The authors describe two cases of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in patients with nephrotic syndrome. The main clinical features of CVT were persistent headache, hemiparesis, and seizure, and the diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. Both showed acquired deficiency of free protein S. The neurologic symptoms remained stationary in the first patient, who received no anticoagulation therapy, but resolved rapidly in the second, treated with intravenous heparin and supplemented with fresh frozen plasma. CVT should be suspected in patients with nephrotic syndrome who present with symptoms of intracranial hypertension or any focal neurologic deficit.

0034092043	Carotid and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography in different types of carotid-cavernous fistula	Background and Purpose - Patients with carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) may undergo direct or indirect shunting. Ultrasonography has value that is complementary to angiography in the assessment and follow-up of these patients. The aim of this study was to characterize findings provided by carotid duplex sonography (CDS) and transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD) in patients with different types of CCF. Methods - CDS and TCCD were independently performed by technologists and neurologists. Digital subtraction or MR angiography was interpreted by a neuroradiologist. Ultrasonographic studies were categorized into 4 types: I, direct shunting only; II, direct shunting with a carotid aneurysm; III, indirect shunting only; and IV, mixed (direct and indirect) shunting. In addition to carotid and intracranial flow velocities, volume, and pulsatility, other direct and indirect ultrasound signs of shunting were evaluated. The direct sign of CCF was a mosaic flash detected by TCCD. Alteration of hemodynamic parameters on CDS and demonstration of draining veins with the use of TCCD were considered indirect signs. Results - Fifteen patients (8 men, 7 women) were included in the study. According to angiographic results, patients in ultrasonographic classification types I (n=7) and II (n=3) corresponded to type A of Barrow's classification. Patients with type III (n = 8) were Barrow's type C. Type IV (n=1) had a combination of Barrow's types A and C. On ultrasound, both direct and indirect signs were seen in types I, II, and IV CCF. The presence of a 2-colored oval mass divided by a zone of separation without turbulence differentiated type I from type II CCF. All patients with type III CCF had indirect signs, and only 1 patient had direct signs on TCCD. Abnormal TCCD findings were most commonly seen through the transorbital window (100%), followed by the transtemporal window (63%) and transforaminal window (40%). Conclusions - If only indirect ultrasonographic signs of CCF are present, TCCD can be used to predict an indirect CCF type on the basis of the origin of the fistula. With direct communication between carotid artery and cavernous sinus, both direct and indirect ultrasonographic signs can be found. The combination of CDS/TCCD may provide a noninvasive and reliable way to classify patients with CCF.

0033789636	Imaging in the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of vertebral artery dissection	The purpose of this report is to discuss the value of ultrasonographic examination in the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of vertebral artery dissection. We collected data on 8 patients with 11 pathologic vessels: 9 were affected intracranially and 6 were affected extracranially. Four vessels were affected in both intracranial and extracranial segments. Extracranial color-flow duplex sonography could detect abnormalities in every extracranial vertebral artery dissection. Most abnormal findings were non-specific, including severely reduced flow, absence of flow, and absence of diastolic flow. A specific finding (intramural hematoma) was noted in one artery. Abnormal transcranial color-coded sonographic findings included absence of flow, reduced velocity and reversed flow direction. Three intracranial dissecting arteries showed normal findings on transcranial color-coded sonography. Ultrasonographic follow-up study revealed evidence of improvement; this was noted almost exclusively in the extracranial segments of the vertebral artery but infrequently in the intracranial segment. Extracranial color-flow duplex sonography is sensitive in the detection of extracranial vertebral artery dissection, both in initial diagnosis and in follow-up evaluation.

0033942707	Hospital arrival time after onset of different types of stroke in greater Taipei	Background and purpose: The effectiveness of stroke treatment is highly dependent on the post-onset time of treatment. Recent reports have established the importance of aggressive medical or surgical intervention in the hyperacute stage. In order to design an appropriate treatment program for acute stroke patients, we studied the arrival time after onset of different types of stroke at a tertiary medical center serving the greater Taipei area. Methods: This was a prospective study of acute stroke patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) during a 1-year period (1997). There were 842 patients with accurate records of hospital arrival time who were either directly or indirectly admitted to the ED during the study period. Each stroke patient had a diagnosis of either cerebral infarction (CI), cerebral hemorrhage (CH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or transient ischemic attack (TIA). CI was further divided into five subtypes: large artery atherothrombosis, lacunae, cardioembolism, other specific causes, and undetermined cause. The arrival time after stroke onset was stratified into seven different time intervals: 0 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours, and 1 to 3, 3 to 7, and more than 7 days. Results: Stroke patients who came directly to the ED arrived much sooner after onset than those who came via an indirect route (80.5% vs 36.5% in the first 24 hours). Of the 617 patients in the direct group, the percentage of patients arriving at the ED within 3 hours after onset was significantly greater among CH (66.2%), SAH (68.4%), and TIA (57.9%) patients than among CI (27.4%) patients. The percentage of CI patients who arrived early (0 to 3 hours) was significantly higher in those with cardioembolism (56.3%) than in those with large artery atherothrombosis (24,5%), lacunae (15.3%), other specific causes (13.6%), or undetermined cause (23.2%). Conclusions: These results show that direct transportation to the ED after stroke onset resulted in shorter treatment delay; hospital arrival time varied significantly among the different types of stroke and subtypes of CI. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke (CH and SAH) and cardioembolism were sent to the ED with the shortest delay. These results may be useful in strategic planning for stroke management.

0033988578	Risk factors and incidence of postoperative delirium elderly Chinese patients	Objectives: To investigate the incidence of postoperative delirium among elderly patients and to examine the interrelationship between basic vulnerability and precipitating factors for delirium. Design and Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. Data were collected in a tertiary medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. From the 1st to the 5th postoperative day, nurses assessed patients using a confusion-screening tool. Patients with signs of delirium were closely examined for changes in behavior and cognitive status and vital signs, and laboratory data were collected to further validate the organic etiology of delirium. Patients were finally diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria in consensus meetings. Subjects: Seven hundred and one elderly patients, that were admitted consecutively for elective orthopedic or urologic surgery, were enrolled in this study. All subjects met the following criteria: (1) 65 years of age or older; (2) able to communicate orally in Chinese, and (3) not unconscious, delirious, deaf, or aphasic upon admission. Results: The overall incidence of delirium among these subjects was 5.1%. Logistic regression analysis identified that older age and preexisting cognitive impairment were vulnerability factors, and that the use of psychoactive drugs was a precipitating factor for delirium. Patients with both basic vulnerability and the precipitating factor had a 56-fold increased probability of delirium (0.28 vs. 0.005 in comparison with those who did not exhibit these factors). Conclusion: Few risk factors of postoperative delirium in the older Chinese sample were identified. The only modifiable risk factor appears to be the use of psychoactive drugs.

38449103861	Midlife risk factors for subtypes of dementia: A nested case-control study in Taiwan	OBJECTIVE:: To identify the midlife risk factors for subtypes of dementia newly developed later in life. METHODS:: A nested case-control study was conducted on 157 demented cases and 628 comparison cases selected from 40,636 men and women who were enrolled from 1982 to 1992. Four comparison cases were frequency-matched on age, time at enrollment (within 6 months), gender, and residential township. Midlife risk factors included vascular risk factors (body mass index [BMI], total cholesterol, total triglycerides, blood glucose, cerebrovascular accident [CVA] history, diabetes mellitus history, and hypertension history), cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. Dementia assessments were ascertained through the computerized data linkage from National Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2002 and clinically confirmed by neurologists or psychiatrists. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the matched odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each risk factor. RESULTS:: A J-shaped relationship was observed between BMI (kg/m) and dementia. The multivariate-adjusted ORs (95% CI) of developing dementia were 1.84 (1.02ĝ€"3.33), 1.87 (1. 08ĝ€"3.23) and 2.44 (1.39ĝ€"4.28), respectively, for BMIs of <20.5, 23.0ĝ€"25.4, ĝ‰¥25.5 compared with a BMI of 20.5ĝ€"22.9 as the referent group (OR ≤ 1.0). Similar findings were observed for Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). The association between obesity (BMI ĝ‰¥25.5) and both AD and VaD was statistically significant among cigarette smokers but not among nonsmokers. Additionally, history of CVA was a significant risk factor for VaD, but not for AD. CONCLUSION:: Being underweight, being overweight, and a cerebrovascular accident in midlife may increase the risk of dementia in late life. © 2007 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

32944478543	Validity and reliability of a Taiwan Chinese version of the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia	Objective: The Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSI-D) has been reported to be sensitive. The authors examined the reliability and validity of a Chinese (Taiwanese) version of the CSI-D for elderly patients. Methods: Four groups were tested with the CSI-D: 31 with mild or moderate dementia; 32 non-dementia, depressed subjects; and 34 low-education, and 30 high-education normal-comparison subjects. Patients with dementia or depression were selected from outpatients of two hospitals. Testing was carried out in either the community or outpatient setting. Results: The internal consistency, interrater reliability, and test-retest reliability of the CSI-D were good. The CSI-D was highly correlated with scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination and 10-word-list-learning task. Correlation with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale was not significant. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis suggested that the CSI-D was a good instrument in differentiating dementia from depression and normal subjects with low education. It had good sensitivity and specificity. Education was related to the cognitive scores but not related to informant scores. The combination of an informant interview with a cognitive test enhanced the performance of the CSI-D. Conclusions: The Taiwan Chinese version of the CSI-D is psychometrically sound, brief, easy to complete, and therefore suitable as a screening instrument far dementia in Taiwan. The study reinforces earlier suggestions that the informant interview yields improved validity for detecting dementia. © 2005 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

32244435986	Third ventricle midline shift due to spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage evaluated by transcranial color-coded sonography	Objective. We aimed to assess the clinical usefulness of the third ventricle midline shift (MLS) evaluated by transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) in acute spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods. Consecutive patients with acute (<24 hours after symptom onset) ICH were recruited for this TCCS study. Sonographic measurement of MLS and the pulsatility index (PI) of the middle cerebral arteries were compared with head computed tomographic (CT) data, including MLS, and hematoma volume. Poor functional outcome at 30 days after stroke onset was defined as modified Rankin scale greater than 2. Results. There were 51 patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH who received CT and TCCS studies within a 12-hour window. Correlation between MLS by TCCS (mean ± SD, 3.2 ± 2.6 mm) and CT (3.0 ± 2.4 mm) was high (γ = 0.91; P < .01). There was also a good linear correlation between hematoma volume and MLS by TCCS (γ = 0.81; P < .01). Compared with ICH volume less than 25 mL, those with greater volume had more severe MLS and a higher PI of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (P < .001 ). Midline shift by TCCS was more sensitive and specific than the PI in detecting large ICH (accuracy = 0.82 if MLS ≥ 2.5 mm), and it was also a significant predictor of poor outcome (odds ratio, 2.09 by 1-mm increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.13). Conclusions. Midline shift may be measured reliably by TCCS in spontaneous supratentorial ICH. Our study also showed that MLS on TCCS is a useful and convenient method to identify patients with large ICH and hematoma expansion and to predict short-term functional outcome. © 2006 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

34249075719	Transcranial color-coded sonography helps differentiation between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and vascular parkinsonism	Background: Recently, transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) has been found to have a diagnostic value in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), which displays increased hyperechogenicity at the substantia nigra (SN). Objective: To use TCCS, to assess the difference in SN hyperechogenicity and intracranial hemodynamics among subjects with IPD, vascular parkinsonism (VP) and controls. Methods: Eighty IPD and 30 VP patients, and 60 controls were recruited into this study. The hyperechogenicity area at the SN and midbrain were calculated by encircling the outer circumference from the ipsilateral temporal window, using TCCS in each subject. The hemodynamics of intracranial large arteries, including flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI), were also measured. Results: The presence of SN hyperechogenicity was significantly higher in the IPD patients than in the VP patients and controls (84% vs. 20% & 5%, respectively, p < 0.001). In IPD patients, the SN hyperechogenicity was correlated with the neurological severity and disease duration. Twenty-five (66.7%) VP patients had obvious vascular abnormality, as seen in TCCS study. The mean PI was significantly more elevated in the VP patients than those in the IPD patients and controls (all p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference of flow velocities among the VP, IPD patients and controls. Conclusions: TCCS, combining B-mode imaging for SN echogenicity and trancranial Doppler for intracranial hemodynamics, is a useful diagnostic tool in the differentiation between IPD and VP. These findings also suggest that multiple subcortical vascular lesions may damage the basal ganglia and thalamocortical circuit and result in parkinsonism features in VP patients. © 2007 Steinkopff-Verlag.

58149305713	Guidelines for the general management of patients with acute ischemic stroke	The content of the second edition of "Guideline for General Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke" was amended from the first edition of that of the Taiwan Stroke Society in 2002. The format of the guideline followed the common unified instruction for the project of "The establishment of clinical guidelines for the top 10 payments diseases of the National Health Insurance at the departments of inpatients, emergency and outpatients" as recommended by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI). The guideline was revised after several official meetings of local experts, as well as citation from the latest updated guidelines of the United States and the European Stroke academic groups. Before editing notice, the final evaluation was performed by the review team of the NHRI. Application of the guideline is dedicated or designated to the patients with acute ischemic stroke, and which is applied only limited to the general management. Guidelines for subacute or chronic phase, or the specific treatment for ischemic stroke patients will be published in separated articles. Management of most of the needs for patients with acute ischemic stroke must be completed in a very short period of time. It is recommended that hospitals providing stroke service to set up stroke unit, and to organize an integrated stroke team consisting of specialists from multiple disciplines. Upon arrival to the hospitals, patients should undergo the brain computed tomography, and related examinations and assessment as soon as possible to guide the choice of treatment reference for acute intervention. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment within three hours is effective in reducing disability for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke patients with or without persistent symptoms should start antiplatelet therapy immediately, generally aspirin. Dose-adjusted warfarin (INR range of 2.0-3.0) is recommended for ischemic stroke patients with persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to prevent secondary embolism. The routine use of heparin and drugs theoretically preventing further brain injury, including steroids, neuroprotectants, plasma volume expanders, barbiturates, and streptokinase, has not been proven benefits for recommendation.

4344664673	Clinical characteristics of stroke among Chinese in New York City	Background: Limited information exists on clinical characteristics of stroke among Chinese persons living in the United States. We compared the clinical characteristics of Chinese and White stroke patients living in New York City. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of stroke patients hospitalized at NYU Downtown Hospital from January 1995 to July 1998. Results: During 3.5 years, there were 728 admissions for stroke (454 Chinese, 115 Whites, 75 Blacks, 80 Hispanics, and 4 other Asia). Chinese and White patients had similar age and gender distributions. Compared with Whites, Chinese patients had a lower body mass index (22.8 vs 25.8, respectively, P=0.02), were less likely to smoke (13% vs 20%, respectively, P<0.01), or regularly consume alcohol (8% vs 25%, respectively, P<0.01). Although recorded blood pressure was similar, Chinese patients were more likely than Whites to have a history of hypertension (77% vs 64%, respectively, P=0.03), left ventricular hypertrophy (37% vs 25%, respectively, P=0.02), history of diabetes (33% vs 21%, respectively, P=0.01), and higher levels of blood lipids and glucose. Chinese patients were more likely than Whites to have hemorrhagic stroke (24% vs 17%, respectively, P=0.02). Overall age-adjusted in-hospital mortality rate was 14.2%, and no significant difference was observed between Chinese and Whites (13.8% vs 14.8%, respectively, P=01). For both races, hemorrhagic stroke was far more likely to be fatal than ischemic stroke (34.5% vs 6.1%, respectively, P<0.001). Factors associated with in-hospital death included systolic blood pressure, blood glucose level, history of coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Conclusions: Chinese patients who suffered a stroke showed higher risk profiles, and were more likely to experience a more lethal hemorrhagic stroke, compared to White patients. The short-term in-hospital survival rates were similar between Chinese and White patients with stroke.

42949103086	Ultrasonography in intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula	Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are abnormal arteriovenous shunts located in the intracranial dura mater. While invasiveness of conventional cerebral catheter angiography impedes regular investigation, more and more studies have attempted to use ultrasonography to detect hemodynamic changes associated with dural AVFs. For example, the use of carotid duplex sonography in patients with dural AVFs has shown that these patients usually have a lower resistance index than normal subjects in the feeding arteries, including the external carotid artery and its branches. In addition, cerebral circulation time (CCT), which is the time delay between enhancement in the carotid artery and the contralateral internal jugular vein after injection of a sonographic enhancing agent, can be measured using carotid duplex sonography. CCT values were shown to be significantly lower in dural AVF patients than those in control subjects. Furthermore, transcranial color-coded sonography may show high flow velocity, reverse flow direction and abnormal Doppler waveforms in cerebral veins/sinus and in the superior ophthalmic veins of dural AVF patients. While early diagnosis with long-term follow-up is important in dural AVFs, ultrasonography could be a potential screening and follow-up tool in patients with dural AVFs, considering the convenience, noninvasiveness, low cost and reproducibility of results with this procedure. © Elsevier & CTSUM.

42949148208	Safety and feasibility of drug-eluting stent implantation at vertebral artery origin: The first case series in Asians	Background/Purpose: Studies of the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation to treat vertebral artery (VA) ostial stenosis are lacking in the Asian population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of DES implantation to treat VA ostial stenosis in Asians. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical and radiologic records of patients receiving VA origin stenting with DES from October 2004 to September 2006 in the National Taiwan University Hospital. Results: Eleven symptomatic patients (9 male; mean age, 72 years) with 11 lesions treated with DES were included. There were eight lesions treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents and three lesions treated with sirolimus-eluting stents. The success rate for implantation of a DES was 100%. The percentage of stenosis was significantly reduced after stenting (86 ± 5 to 2 ± 4%; p < 0.001). No peri-interventional neurologic, vascular, or other medical complications were noted. All patients were asymptomatic at the mean follow-up time of 18.7 ± 8.6 months (range, 6-30 months). Two patients received repeat angiography at 4 or 8 months after stenting. No significant in-stent restenosis was found. Conclusion: Symptomatic VA origin stenosis can be treated safely and effectively with DES in Asians. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

44649122770	Predictors of survival and functional outcome in acute stroke patients admitted to the stroke intensive care unit	Multivariate models have not been widely used to predict the outcome of acute stroke patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The purpose of this study was to determine potential measures observed in the first 12 h post-stroke that predict early mortality and functional outcomes in ICU-admitted stroke patients. Eight hundred and fifty acute stroke patients (ischemic stroke, 508; intracerebral hemorrhage, 342) were included in this analysis between November 2002 and December 2006. Measures of interest were obtained in the first 12 h after onset of stroke were analyzed for three types of outcome: 3-month mortality, 3-month mortality or institutional care, and poor functional outcomes at discharge. Poor functional outcomes were defined as a Barthel index < 80 or a Rankin scale > 2. Multivariate regression models were used to determine the predictive value of the observed measures. After 3 months, 17% of patients had died; 21% were alive but being cared for in institutional settings; and 62% were alive and living at home. Functional status at discharge indicated 16% of patients had died, poor function in 50%, and good function in 34% of patients. Initial stroke severity, measured by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and dependence on a ventilator predicts 3-month mortality and poor outcome in all stroke patients. In addition, old age, previous stroke, and total anterior circulatory infarct were associated with poor outcome in ischemic stroke patients; old age, low body mass index and the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage were associated with poor outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage patients. In conclusion, early stroke mortality and outcome at discharge can be predicted in the first few hours following an acute stroke for moderate to severe ICU-admitted stroke patients. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

45549092186	Dynamic cerebral autoregulation in carotid stenosis before and after carotid stenting	Background: Impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) has been shown in patients with severe (≥70%) internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, but DCA in moderate (50% to 69%) ICA stenosis, especially its response to carotid revascularization, has rarely been reported. Our study aimed to characterize DCA in severe and moderate ICA stenosis before and after carotid stenting. Methods: This study included 21 patients with ICA stenosis ≥50% who received carotid stenting. Data of arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery, measured by transcranial Doppler, were collected for 10 minutes ≤24 hours before and after stenting. The DCA index, represented as aMx, was assessed by calculating the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of spontaneous arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity fluctuations. The relationship between aMx and stenotic severity and also alternations of aMx before and after stenting were assessed. Results: Carotid stenting was effective to improve the DCA in the stenting side but not in the contralateral nonstenting side. In considering individual ICAs, the average aMx (mean ± SD) increased significantly from ICA stenosis <50% (0.117 ± 0.091) to 50% to 69% (0.349 ± 0.144), 70% to 99% (0.456 ± 0.147), and total occlusion (0.557 ± 0.210; P < .05, P < .01, and P < .01, compared with 50% to 69%, 70% to 99%, or total occlusion with <50% stenosis). The correlation between the degree of ICA stenosis and the aMx was also significant (r = 0.693, P < .005). The aMx improved significantly in the stented side after carotid stenting in both moderate and severe ICA stenosis, and this finding was not affected by age, sex, risk factors, or clinical symptoms. Conclusions: In addition to patients with severe carotid stenosis, patients with moderate carotid stenosis may also have impaired DCA that can be restored after carotid stenting. © 2008 The Society for Vascular Surgery.

48849105354	Chinese version of the zarit caregiver burden interview: A validation study	Objective: The prevalence of dementia is expected to increase in Chinese society in the next 40 years. Family members remain the primary caregivers and bear a heavy burden. The present study aims to examine the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Zarit Burden Interview (CZBI). METHOD: One hundred eighty-one patient-caregiver dyads were recruited. Caregivers completed the measures of the CZBI, Caregiver Activity Survey (CAS) and 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12). Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale were used to assess the patients condition. Results: Overall reliability of CZBI was good, with the internal consistency and test-retest reliability being high. The CZBI was highly correlated with the scores of the CAS and CHQ-12, which provides evidence of concurrent validity. Factor analysis found five factors, which accounted for 60% of variance. Conclusion: The CZBI is feasible for measuring feelings of burden of caregivers for Taiwanese patients with dementia. © 2008 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

61449224481	Urinary arsenic methylation capability and carotid atherosclerosis risk in subjects living in arsenicosis-hyperendemic areas in southwestern Taiwan	Long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic from artesian drinking well water is associated with carotid atherosclerosis in the Blackfoot Disease (BFD)-hyperendemic area in Taiwan. The current study examined the arsenic methylation capacity and its risk on carotid atherosclerosis. A total of 304 adults (158 men and 146 women) residing in the BFD-hyperendemic area were included. The extent of carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by duplex ultrasonography. Chronic arsenic exposure was estimated by an index of cumulative arsenic exposure (CAE) and the duration of artesian well water consumption. Urinary levels of inorganic arsenite [As(III)], arsenate [As(V)], monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)] were determined by high performance liquid chromatography linked on-line to a hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry (HPLC-HG-AAS). The percentage of arsenic species, primary methylation index [PMI = MMA(V) / (As(III) + As(V)] and secondary methylation index [SMI = DMA(V) / MMA(V)] were calculated and employed as indicators of arsenic methylation capacity. Results showed that women and younger subjects had a more efficient arsenic methylation capacity than did men and the elderly. Carotid atherosclerosis cases had a significantly greater percentage of MMA(V) [%MMA(V)] and a lower percentage of DMA [%DMA (V)] compared to controls. Subjects in the highest two tertiles of PMI with a median of CAE > 0 mg/L-year had an odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of carotid atherosclerosis of 2.61 and 0.98-6.90 compared to those in the highest two tertiles of PMI with a CAE = 0 mg/L-year. We conclude that individuals with greater exposure to arsenic and lower capacity to methylate inorganic arsenic may be at a higher risk to carotid atherosclerosis. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

67349246524	Stroke center characteristics which influence the administration of thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke: A national survey of stroke centers in Taiwan	Stroke centers and intravenous tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) are effective management for acute ischemic stroke. This study aimed to analyze stroke center characteristics on the administration of thrombolytic therapy. A national survey of stroke centers in academic medical centers and regional teaching hospitals in Taiwan was conducted. The survey questions included the number of tPA or other thrombolytic therapies, presence of stroke intensive care units and wards, initiation of rehabilitation, and 15 criteria for establishment of stroke centers adopted from the Brain Attack Coalition's recommendation. Factors influencing administration of thrombolytic therapy were analyzed. Intravenous tPA increased from 135 cases in 2004 to 246 cases in 2006, accounting for approximately 0.4% and 0.8% of all acute ischemic stroke patients in Taiwan, respectively. The frequency of thrombolytic therapy administration significantly correlated with stroke center criteria (Spearman's rho = 0.731, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed routine intravenous tPA protocol in the emergency room (odds ratio = 4.6, P = 0.042) and supervision by the stroke center director (odds ratio = 3.7, P = 0.031) significantly influenced the administration of thrombolytic therapy. Well-organized stroke centers, routine use of thrombolytic therapy protocols in the emergency room, and guidance by a stroke center director are important for enhancing thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

67650492274	Notch signaling and CADASIL	Notch signaling plays an essential role in vascular development and human vascular diseases. In adults, mutations of the Notch3 gene cause a hereditary vascular degenerative disease known as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is characterized by recurrent strokes and cognitive impairment. Over the past decade, the number of CADASIL patients increased significantly with improvements in genetic testing and other diagnostic tools, but the true prevalence of CADASIL is still underestimated, especially in Asia. Basic studies suggest that Notch3 is essential for the development and survival of the vascular smooth muscle cells, but the mechanisms by which Notch3 mutations become pathogenic are still unclear. This article reviews the clinical features and possible pathogenesis of CADASIL. Efforts to improve the diagnostic accuracy and define the role of Notch3 mutation in brain damage and clinical presentations of CADASIL should be continued.

0034808344	Correlations between peripheral differential leukocyte counts and carotid atherosclerosis in non-smokers	Substantial evidence clearly indicates the immuno-inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis and the important roles of monocytes and other leukocytes in atherogenesis. The relationship between atherosclerosis and the peripheral monocyte count, however, has been equivocal and uncertain so far. One possible reason may be an opposing effect of different major risk factors of atherosclerosis on the monocyte count, e.g. smoking increases the monocyte count while hypercholesterolemia is accompanied by a lower monocyte count. Since smoking is well shown to increase leukocyte counts prominently in weeks, our study included only non-smokers who participated in a health check program at our hospital from 1996 to 1998 and had received a carotid duplex study with extra payment. Our results revealed the followings: In male non-smokers (n=571), the presence of carotid atherosclerosis was associated with significant increases in the counts of all leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte (P<0.005,<0.001 and <0.05, respectively), and, after adjustments for age and body mass index, there were significant positive links between these three leukocyte counts and the severity of carotid atherosclerosis, judged by either the sum score of all carotid plaques or the score of the most severe carotid plaque. On the contrary, in female non-smokers (n=614), there was no significant link between differential leukocyte counts and either the presence or severity of carotid atherosclerosis. These results are compatible with recently recognized sex differences in the mechanism and pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, and together with relevant results in the literature, suggest that monocytes and neutrophils are the main types of leukocytes involved in atherosclerosis. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

0035183343	Long-term clinical outcome of spontaneous carotid cavernous sinus fistulae supplied by dural branches of the internal carotid artery	We report the long-term clinical outcome of spontaneous carotid cavernous sinus fistulae (CCF) originally supplied by branches arising from the internal carotid artery (Barrow's type B), or type-D lesion that became type B after particulate embolization. A total of 55 patients was included in this study. Their angiography revealed that cortical drainage was absent, and that the arteries supplying the fistulae originated in the dural branches of the internal carotid artery. Thirty-two patients had type-D lesions, which became type-B lesions after obliteration of the external carotid supply by endovascular treatment. The other 23 patients had type-B lesions documented by angiography, and had no embolization. The follow-up period ranged from 8 to 144.5 months. Clinical cure was achieved in 39 patients (70.9%), improvement in eight patients (14.5%), the lesion remained stable in four patients (7.3%), and was aggravated in four patients (7.3%). The number of drainage veins is the only radiographic factor that could predict the outcome. Those patients with single draining veins had a better chance of complete remission. The outcome between the group with original type D lesions after embolization and the group with original type B revealed no statistically significant difference. The time-course to complete cure was significantly shorter in the group with embolization of the external carotid supply. In the four patients whose symptoms were aggravated, embolization was performed, and the result was excellent. The clinical outcome of type-B CCF, or type D converted to type B, is good. Previous external carotid artery embolization can significantly shorten the time to complete cure. Aggressive treatment should be reserved for those who have aggravated symptoms.

0035198635	Factor structure and explanatory variables of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) for elderly persons in Taiwan	Background and Purpose: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is commonly used in studies and clinical assessment of cognitive functioning. The purpose of this study was to examine the factor structure and variables explaining the scores of the MMSE in elderly persons in Taiwan, in order to provide a reference for instrument selection and data collection for clinicians and researchers. Methods: Secondary data from an epidemiologic study that included 1,442 randomly selected subjects aged 64 to 98 with an average age of 72.6 years were used. Males comprised 57.1% of the sample, and females 42.9%. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and covariance structure modeling were used to analyze the data. Results: In the cross validation of the covariance structure modeling, 50.1% of the variance in simple processing, 86.9% in complex processing, and 66.9% in memory/attention were explained. Better education background predicted better score in complex processing ability (path coefficient = .860). Greater independence in self-care ability predicted better scores in simple processing (path coefficient = -.716) and memory/attention (path coefficient = -.811). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that items in the MMSE measuring complex processing ability including writing, reading and obeying, and copy design are seriously biased by educational background, and that the remaining items are better indicators of the subject's cognitive functioning for elderly persons in Taiwan. In our model, self-care ability was strongly related to cognitive functioning as measured by the MMSE, especially for items in the factors of simple processing (registration, naming, repetition, and commanding) and attention/memory (orientation to place and time, attention, and recall).

7244245423	Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas with or without cerebral sinus thrombosis: Analysis of 69 patients	Objectives: To compare the characteristics of dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) with or without cerebral sinus thrombosis (CST), and to analyse the determinants of aggressive manifestations in patients with dural AVF. Methods: We investigated 69 patients aged 51.4 (SD 15) years who were diagnosed as having dural AVF. According to the location of the lesion and venous drainage pattern, dural AVF was classified into three sites (cavernous sinus, large sinus, and other) and five types (by Cognard's method). Aggressive manifestations of dural AVF were defined as intracranial haemorrhage, venous infarction, seizure, altered mental status, and intracranial hypertension. The diagnosis of CST was based on cerebral angiogrqphy. Logistic regression methods were used to analyse the determinants of aggressive manifestation in patients with dural AVF. Results: CST was found in 39% of the patients with dural AVF. It was located at almost either the sinus around the dural AVF or the downstream venous flow pathways of the dural AVF. There was no significant difference with regard to sex, location, or type of dural AVF between patients with dural AVF with and without CST. The location "other sinuses" and the type of dural AVF "IIb/IIa+b/III/IV/V" were significantly related to aggressive manifestations of dural AVF (odds ratio 19 (p=0.001) and 5.63 (p=0.033), respectively). Presence of CST in patients with dural AVF had an odds ratio of 4.25 (p=0.12) for development of aggressive manifestations. Conclusions: CST affects two fifths of patients with dural AVF. The location and type of dural AVF are major determinants of aggressive manifestations in patients with dural AVF.

75149133149	Comparison of behavioral and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer's disease among institution residents and memory clinic outpatients	Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) cause caregiver distress and earlier institutionalization. We compared the prevalence and characteristics of BPSD between institution residents and memory clinic outpatients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to test the hypothesis that there is more BPSD among institution residents than among their outpatient counterparts. Methods: We assessed BPSD by interviewing the patients principal caregivers, either family or professionals, using the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD). Data from 138 patients with probable AD from the memory clinic and 173 residents with possible AD living in the long-term care facilities were collected. The diagnoses followed the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Results: BPSD profiles of the two groups were similar but not identical. The prevalence of at least one BPSD was high in both groups (community 81.9%, institution 74.9%). Activity disturbance was the most frequently reported BPSD in both groups (community 52.2%, institution 38.7%). Delusions, hallucinations, anxiety and aggressiveness were seen more frequently in memory clinic outpatients. The outpatients also had higher scores of BEHAVE-AD subscales in delusion/paranoid ideation, affective disturbance, and global rating of severity. With the increase of disease severity there were significantly more activity disturbance, psychosis, and aggressiveness in patients with AD. Conclusions: Caregiver factor and institution effect were two possible reasons for the higher prevalence and the greater severity of BPSD in community patients. BPSD caused more distress to family caregivers than the professional caregivers. High levels of psychotropic prescriptions for patients living in the long-term care facilities may also play a role. © 2009 International Psychogeriatric Association.

77950223630	Dose-response relation between neuromuscular electrical stimulation and upper-extremity function in patients with stroke	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE-: The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of different doses of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on upper-extremity function in acute stroke patients with severe motor deficit. METHODS-: Sixty-six acute stroke patients were randomized to 3 groups: high NMES, low NMES, or control. The low-NMES group received 30 minutes of stimulation per day, and the high-NMES group received 60 minutes per day, for 4 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment Scale, Action Research Arm Test, and Motor Activity Log were used to assess the patients at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks post baseline (follow-up). RESULTS-: Both NMES groups showed significant improvement on Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment and Action Research Arm Test scales compared with the control group at week 4 and follow-up. The high-NMES group showed treatment effects similar to those of the low-NMES group. CONCLUSIONS-: Higher and lower doses of NMES led to similar improvements in motor function. A minimum of 10 hours of NMES in combination with regular rehabilitation may improve recovery of arm function in stroke patients during the acute stage. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.

77953257547	Early and intensive rehabilitation predicts good functional outcomes in patients admitted to the stroke intensive care unit	Purpose. Earlier and more intense rehabilitation benefit stroke patients. Yet, studies have caution intensive therapy during acute brain injury. This study examined the rehabilitation commencement time and intensity as predictors of functional outcomes in acute stroke patients admitted to the stroke intensive care unit (ICU). Method.Sociodemographic, medical, rehabilitative and functional data were collected on 154 acute stroke patients. Regression analyses were used to identify predictors for the basic activities of daily living (Barthel Index, BI) and the walking ability at discharge. Result.Rehabilitation commencement time and intensity significantly predicted the BI score at discharge after adjusting for initial severity (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and age (p<0.05). For the walking function at discharge, only the rehabilitation intensity was a significant predictor after adjusting for initial severity and age (p<0.05). Furthermore, with increasing rehabilitation intensity, patients with severe stroke benefited more than those with moderate stroke. Conclusion.Rehabilitation commencement time and intensity, after adjusting for admission functional status and severity of stroke, remained to be important predictors of stroke functional outcomes. This study supported the recommendation to commence rehabilitation early and intensively and provided evidence that this claim can be extended to acute stroke patients admitted to an ICU. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

77955908160	Diabetic muscle infarction in a patient with acute embolic stroke	Diabetic mellitus (DM) has many well-known complications. However, there is one rare complication, diabetic muscle infarction (DMI), which is usually under diagnosed. Hereby, we present a 53-year-old Chinese man with a history of DM, hypertension and atrial fibrillation. He had acute onset of severe left lower leg pain and swelling with difficulty in walking 4 days before admission. Physical examination revealed non-pitting and nonerythematous swelling with cold sensation of the left medial calf muscles. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed homogenous high signal changes in the calf muscles on T2 images, which indicated DMI. After anticoagulation treatment, the patient had a fair recovery within 4 weeks and he could walk by himself thereafter. DMI is a rare complication of poorly controlled DM. It does have a characteristic clinical presentation and MRI findings. Increased clinical awareness is important for early recognition and correct treatment. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

77955951478	GT-repeat polymorphism in the heme oxygenase-1 gene promoter and the risk of carotid atherosclerosis related to arsenic exposure	Background. Arsenic is a strong stimulus of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression in experimental studies in response to oxidative stress caused by a stimulus. A functional GT-repeat polymorphism in the HO-1 gene promoter was inversely correlated to the development of coronary artery disease in diabetics and development of restenosis following angioplasty in patients. The role of this potential vascular protective factor in carotid atherosclerosis remains unclear. We previously reported a graded association of arsenic exposure in drinking water with an increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between HO-1 genetic polymorphism and the risk of atherosclerosis related to arsenic. Methods. Three-hundred and sixty-seven participants with an indication of carotid atherosclerosis and an additional 420 participants without the indication, which served as the controls, from two arsenic exposure areas in TWN, a low arsenic-exposed Lanyang cohort and a high arsenic-exposed LMN cohort, were studied. Carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated using a duplex ultrasonographic assessment of the extracranial carotid arteries. Allelic variants of (GT)n repeats in the 5'-flanking region of the HO-1 gene were identified and grouped into a short (S) allele (< 27 repeats) and long (L) allele ( 27 repeats). The association of atherosclerosis and the HO-1 genetic variants was assessed by a logistic regression analysis, adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. Results. Analysis results showed that arsenic's effect on carotid atherosclerosis differed between carriers of the class S allele (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.86-2.25; p = 0.181) and non-carriers (OR 2.65; 95% CI 1.03-6.82; p = 0.044) in the high-exposure LMN cohort. At arsenic exposure levels exceeding 750 g/L, difference in OR estimates between class S allele carriers and non-carriers was borderline significant (p = 0.051). In contrast, no such results were found in the low-exposure Lanyang cohort. Conclusions. This exploratory study suggests that at a relatively high level of arsenic exposure, carriers of the short (GT)n allele (< 27 repeats) in the HO-1 gene promoter had a lower probability of developing carotid atherosclerosis than non-carriers of the allele after long-term arsenic exposure via ground water. The short (GT)n repeat in the HO-1 gene promoter may provide protective effects against carotid atherosclerosis in individuals with a high level of arsenic exposure. © 2010 Wu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78049448773	Neurosarcoidosis Affecting the Spinal Cord	Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that involves multiple systems. Complications in the nervous system are rare, especially in Asia. This report describes an unusual case of neurosarcoidosis affecting the spinal cord and other systems in a 53-year-old Taiwanese women patient. The patient presented with subacute onset of right arm radicular pain followed by quadriparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyperintense lesion on T2WI in the cervical spinal cord. The patient also had a history of facial neuropathy, bilateral parotid enlargement, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, hypercalcemia, nephrocalcinosis, and renal function impairment. Parotid gland biopsy showed granulomatous lesion with multinucleated giant cells. Sarcoidosis was diagnosed after other possibilities were excluded. Oral steroid treatment resulted in initial significant clinical improvement. Awareness of the systemic and neurological presentations of sarcoidosis can prompt the correct diagnosis and treatment. © 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

78651247951	Cerebral infarction in acute anemia	There are few previous studies on the relationship between cerebral infarction and acute anemia. This study presents patients with cerebral infarction in acute anemia due to marked blood loss and aims to clarify the stroke nature and possible mechanism. Patients with acute cerebral infarction and anemia following marked blood loss without systemic hypotension were recruited from 2001 to 2009. Clinical characteristics, particularly hemoglobin level, and neuroimaging findings were reviewed in detail to analyze the stroke nature and verify the possible pathogenesis. Twelve patients (males 8; mean age 74.9 years) were included. Eleven patients had cerebral infarction after acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding, and one had cerebral infarction following postoperative extensive hematoma during hospitalization. In all patients, borderzone infarction was the most characteristic finding: six had unilateral and six had bilateral borderzone infarction. Mean hemoglobin at infarction after acute blood loss was 5.8 g/dl, with 46% reduction from baseline. Of nine patients receiving detailed extracranial and intracranial vascular studies, none had severe carotid stenosis and six had intracranial stenosis. The arterial borderzones are the most vulnerable regions to a fall in cerebral perfusion. Acute anemia may produce cerebral blood flow insufficiency, reduce oxygen-carrying capacity, and result in distal-field tissue ischemic injury when hemoglobin level decreases below a critical level, especially in patients with intracranial stenosis. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

0035950993	Image analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging	Functional MRI can provide important new insights into the phenomenon of brain activity through improved temporal and spatial resolution as well as easiness and safety on repeated or prolonged examination. A revolutionary renewal on the knowledge of functional anatomy of the human brain based on the pre-fMRI technology is thus possible. However, the activity in the brain is so complex that the simplified model-dependent analysis methods may not be sufficient. Therefore, we have endeavored to establish data-driven tools and methodologies for fMRI. Insupervised algorithms based on self-organized artificial neural network and fuzzy logic are used to solve the problem of biased result or misled interpretation frequently encountered in statistical methods depending on prior knowledge of imposed experimental paradigm or assumed pattern of brain response to activation. With these new analysis methods, more accurate activation regions and physiological dynamics can be identified that makes further investigation possible and easier.

0036237955	Long-term results of elective stenting for severe carotid artery stenosis in Taiwan	Stenting for severe carotid stenosis has been proposed as an alternative for patients with high surgical risk for endarterectomy, but its effectiveness and safety has never been evaluated in large case series in a pure Asian population. One hundred and eighteen ethnic Chinese patients (mean age 72.8 years) with 129 severely narrowed carotid arteries were stented electively using self-expanding stents. The mean pre-treatment diameter stenosis was 85% and final residual diameter stenosis 14%. The peri-procedural stroke and death rate was 4.2%. One (0.8%) late ischemic stroke and 2 (1.7%) deaths occurred during a mean follow-up of 16.3 months, and the restenosis rate was 3.1%. Carotid stenting, therefore, can be done safely and effectively in Chinese patients. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

0035996582	Carotid atherosclerosis, intima media thickness and risk factors - An analysis of 1781 asymptomatic subjects in Taiwan	The aim of this study was to investigate the association of intima media thickness (IMT) and plaque with risk factors for atherosclerosis in asymptomatic subjects in Taiwan. Between 1998 and 2001, the study recruited 1781 asymptomatic subjects (1131 men and 650 women [mean age, 49 years; range 18-85 years]). These were examined by B-mode ultrasound to measure the IMT at the far wall of the common carotid artery (CCA) and the extent of plaque formation. A wide range of vascular risk factors including age, gender, smoking, body mass index, blood chemistry, and previous history were surveyed. The mean (±S.D.) IMT observed was 0.68 (±0.12) and 0.66 (±0.11) mm for men and women, respectively, (P=0.0008). The mean (S.D.) IMT of the CCA was 0.66 (±0.12) mm on the right side and 0.68 (±0.12) mm on the left side (P=0.0004). IMT increased with aging, according to the equation IMT=(0.005 × age in years)+0.043. Higher IMT was associated with male gender, and IMT was greater in the left CCA. About 36.9% of subjects had carotid plaques. The percentage of plaque increased with aging. The plaque prevalence was positively associated with IMT. The value of IMT over the cut point of 0.68 mm correlated with obviously increased risk of carotid atherosclerosis. Age, systolic blood pressure and fasting blood sugar were independent risk factors related to both carotid atherosclerosis and thick IMT. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

0036287180	Stroke in patients with common carotid artery dissection secondary to dissecting aortic aneurysm: An observational vascular imaging study	Background: Common carotid artery dissection (CCAD) usually arises from the extension of an aortic arch dissection. Neurologic complications, including stroke, sometimes occur in CCAD patients. We investigated the imaging characteristics of CCAD patients with and without stroke. Materials and methods: From 1990 to 1999, there were eight patients diagnosed with CCAD, all due to aortic arch dissection. The clinical manifestations, findings of color-coded duplex sonography (CDS) and other vascular imaging modalities were analyzed. Results: Ultrasonographic study of all patients revealed a visible intimal flap dissecting the common carotid artery lumen into the true and false lumina. Three patients had cerebral infarctions and one had a transient ischemic attack. Two patients had thrombi in the false lumen of the common carotid arteries on CDS. Chest radiography showed thrombi in the aortas of two patients. One patient was proved to have aortic arch dissection after a stroke. Conclusion: Thrombi were noted in the false lumina of the common carotid arteries or aortas of all CCAD patients with stroke, but not in the patients without stroke. CDS can be used as an additional examination for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with aortic dissection and CCAD.

0035737226	Neurosyphilis presents as atypical encephalitis or cerebral vasculitis: Report of two cases	Neurosyphilis first presented as acute encephalitis or encephalopathy with seizures had only been rarely reported in the literature. We reported two human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with neurosyphilis, both first attracting medical attention due to seizures and acute confusional state. The first patient was clinically indistinguishable from acute herpes simplex encephalitis, including the electroen-cephalographic patterns and head magnetic resonance imaging findings. The second patient had left hemiparesis and seizures, with angiographic evidence of diffuse cerebral vasculitis. In patients with late onset seizures, the differential diagnosis of underlying focal brain lesions should include neurosyphilis.

79958766624	Dysphagia screening decreases pneumonia in acute stroke patients admitted to the stroke intensive care unit	Dysphagia increases the risk of pneumonia in stroke patients. This study aimed to evaluate bedside swallowing screening for prevention of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) in acute stroke patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Consecutive acute stroke patients admitted to the stroke ICU from May 2006 to March 2007 were included. Patients were excluded if they were intubated on the first day of admission or had a transient ischemic attack. A 3-Step Swallowing Screen was introduced since October 2006 and therefore patients were divided into pre-screen and post-screen groups. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine independent risk factors for SAP and in-hospital death. There were 74 and 102 patients included in the pre- and post-screen groups, respectively. Pneumonia was associated with higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, older age, nasogastric and endotracheal tube placement. After adjusting for age, gender, NIHSS score and nasogastric and endotracheal tube insertion, dysphagia screening was associated with a borderline decrease in SAP in all stroke patients (odds ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18-1.00; p = 0.05). However, dysphagia screening was not associated with reduction of in-hospital deaths. Systematic bedside swallowing screening is helpful for prevention of SAP in acute stroke patients admitted to the ICU. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79958173052	Genetic polymorphisms of a novel vascular susceptibility gene, ninjurin2 (NINJ2), are associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease	Background: Accumulated evidences have shown that vascular risk factors, e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, may be related to the risk of dementia. This study investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms of a vascular susceptibility gene, Ninjurin2 (NINJ2), and the risk of dementia, which has not been explored previously. Methods: A total of 275 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 119 vascular dementia (VaD) patients aged 50 or older were recruited from three teaching hospitals from 2007 to 2010. Healthy controls (n = 423) with the same age of cases were recruited from the health checkup and volunteers worked at the hospital during the same time period. Five common (frequency >5%) haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in NINJ2 were genotyped to test for the association between sequence variants of NINJ2 and dementia risk, and how vascular risk factors modify this association. Results: Homozygosity of two NINJ2 SNPs was significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD [rs11833579: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.80; rs12425791: AOR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12-0.96]. Five common haplotypes (cumulative frequency = 97%) were identified. The global test for the association between NINJ2 haplotypes and AD was significant (p = 0.03). Haplotype CAGGA was significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.11-0.94). No associations were observed for VaD. Conclusion: Inherited polymorphisms of the vascular susceptibility gene NINJ2 were associated with AD risk. © 2011 Lin et al.

79960346106	Ischemic stroke in patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas	Background/Purpose: Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) can be complicated by ischemic stroke. This study investigated the frequency and determinants of ischemic stroke in patients with intracranial DAVF. Methods:We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients with intracranial DAVF. Patients with pure hemorrhagic stroke or without available brain imaging for clarifying stroke type were excluded. DAVF was diagnosed by cerebral catheter angiography. Cognard classification and location of DAVFs were ascertained. The clinical characteristics, outcome, and radiographic findings were recorded. Factors associated with occurrence of ischemic stroke in the patients with DAVFs were determined. Results: A total of 134 patients were enrolled. Six patients (4.5%) had ischemic stroke (mean age: 53.8 ± 13.4 years) and 128 patients were free from stroke (mean age: 55.4 ± 15.2 years). Men accounted for 83% in the ischemic stroke group and 34% in the non-stroke group. Chemosis, exophthalmos and tinnitus were more frequent in the non-stroke group, whereas seizure and mental decline were more frequent in the ischemic stroke group. DAVF was associated with highest risk of ischemic stroke at locations other than the cavernous sinus or large sinuses. Ischemic stroke also correlated with types of DAVF involving cortical venous drainage, including type IIb (18%), III (15%), and IV (100%). No patient with DAVF type I and IIa had ischemic stroke. The rate of ischemic stroke in patients with concomitant DAVF and cerebral sinus thrombosis was higher than in DAVF patients without cerebral sinus thrombosis. Venous infarct was the major subtype of ischemic stroke in five DAVF patients. Endovascular therapy was the most common choice in both groups, and fewer patients in the ischemic stroke group did not receive any treatment for DAVFs. Conclusion: Location and type of DAVF were two important factors related to the occurrence of ischemic stroke in DAVF patients. © 2011 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

84856069957	Sequence variants of interleukin 6 (IL-6) are significantly associated with a decreased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease	Background: Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been related to beta-amyloid aggregation and the appearance of hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. However, previous studies relating IL-6 genetic polymorphisms to AD included few and unrepresentative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the results were inconsistent.Methods: This is a case-control study. A total of 266 patients with AD, aged≧65, were recruited from three hospitals in Taiwan (2007-2010). Controls (n = 444) were recruited from routine health checkups and volunteers of the hospital during the same period of time. Three common IL-6 haplotype-tagging SNPs were selected to assess the association between IL-6 polymorphisms and the risk of late-onset AD (LOAD).Results: Variant carriers of IL-6 rs1800796 and rs1524107 were significantly associated with a reduced risk of LOAD [(GG + GC vs. CC): adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.64 and (CC + CT vs. TT): AOR = 0.60, respectively]. Haplotype CAT was associated with a decreased risk of LOAD (0 and 1 copy vs. 2 copies: AOR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44-0.95). These associations remained significant in ApoE e4 non-carriers only.

84862798301	Genetic polymorphisms of nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and the risk of Alzheimer's disease	Background: Loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons is attributable to the proapoptotic signaling induced by nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and may link to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Only one study has investigated the association between NGFR polymorphisms and the risk of AD in an Italian population. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) may modify this association based on previous animal and epidemiologic studies. Methods. This was a case-control study in a Chinese population. A total of 264 AD patients were recruited from three teaching hospitals between 2007 to 2010; 389 controls were recruited from elderly health checkup and volunteers of the hospital during the same period of time. Five common (frequency5%) haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) were selected from NGFR to test the association between NGFR htSNPs and the risk of AD. Results: Variant NGFR rs734194 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD [GG vs. TT copies: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.20-0.95]. Seven common haplotypes were identified. Minor haplotype GCGCG was significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD (2 vs. 0 copies: adjusted OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.17-0.91).

84863014051	Dosage of neuromuscular electrical stimulation: Is it a determinant of upper limb functional improvement in stroke patients?	Objective: To investigate the predictors related to upper extremity functional recovery, with special emphasis on neuromuscular electrical stimulation dose-response in patients after stroke. Subjects: Ninety-five patients with stroke who received a 4-week neuromuscular electrical stimulation intervention. Design: Prospective predictive analysis. Methods: The change score of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) was used as the main outcome. Baseline subject characteristics, stroke-related data, and intervention-related data were collected. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to identify the potential predictors related to main outcome. Results: The regression model revealed that the initial Fugl-Meyer upper limb score was the most important predictor for ARAT change score post-test, followed by time since stroke onset and location of stroke lesion. At 2-month follow-up, the neuromuscular electrical stimulation dosage became a significant determinant in addition to the above predictors. Conclusion: Initial motor severity and lesion location were the main predictors for upper limb functional improvement in stroke patients. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation dosage became a significant determinant for upper limb functional recovery after stroke at 2-month follow-up. More intensive neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy during early rehabilitation is associated with better upper limb motor function recovery after stroke. © 2012 The Authors.

84863672542	A potential protective effect in multilingual patients with semantic dementia: Two case reports of patients speaking Taiwanese and Japanese	Purpose: Several reports have suggested that multilingualism has a protective effect against semantic dementia. Here, we provide further evidence for this effect. Case Reports: First: The patient was a 75-year-old right-handed Taiwanese woman who had retired after working as a tailor. She was able to speak Taiwanese, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese fluently until 5 years ago. She gradually developed symptoms of profound anomia and difficulty with word-finding. Her mother tongue was Taiwanese and she had learned Japanese as her first symbolized language. She had used Mandarin Chinese for most of her life, but depended on Japanese to read and write (such as reading a newspaper and keeping accounts). However, she could now speak only very simple Taiwanese and Japanese, and could recognize only simple Japanese characters. Second: The patient was a 62-year-old right-handed man who had worked as an ironworker. He could speak Taiwanese and Mandarin Chinese fluently until 5 years ago. His mother tongue was Taiwanese. After 5 years of language deterioration, he was unable to communicate with his family members or recognize any characters, including numbers. SPECT results: Brain perfusion ECD SPECT (Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography) showed less perfusion in the multilingual patient (Case #1) than in the bilingual patient (Case #2). Neuropsychological tests also demonstrated a slower rate of degeneration in the multilingual patient. Conclusion: We speculate that reading and writing in Japanese had a greater impact on the semantic system in Case #1. Thus, this patient showed relatively less degeneration or functional inactivity, as shown by perfusion in the frontal lobe, and this might be due to the persistent activation involved in multilingualism.

84864992995	A young man presenting with acute encephalopathy, hemiparesis, and headache	Background: Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a rare type of migraine. Correct diagnosis is challenging for emergency physicians (EPs) due to its variable clinical picture, as well as its lack of diagnostic biological markers. Objectives: To raise awareness among EPs regarding FHM's diverse clinical picture, and to highlight FHM's diagnostic criteria to facilitate an accurate and timely diagnosis of FHM in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with indicative symptomatology. Case Report: A 24-year-old male student presented to the ED complaining of dizziness, general weakness, and blurred vision that had developed the previous night. The initial physical examination revealed drowsiness, slow speech production, and slight weakness with paresthesia in all limbs. Detailed communication with the patient's aunt revealed that he had experienced several similar attacks since the age of 12 years, and that there was also an extensive family history of the same symptoms. In addition, 2 h after arrival, the patient experienced severe throbbing headache, vomiting, severe dysphasia, and the weakness shifted to the right side. A computed tomography scan of the brain showed no anomalies. He was admitted with a tentative diagnosis of FHM. Conclusion: A diagnosis of FHM should be considered if the patient's clinical features include headache and weakness, with a family history of similar symptomatology. However, atypical symptoms of FHM may present as recurrent episodes of unexplained encephalopathy. Crucial elements for making an accurate and timely diagnosis of FHM include a detailed knowledge of weakness-related diseases and an ability to consider FHM in the differential diagnosis, as well as obtaining a thorough family history with repeated neurologic assessments. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84865010423	Effects of repetitive hyperbaric oxygen treatment in patients with acute cerebral infarction: A pilot study	The role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is controversial. This prospective study assessed the efficacy and safety of HBOT as adjuvant treatment on 46 acute ischemic stroke in patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy. The HBOT group (n = 16) received conventional medical treatment with 10 sessions of adjunctive HBOT within 35 days after stroke onset, while the control group (n = 30) received the same treatment but without HBOT. Early (around two weeks after onset) and late (one month after onset) outcomes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS scores) and efficacy (changes of NIHSS scores) of HBOT were evaluated. The baseline clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. Both early and late outcomes of the HBOT group showed significant difference (P ≤ 0.001). In the control group, there was only significant difference in early outcome (P = 0.004). For early efficacy, there was no difference when comparing changes of NIHSS scores between the two groups (P = 0.140) but there was statistically significant difference when comparing changes of NIHSS scores at one month (P ≤ 0.001). The HBOT used in this study may be effective for patients with acute ischemic stroke and is a safe and harmless adjunctive treatment. Copyright 2012 Cheng-Hsin Chen et al.

0037243124	Diffuse capillary telangiectasia of the brain manifested as a slowly progressive course	Brain capillary telangiectasia (BCT) are usually small, solitary, benign in clinical manifestation, or found incidentally at autopsy. However, diffuse BCT are rarely reported. A 39-year-old woman had the first generalized seizure 10 years previously. Thereafter, she had sustained progressive spastic paraparesis and blurred vision. Computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse brain atrophy with numerous calcified spots. Contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance images showed diffuse faintly enhancing lesions with stippled appearance in the whole brain. Cerebral angiography revealed multiple small nets of dilated capillaries and Xenon CT showed diffuse low cerebral blood flow in the resting and good cerebral reserve capacity in the acetazolamide challenge test. Therefore, diffuse BCT was diagnosed clinically. Although BCT are not rare, diffuse BCT with slowly progressive neurological symptoms had never been reported before. It causes global cerebral ischemia that lead to brain atrophy and a degenerative course. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

0037265494	The hemodynamic effects of internal carotid artery stenting: A study with color-coded duplex sonography	Background: Stenting has been used as an alternative treatment for patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. Color-coded duplex sonography (CDS) is able to measure not only the prestenting stenosis but also the poststenting hemodynamic changes. The purpose of this study was to quantify, using CDS, the hemodynamic changes after ICA stenting. Methods: Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were included in this study. The degree of ICA stenosis before stenting was required to be more than 50%. Thirty-two treated ICAs were included to compare the prestenting and poststenting CDS findings, including the diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumen, the flow peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities, the resistivity index and the amount of flow in bilateral extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. Results: After stenting, the turbulent flow pattern in the stenotic ICA recovered to laminar flow, and the reversed ophthalmic flow direction normalized. Of the CDS parameters applied to evaluate the effect of stenting on ICA stenosis, the diameter, residual area, peak systolic velocity, diastolic velocity and the ration of systolic flow velocity ratio in the ICA to that in the common carotid artery (CCA) were altered significantly. The mean area and residual area of these stenotic ICAs showed increases of 24% (p = 0.005) and 84% (p = 0.001) after ICA stenting, respectively. The mean peak systolic flow velocity significantly decreased by 71%. The mean diastolic flow velocity also significantly decreased (by 77%). Both the systolic and diastolic velocities of the ipsilateral CCA significantly increased after stenting. The amount of flow in the contralateral ICA decreased significantly after stenting. The change in the amount of flow in the vertebral arteries after ICA stenting was insignificant. Conclusions: The results of this CDS study clearly demonstrated the hemodynamic changes after ICA stenting. The carotid stenting significantly changed the ICA flow pattern, diameter, residual area, peak systolic velocity and ICA to CCA velocity ratio. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

0037117661	Biological gradient between long-term arsenic exposure and carotid atherosclerosis	Background - Long-term exposure to ingested arsenic has been documented to induce peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and cerebral infarction in a dose-response relationship. This study further examined the biological gradient between ingested inorganic arsenic and carotid atherosclerosis. Methods and Results - We studied 199 male and 264 female adult residents from the southwestern area of endemic arseniasis in Taiwan. The extent of carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by duplex ultrasonography. Diabetes mellitus was determined by oral glucose tolerance test, hypertension by mercury sphygmomanometers, and serum lipid profiles by autoanalyzers. Information regarding the consumption of high-arsenic artesian well water, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption was obtained through standardized questionnaire interviews. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio and its 95% CI of carotid atherosclerosis for various risk factors. Three indices of long-term exposure to ingested arsenic, including the duration of consuming artesian well water, the average arsenic concentration in consumed artesian well water, and cumulative arsenic exposure, were all significantly associated with prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in a dose-response relationship. The biological gradient remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, waist-to-hip ratio, and serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio was 3.1 (95% CI 1.3 to 7.4) for those who had a cumulative arsenic exposure of ≥20 mg/L-years compared with those without exposure to arsenic from drinking artesian well water. Conclusions - Carotid atherosclerosis is associated with ingested inorganic arsenic, showing a significant biological gradient.

0036892155	Multifocal leukoencephalopathy induced by levamisole: A case report	A 24-year-old woman developed progressive dysarthria and right hemiparesis following 6 months' course of levamisole treatment for recurrent oral ulcer (a total dose of 5400 mg). Her head magnetic resonance images showed multifocal white matter lesions with rim enhancement. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis and evoked potential studies were normal. After receiving steroid pulse therapy and then gradual tapering of the steroids, she had marked clinical and radiographic improvement. Multifocal leukoencephalopathy has been associated with the administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and levamisole respectively or in combination. Identification of this syndrome is important, because early cessation of the causative agents and possibly a short course of steroid treatment would lead to early resolution.

84871296103	Sequence Variants of Toll Like Receptor 4 and Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease	Background: Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been related to inflammation and beta-amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. No study has explored the association between haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) of TLR4 and AD risk previously and ApoE e4 status alone showed low sensitivity in identifying late-onset AD (LOAD) patients. Methods: A total of 269 LOAD patients were recruited from three hospitals in northern Taiwan (2007-2010). Controls (n = 449) were recruited from elderly health checkup and volunteers of the hospital during the same period of time. Five common (frequency≥5%) TLR4 htSNPs were selected to assess the association between TLR4 polymorphisms and the risk of LOAD in the Chinese ethnic population. Results: Homozygosity of TLR4 rs1927907 was significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD [TT vs. CC: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-4.64]. After stratification, the association increased further in ApoE e4 non-carriers (AOR = 3.07) and in hypertensive patients (AOR = 3.60).

84879893308	Onset headache predicts good outcome in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : The study aimed to assess whether onset headache is an ominous sign in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke. METHODS - : A large population of ischemic stroke patients was obtained from the Taiwan Stroke Registry. Stroke subtypes were classified by the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria. On the basis of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, second version, onset headache was defined as a new headache that developed at the onset of ischemic stroke. Clinical features and impact on stroke outcomes, including in-hospital stroke in evolution, changes in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on discharge, and Barthel index and modified Rankin scale ≤6 months after stroke were compared between those with and without onset headache. RESULTS - : Among 11 523 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke, 848 had onset headache (7.4%). Patients with specific cause, large-Artery atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism were more likely to have onset headache. Patients with onset headache were younger, predominantly female, and more likely to have posterior circulation ischemic lesions. Compared with patients without onset headache, those with onset headache had a lower frequency of stroke in evolution (4.5% versus 6.7%; adjusted relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.79), greater improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on discharge (0.08 versus -0.20; P=0.02), higher mean Barthel index scores (86.5±20.0 versus 83.9±23.3; adjusted difference, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-2.89), and a lower frequency of modified Rankin scale higher than 2 (27.6% versus 31.5%; adjusted relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.95) at 1-month follow-up. There was also a trend for better functional outcome in 3- and 6-month follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS - : By adopting standard classification criteria, this large-scale study demonstrated that onset headache was associated with modest but significantly better outcomes after ischemic stroke. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84880109055	Pre-ICH warfarin use, not antiplatelets, increased case fatality in spontaneous ICH patients	Background and purpose: Anticoagulant and antiplatelets for prevention of ischaemic stroke and cardiovascular diseases may increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study aimed to investigate the influence of pre-ICH use of anticoagulant and antiplatelets on ICH patients. Methods: Consecutive patients with acute spontaneous ICH registered in a single-center stroke registry during 2001 to 2010 were analyzed and categorized according to their pre-ICH use of warfarin (Group I), antiplatelets (Group II), or neither (Group III). Survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model were used to compare between the three groups and the predictors. Results: Of 2021 ICH patients (male, 63.3%; mean age, 62.6 ± 14.4 years) included, there were 94 (4.7%) in Group I, 232 (11.4%) in Group II, and 1695 (83.9%) in Group III. Warfarin users had larger hematoma volume, more intraventricular extension, higher frequencies of lobar ICH, and higher case fatality than non-warfarin users (Groups II and III). The Cox proportional hazard model showed increased 6-month case fatality in pre-ICH warfarin users (adjusted hazard ratio 2.75, 95% confidence interval 2.04-3.72, P < 0.001), but not in pre-ICH antiplatelet users (adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.72-1.26). Conclusions: Intracerebral hemorrhage patients with prior warfarin use, but not antiplatelet use, had significantly higher case fatality at 6 months. © 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology © 2012 EFNS.

84894214006	CHRNA7 polymorphisms and response to cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease	Background: CHRNA7 encodes the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit, which is important to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and cholinergic neurotransmission. Previously, CHRNA7 polymorphisms have not been related to cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) response. Methods: Mild to moderate AD patients received ChEIs were recruited from the neurology clinics of three teaching hospitals from 2007 to 2010 (n = 204). Nine haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms of CHRNA7 were genotyped. Cognitive responders were those showing improvement in the Mini-Mental State Examination score ≥2 between baseline and 6 months after ChEI treatment. Results: AD women carrying rs8024987 variants [GG+GC vs. CC: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.47-8.89] and GG haplotype in block1 (AOR = 3.34, 95% CI = 1.38-8.06) had significantly better response to ChEIs (false discovery rate <0.05). These variant carriers using galantamine were 11 times more likely to be responders than female non-carriers using donepezil or rivastigmine. Conclusion: For the first time, this study found a significant association between CHRNA7 polymorphisms and better ChEI response. If confirmed by further studies, CHRNA7 polymorphisms may aid in predicting ChEI response and refining treatment choice. © 2013 Weng et al.

84910637744	Neuropsychological performance in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning	This study investigated changes in cognitive function in acute and delayed carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning groups with comprehensive neuropsychological tests at 1 month and 6 months after therapy. For this study, 11 patients with acute and 14 with delayed CO poisoning were recruited. The neuropsychological tests included psychomotor speed, visual-spatial ability, language, logical memory, working memory, and executive function. The results showed that patients with delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome (DNS) had poorer performance on neuropsychological tasks than did those with acute CO poisoning at the 1st month and reached almost the same level as the acute group on the neuropsychological tasks at the 6-month follow-up assessment. The DNS group had more significant progress on general cognitive function, psychomotor speed, and visual-spatial ability than did the acute group after continuous hyperbaric-oxygen therapy.

10444235670	Carotid artery stenosis: Routine predilatation or direct stenting?	Stenting is a potential alternative treatment for carotid artery stenosis. Direct stenting may, theoretically, reduce the risk of embolism by minimizing plaque manipulation before tissue scaffolding is achieved. The results of direct carotid stenting are reported and compared with those of stenting with predilatation. One hundred and seventy-four carotid artery stenoses were treated from July 1998 to February 2002, with 84 lesions directly stented (Group 1) and the other 90 lesions stented after predilatation (Group 2). The criteria for direct stenting were minimal luminal diameter (MLD) > 1 mm and no visible thrombus angiographically. Technical success rates of the two groups were both 100%, without any cross-over. Reference vessel diameter and lesion length did not differ between the two groups. In Group 1, diameter stenosis was lower (79 ± 8 vs 92 ± 7%, P < 0.001) and MLD was larger (1.1 ± 0.5 vs 0.4 ± 0.4 mm, P < 0.001) than that in Group 2, but the final MLD (4.7 ± 0.9 vs 4.7 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.94) of the two groups were not statistically different. The periprocedural ipsilateral stroke or death rates were also similar in the two groups (2/84 vs 4/90, P = 0.68). It was concluded that if the MLD of carotid stenosis is larger than 1 mm and no thrombus is present, direct stenting could be carried out safely with results comparable to that of stenting after predilatation.

10644258022	Clinical and ultrasonographic manifestations in major causes of common carotid artery occlusion	Background and Purpose. Atherosclerosis is the main cause of common carotid artery occlusion in most reports. This study aimed to identify the major causes of common carotid artery occlusion and compare the clinical features and carotid duplex ultrasonography findings of patients with common carotid artery occlusion attributable to each cause. Methods. Patients with common carotid artery occlusion documented by carotid duplex ultrasonography at the Neurovascular Laboratory (National Taiwan University Hospital) from 1988 to 2003 were included. Medical records and ultrasonographic findings were reviewed in detail to clarify the possible etiology of common carotid artery occlusion. Results. A total of 44 patients (male, 27 [61%]; female, 17 [39%]; mean age, 58 years) had common carotid artery occlusion attributable to a carotid duplex ultrasonography-identifiable cause. The causes of common carotid artery occlusion included atherosclerosis (17 [39%]), Takayasu's arteritis (11 [25%]), postirradiation arteriopathy (7 [16%]), cardiac embolism (6 [14%]), syphilis (1), blunt trauma (1), and homocystinuria (1). Among the patients with common carotid artery occlusion due to the 4 major causes, 27 (66%) had ischemic stroke and 14 (34%) had no symptoms or nonlocalizing symptoms. The frequency of symptomatic common carotid artery occlusion was 83% in those with cardioembolism, 76% in those with atherosclerosis, 71% in those with postirradiation arteriopathy, and 36% in those with Takayasu's arteritis. Common carotid artery occlusion usually involved the carotid bulb and distal common carotid artery in atherosclerosis (88%) and postirradiation arteriopathy (100%), but not in Takayasu's arteritis (27%). Echogenicity of occluded material was heterogeneous in atherosclerosis and post-irradiation arteriopathy patients but homogeneous in all Takayasu's arteritis patients. The authors postulate that the thrombotic mechanism might differ according to etiology. Conclusions. The causes of common carotid artery occlusion are diverse. Atherosclerosis, Takayasu's arteritis, and post-irradiation arteriopathy are the most common causes of common carotid artery occlusion in Taiwan. The clinical features, pathophysiology, and carotid duplex ultrasonography findings vary according to the cause of common carotid artery occlusion.

10844225151	Incidence and etiologies of stroke during pregnancy and puerperium as evidenced in Taiwanese women	Background: Pregnancy is a known risk factor for stroke, but relatively few studies have been conducted in Asian populations to document the risk. This study aimed to analyze the incidence and etiologies of stroke occurring during pregnancy and puerperium in Taiwanese women. Methods: From 1984 to 2002, female patients 15 through 40 years of age with first-ever stroke during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of delivery were recruited. Stroke was classified as ischemic stroke (IS), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The incidence, time of stroke onset (1st through 3rd trimester or puerperium), and etiologies of different stroke subtypes were analyzed. Results: Of 402 young female stroke patients, 49 had stroke during pregnancy and puerperium, including 16 with IS, 11 with CVT, 19 with ICH and 3 with SAH. After excluding referral patients, the incidences of pregnancy-related stroke were 46.2 (95% CI 30.7-69.5) per 100,000 pregnancies. 67% developed stroke in the 3rd trimester and puerperium, and 73% of CVT occurred in the puerperium period. Etiologies were well defined in 78% of patients. Eclampsia (37%) and arteriovenous malformation (26%) were the most important etiologies of ICH. For IS and CVT, rheumatic heart disease (44%) and coagulopathy (64%) were the major etiologies respectively. Conclusions: The incidence of stroke occurrence during pregnancy and puerperium in Taiwanese women is higher than that of Caucasian populations; the majority of strokes occurred in the 3rd trimester and puerperium, particularly CVT.

11544375732	Effects of mild whole body hyperthermia on graded focal ischaemia-reperfusion in a rat stroke model	The influence of body temperature on focal cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion was investigated by using a well established rat stroke model. Three different degrees of ischaemia were created in the cerebral cortex of the right middle cerebral artery territory by varying the duration of clamping of the bilateral common carotid arteries and the right middle cerebral artery with full reperfusion. Mild hyperthermic (body temperature 38-39°C) influence during ischaemia significantly enhanced the severity of infarction in mild (30 min) ischaemia, mean infarct volume was 78% greater than normothermic (body temperature 36.5-37.5°C) group (P < 0.001); and in moderate (60 min) ischaemia, mean infarct volume was 23% greater than in the normothermic group (P < 0.05); but no difference between the two groups was observed in severe (90 min) ischaemia. Our data suggest that mild whole body hyperthermia during focal ischaemia-reperfusion has a detrimental effect on the infarct volume only in mild and moderate ischaemia in this model. © Harcourt Brace & Co.

12144272162	Symptomatic ostial vertebral artery stenosis treated with tubular coronary stents: Clinical results and restenosis analysis	Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of stent implantation to treat ostial vertebral artery stenosis. Method: Fifty-eight symptomatic patients (44 men; mean age 72 years, range 54 to 88) with 67 ostial vertebral artery lesions received 67 balloon-expandable coronary stents. Follow-up angiography was performed if restenosis was suspected or during later catheterization for other indications. Restenosis was defined as >50% diameter narrowing. Result: Technical success was 100%. Periprocedural neurological complications included 2 (3.4%) posterior and 1 (1.7%) anterior strokes. Other complications included 1 (1.7%) massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion and endoscopic therapy, 1 (1.7%) femoral pseudoaneurysm requiring surgical repair, and 1 (1.7%) large shoulder hematoma secondary to a ruptured small branch of the thoracoacromial artery. Antiplatelet medication was discontinued in the ulcer patient, and the vertebral stent occluded at 8 months. At a mean follow-up of 31.3±17.1 months, 1 (1.7%) patient died after coronary bypass 2 months after stenting. One (1.7%) patient reported recurrent dizziness at 14 months and had angiographic evidence of in-stent restenosis. Angiographic evaluation of 32 (48%) lesions at a mean 11.0±9.6 months uncovered restenosis in 8 (25%) vessels, including the 2 cases noted above. Aside from these 2 patients, none of the other patients with restenosis were symptomatic. Multivariant Cox regression analysis showed reference vessel diameter as the only independent predictor of restenosis. Conclusion: Symptomatic ostial vertebral artery stenosis can be treated with relative safety using coronary techniques and equipment. Reference vessel diameter was the only predictor of restenosis in vertebral artery ostial stents.

13444304264	Arg332Cys mutation of NOTCH3 gene in the first known Taiwanese family with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy	The phenotype and genotype of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy and subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) in Caucasians have been well characterized, but CADASIL is less recognized in Asian populations. Here we investigated the first known Taiwanese family affected by CADASIL and identified an uncommon NOTCH3 mutation. The family had clinical manifestations in affected members including recurrent strokes, early dementia, and depression, but not migraine. A skin biopsy in the proband patient showed characteristic pathological findings of CADASIL on electron microscopy. Afterward, genetic analysis found an Arg332Cys mutation at exon 6 of NOTCH3. Neuropsychological evaluation showed vascular dementia in two of four affected people. Head MRI showed multiple infarcts in bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, periventricular white matter, external capsules, and brainstem, but involvement of the anterior temporal pole was found only in two people with milder symptoms. To our knowledge, the Arg332Cys NOTCH3 mutation at exon 6, which was identified in the studied family, has not been reported in Asian populations. Our findings emphasize the importance of genetic analysis of NOTCH3 for Asians with a phenotype typical of CADASIL. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
