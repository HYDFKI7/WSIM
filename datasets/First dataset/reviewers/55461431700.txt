36549022570	A Comparative Analysis of B Chromosomes and Genetic Diversity in Maize (Zea mays L.) Landraces from Southwest China	The number of B chromosomes (Bs) in 54 maize landraces from Southwest China was tested by means of cytological observations. Nine landraces with Bs were observed. A map, showing the geographic distribution of the landraces with Bs, was plotted. It was found that southeastern Sichuan Province in China was the main distribution area of the landraces with Bs in Southwest China. In order to obtain information on relationships between Bs and genetic variation, genetic diversity both among and within 11 landraces was evaluated. For each SSR marker, the number of alleles ranged from 3 to 12 with an average of 7.86, which revealed a high level of genetic diversity among maize landraces in Southwest China. Based on SSRs data, higher genetic variation was found in the landraces with 2B, and the genetic distance between the landraces with and without Bs was higher. The results together with the principal component analysis (PCA) supported the hypothesis that maize landraces in Southwest China were first introduced to the middle part of southwest Sichuan, China. At the same time, the effect of Bs on genetic variation was discussed. © 2007 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

37649019726	Comparative QTL Mapping of Resistance to Gray Leaf Spot in Maize Based on Bioinformatics	The integration QTL map for gray leaf spot resistance in maize was constructed by compiling a total of 57 QTLs available with genetic map IBM2 2005 neighbors as reference. Twenty-six "real QTLs" and seven consensus QTLs were identified by refining these 57 QTLs using overview and meta-analysis approaches. Seven consensus QTLs were found on chromosomes 1.06, 2.06, 3.04, 4.06, 4.08, 5.03, and 8.06, and the map coordinates were 552.53, 425.72, 279.20, 368.97, 583.21, 308.68 and 446.14 cM, respectively. Using a synteny conservation approach based on comparative mapping between the maize genetic map and rice physical map, a total of 69 rice and maize resistance genes collected from websites Gramene and MaizeGDB were projected onto the maize genetic map IBM2 2005 neighbors, and 2 (Rgene32, ht1), 4 (Rgene5, rp3, scmv2, wsm2), and 4 (ht2, Rgene6, Rgene8 and Rgene7) positional candidate genes were found in three consensus QTLs on chromosomes 2.06, 3.04, and 8.06, respectively. The results suggested that the combination of meta-analysis of gray leaf spot in maize and sequence homologous comparison between maize and rice could be an efficient strategy for identifying major QTLs and corresponding candidate genes for the gray leaf spot. © 2007 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

34249845075	The Effects of Low Phosphorus Stress on Morphological and Physiological Characteristics of Maize (Zea mays L.) Landraces	A field trial was conducted to investigate main morphological and physiological changes of different maize landraces to low-P stress at the stage of seedling. P-deficiency significantly decreased root volume, total leaf area, and plant dry weight, but greatly increased density of root hairs and root top ratio. In addition, P-deficiency induced the significant enhancement of phosphorus utilization efficiency and the amount of proline, malondialdehye (MDA), acid phosphatase (APase), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), but the significant reduction of P uptake and soluable protein content. Since P-deficiency had smaller effects on the P-tolerant maize landraces DP-44, DP-32 and DP-33 as compared with P-sensitive landraces DP-29 and DP-24, it was demonstrated that differences of tolerance to P-deficiency existed among different maize landraces. The results based on the correlation analysis showed that the economic yield of maize landraces had relationships with their morphological and physiological characteristics under P-deficiency. © 2007 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

58849150735	Analysis of digenic epistatic and QTL × environment interactions for resistance to banded leaf and sheath blight in maize (Zea mays)	Maize banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) due to Rhizoctonia solani Kühn, is an increasing problem in maize production areas, particularly in China and Southeast of Asian. A genetic map containing 146 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 229 F2 plants derived from the cross R 15 (resistant) × Ye 478 (susceptible) were used in this study. QTL were characterized in a population of 229 F2:4 lines derived from selfing the F2 plants and were evaluated with two replications at two environments, QTL mapping analysis of disease resistance index of banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) in a F2: 4 population was performed with QTL Mapper 2.0 software. Twelve pairs of distinctly digenic epistatic QTL including a total of seventeen QTL were detected and distributed on seven chromosomes (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 & 10), QTL main effects, epistatic effects, and QTL × environment (QE) interactions effects were predicted. Less than 20% of single effects, for identified QTL were significant at 5% level, most of which were dominance effects and additive × dominance epistatic interactions effects. There are few QTL with significantly QE interactions effects and they were mainly interactions between aa and environment. The information about QTL epistatic and QE interactions will facilitate marker-assisted (MAS) selection for BLSB resistance breeding programs in maize.

79952380268	A meta-analysis of QTL associated with ear rot resistance in maize	The three predominant ear rot (ER) diseases of maize are Aspergillus ear rot (AER), Fusarium ear rot (FER) and Gibberella ear rot (GER). These three diseases are responsible for most disease-related reductions in yield and quality. To identify QTL chromosome regions for resistance to these three ERs and to investigate the relationship among these resistances, 87(eightyseven) initial QTL from 14 studies were used to project meta-QTL (MQTL) on a high-density genetic linkage map (IBM2 neighbors 2008). The results showed that 29 MQTL (each MQTL comprising two to six initial QTL) were projected on chromosomes 1 to 8. Six MQTL located on chromosomes 3 and 4 were recommended to use for improving ER resistance in a marker assisted selection (MAS) program. Meta-analysis also indicated that QTL from different ER types and resistance sources were clustered on the same chromosome regions, particularly on bins 3.04 and 2.08. Among eight resistance sources, CO387 contributed 18 of 29 MQTL.

80052648330	Advances on research epigenetic change of hybrid and polyploidy in plants	Hybridization between different species, and subsequently polyploidy, play an important role in plant genome evolution, as well as it is a widely used approach for crop improvement. Recent studies of the last several years have demonstrated that, hybridization and subsequent genome doubling (polyploidy) often induce an array of variations that could not be explained by the conventional genetic paradigms. A large proportion of these variations are epigenetic in nature. Epigenetic can be defined as a change of the study in the regulation of gene activity and expression that are not driven by gene sequence information. However, the ramifications of epigenetic in plant biology are immense, yet unappreciated. In contrast to the ease with which the DNA sequence can be studied, studying the complex patterns inherent in epigenetic poses many problems. In this view, advances on researching epigenetic change of hybrid and polyploidy in plants will be initially set out by summarizing the latest researches and the basic studies on epigenetic variations generated by hybridization. Moreover, polyploidy may shed light on the mechanisms generating these variations. These advances will enhance our understanding on their evolutionary significances, as well as enable us to utilize these variations more effectively than before in crop breeding. © 2011 Academic Journals.

84888012239	Combined small RNA and degradome sequencing reveals microRNA regulation during immature maize embryo dedifferentiation	Genetic transformation of maize is highly dependent on the development of embryonic calli from the dedifferentiated immature embryo. To better understand the regulatory mechanism of immature embryo dedifferentiation, we generated four small RNA and degradome libraries from samples representing the major stages of dedifferentiation. More than 186 million raw reads of small RNA and degradome sequence data were generated. We detected 102 known miRNAs belonging to 23 miRNA families. In total, we identified 51, 70 and 63 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in the stage I, II, III samples, respectively, compared to the control. However, only 6 miRNAs were continually up-regulated by more than fivefold throughout the process of dedifferentiation. A total of 87 genes were identified as the targets of 21 DEM families. This group of targets was enriched in members of four significant pathways including plant hormone signal transduction, antigen processing and presentation, ECM-receptor interaction, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. The hormone signal transduction pathway appeared to be particularly significant, involving 21 of the targets. While the targets of the most significant DEMs have been proved to play essential roles in cell dedifferentiation. Our results provide important information regarding the regulatory networks that control immature embryo dedifferentiation in maize. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84897555312	Genome expression profile analysis of the maize sheath in response to inoculation to R. solani	Currently, the molecular regulation mechanisms of disease-resistant involved in maize leaf sheaths infected by banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) are poorly known. To gain insight into the transcriptome dynamics that are associated with their disease-resistant, genome-wide gene expression profiling was conducted by Solexa sequencing. More than four million tags were generated from sheath tissues without any leaf or development leaf, including 193,222 and 204,824 clean tags in the two libraries, respectively. Of these, 82,864 (55.4 %) and 91,678 (51.5 %) tags were matched to the reference genes. The most differentially expressed tags with log2 ratio >2 or <-2 (P < 0.001) were further analyzed, representing 1,476 up-regulated and 1,754 down-regulated genes, except for unknown transcripts, which were classified into 11 functional categories. The most enriched categories were those of metabolism, signal transduction and cellular transport. Next, the expression patterns of 12 genes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, and it is showed the results were general agreement with the Solexa analysis, although the degree of change was lower in amplitude. In conclusion, we first reveal the complex changes in the transcriptome during the early development of maize sheath infected by BLSB and provide a comprehensive set of data that are essential for understanding its molecular regulation mechanism. © 2014 The Author(s).

84897946511	Identification of candidate genes for drought tolerance by whole-genome resequencing in maize	Background: Drought stress is one of the major limiting factors for maize production. With the availability of maize B73 reference genome and whole-genome resequencing of 15 maize inbreds, common variants (CV) and clustering analyses were applied to identify non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and corresponding candidate genes for drought tolerance. Results: A total of 524 nsSNPs that were associated with 271 candidate genes involved in plant hormone regulation, carbohydrate and sugar metabolism, signaling molecules regulation, redox reaction and acclimation of photosynthesis to environment were detected by CV and cluster analyses. Most of the nsSNPs identified were clustered in bin 1.07 region that harbored six previously reported QTL with relatively high phenotypic variation explained for drought tolerance. Genes Ontology (GO) analysis of candidate genes revealed that there were 35 GO terms related to biotic stimulus and membrane-bounded organelle, showing significant differences between the candidate genes and the reference B73 background. Changes of expression level in these candidate genes for drought tolerance were detected using RNA sequencing for fertilized ovary, basal leaf meristem tissue and roots collected under drought stressed and well-watered conditions. The results indicated that 70% of candidate genes showed significantly expression changes under two water treatments and our strategies for mining candidate genes are feasible and relatively efficient. Conclusions: Our results successfully revealed candidate nsSNPs and associated genes for drought tolerance by comparative sequence analysis of 16 maize inbred lines. Both methods we applied were proved to be efficient for identifying candidate genes for complex traits through the next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS). These selected genes will not only facilitate understanding of genetic basis of drought stress response, but also accelerate genetic improvement through marker-assisted selection in maize. © 2014 Xu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84907942413	Microemulsion formulation of carbendazim and its in vitro antifungal activities evaluation	The fungus Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn is a widespread and destructive plant pathogen with a very broad host range. Althoughvarious pathogens, including R. solani, have been traditionally controlled using chemical pesticides, their use faces drawbacks such as environmental pollution, development of pesticide resistance, and other negative effects. Carbendazim is a well-known antifungal agent capable of controlling a broad range of plant diseases, but its use is hampered by its poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we describe an environmentally friendly pharmaceutical microemulsion system using carbendazim as the active ingredient, chloroform and acetic acid as solvents, and the surfactants HSH and 0204 as emulsifiers. This system increased the solubility of carbendazim to 30 g/L. The optimal microemulsion formulation was determined based on a pseudo-ternary phase diagram; its physicochemical characteristics were also tested. The cloud point was greater than 90uC and it was resistant to freezing down to 218uC, both of which are improvements over the temperature range in which pure carbendazim can be used. This microemulsion meets the standard for pesticide microemulsions and demonstrated better activity against R. solani AG1-IA, relative to an aqueous solution of pure carbendazim (0.2 g/L). The mechanism of activity was reflected in the inhibition of against R. solani AG1-IA including mycelium growth, and sclerotia formation and germination were significantly better than that of 0.2 g/L carbendazim water solution according to the results of t-test done by SPSS 19.

84925876569	Heterosis in early maize ear inflorescence development: A genome-wide transcription analysis for two maize inbred lines and their hybrid	Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, contributes to superior agronomic performance of hybrids compared to their inbred parents. Despite its importance, little is known about the genetic and molecular basis of heterosis. Early maize ear inflorescences formation affects grain yield, and are thus an excellent model for molecular mechanisms involved in heterosis. To determine the parental contributions and their regulation during maize ear-development-genesis, we analyzed genome-wide digital gene expression profiles in two maize elite inbred lines (B73 and Mo17) and their F<inf>1</inf> hybrid using deep sequencing technology. Our analysis revealed 17,128 genes expressed in these three genotypes and 22,789 genes expressed collectively in the present study. Approximately 38% of the genes were differentially expressed in early maize ear inflorescences from heterotic cross, including many transcription factor genes and some presence/absence variations (PAVs) genes, and exhibited multiple modes of gene action. These different genes showing differential expression patterns were mainly enriched in five cellular component categories (organelle, cell, cell part, organelle part and macromolecular complex), five molecular function categories (structural molecule activity, binding, transporter activity, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity and catalytic activity), and eight biological process categories (cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, regulation of biological process, establishment of localization, cellular component organization or biogenesis, response to stimulus and localization). Additionally, a significant number of genes were expressed in only one inbred line or absent in both inbred lines. Comparison of the differences of modes of gene action between previous studies and the present study revealed only a small number of different genes had the same modes of gene action in both maize seedlings and ear inflorescences. This might be an indication that in different tissues or developmental stages, different global expression patterns prevail, which might nevertheless be related to heterosis. Our results support the hypotheses that multiple molecular mechanisms (dominance and overdominance modes) contribute to heterosis. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

45949098996	Improving inorganic phosphorus content in maize seeds by introduction of phytase gene	In our research, the plant endosperm special expression vector pCBA with target gene phyA was introduced into maize inbred line 19-599 (red) by microprojectile bombardment transformation. The result of PCR assay and Southern hybridization for regenerated plants showed genomes of seven plants were embedded with target gene phyA. Of the seven plants, seeds of four plants were collected successfully. The result of phytase activity assay revealed, phytase activities of dry seeds of three plants exhibited distinct increase compared to the control. The top phytase activity of them increased by 60.85% and the according inorganic phosphate content increased by 47.84%. It is concluded that the foreign gene phyA was expressed to a certain extent and that transgenic phytase promoted decomposing of phytic acid of seeds, which led to improvement of inorganic phosphorus content in transgenic seeds. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

53549089609	Differential Expression of Mitochondrial Proteins Between C-Type Cytoplasmic Male Sterility Line C48-2 and Its Maintainer Line in Maize	To seek some evidence and explanation for the sterility mechanism of C-type cytoplasmic male sterility (C-CMS) in maize (Zea mays L.), a C-type sterile line (C48-2) and its maintainer (N48-2) were used, for analyzing the differential expression of their anther mitochondrial proteome. The mitochondrial proteins in the anthers were separated first by two-dimensional electrophoresis, with immobilized pI (3-10, nonlinear) gradients, and later by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie brilliant blue-stained protein spots were analyzed using software PDQUEST. There were about 260 detectable spots on each 2D-gel. With direct MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis and protein database searching, only 2 out of 10 protein spots were selected as important candidates, based on reliability and differential amounts. They were putative glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and voltage-dependent anion channel protein-1 (VDAC1), respectively. Both of them were upregulated in the mononuclear phase of C48-2. The GDH exists mainly in mitochondria of higher plants and plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism. The upregulation of GDH affects the normal energy supply during plant development, probably leading to cytoplasmic sterility. The VDAC1 plays an essential role not only in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, but also in apoptosis, mediated by the mitochondrial pathway. Overexpression of VDAC1 in a variety of cells induces apoptotic cell death, indicating that VDAC1 functions as a conserved mitochondrial element of the death machinery. It is suggested that GDH and VDAC1 in the mitochondria probably cause the sterility in C-CMS in maize. © 2008 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

68849111298	Development of Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) Primers for the Detection of Resistance to Sporisorium reiliana in Maize	Head smut of maize (Zea mays L.), which was caused by Sporisorium reiliana, occurred in most of the maize growing areas of the world. The purpose of this study was to develop SCAR markers for map-based cloning of resistance genes and MAS. Two sets of BC3 progenies, one (BC3Q) derived from the cross Qi319 (resistance) × Huangzao 4 (susceptible), the other (BC3M) from Mo17 (resistance) × Huangzao 4 (susceptible), were generated. Huangzao 4 was the recurrent parent in both progenies. A combination of BSA (bulked segregant analysis) with AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) method was applied to map the genes involving the resistance to S. reiliana, and corresponding resistant and susceptible bulks and their parental lines were used for screening polymorphic AFLP primer pairs. One fragment of P13M61-152 was converted into SCAR (sequence charactered amplified fragment) marker S130. The marker was mapped at chromosome bin 2.09, the interval of a major QTL region previously reported to contribute to S. reiliana resistance. Furthermore, S130 was highly associated with resistance to S. reiliana, and could be useful for marker-assisted selection and facilitate map-based cloning of resistance genes. © 2009 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

RNA editing of two mitochondrial or organs genes, atp6 and cox2, in different tissues were analyzed using homonucleic but alloplasmic, and homoplasmic but heteronucleic maize (zea mays L.) as experimental materials. A total of 18 and 26 editing sites for atp6 conservative region transcript were identified by direct and clone sequencing, respectively. By direct sequencing 23 and 22 editing sites for cox2 transcript were identified in 48-2 and Huangzaosi nuclear backgrounds, respectively. From the direct sequencing results, the occurrence rates of different transcripts generally increase in sterile lines.

77951859490	Structural and functional characterization of a pollen-specific promoter NTPp13 in tobacco	A novel 407 bp nucleotide sequence NTPp13 was isolated from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) by PCR, its structure and function were characterized. The NTPp13 sequence was highly homologous with the pollen-specific expression promoter Zm13 from maize (Zea mays L.) and contained some key motifs which controlled pollen-specific expression. The NTPp13 was fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and transferred into tobacco. Analysis of the transgenic plants revealed that this putative promoter fragment was sufficient to direct GUS expression specifically in the anther, exactly in the pollen and pollen tube, and that GUS activity reached the maximum at the stage of pollen grain began to separate. Further study showed that the expression of NTPp13 sequence at pollen was stable at the range of temperature measured. These data suggested that the NTPp13 sequence was likely the essential element of promoter region of an unknown pollen-specific gene from tobacco. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

77953906543	Effects of Mass Selection on Maize Synthetic Populations	For evaluating the effects on improvement of different maize (Zea mays L.) synthetic populations, genetic parameters derived from simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were statistically analyzed with maize synthetic populations GP3, GP4, and GP5 after 4 cycles of mass selection. Genetic differences were observed in most traits across populations or cycles, and the interaction between population and cycle was significant. The genetic gains ranked as GP3 < GP5 < GP4 for kernel depth and as GP3 > GP5 > GP4 for row number per ear. Means of kernel depth and row number per ear were obviously increased after 4 cycles of mass selection, showing significantly direct responses to selection. Plant height and ear height were enhanced by selection, and the increment in GP4 was significantly higher than that in GP3 and GP5. The genetic gains of yield per plant and ear diameter were higher in GP4 than in GP3 and GP5. In all populations, most yield traits were improved in cycle C4 compared to those in cycle C0, showing a significant correlated response. Except for plant height and ear height, the other traits showed significant variations in GCA, and the GCA effects of GP5 in most yield traits were higher than those of GP3 and GP4. In most yield traits, the GCA effects tended to increase with the progress of population improvement through mass selection. Testcross combinations with yield per plant more than 8% over the controls were derived from the cycle C4, showing a significantly indirect response to mass selection. The variation coefficients of phenotypic traits varied slightly across selection cycles. The genetic similarity based on SSR data showed slight increases in GP3 and GP4, but relative stability in GP5. With the increase of selection cycle, the genotype number in derivatives had small reductions in GP3 and GP4, but an increase tendency in GP5. These results indicate that mass selection is not only effective for population improvement but also maintained the genetic diversity of the population. The effect of genetic improvement varied across populations of traits. © 2010 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

77956701114	Heavy metal-transport proteins in plants; A revie	The heavy metals in soil not only damage plant growth, but also threaten the health of human beings and animals through food chain. Heavy metal-transport proteins play crucial roles in the heavy metals uptake and tolerance of plants. Plant heavy metal-transport proteins can be classified as metal-uptake proteins and metal-efflux proteins. The metal-uptake proteins can transport essential heavy metals into cytoplasm, and also, transport toxic heavy metals into cytoplasm due to the absence of essential heavy metals or the competition among ions. The metal-efflux proteins are a group of detoxification proteins, which can efflux excess and toxic heavy metals from cytoplasm, or move these metals into vacuole. In recent years, the associations between elevated steady-state transcript levels of heavy metal-transporter genes and metal accumulation in plants have been revealed, and many heavy metal-transport proteins have been cloned and identified. In this paper, the metal affinity, tissue-specific gene expression, and cellular location of representative heavy metal-transport proteins were reviewed.

77957987720	Genetic diversity and classification of maize landraces from China's Sichuan Basin based on agronomic traits, quality traits, combining ability and SSR markers	Twenty-two maize landraces representing all the ecosystems in the Sichuan Basin were analyzed based on agronomic traits, quality traits, combining ability and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Of the 22 landraces, Dazhaibaogu, Dahuang and Yuzuibaogu exhibited the best agronomic performance, while Nuoyumi, Rongzhaiyumi and Dadudu had the highest oil, protein and starch content, respectively. Thirteen of the landraces with medium to late maturity ratings were used in a combining ability study with five testers. General combining ability (GCA) effects for grain yield per plant were significantly different among the 13 landraces: five (Hanyuanhongbaogu, Dabaimaya, Xuesi, Dahuang and Dazhaibaogu) had the highest GCA effects. Based on the specific combing ability (SCA) effects for grain yield per plant, the 13 landraces were divided into three preliminary heterotic groups. A total of 220 individuals from the 22 landraces were fingerprinted with 41 SSR markers to determine the genetic diversity. The number of polymorphic bands, percentage of polymorphic bands, genetic diversity, effective number of alleles and Shannon's information index of the 22 landraces were 211, 74.18%, 0.27, 1.47 and 0.40, respectively. The 22 landraces were classed into three groups based on SSR markers. The results indicated that clustering of landraces was associated with the ecological environment from which the landraces originated. In this study, Dazhaibaogu, Dahuang, Yuzuibaogu, Xuesi and Dabaimaya were the landraces determined to have the most promising characteristics for further use in a maize breeding program.

78650312808	Construction of root library by SSH and preliminary analysis of genes responsible for phosphorus deficiency in maize	An elite maize inbred line with high tolerance to low phosphorus, 178, was studied for constructing root library and analyzing some genes closely related to phosphorus (P) deficiency using SSH and Semiquantitative RT-PCR. As a result, 3648 preliminary clones were obtained for root library under stress of P deficiency. By DNA sequencing of 34 random clones, we obtained 23 unique EST sequences which are involved in functions of root cell structure, tolerance and defense, protein modification and composition, transcription regulation, metabolism, and other unknown aspects. Five representative genes were further analyzed for their expression models. The results suggested that the molecular mechanism to adapt P deficiency in maize, performed by multi-genes with different contributions, is similar to rice, Arabidopsis and soybean. The expression order of 5 low P tolerant genes in maize root was PAP, GCS, TOM, PDI and AIP. And it was considered preliminarily that physiological and biochemical changes were prior to morphologic changes in maize root and the essential tolerance to low P may be determined by extending absorption of P to wide soil range through adaption of root architecture and root secretions, which is the greatest difference between tolerant and sensitive maize varieties under low P stress. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

79952988711	Cytoplasmic male sterility-regulated novel microRNAs from maize	In higher plants, microRNA (miRNA) is involved in regulation of developmental processes, including sexual organ development. Seven novel miRNA families with one known miRNA were isolated by constructing a small RNA library from a mixture of anther from a cytoplasmic male sterile line and its maintainer. Two miRNAs are conserved in plant species. A total of 18 potential targets were identified for the eight miRNA families, including 15 proteins annotated with function and three unknown proteins. The known proteins include several proteins relevant to cell structure and stress response, transcription factors, and enzymes associated with metabolic and signaling pathways, playing important roles in microspore development. Quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed different expression patterns of the miRNAs between the cytoplasmic male sterile line and its maintainer. Each of the miRNAs tended to be down-regulated after the tetrad stage in a fertile line. However, most of the miRNAs in the cytoplasmic male sterile line were shown to be up-regulated from the tetrad to mononuclear stage, displaying special expression patterns differing from the ones in fertile line. We conclude that additional inactive miRNA pathways are essential during pollen development for a fertile line to ensure male fertility. Contrarily, miRNAs are up-regulated during the period from the tetrad to mononuclear stage, which contributes to pollen abortion for a cytoplasmic male sterile line. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79961129195	Large-scale screening for maize drought resistance using multiple selection criteria evaluated under water-stressed and well-watered environments	A total of 550 maize inbred lines collected from global breeding programs were evaluated for drought resistance under both well-watered and water-stressed environments. The evaluation was based on multiple measurements of biomass taken before and after the drought stress was applied using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), along with other selection criteria including anthesis-silking interval, leaf senescence, chlorophyll content, root capacitance, final grain yield, and grain yield components. Kernel weight was the most stable trait under drought stress. Correlations between the primary trait (grain yield) and the secondary traits, except the root capacitance and ASI under water-stressed condition, were all significant. Root capacitance had relatively low heritability and low genetic correlation with other drought resistance criteria, and is not recommended as a drought resistance criterion. Significant reduction of NDVI values measured in the afternoon when the leaves became rolling, compared to those measured in the morning when the leaves were open, provides a reliable index for leaf rolling, which however was not significantly correlated with grain yield. NDVIs measured across different developmental stages were highly correlated with each other and with most of the secondary traits as well as, grain yield, indicating that NDVI can be used as a secondary trait for large-scale drought resistance screening. Regression models built based on non-yield drought criteria and yield components explained about 40% and 95% of the variation for the grain yield, respectively. Some maize lines developed in China for temperate regions showed strong drought resistance comparable to tropical maize lines when tested under tropical condition, indicating that temperate lines with a wide adaptability can be used in drought resistance breeding for both temperate and tropical environments. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80051572784	A high-through technique to measure DNA Methylation	MethyLight is a sodium-bisulfite-dependent, quantitative, fluorescence-based, real-time PCR strategy that is used to detect and quantify DNA methylation in genomic DNA. High-throughput MethyLight allows the rapid and sensitive detection of very low frequencies of hypermethylated alleles in populations of alternated individuals. The high sensitivity and specificity of MethyLight can be applied not only to make it uniquely suited disease clinical but also quantitatively assessed of these low-frequency methylation events. Owing to its full of advantages of simple procedure, high efficiency and high sensitivity, MethyLight provides a powerful approach for clinical examination, Gene expression analysis, SNP analysis and allele analysis. Coupled with other techniques, MethyLight can be used immediately in identifying allelic alterations in genes exhibiting expressions correlating with phenotypes, Locating an allelic series of induced point mutations in genes of interest.

82355164390	Characterization of correlation between grain moisture and ear rot resistance in maize by QTL meta-analysis	Ear rot (ER) in maize is a prevalent disease worldwide which reduces yield and grain quality. Grain moisture content (GM) is an important factor which impacts the fungal development of ER species. Our purpose was to identify the genomic regions of maize in the control of GM and ER resistance, and the correlations between two traits. A meta-analysis was carried out using 241 quantitative trait loci (QTL) from 29 studies to propose meta-QTL (MQTL) on a high-density genetic linkage map (IBM 2 neighbors 2008). For GM content, 44 MQTL were identified on all chromosomes except for chromosome 9, while 29 MQTL were found for ER resistance, mainly located on chromosomes 3, 6 and 7. Moreover, 14 overlapping domains for GM MQTL and ER MQTL were observed on chromosomes 2, 3, 6 and 7, mainly focused on five active regions (bins 2.08-2.09, 3.04, 3.06, 6.04-6.06 and 7.03-7.03). There were 13 genes in the overlapping domain which could be divided into five classes: stress-related gene, photosystem-related gene, architecture-related gene, dynamic-related gene and seminal-related gene. It was possibly that the five-class genes were simultaneously related with GM and ER. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84862549645	Development of a difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion and its antifungal activities against Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA	According to its physical and chemical properties, the composition of difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion was as follows: xylene as solvent, emulsifier HSH as surfactant and methanol as cosurfactant. The optimal formulation of difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion was oil/SAA/water = 1/2/5 (w/w), in which the SAA consisted of emulsifier HSH and methanol with ratio of 3/2 (w/w). The cloud point of difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion was 70 ? C and its effective ingredient content was 2.5% measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Its heat storage stability was studied according to the standards. The decomposition rates of the difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion were merely 2.45%, 2.63% respectively and met the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) standards of pesticide microemulsion. Investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) the particle size of difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion was 90?140nm and its antifungal activities against Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA were tested and compared with that of Meiyu. We found that the inhibition rates in the difenoconazole/propiconazole microemulsion treatment group were significantly higher than that of the emulsion group with the same content of effective ingredients and the study also revealed that its inhibiting ability on the formation and germination of sclerotia was significant.

84862254478	The Genetic Architecture of Flowering Time and Photoperiod Sensitivity in Maize as Revealed by QTL Review and Meta Analysis	The control of flowering is not only important for reproduction, but also plays a key role in the processes of domestication and adaptation. To reveal the genetic architecture for flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity, a comprehensive evaluation of the relevant literature was performed and followed by meta analysis. A total of 25 synthetic consensus quantitative trait loci (QTL) and four hot-spot genomic regions were identified for photoperiod sensitivity including 11 genes related to photoperiod response or flower morphogenesis and development. Besides, a comparative analysis of the QTL for flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity highlighted the regions containing shared and unique QTL for the two traits. Candidate genes associated with maize flowering were identified through integrated analysis of the homologous genes for flowering time in plants and the consensus QTL regions for photoperiod sensitivity in maize (Zea mays L.). Our results suggest that the combination of literature review, meta-analysis and homologous blast is an efficient approach to identify new candidate genes and create a global view of the genetic architecture for maize photoperiodic flowering. Sequences of candidate genes can be used to develop molecular markers for various models of marker-assisted selection, such as marker-assisted recurrent selection and genomic selection that can contribute significantly to crop environmental adaptation. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this study, 19 representative elite maize inbred lines and 3 hybrid varieties were investigated at the seedling stage, which can accumulate Pb and Cd in the stems and leaves, respectively. The results demonstrated that significant differences are among inbred lines for accumulation of heavy metals, implying that the Cd accumulation is significant correlation between the male parents and their hybrids and some inbred lines have been selected for cross-breeding with low Pb or Cd accumulation, such as S37, 9782, and ES40; Moreover, some inbred lines could be suitable for phytoremediation species for soil bioremediation with high levels of Pb and Cd accumulation, including 178, R08, 48-2, and Mo17ht.

84862955056	Applications and development trends in biopesticides	Biopesticides are very effective in the agricultural pest control without causing serious harm to ecological chain or worsening environmental pollution. The research and development of practical applications in the field of biopesticides greatly mitigate environmental pollution caused by chemical pesticide residues and promotes sustainable development of agriculture. Since the advent of biopesticides, a large number of products have been released, several of which have already played dominant roles in the market. The development of biopesticides stimulates modernization of agriculture and will, without doubt, gradually replace chemical pesticides. Many biopesticides are ideal substitutes for their traditional chemical counterparts in pollution-free agricultural production, but some of them display certain toxicity; this should be taken into consideration by the researchers in the field. In this paper, we discuss the current development and application of biopesticides from various categories, the problems occurring in the process of their development and proposing the introduction of various constraints. We review various studies and analyze the development trends in biopesticides in agriculture, demand, market and other fields. © 2011 Academic Journals.

84862973323	Molecular cloning and characterization of pathogenesis-related protein 5 in Zea mays and its antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani	We described the cloning and characterization of pathogenesis-related protein 5 gene in maize, named ZmPR5 (GenBank Accession Number: HM230665). Molecular and bioinformatic analyses of ZmPR5 revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 525 bp, encoding a protein of 175 amino acids (aa) and a deduced molecular mass of 17.5 KDa. Homology analysis of the Zea mays L. deduced amino acid sequence, indicated homology between 40 and 74% with Oryza sativa, Hordeum vulgare, and Triticum aestivum, among others. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of ZmPR5 is constantly higher in the maize resistant inbred line R15 compared with that in the susceptible inbred line 478. Moreover, the ZmPR5 gene was up-regulated after it was challenged by Rhizoctonia solani. We subsequently purified the recombinant protein and analyzed its antimicrobial activities in vitro. The results obtained show that the recombinant protein inhibited hyphal growth of R. solani. This study suggests that the expression of ZmPR5 is closely related to maize sheath blight resistance caused by R. solani. Further, the antifungal activity of ZmPR5 showed that ZmPR5 plays an important role in the disease resistance response. © 2011 Academic Journals.

84863073996	Identification of genes differentially expressed in maize (Zea mays L.) during Rhizoctonia Solani Kühn infection by suppression subtractive hybridization	Banded leaf and sheath blight (BLSB) caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kühn is an emerging problem in maize worldwide. To study gene expression in maize plants infected by R. solani Kühn, we constructed two suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library using complementary DNA (cDNA) from uninoculated plants as a driver and those from inoculated plants as a tester. After two cycles of hybridization, 84 cDNA clones from the forward and reverse SSH library were obtained and sequenced. Gene analysis indicated that these clones represented 51 single genes, and the functions of 35 genes could be assigned using existing databases. Thirty-five expression sequences tags (ESTs) were classified in fuctional categories, such as: transcription, regulation, protein processing, metabolism, defense, disease response and other functions. The expression of 15 genes was analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and found to be up-regulated or down-regulated in response to R. solani Kühn re-infection. In conclusion, this study provides a basis for a molecular understanding of host reaction in response to pathogen. © 2012 Academic Journals.

84863364799	Genome expression profile analysis of the immature maize embryo during dedifferentiation	Maize is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide and one of the primary targets of genetic manipulation, which provides an excellent way to promote its production. However, the obvious difference of the dedifferentiation frequency of immature maize embryo among various genotypes indicates that its genetic transformation is dependence on genotype and immature embryo-derived undifferentiated cells. To identify important genes and metabolic pathways involved in forming of embryo-derived embryonic calli, in this study, DGE (differential gene expression) analysis was performed on stages I, II, and III of maize inbred line 18-599R and corresponding control during the process of immature embryo dedifferentiation. A total of ~21 million cDNA tags were sequenced, and 4,849,453, 5,076,030, 4,931,339, and 5,130,573 clean tags were obtained in the libraries of the samples and the control, respectively. In comparison with the control, 251, 324 and 313 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the three stages with more than five folds, respectively. Interestingly, it is revealed that all the DEGs are related to metabolism, cellular process, and signaling and information storage and processing functions. Particularly, the genes involved in amino acid and carbohydrate transport and metabolism, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and signal transduction mechanism have been significantly changed during the dedifferentiation. To our best knowledge, this study is the first genome-wide effort to investigate the transcriptional changes in dedifferentiation immature maize embryos and the identified DEGs can serve as a basis for further functional characterization. © 2012 Shen et al.

84868634724	Cloning and characterization of miRNAs from maize seedling roots under low phosphorus stress	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding regulatory RNAs that regulate gene expression by guiding target mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition in plants and animals. In this study, a small RNA library was constructed to identify conserved miRNAs as well as novel miRNAs in maize seedling roots under low level phosphorus stress. Twelve miRNAs were identified by high throughput sequencing of the library and subsequent analysis, two belong to conserved miRNA families (miRNA399b and miRNA156), and the remaining ten are novel and one of latter is conserved in gramineous species. Based on sequence homology, we predicted 125 potential target genes of these miRNAs and then expression patterns of 7 miRNAs were validated by semi-RT-PCR analysis. MiRNA399b, Zma-miR3, and their target genes (Zmpt1 and Zmpt2) were analyzed by real-time PCR. It is shown that both miRNA399b and Zma-miR3 are induced by low phosphorus stress and regulated by their target genes (Zmpt1 and Zmpt2). Moreover, Zma-miR3, regulated by two maize inorganic phosphate transporters as a newly identified miRNAs, would likely be directly involved in phosphate homeostasis, so was miRNA399b in Arabidopsis and rice. These results indicate that both conserved and maize-specific miRNAs play important roles in stress responses and other physiological processes correlated with phosphate starvation, regulated by their target genes. Identification of these differentially expressed miRNAs will facilitate us to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of maize seedling roots development under low level phosphorus stress. © 2012 The Author(s).

84872174127	Overexpression of an Incw2 gene in endosperm improved yieldrelated traits in maize	High yield is an eternal goal for crop breeding. Incw2 protein is the enzyme in the metabolic pathway that mobilizes photoassimilated sucrose into numerous reactions of the developing plant seeds, associated with grain yield. In the research, an Incw2 gene driven by 27 kD zein promoter was specifically over-expressed in the endosperm cells of maize inbred line 18-599R by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. PCR assay displayed that ten of the regenerated plants were integrated with the target gene. By semi-quantitative RT-PCR and invertase activity analysis, five of them showed significantly higher expression of Incw2 transcripts and enzyme activity compared to the wild type. Among them, line 1 stood out because it possessed the highest level of Incw2 mRNA and enzyme activity. The effects of Incw2 over-expression were reflected in the increased chlorophyll content, improved photosynthesis and delay of leaf senility. In addition, yield-related traits such as ear length, ear diameter, ear weight, grain weight per ear, and hundred-kernel weight appeared to be improved in three of the transformants compared with the wild type. The grain weight per plant of line1 was increased by nearly 10%. The results collectively indicate that it is potentially practical to enhance kernel yield of maize by overexpression of Incw2 in endosperm.

Biofortified foods can potentially be an inexpensive, locally adaptable, and long-term solution to dietary-nutrient deficiency. In order to improve the β-carotene content in maize grain by breeding and minimize vitamin A deficiency, a complete diallel cross was designed with eight inbred lines of maize, and 64 combinations were obtained in this study. The experimental combinations were planted in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, respectively, with a random complete block design. The β-carotene contents in the grains of the experimental materials were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the tested materials, the effect difference of general combining ability of the β-carotene content was significant; however, the effect difference of the special combining ability and the reciprocal effect were not significant. The β-carotene content of maize grain was not influenced significantly by the cross and the reciprocal cross.

84873750102	Genome expression profile analysis reveals important transcripts in maize roots responding to the stress of heavy metal Pb	Lead (Pb) has become one of the most abundant heavy metal pollutants of the environment. With its large biomass, maize could be an important object for studying the phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated soil. In our previous research, we screened 19 inbred lines of maize for Pb concentration, and line 178 was identified to be a hyperaccumulator for Pb in both the roots and aboveground parts. To identify important genes and metabolic pathways related to Pb accumulation and tolerance, line 178 was underwent genome expression profile under Pb stress and a control (CK). A total of approximately 11 million cDNA tags were sequenced and 4 665 539 and 4 936 038 clean tags were obtained from the libraries of the test and CK, respectively. In comparison to CK, 2379 and 1832 genes were identified up- or downregulated, respectively, more than fivefolds under Pb stress. Interestingly, all the genes were related to cellular processes and signaling, information storage and processing or metabolism functions. Particularly, the genes involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones; signal transduction, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; and lipid transport and metabolism significantly changed under the treatment. In addition, seven pathways including ribosome, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation were affected significantly, with 118, 12, 34, 21, 18, 72 and 43 differentially expressed genes involved. The significant upregulation of the ribosome pathway may reveal an important secret for Pb tolerance of line 178. And the sharp increase of laccase transcripts and metal ion transporters were suggested to account in part for Pb hyperaccumulation in the line. © Physiologia Plantarum 2012.

84879472246	Identification of promoter motifs regulating ZmeIF4E expression level involved in maize rough dwarf disease resistance in maize (Zea Mays L.)	Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD, a viral disease) results in significant grain yield losses, while genetic basis of which is largely unknown. Based on comparative genomics, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) was considered as a candidate gene for MRDD resistance, validation of which will help to understand the possible genetic mechanism of this disease. ZmeIF4E (orthologs of eIF4E gene in maize) encodes a protein of 218 amino acids, harboring five exons and no variation in the cDNA sequence is identified between the resistant inbred line, X178 and susceptible one, Ye478. ZmeIF4E expression was different in the two lines plants treated with three plant hormones, ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonates at V3 developmental stage, suggesting that ZmeIF4E is more likely to be involved in the regulation of defense gene expression and induction of local and systemic resistance. Moreover, four cis-acting elements related to plant defense responses, including DOFCOREZM, EECCRCAH1, GT1GAMSCAM4, and GT1CONSENSUS were detected in ZmeIF4E promoter for harboring sequence variation in the two lines. Association analysis with 163 inbred lines revealed that one SNP in EECCRCAH1 is significantly associated with CSI of MRDD in two environments, which explained 3.33 and 9.04 % of phenotypic variation, respectively. Meanwhile, one SNP in GT-1 motif was found to affect MRDD resistance only in one of the two environments, which explained 5.17 % of phenotypic variation. Collectively, regulatory motifs respectively harboring the two significant SNPs in ZmeIF4E promoter could be involved in the defense process of maize after viral infection. These results contribute to understand maize defense mechanisms against maize rough dwarf virus. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84880299032	Analysis on the relationship between Fusarium verticillioides infection-induced genes and ear rot resistance in maize	Fusarium ear rot is a destructive disease in maize mostly caused by the fungus Fusarium verticillioides (FV), which results in reduction of grain yield. To investigate the relationship between the responsive genes during FV infection and QTL chromosome regions for resistance to ear rot in maize, the differentially expressed genes and resistant QTL were co-localized on the reference map IBM2 neighbors 2008 (Intermated B73×Mo17 Map) in the maize chromosome regions. One hand, gene expression changes was investigated through suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and Genechip experiments in resistant inbred line Bt-1, which derived from the tropical germplasm with high resistance to Fussrium ear rot in southwest China. On the other hand, 117 initial QTLs associating with resistance to Fusarium ear rot from early documents were collected to project meta-QTL on the high-density genetic linkage map IBM2. In total, 312 single-copy FV-induced sequences were obtained from the above two methods in Bt-1 and 29 meta-QTLs for ear rot resistance were projecteded in IBM2 map for distributing on chromosomes 1 to 8. Finally, the co-localization analysis results showed that 35 FV-induced sequences were located in the meta-QTL regions, while most other sequences were closed with the meta-QTLs. This phenomenon indicates that the correlation between FV-induced genes and ear rot resistance was connected together closely by their comparing localization. The co-localization analysis also indicated that FV-induced sequences were clustered on the same chromosome regions, particularly on bins 3.06, 3.04 and 6.02. These regions of interest on chromosomes were recommended to use for improving ear rot resistance in a marker assisted selection (MAS) program.

84880799393	Different Gene Expressions of Resistant and Susceptible Maize Inbreds in Response to Fusarium verticillioides Infection	Ear rot, caused by Fusarium verticillioides (FV), is a destructive disease of maize as it reduces grain yield and increases risks of mycotoxin production, thus endangering livestock. To identify genes differentially expressed during FV infection, four cDNA libraries were constructed for suppression subtractive hybridization using RNA isolated from bracts of an FV-resistant inbred maize line, Bt-1, as well as an FV-susceptible maize inbred line, Ye478. A total of 145 clones were obtained following reverse dot-blot hybridization, and these were sequenced from these libraries. Similarity analysis revealed that of these genes, 93 were unique, including 68 of known function, 24 of unknown function, and a single novel gene. Most genes of known function were predominantly involved in plant defense such as cell defense, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and metabolism. Expression profiles of eight representative genes, using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, confirmed that differential gene regulation during FV infection was involved. These findings suggested that these differentially expressed genes might be involved in FV defense responses in maize. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84883308903	Transcriptional responses of maize seedling root to phosphorus starvation	Maize (Zea mays) is the most widely cultivated crop around the world, however, it is commonly affected by phosphate (Pi) deficiency and the underlying molecular basis of responses mechanism is still unknown. In this study, the transcriptional response of maize roots to Pi starvation at 3 days after the onset of Pi deprivation was assessed. The investigation revealed a total of 283 Pi-responsive genes, of which 199 and 84 genes were found to be either up- or down-regulated respectively, by 2-fold or more. Pi-responsive genes were found to be involved in sugar and nitrogen metabolic pathways, ion transport, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and other processes related to growth and development. In addition, the expression patterns of maize inorganic phosphorus transporters, acid phosphatase, phytase, 2-deoxymugineic acid synthase1, POD and MYB transcription factor were validated in 178 roots response to low phosphorus stress. of which, two genes encoding phytase and acid phosphatase were significantly induced by Pi deficiency and may play a pivotal role in the process of absorption and re-utilization of Pi in Maize. These results not only enhance our knowledge about molecular processes associated with Pi deficiency, but also facilitate the identification of key molecular determinants for improving Pi use in maize. Moreover, this work sets a framework to produce Pi-specific maize microarrays to study the changes in global gene expression between Pi-efficient and Pi-inefficient maize genotypes. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The microemulsion was successfully prepared using toluene as solvent, emulsifier HSH as surfactant, and methanol as co-surfactant. And its optimal formulation was 4/3/3 (w/w) [oil/SAA (mixture of emulsifier and methanol)/water] selected according to the pseudoternary phase diagrams. In this formulation, SAA consists of emulsifier HSH and methanol with a weight ratio of 4/3. Triadimefon microemulsion did not freeze at -18 °C; moreover, the low temperature stability of triadimefon preparations was greatly improved, which was one of the key findings. After observing appearance, centrifuging, and diluting, type of the microemulsion was determined to oil in water. All of the other physicochemical properties including heat storage stability, emulsion stability, and cloud point met the standard of pesticide microemulsion. Its antifungal activities against Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA including mycelium growth, sclerotia formation and germination were statistically significant higher than that of 20% triadimefon emulsion from the t-test done by IBM SPSS 19. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84892421877	Identification of miRNAs and their target genes in developing maize ears by combined small RNA and degradome sequencing	Background: In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ~22 nt RNAs that play important regulatory roles in many aspects of plant biology, including metabolism, hormone response, epigenetic control of transposable elements, and stress response. Extensive studies of miRNAs have been performed in model plants such as rice and Arabidopsis thaliana. In maize, most miRNAs and their target genes were analyzed and identified by clearly different treatments, such as response to low nitrate, salt and drought stress. However, little is known about miRNAs involved in maize ear development. The objective of this study is to identify conserved and novel miRNAs and their target genes by combined small RNA and degradome sequencing at four inflorescence developmental stages.Results: We used deep-sequencing, miRNA microarray assays and computational methods to identify, profile, and describe conserved and non-conserved miRNAs at four ear developmental stages, which resulted in identification of 22 conserved and 21-maize-specific miRNA families together with their corresponding miRNA*. Comparison of miRNA expression in these developmental stages revealed 18 differentially expressed miRNA families. Finally, a total of 141 genes (251 transcripts) targeted by 102 small RNAs including 98 miRNAs and 4 ta-siRNAs were identified by genomic-scale high-throughput sequencing of miRNA cleaved mRNAs. Moreover, the differentially expressed miRNAs-mediated pathways that regulate the development of ears were discussed.Conclusions: This study confirmed 22 conserved miRNA families and discovered 26 novel miRNAs in maize. Moreover, we identified 141 target genes of known and new miRNAs and ta-siRNAs. Of these, 72 genes (117 transcripts) targeted by 62 differentially expressed miRNAs may attribute to the development of maize ears.

84896454220	Molecular phylogenetic characterization and analysis of the WRKY transcription factor family responsive to Rhizoctonia solani in maize	In this study we have identified, based on the maize genome, 85 WRKY genes that were phylogenetically clustered into three families formed by 8 distinct subfamilies. The exon/intron structures and motif compositions of these WRKY genes were highly conserved in each subfamily suggesting their functional conservation. Moreover, based on qTelller analyses, the majority of these WRKY genes showed a specific temporal and spatial expression pattern. These WRKY genes, within the same group, manifested a distinct expression, indicating a similar function in their expression during the evolutionary process; this is reflected by their sub-functionalizations in their expression pattern concerning leaf developmental gradient, while mature bundle sheath, and mesophyll cells had a similar cellular localization and modality of expression. This study has also provided evidence of the presence of a subset of WRKY genes exhibiting a putative functional role in leaf sheath when infected with Rhizoctonia solani. This finding appears helpful for future functional investigations to unravel the roles of WRKY genes in plant pathogen resistance. Interestingly, in this study we have identified three WRKY genes that are predicted to be potential targets of miR160 and miR171b families. Therefore, this finding appears relevant in elucidating the biological functions of these transcription factors to clarify the molecular mechanisms affecting leaf sheath growth and development during fungal infection and plant resistance.

84899417582	MiR393-targeted TIR1-like (F-box) gene in response to inoculation to R. Solani in Zea mays	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate special target mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level by directing target mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. Plant miRNAs regulate gene expression mainly by guiding cleavage of target mRNAs and subsequently play important roles in diverse developmental processes, nutrient homeostasis and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. MiRNA393 plays important and diverse roles in defense against bacterial pathogens by negatively targeting transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) in plant development. It will be essential for understanding complex feedback regulations in the development pathway by unraveling the miR393 network in a temporal and spatial manner. Here, we report that Zma-miR393b down-regulates its putative target TIR1-like (F-box) gene by guiding the cleavage of their mRNAs in development of leaf sheaths in response to R. Solani infection, Zma-miR393b and its putative target gene TIR1 were confirmed through Q-PCR and the spatial expression of Zma-miR393b was further analyzed by in situ hybridization. These findings suggested that, as a negative feedback regulation of TIR1-like (F-box) gene, Zma-miR393b plays an important role in defense against R.

84901243893	Validation of potential reference genes for qPCR in maize across abiotic stresses, hormone treatments, and tissue types	The reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful and widely used technique for the measurement of gene expression. Reference genes, which serve as endogenous controls ensure that the results are accurate and reproducible, are vital for data normalization. To bolster the literature on reference gene selection in maize, ten candidate reference genes, including eight traditionally used internal control genes and two potential candidate genes from our microarray datasets, were evaluated for expression level in maize across abiotic stresses (cold, heat, salinity, and PEG), phytohormone treatments (abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene, and gibberellins), and different tissue types. Three analytical software packages, geNorm, NormFinder, and Bestkeeper, were used to assess the stability of reference gene expression. The results revealed that elongation factor 1 alpha ( EF1α), tubulin beta (β-TUB), cyclophilin (CYP), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (EIF4A) were the most reliable reference genes for overall gene expression normalization in maize, while GRP (Glycine-rich RNA-binding protein), GLU1(beta-glucosidase), and UBQ9 (ubiquitin 9) were the least stable and most unsuitable genes. In addition, the suitability of EF1α, β-TUB, and their combination as reference genes was confirmed by validating the expression of WRKY50 in various samples. The current study indicates the appropriate reference genes for the urgent requirement of gene expression normalization in maize across certain abiotic stresses, hormones, and tissue types. © 2014 Lin et al.

84902661936	A luciferase-based method for assay of 5′-adenylylsulfate reductase	A luciferase-based method was developed for measurement of 5′-adenylylsulfate (APS) reductase (APR), an enzyme of the reductive sulfate assimilation pathway in prokaryotes and plants. APR catalyzes the two-electron reduction of APS and forms sulfite and adenosine 5′-monophospahate (AMP). The luciferase-based assay measures AMP production using an enzyme-coupled system that generates luminescence. The method is shown to provide an accurate measurement of APR kinetic properties and can be used for both endpoint and continuous assays. APR activity can be measured from pure enzyme preparations as well as from crude protein extracts of tissues. In addition, the assay is ideally suited to high-throughput sample analysis of APR activity in a microtiter dish format.

84903389255	Genome-wide analysis of water-stress-responsive microRNA expression profile in tobacco roots	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in plants. In this study, we investigate miRNAs in an agronomically important common tobacco in China, named Honghua Dajinyuan (a drought-tolerant cultivar). Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles in mock-treat grown (CK) and 20 % polyethylene glycol-grown (PEG-grown) tobacco roots using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 656 unique miRNAs representing 53 miRNA families were identified in the two libraries, of which 286 unique miRNAs representing 162 microRNAs were differentially expressed. In addition, nine differentially expressed microRNAs selected from different expressed miRNA family with high abundance were subjected to further analysis and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). In addition, the expression pattern of these identified candidate conserved miRNA and target genes of three identified miRNA (nta-miR172b, nta-miR156i, and nta-miR160a) were also validated by Q-PCR. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggests that the putative target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in metabolic process and response to stimulus. In particular, 25 target genes are involved in regulating plant hormone signal transduction and metabolism, indicating that these association microRNAs may play important regulatory roles in responding to PEG resistance. Moreover, this study adds a significant number of novel miRNAs to the tobacco miRNome. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84919459385	The dynamics of DNA methylation in maize roots under Pb stress	Plants adapt to adverse conditions through a series of physiological, cellular, and molecular processes, culminating in stress tolerance. However, little is known about the associated regulatory mechanisms at the epigenetic level in maize under lead (Pb) stress. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare DNA methylation profiles during the dynamic development of maize roots following Pb treatment to identify candidate genes involved in the response to Pb stress. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) was used to investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in maize roots under normal condition (A1) and 3 mM Pb(NO
