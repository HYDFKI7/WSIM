33745698639	Expression of E-selectin, integrin β1 and immunoglobulin superfamily member in human gastric carcinoma cells and its clinicopathologic significance	Aim: To study the expression levels of E- selectin, integrin βi and immunoglobulin supperfamily member-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human gastric carcinoma cells, and to explore the relationship between these three kinds of cell adhesion molecules and gastric carcinoma. Methods: The serum contents of E-selectin, integrin pi and ICAM-1 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in 47 healthy individuals (control group) and in 57 patients with gastric carcinoma (gastric carcinoma group) respectively prior to operation and 7 d after operation. Results: The serum E-selectin, ECAM-1 and integrin β1 were found to be expressed in both control and gastric carcinoma groups. However, they were highly expressed in patients with gastric carcinoma patients before operation or with unresectable tumours. The expression levels of ICAM-1 and integrin β1 were significantly higher in gastric carcinoma patients than in controls (P < 0.01). A comparison of the E-selectin levels between the two groups showed statistically insignificant differnice (P = 0.64). In addition, the expression levels were all decreased substantially in the postoperative patients subjected to radical resection of the tumours, indicating that the high level expressions of these compounds might be the important factor for predicting the prognosis of these patients. Conclusion: Serum E-selectin, ICAM-1 and i ntegrin βi expression levels are probably related to the metastasis and relapse of gastric cancer. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

59249106504	Genomic-wide analysis of lymphatic metastasis-associated genes in human hepatocellular carcinoma	Aim: To identify the genes related to lymph node metastasis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 32 HCC patients with or without lymph node metastasis were investigated by high-throughput microarray comprising 886 genes. Methods: The samples of cancerous and non-cancerous paired tissue were taken from 32 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy with lymph node dissection. Total RNA was extracted from the cells obtained by means of laser microdissection (LCM) and was amplified by the T7-based amplification system. Then, the amplified samples were applied in the cDNA microarray comprising of 886 genes. Results: The results demonstrated that 25 up-regulated genes such as cell membrane receptor, intracellular signaling and cell adhesion related genes, and 48 down-regulated genes such as intracellular signaling and cell cycle regulator-related genes, were correlated with lymph node metastasis in HCC. Amongst them were included some interesting genes, such as MET, EPHA2, CCND1, MMP2, MMP13, CASP3, CDH1, and PTPN2. Expression of 16 genes (MET, CCND1, CCND2, VEGF, KRT18, RFC4, BIRC5, CDC6, MMP2, BCL2A1, CDH1, VIM, PDGFRA, PTPN2, SLC25A5 and DSP) were further confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Conclusion: Tumor metastasis is an important biological characteristic, which involves multiple genetic changes and cumulation. This genome-wide information contributes to an improved understanding of molecular alterations during lymph node metastasis in HCC. It may help clinicians to predict metastasis of lymph nodes and assist researchers in identifying novel therapeutic targets for metastatic HCC patients. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

80052242479	Identification of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-associated genes in early stage cervical squamous cell carcinomas	This retrospective study investigated gene expression in tumour samples from 38 patients with early stage human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of viral markers of HPV16 or HPV18 infection. Gene expression profiles of tumour samples and the corresponding normal cervical epithelium were analysed using cDNA microarrays. Several genes showed differential expression between the two groups of HPV-infected CSCC patients, although seven genes showed similar changes in both groups. The four genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, matrix metallopeptidase 9, laminin γ-1, and epidermal growth factor receptor were up-regulated, and the three genes encoding transforming growth factor β receptor 1, interleukin-1a and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6 were down-regulated, in both HPV16

80052301263	High fat diet induces formation of spontaneous liposarcoma in mouse adipose tissue with overexpression of interleukin 22	Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is a T-cell secreted cytokine that modulates inflammatory response in nonhematopoietic tissues such as epithelium and liver. The function of IL-22 in adipose tissue is currently unknown. We generated a transgenic mouse model with overexpression of IL-22 specifically in adipose tissue. The IL-22 transgenic mice had no apparent changes in obesity and insulin resistance after feeding with high fat diet (HFD). Unexpectedly, all the IL-22 transgenic mice fed with HFD for four months developed spontaneous tumors in epididymal adipose tissue. Histological analysis indicated that the tumors were well-differentiated liposarcomas with infiltration of inflammatory cells. IL-22 overexpression promotes production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-10 and stimulates ERK phosphorylation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, IL-22 treatment in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes could induce IL-1β and IL-10 expression, together with stimulation of ERK phosphorylation. Taken together, our study not only established a novel mouse model with spontaneous liposarcoma, but also revealed that IL-22 overexpression may collaborate with diet-induced obesity to impact on tumor development in mouse. © 2011 Wang et al.

84887516196	Expression of microRNA-29b in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinical significance	To detect the expression of miR-29b in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to analyze its correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis of ESCC. The expression of miR-29b in 84 ESCC samples and matched normal tissue samples was detected by real-time PCR. The relationship between the expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of ESCC was analyzed. Forty-eight cases (57.2%) of carcinoma samples showed low expression of miR-29b, which was correlated with tumor infiltrating degree and pathological staging in ESCC (both P < 0.05), while 28 cases (33.3%) were negative and 8 (9.5%) showed high expression. The disease-free survival in patients with low expression of miR-29b was longer than that in those with non-low repression (P < 0.05), The expression of miR-29b and tumor family history was one of the factors affecting the survival of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.05). The low expression of miR-29b may participate the progression and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as a tumor suppressor factor. Detection of miR-29b expression may have certain clinical significance on the progression and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

59849104114	Distinct expression patterns in hepatitis B virus- and hepatitis C virus-infected hepatocellular carcinoma	Aim: To identify biomarkers indicating virus-specific hepatocarcinogenic process, differential mRNA expression in 32 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were investigated by means of cDNA microarrays comprising of 886 genes. Methods: Thirty two HCC patients were divided into two groups based on viral markers: hepatitis B virus positive and HCV positive. The expression profiles of 32 pairs of specimens (tumorous and surrounding non-tumorous liver tissues), consisting of 886 genes were analyzed. Results: Seven up-regulated genes in HBV-associated HCC comprised genes involved in protein synthesis (RPS5), cytoskeletal organization (KRT8), apoptosis related genes (CFLAR), transport (ATP5F1), cell membrane receptor related genes (IGFBP2), signal transduction or transcription related genes (MAP3K5), and metastasis-related genes (MMP9). The up-regulated genes in HCV-infected group included 4 genes: VIM (cell structure), ACTB (cell structure), GAPD (glycolysis) and CD58 (cell adhesion). The expression patterns of the 11 genes, identified by cDNA microarray, were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in 32 specimens. Conclusion: The patterns of all identified genes were classified based on the viral factor involved in HBV- and HCV-associated HCC. Our results strongly suggest that the pattern of gene expression in HCC is closely associated with the etiologic factor. The present study indicates that HBV and HCV cause hepatocarcinogenesis by different mechanisms, and provide novel tools for the diagnosis and treatment of HBV-and HCV-associated HCC. © 2008 The WJG Press.

0035323333	Genetic analysis of wild-type hepatitis A virus strains	Objective To clarify the distribution of hepatitis A virus (HAV) genotype in geographical regions of China. Methods Seventeen representative HAV strains were isolated from the stool or serum of hepatitis A patients in different geographical regions. Viral RNA was recovered from stool or serum by proteinase K digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation prior to reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. The nucleotide sequences of VP1/2A junction region were tested by using a direct sequencing technique. Results A pairwise comparison of sequences within 168 bases at the VP1/2A junction revealed that all the sequences clustered within genotype I . About 53% of strains clustered in genotype I B, with less than 6% variability; while the others clustered in genotype I A, with less than 5.3% variability. Sequence homology between genotype I A and I B varied from 88.7% to 92.3%. Conclusion Epidemic or sporadic HAV strains in China may belong to HAV genotype I A or I B. Epidemiologically related strains may be identical or closely related in sequence.

77949608574	Initiation of malignancy by duodenal contents reflux and the role of ezrin in developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Gastroesophageal reflux has recently been implicated as a causative factor in upper aerodigestive tract carcinogenesis. Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) have developed in duodenal-content reflux animals without any known carcinogen present. We established a cell line, designated ESCC-DR, from a thoracic metastatic tumor in a reflux animal. To gain insight into the genomic alterations associated with duodenal content reflux-induced carcinogenesis, we first performed comparative genomic hybridization using an Agilent rat 244K array in ESCC-DR and identified many chromosomal gains and losses. Of the many genes identified, we detected an interesting ezrin amplicon that has been recently reported in human ESCC. Ezrin, which cross-links the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane, is involved in the growth and metastatic potential of cancer cells. Overexpression of ezrin protein in ESCC-DR was confirmed by Western blotting. We also compared ezrin protein expression levels and patterns in hyperplastic, dysplastic, ESCC, and metastatic sites developed in two distinct reflux models using immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining of ezrin revealed overexpression in the nucleus, and the cytoplasm as well as plasma membrane of ESCC cells. Phosphorylated ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) was expressed at the leading edge, or invasive front, of larger metastatic sites. Taken together, duodenal reflux has a great potential for initiating malignancy, and thus likely plays a role in development of ESCC. Ezrin probably influences the growth and invasiveness of ESCC cells, and phosphorylation is only required in metastatic behavior of tumor cells at the leading edge and invasive front. © 2010 Japanese Cancer Association.

77953655010	Lineage analysis of early and advanced tubular adenocarcinomas of the stomach: Continuous or discontinuous?	Background: Eradication of early gastric carcinoma (GC) is thought to contribute to reduction in the mortality of GC, given that most of the early GCs progress to the advanced GCs. However, early GC is alternatively considered a dormant variant of GC, and it infrequently progresses to advanced GC. The aim of this study was to clarify the extent of overlap of genetic lineages between early and advanced tubular adenocarcinomas (TUBs) of the stomach.Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for p53 was performed using 28 surgically resected stomachs with 13 intramucosal and 15 invasive TUBs. By chromosome- and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), genomic copy number constitution was compared between the mucosal and invasive parts of the invasive TUBs and between the mucosal parts of the invasive and intramucosal TUBs, using 25 and 22 TUBs, respectively. TP53 mutation in exons 5-8 was examined in 20 TUBs.Results: Chromosomal CGH revealed that 4q+ and 11q+ were more common in advanced and early TUBs, respectively, whereas copy number changes in 8q and 17p showed no significant differences between early and advanced TUBs. However, array CGH revealed that, of the 13 intramucosal TUBs examined, loss of MYC (MYC-) and gain of TP53 (TP53+) was detected in 9 TUBs and MYC+ and/or TP53- was detected in 3 TUBs. Of the mucosal samples of 9 invasive TUBs, 7 showed MYC-/TP53+ and none showed MYC+ and/or TP53-. Of the 9 samples from the invasive parts, 1 (from submucosal cancers) showed MYC-/TP53+ and 6 (1 from submucosal and 5 from advanced cancers) showed MYC+ and/or TP53-. The latter 6 tumours commonly showed a mutant pattern (diffuse or null) in p53 immunohistochemistry, and 4 of the 6 tumours assessable for TP53 sequence analysis revealed mutations. The overall array CGH pattern indicated that, between the mucosal and invasive parts, genetic lineage was found discontinuous in 5 advanced cancers and continuous in 3 submucosal cancers.Conclusions: Genetic lineages often differed between early and advanced TUBs. MYC-/TP53+ and MYC + and/or TP53- may be the signatures of dormant and aggressive TUBs, respectively, in the stomach. © 2010 Nakayama et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77953393624	Screening of lymphatic metastasis-associated genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Objective: To screen the differentially expressed genes between primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with and without lymphatic metastasis by cDNA microarray, and to understand the mechanism of lymphatic metastasis. Methods: The total RNA was extracted from the cells obtained by means of LCM from the primary carcinoma, the corrresponding esophageal epithelium in 35 cases of ESCC, and purified to mRNA by Oligotes. RNA was amplified by the T7-based amplification system and then applied to a cDNA microarray. Both cRNAs from the esophageal and normal esophageal mucosa were reversely transcribed to the cDNA with the incorporation of fluorescent dUTP to prepare the hybridization probes. The mixed probes were hybridized to the cDNA microarray. After the high-stringent washing, the cDNA microarray was scanned for the fluorescent signals, and the lymphatic metastasis-associated genes were screened by bioinformatics between ESCC samples with and without lymphatic metastasis. Six genes were selected and validated with real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: Fifty-eight genes significantly differed between the ESCC with and without lymphatic metastasis (P<0.05), of which 28 were up-regulated and 30 were down-regulated. The up-regulated genes were involved in cell adhesion molecules and cell membrane receptors and the down-regulated genes were mostly cell cycle regulators and intracellular signaling molecules. The expressions of 6 genes validated by qRT-PCR were concordant with those detected by cDNA microarray. Conclusion: Many lymphatic metastasis-associated genes in ESCC are screened by high-throughput gene chip, and validating their cellular functions will help to identify the key gene or pathway responsible for lymphatic metastasis, which might open up a new idea or a clue for preventing and controling lymphatic metastasis in ESCC.

77953884926	Novel statistical framework to identify differentially expressed genes allowing transcriptomic background differences	Motivation: Tests of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from microarray experiments are based on the null hypothesis that genes that are irrelevant to the phenotype/stimulus are expressed equally in the target and control samples. However, this strict hypothesis is not always true, as there can be several transcriptomic background differences between target and control samples, including different cell/tissue types, different cell cycle stages and different biological donors. These differences lead to increased false positives, which have little biological/medical significance. Result: In this article, we propose a statistical framework to identify DEGs between target and control samples from expression microarray data allowing transcriptomic background differences between these samples by introducing a modified null hypothesis that the gene expression background difference is normally distributed. We use an iterative procedure to perform robust estimation of the null hypothesis and identify DEGs as outliers. We evaluated our method using our own triplicate microarray experiment, followed by validations with reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and on the MicroArray Quality Control dataset. The evaluations suggest that our technique (i) results in less false positive and false negative results, as measured by the degree of agreement with RT-PCR of the same samples, (ii) can be applied to different microarray platforms and results in better reproducibility as measured by the degree of DEG identification concordance both intra- and inter-platforms and (iii) can be applied efficiently with only a few microarray replicates. Based on these evaluations, we propose that this method not only identifies more reliable and biologically/medically significant DEG, but also reduces the power-cost tradeoff problem in the microarray field. © The Author 2010.

77953427225	Recent studies on radio- and chemoresistance of brain tumors mediated by tumor stem cells	Objective: To discuss the latest information about TSCs in brain tumor and outline some of the therapeutic implications that can be derived. Methods: The English literature in the Pubmed retrieval system and Chinese literature in the VIP information with the MESH (Medical subject headlines) were searched. With tumor stem cells (TSCs), radio- and chemoresistance and malignant primary brain tumors as keywords, the literature about the radio- and chemoresistance of brain tumors mediated by tumor stem cells from 2002 to 2008 was collected electronically, and got 22 papers. Results: Tumor stem cells (TSCs) have the capacity to repopulate tumors and drive malignant progression and mediate radio-and chernoresistance. It implies that the future therapies should turn from the elimination of the rapidly dividing, but differentiated tumor cells, to specifically targeting the minority of tumor cells that repopulate the tumor. Although there exists some support for the TSCs hypothesis, there remain many uncertainties regarding theoretical, technical, and interpretational aspects of the data supporting it. Conclusion: If correct, the TSCs hypothesis can have profound implications of tumor classification and treatment.

77953450342	Expressions of p53, c-erbB-2 and EGFR in linear gradient surgical margins of oral squamous cell carcinoma and their significance	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mRNA expressions of p53, c-erbB-2 and EGFR in the linear gradient surgical margins of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and discuss the possibility of the safe surgical margin identification by fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR technique. METHODS: Twenty linear gradient surgical tissue groups in 18 primary OSCC cases were analyzed in the expressions of p53, c-erbB-2 and EGFR by fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR technique, and each group included tumour tissue and five linear gradient surgical margins with extent of 0, 0. 5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cm to tumour lesion. The results were analyzed by paired t-test. RESULTS: The highly significant expression discrepancy of p53 was detected in 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cm surgical margins compared with tumour location respectively (P<0.01), also, 0.5 cm surgical margins compared with 0 cm surgical margins (P<0.01). Analogously, the highly significant expression discrepancy of EGFR was detected in 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cm surgical margins compared with tumour location respectively (P<0.01). For c-erbB-2, there was the significant expression discrepancy in tumour location, 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 cm surgical margins compared with 2.0 cm surgical margins respectively (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: From the expression discrepancies between tumour location and 2.0 cm surgical margins in p53, c-erbB-2 and EGFR, the fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR technique is possibilly sensitive to identify where is the really safe marginal area in surgery at the molecular level. Furtermore, 2.0 cm margin from tumoure location seems to be safe in OSCC surgery. The relationships among the other linear gradient margin groups in p53, c-erbB-2 and EGFR respectively are still not sure.

77956398232	Microsatellite instability with promoter methylation and silencing of hMLH1 can regionally occur during progression of gastric carcinoma	Microsatellite instability (MSI) is known to result from inactivation of mismatch repair genes largely by promoter methylation. However, the methylation usually accumulates time-dependently. To know whether MSI can be acquired later in tumorigenesis, we examined intratumoral heterogeneity of MSI and promoter methylation of hMLH1 after immunohistochemical screening for heterogeneous expression of hMLH1 in 55 cases of gastric carcinomas. We demonstrated for the first time that MSI-H can develop from MSI-L or the absence of MSI due to time-dependent accumulation of DNA methylation during progression of early-stage gastric carcinomas. The resultant replication errors may play a role in enhancing invasive activity. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77956212281	Studies on methylation of 5′ -CpG island in the promoter region of TSHR gene in papillary thyroid carcinomas	Objective: To investigate the role of the 5′-CpG island methylation in the promoter region of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) gene in the carcinogenesis and progression of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying PTC carcinogenesis. Methods: The 5′-CpG island methylation in the promoter region of TSHR gene was detected using real-time fluorescent quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) in tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent thyroid tissues isolated from 90 patients with PTC. The relationship between the methyaltion status of TSHR 5′-CpG island and clinical pathological parameters was analyzed. Results: Methylation of TSHR promoter 5′-CpG island was detected in 37 specimens out of 90 cases of tumor tissues (37/90, 41.1%) and only in 5 specimens out of 90 cases of corresponding adjacent thyroid tissues (5/90, 5.6%). The rate of methylation of TSHR promoter in PTC was higher than that in adjacent thyroid tissures (P < 0.05). The 5′-CpG island methylation of TSHR gene promoter correlated with tumor size, number of lesions, local invasion, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage, respectively (P < 0.05), but not with gender and age of patients (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Methylation of 5′-CpG island in the promoter region of TSHR gene is a molecular event that frequently occurred in the tumorigenesis of PTC, which may be an important reason for the decreased iodide-uptake by thyroid cells. Methylation of 5′-CpG island in the promoter region of TSHR gene played an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of PTC.

78650648921	MicroRNAs and esophageal cancer	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs of 19-22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MiRNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in almost all basic signaling pathways. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are closely associated with tumor genesis, differentiation, metastasis and relapse. The research of miRNA alterations in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer has been attracting more and more attention, providing a new technique for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the disease. MiRNAs might act as new biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and new targets for tumor gene therapy. This article focuses on the biosynthesis, mechanisms of action, and detection of miRNAs, their relationship with tumors, as well as their potential use in the diagnosis, classification and biological treatment of esophageal cancer.

79551478746	Prognostic significance of RASSF1A expression and methylation status in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	AIM: To investigate the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1A gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to analyze their prognostic significance. METHODS: The mRNA expression and DNA methylation of the promoter region of the RASSF1A gene in normal esophageal tissue samples and ESCC tissue samples taken from 49 ESCC patients were detected by real-time RT-PCR and real-time methylation-specific PCR (qMSP), respectively. RESULTS: RASSF1A mRNA expression was down-regulated in 53.06% (26/49) of ESCC tissue samples. The level of RASSF1A mRNA expression in ESCC was significantly lower than that in adjacent normal tissue (P < 0.05). Down-regulation of RASSF1A mRNA expression was correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in ESCC patients (all P < 0.05). Hypermethylation of the RASSF1A gene promoter region was detected in 77.60% (38/49) of ESCC patients. RASSF1A gene promoter hypermethylation was correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in ESCC patients (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: RASSF1A gene promoter hypermethylation is a very common molecular event in ESCC and may be responsible for the down-regulation of RASSF1A mRNA expression. Down-regulation of RASSF1A mRNA expression and hypermethylation of RASSF1A gene promoter region were significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage and poor prognosis in ESCC patients.

79952826784	Comprehensive profiling of the low molecular weight proteins and peptides in weak cation exchange beads human serum retentate	Mass spectrometric profiling using ProteinChip and magnetic beads has rapidly grown over the past years, particularly to generate serum profiles for cancer diagnosis. The molecular weights of these distinguishing peaks are usually under 30 kDa. To identify those low molecular weight proteins and peptides is important for specific assays to be developed and increases biological insight. In this study, low molecular weight proteins and peptides from serum were purified by a combination of weak cation exchange magnetic beads and high performance liquid chromatography. The purified proteins and peptides were analyzed by 1D SDS PAGE, SELDI and LC-MS/MS. 246 proteins were identified from the HPLC fractions by LC-MS/MS. 95(38.62%) proteins were first identified in serum compare with Sys-BodyFluid database. 11(11/96) proteins were documented cancer associated proteins. We also observed about 109 proteins/peptides in SELDI mass spectrum, and 13 of the SELDI features were identified. Copyright © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

79952951341	Hypermethylation-modulated down-regulation of CDH1 expression contributes to the progression of esophageal cancer	CDH1, a cell adhesion molecule, which plays a key role in maintaining the epithelial phenotype, is regarded as an invasion-suppressor gene in light of accumulating evidence from in vitro experiments and clinical observations. In an attempt to clarify the mechanism responsible for inactivation of this gene in carcinomas, we investigated the methylation status of the CDH1 gene 5′-CpG islands and its regulatory mechanism in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) and treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) were conducted to analyze the methylation status at the CDH1 promoter region in the human esophageal carcinoma cell lines, EC1 and EC9706. A total of 235 invasive esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCCC) at stages I-IV and their corresponding normal tissue samples, were included in an immunohisto-chemistry study and methylation analysis of CDH1. The results demonstrate that in EC1 and EC9706 cells, the CDH1 promoter is methylated and treatment with 5-Aza-CdR restored CDH1 expression. Enhanced CDH1 expression decreased cell migration, invasion ability and increased adhesion ability. Decreased CDH1 expression was detected in 59.6% of ESCCCC tissues, compared with their adjacent non-neoplastic epithelia, which had a close correlation with the primary tumor status, lymph node status, distant metatasis and clinicopathologic stage. Hypermethylation at the CDH1 promoter was detected in 97.9% of 140 cases of ESCCCC with low CDH1 expression. The methylation of CDH1 promoters (P=0.929) was closely correlated with the lack of expression of their corresponding proteins. The Cox regression model for survival analysis showed that increases in CDH1 methylation had a greater impact on the prognosis than tumor clinical stage. These findings suggest that CDH1 gene silencing by promoter hypermethylation and the resultant reduction of CDH1 expression may play an important role in the progression of ESCCCC. CDH1 methylation was a significant predictor of survival in ESCC patients after surgery.

79953803304	Analysis of the relationship between multiple HPV infections and clinicopathologic characteristics in patients with uterine cervical cancer	Objective: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has become a point of interest in studies of oncogenic viruses. Over 200 genotypes of HPV have been found. However, the genotypic distribution in uterine cervix cancer (UCC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the infection rate of HPV and genotype distributions in UCC, and to discuss the relationship between multiple HPV infections and clinicopathological features in UCC patients. Methods: The HPV genotypes were detected in 171 UCC patients treated in Zhejiang Provincial Cancer Hospital between September 2008 and April 2009. The genetic diagnosis and HPV genotyping were conducted using flow-through hybridization and gene chip technology (HybriMax). The difference among the age, clinical stages, clinicopathologic types and nodal metastasis in the patients with multiple, single and absent HPV infection were compared and analyzed. Results: HPV infection was found in 122 of 171 (71.35%, 122/171) UCC patients, of which 103 (60.2%, 103/171) had single HPV infection and 19 (11.1%, 19/171) had multiple infections. Dual infection was the most common of the multiple HPV infections and was found in 15 patients; triple infection was found in 2 patients and quadruple infection was found in another 2 patients. HPV16, HPV18 and HPV58 were the most common types of single infection, and HPV16+HPV58 and HPV16+HPV52 were most frequently seen in multiple HPV infections. HPV16 was the major type of HPV infection both in the multiply and singly infected patients. The ratio of multiple HPV infection was higher in the patients aged ≥ 52 years than in those < 52, with significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.05). However, there were no differences in clinical staging, pathologic type, and nodal metastasis among patients with multiple and single infections or those without HPV infection. Conclusion: HPV multiple infection status is related to age but is not related to other prognostic indicators such as clinical stage, pathological type, or lymph node metastasis. HybriMax flow-through hybridization and gene chip technology is suited to clinical screening for HPV infection and genotype.

79954571639	Functional cooperation of RKTG with p53 in tumorigenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition	Raf kinase trapping to Golgi (RKTG) is a potential tumor suppressor gene due to its negative roles in regulating Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway and GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor) Gbg subunit signaling. Interestingly, RKTG-deficient mice are free of tumors, although they are prone to form skin cancer on carcinogen administration. On the other hand, p53 is a well-characterized tumor suppressor gene and p53 heterozygous mice develop sarcoma and other tumors starting from 12 months of age. In RKTG-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, lypophosphatidic acid (LPA), but not EGF (epidermal growth factor), could stimulate hyperphosphorylation of AKT and GSK3b, accompanied by increases in phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and accumulation of p53, as well as its target genes p21 and p16. Spontaneous skin cancer-like tumors were detected in about 25% of RKTG nullizygous and p53 heterozygous mice within 7 months of age. Hyperplasia and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were observed in the tumor-overlying epidermis, in which LOH of p53 occurred and EMT features emerged. In p53-mutated A431 epithelial carcinoma cells, knockdown of RKTG led to enhancement of LPA-stimulated AKT and GSK3b phosphorylation, together with increased accumulation of b-catenin and appearance of EMT features that were antagonized by p53 overexpression. In HepG2 epithelial cells, LPA-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and EMT features reached maximum when both RKTG and p53 were simultaneously silenced. In summary, these results not only indicate that RKTG has an in vivo tumor suppressor function to cooperate with p53 in tumorigenesis but also suggest that p53 has an EMT checkpoint function and the loss of this function can combine with loss of RKTG to drive EMT and tumor progression. © 2011 American Association for Cancer Research.

79958228953	Unfavorable clinical implications for hypermethylation of RUNX3 in patients with salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma	To elucidate the potential etiological role of RUNX3 in the development of salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), we analyzed the methylation status of RUNX3 in a series of 114 ACC tissues and 3 ACC cell lines. Results showed that the methylated rate of RUNX3 was 50.9 and 3.5% in the 114 ACC samples and the corresponding normal salivary glands, respectively, achieving a significant difference (P<0.001). There was a significant correlation between RUNX3 methylation and various clinicopathological parameters of ACCs, such as perineural invasion, lymph node involvement, T-stage and distant metastasis (P<0.001). RUNX3 methylation was a significant predictor of the 5-year disease-free survival in ACC patients after surgery. Partial methylation was found in all 3 ACC cell lines, and the reactivation and more potent expression of RUNX3 was induced by 5-triazole-2-deoxycytidine. Our findings indicate that RUNX3 methylation may occur as a common event in the development of ACC and that methylation may be a major mechanism for inactivation of RUNX3 in ACC.

79959736867	Hypermethylation-modulated Downregulation of RASSF1A Expression Is Associated with the Progression of Esophageal Cancer	Background and Aims: Chromosome 3p21 is an important locus harboring critical tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple tumors including esophageal carcinoma (EC). Aberrant promoter methylation is a fundamental mechanism of inactivation of TSGs in cancer. RASSF1A, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, recently cloned from the lung tumor locus at 3p21.3, is frequently inactivated by hypermethylation of its promoter region in a number of malignancies. We undertook this study to investigate the methylation status of RASSF1A and its significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: Real-time RT-PCR and real-time methylation-specific PCR (real-time MSP) were used to detect RASSF1A expression and the methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter, respectively, in 124 primary ESCC tissues. Results: Hypermethylation, partial methylation and unmethylation of the promoter region of RASSF1A were detected in 56 (45.2%), 23 (18.6%) and 45 (36.2%) of 124 ESCC samples, respectively. Unmethylation of the promoter region of RASSF1A was detected in 119 (96%) of the 124 corresponding noncancerous tissues. Five (4.0%) of 124 noncancerous tissues showed partial methylation. The presence of hypermethylation was statistically associated with loss of RASSF1A mRNA expression in primary ESCC (p <0.05). There were statistically significant correlations between the presence of hypermethylation and regional lymph node involvement (p = 0.000), histological differentiation (p = 0.009) and tumor stage (p = 0.000). Conclusions: Our results suggest that RASSF1A may be one of the ESCC-related TSGs located at 3p21, and hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter of the RASSF1A is associated with the progression of ESCC. © 2011 IMSS.

80052002567	Methylation of 5′-CpG island in the promoter region of APC gene in csophageal carcinoma tissues	OBJECTIVE: To detect the methylation of 5′-CpG island locating in the promoter region of APC gene in esophageal carcinoma, and analyze the relationship between the methylation of 5′-CpG island in the promoter region of APC gene and clinical manifestation. METHODS: The methylation of 5′-CpG island in the promoter region of APC gene was detected by real-time methylationspecific PCR, qMSP in all esophageal carcinoma tissues and peri-carcinomatous tissues. Comparision between groups was performed by log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was carried out by Cox proportional hazard method. RESULTS: In the tissues of 182 patients with esophageal carcinoma, the rate of the methylation of 5′-CpG island in the promoter region of APC gene was 54.40% (99/182), but the rate of the peri-carcinomatous tissues was only 9.90% (18/182). There was a notable difference between two groups (P<0.05). Obvious positive correlation was found between the methylation of 5′-CpG island in the promoter region of APC gene and lymph node metastasis, tumor metastasis, clinical stage, poor prognosis (χ

METHODS: Portal hypertension was induced in Wistar rats by partial portal vein ligation. Seventy male rats were randomly divided into three groups: model control group (n = 30), Compound Danshen Injection group (n = 30) and normal control group (n = 10). Rats were killed 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 45 days after model creation to observe gastric histopathological changes and detect the expression levels of iNOS, ET-1, SOD, Bcl-2 and Bax in gastric tissue. RESULTS: Compared to the normal control group, the expression of iNOS, ET-1 and Bax in gastric tissue in the model control group was significantly up-regulated on day 5, peaked on day 15, and was maintained thereafter, while that of Bcl-2 and SOD was significantly down-regulated on day 5, reached the lowest level on day 15, and was maintained thereafter. Compared to the model control group, treatment with Compound Danshen Injection reduced gastric injury, increased the activity of SOD, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated that of iNOS, ET-1 and Bax (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Compound Danshen Injection exerts a protective effect against gastric mucosal lesion in rats with portal hypertensive gastropathy possibly via a mechanism associated with antioxidation and inhibition of apoptosis.

80955151525	Critical regions and spreading of runt-related transcription factor-3 C-phosphate-G (CpG) island methylation in human salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma	We investigated the spreading pattern of runt-related transcription factor-3 (RUNX3) C-phosphate-G (CpG) island (3478 base pairs) methylation in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma. The methylation status of multiple regions within the runt-related transcription factor-3 promoter CpG island (3478 base pairs) was detected by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, and the runt-related transcription factor-3 protein was detected with a Western blot in 19 salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma samples and the corresponding nonneoplastic salivary glands. The risk ratio between runt-related transcription factor-3 CpG island methylation and salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma progression was analyzed by the logistic analysis of variance model. A possible association between runt-related transcription factor-3 methylation, clinicopathologic parameters, and runt-related transcription factor-3 protein was analyzed. Hypermethylation initially occurs the most at the 5′ region of runt-related transcription factor-3 CpG island before spreading to the transcription start site. The extent of methylation was found to be the highest in region nos. 1 and 2 among the successive 10 regions, which extend from the 5′ region to the transcription start site within the runt-related transcription factor-3 CpG island. The extent of methylation is lowest at the transcription start site, both in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma and in normal salivary glands. No methylation in the transcription start site was found in normal salivary glands. Logistic analysis of variance model indicates that the transcription start site within the runt-related transcription factor-3 promoter CpG island is critical for gene silencing. Western blots revealed that levels of the runt-related transcription factor-3 protein in adenoid cystic carcinoma samples are significantly lower than those in normal salivary glands (P <.001). Methylation of the runt-related transcription factor-3 CpG island spreads the most from 5′ region to the transcription start site in adenoid cystic carcinoma tissues, and the transcription start site may be a critical region for the runt-related transcription factor-3 methylation. The spreading pattern of the runt-related transcription factor-3 methylation may play an a role in the progression of adenoid cystic carcinoma. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

83655164647	Possible role of pax-6 in promoting breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis	Pax 6, a member of the paired box (Pax) family, has been implicated in oncogenesis. However, its therapeutic potential has been never examined in breast cancer. To explore the role of Pax6 in breast cancer development, a lentivirus based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivery system was used to knockdown Pax6 expression in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. Effect of Pax6 silencing on breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis was analyzed. Pax6-RNAi-lentivirus infection remarkably downregulated the expression levels of Pax6 mRNA and protein in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Accordingly, the cell viability, DNA synthesis, and colony formation were strongly suppressed, and the tumorigenesis in xenograft nude mice was significantly inhibited. Moreover, tumor cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase after Pax6 was knocked down. Pax6 facilitates important regulatory roles in breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression, and could serve as a diagnostic marker for clinical investigation.

84857917558	MSH2 promoter hypermethylation in circulating tumor DNA is a valuable predictor of disease-free survival for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: Tumor-specific alterations of DNA methylation in circulating DNA have been associated with tumor burden and malignant progression. A wealth of information indicating the potential use of DNA methylation in circulating DNA for cancer screening, prognosis and monitoring of the efficacy of anticancer therapies has emerged. In this study, we examined prospectively whether the presence of plasma DNA with tumor characteristics before oesophagectomy is a predictive factor related to disease-free survival (DFS). Methods: Promoter hypermethylation of MSH2 was analyzed using real-time methylation-specific PCR (real-time MSP) in paired tumor and plasma samples of 209 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Results: Aberrant MSH2 methylation was found in 101 of 209 ESCC patients. Of these 101 patients, 77 cases exhibited the same alteration in their plasma DNA. No alterations were found in the plasma DNA of the remaining 108 patients. As a control, we screened for aberrant methylation in the plasma DNA of 60 health individuals. No methylation was found in plasma DNA of these control groups. Follow-up analysis indicated significantly lower DFS for patients with high MSH2 methylation compared to those with MSH2 unmethylation after surgery. Conclusions: It was suggestted that MSH2 methylation in the plasma would be a good predictor of DFS for these ESCC patients before oesophagectomy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84862590034	Correlation between DNA methylation of tumor tissue and invasion in patients with ESCC	OBJECTIVE: To study the methylation status of multiple genes and the correlation between clinical pathological features and DNA methylation in tumor tissue in patients with ESCC were involved. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with ESCC. Fresh-frozen tumor specimens and adjacent normal specimens of them were collected, and DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform. Then, aberrant promoter hypermethylation of APC, RARβ2, CDH1, p16INK4α and RASSF1A was confirmed using MSP(methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction) after bisulfite treatment. Test data, clinical data and pathological data were combined for statistical analysis with SPSS 17.0. RESULTS: The methylation rates of the five genes in esophageal tumor tissues were significantly higher than those of adjacent normal tissues(P=0.000). DNA methylation rates of the five genes were significantly related to clinical pathological stage, lymph node metastasis and nerve vessel invasion(P<0.050).

84862105232	Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma and its role in cancer invasion	Objective: To assess the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma and explore its role in cancer invasion. Methods: Fifty-four patients with pathologically confirmed salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) were divided into invasion group and non-invasion group. The EGFR expression was determined by immunohistochemstry (SP staining). The relations between the EGFR expression and the SACC clinical pathological characteristics were analyzed. Results: EGFR were mainly expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm in the tissue of SACC. The positive rate of EGFR expression in the tumor tissue was 75.9% (41/54), and EGFR was over-expressed in the cytoplasm. The positive rate of EGFR expression in invasion group was higher than that in the non-invasion group (10.0%, P <0.05). EGFR expression were related with the SACC T stages, histological types, distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and nerve invasion (P < 0.05). Conclusions: A higher expression of EGFR gene in the cytoplasm may have important effect on the progression of invasive carcinoma. Further investigations are required to develop new strategy in the treatment of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.

84863039857	Characterization of a carcinogenesis-associated long non-coding RNA	A negative selection strategy was used in the present study to isolate long polyA-minus RNAs from the total transcriptome and a long non-coding RNA named Yiya was identified. Yiya is a 1.9 kb long intergenic ncRNA gene mapped to chromosome 1q41, a well-established cancer susceptibility locus. Expression profiling revealed a general and regulated expression pattern of Yiya in major tissues, and more interestingly, identified elevated mRNA levels in different cancers. Quantitative analysis further demonstrated a dynamic regulation of Yiya expression in cell cycle progression, suggesting that it was involved in cell cycle regulation. Supporting this, overexpression of Yiya promotes cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition, therefore identifying Yiya as a cell-cycle-associated long non-coding RNA. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84863248581	Heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in esophageal cancer using ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay	Aim:Current chemotherapy for esophageal cancer is conducted on the basis of empirical information from clinical trials, which fails to take into account the known heterogeneity of chemosensitivity between patients. This study was aimed to demonstrate the degree of heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in esophageal cancers.Methods:A total of 42 esophageal cancer specimens were collected. The heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in esophageal cancer specimens was examined using an ex vivo ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA).Results:Thirty eight specimens produced evaluable results (90.5%). The most active single agent tested was nedaplatin, to which 28.9% of samples were sensitive. Combinations of chemotherapy agents exhibited much higher sensitivity: cisplatin+paclitaxel was sensitive in 16 of 38 (42.1%) of samples, while nedaplatin+paclitaxel was more effective, which was sensitive in 20 of 38 cases (52.6%).Conclusion:There was a marked heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in esophageal cancer. Chemosensitivity testing may provide a practical method for testing new regimens before clinical trials in esophageal cancer patients. © 2012 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.

Methods: Real-time methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (real-time MSP) technique was used to detect the methylation status of RARβ2 and p16INK4α in tumor tissue, adjacent normal tissue and peripheral blood perioperatively in 76 cases of ESCC. Sixty age-matched healthy volunteers were randomly selected as a control. Results: RARβ2 and p16INK4α hypermethylation presented in both tumor tissue [72.4% (55/76) and 86.8% (66/76)] and peripheral blood [63.2% (48/76) and 71.1% (54/76)] in the ESCC patients, showing a good agreement between them. RARβ2 and p16INK4α hypermethylation was significantly related with pathological stage, lymph node metastasis, and invasion of nerves and vessels (P < 0.05). The DNA methylation rate in peripheral blood was increasing first and then decreasing in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods. Moreover, the RARβ2 methylation in peripheral blood was shown to be significantly associated with family history of cancer (P = 0.023). Conclusion: RARβ2 and p16INK4α methylation in the peripheral blood in ESCC patients may reflect the tumor-bearing status in the body, and may serve as a valuable marker in assessment of the degree of completeness of surgical resection in ESCC patients.

84867864891	CDH1 methylation in preoperative peritoneal washes is an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer	Background and Objectives To investigate the clinical value of CDH1 methylation in preoperative peritoneal washes (PPW) from gastric cancer patients. Methods CDH1 methylation was detected by real-time methylation specific-PCR in tumor tissues and corresponding PPW from 92 gastric cancer patients, gastric mucosa from 40 chronic gastritis patients and 48 normal persons. Results CDH1 methylation was found in 75 of 92 (81.5%) gastric cancer tissues, which significantly correlated with size, growth pattern, differentiation, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and TNM stage of tumor (all P < 0.05), but its relationship to age, gender, tumor site, and H. pylori infection was not found (all P > 0.05).

84867868095	Expression and significance of E-cadherin in adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary glands	Objective: To examine the expression of E-cadherin and the methylation status of CDH1 and explore their clinical significance in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Methods: The expression of E-cadherin was detected by the immunohistochemical method. And the methylation of CDH1 gene promoter 5'-CpG island was analyzed by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (realtime MSP) in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma and normal salivary gland tissue respectively. Results: The expression rate of E-cadherin was lower in SACC than that in normal salivary gland tissue (100.0% vs 55.6%, P < 0.05). And the expression of E-cadherin was associated with different histopathological types, T-stage, nerve invasion, lymphatic and distant metastasis (P < 0.05). However, there was no correlation between the expression of E-cadherin and gender, age and tumor location. Partial methylation of CDH1 was detected in 3 of 30 cases with a positive expression of E-cadherin and full methylation of CDH1 in 23 of 24 cases with a negative expression of E-cadherin. There was a negative correlation between the expression of E-cadherin and the methylation of CDH1 in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (r=-0.483, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The down-regulation of E-cadherin, as modulated by the methylation of CDH1, may contribute to nerve invasion, lymphatic and distant metastasis in SACC. Thus it may be used as a biological indicator of malignancy and prognosis.

84868193092	Stepwise cumulation of RUNX3 methylation mediated by Helicobacter pylori infection contributes to gastric carcinoma progression	Background: Helicobacter pylori has been recognized as a definite carcinogen for gastric cancer (GC); however, the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection remains unclear. Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose deficiency is causally related to GC. However, in H. pylori infection-associated GC, the role of RUNX3 has not been studied. Methods: The authors used real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis to determine methylation status of the RUNX3 promoter in a spectrum of gastric lesions, including 220 samples of chronic atrophic gastritis, 196 samples of intestinal metaplasia, 134 samples of gastric adenoma, 102 samples of dysplasia, and 202 samples of GC with paired noncancerous mucosa tissues and corresponding blood specimens. The association of abnormal methylation with precancerous gastric lesions was evaluated along with the association between RUNX3 methylation and H. pylori infection, and the concordance of methylation levels was investigated between serum and tissues. Results: The results indicated that increasing RUNX3 promoter methylation was correlated with distinct stages of GC progression. GC tissues had the highest methylation proportion (75.2%) compared with precancerous gastric lesions, including chronic atrophic gastritis (15.9%), intestinal metaplasia (36.7%), gastric adenoma (41.8%), and dysplasia (54.9%). H. pylori infection, a major risk factor for GC, contributed to the inactivation of RUNX3 in gastric epithelial cells through promoter hypermethylation. The levels of RUNX3 methylation in serum were in significant concordance with the methylation levels observed in GC tissues (P =.887). Conclusions: The current findings supported RUNX3 methylation as a risk factors for the carcinogenesis of chronic atrophic gastritis with H. pylori infection and indicated that circulating RUNX3 methylation is a valuable biomarker for the detection of early GC. © 2012 American Cancer Society.

84871416661	RUNX3 expression and its methylation of 5'-CpG island in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma cell lines ACC-2, ACC-3 and ACC-M	Objective: To investigate the methylation of 5'-CpG island and expression of RUNX3 in salivary gland adnoid cystic carcinoma cell lines. Methods: RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and Western blot were used to detect the expression of RUNX3 gene and protein in salivary gland adenoic cystic carcinoma cell lines, ACC-2, ACC-3, and ACC-M, before/after a treatment of 5-Aza-dc respectively. Results: A weak expression of RUNX3 was found in ACC-2 and ACC-3.And no expression of RUNX3 was found in ACC-3 cell line. After a treatment of 300 nmol/L 5-Aza-dc for 72 hours, the expression of RUNX3 in ACC-2 and ACC-3 cells was enhanced, and in ACC-M was restored. LSCM results showed that the RUNX3 protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm of ACC cell lines. After a treatment of 300 nmol/L 5-Aza-dc for 72 h, both nuclear and cytoplasmic location of RUNX3 positive signals were found in the ACC-2 and ACC-3 cells. However, a weak positive signal was still only found in the cytoplasm of ACC-M cells. Partial methylation in promoter 5'-CpG island of RUNX3 gene was found in all three cell lines. And the methylation degree of CpG island was 50%, 75% and 33% in ACC-2, ACC-M and ACC-3 respectively. After a treatment of 5-Aza-dc, the RUNX3 gene showed unmethylated status in all three cell lines. Conclusions: The methylation of RUNX3 plays an important role in the silencing of RUNX3 expression in ACC cell lines. The cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3 may be correlated with the inhibition of its function in ACC cells. Copyright © 2010 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84872674945	Elevated circulating CD19+ lymphocytes predict survival advantage in patients with gastric cancer	Background: Circulating lymphocyte subsets reflect the immunological status and might therefore be a prognostic indicator in cancer patients. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical significance of circulating lymphocyte subset in gastric cancer (GC) cases. Methods: A retrospective study on a prevalent cohort of 846 GC patients hospitalized at Hospital from Aug 2006 to Jul 2010 was conducted. We calculated the patient's disease free survival (DFS) after first hospital admission, and hazard ratios (HR) from the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Our findings indicated a significantly decreased percentage of CD3+, and CD8+ cells, a significantly increased proportion of CD4+, CD19+, CD44+, CD25+, NK cells, and an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio in GC patients as compared with healthy controls (all P < 0.05). Alteration of lymphocyte subsets was positively correlated with sex, age, smoking, tumor stage and distant metastasis of GC patients (all P<0.05). Follow-up analysis indicated significantly higher DFS for patients with high circulating CD19+ lymphocytes compared to those with low CD19+ lymphocytes (P=0.037), with CD19+ showing an important cutoff of 7.91±2.98% Conclusion: Circulating lymphocyte subsets in GC patients are significantly changed, and elevated CD19+ cells may predict a favorable survival.

84873411803	Tumor development is associated with decrease of TET gene expression and 5-methylcytosine hydroxylation	The TET (ten-eleven translocation) family of -ketoglutarate (-KG)-dependent dioxygenases catalyzes the sequential oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, leading to eventual DNA demethylation. The TET2 gene is a bona fide tumor suppressor frequently mutated in leukemia, and TET enzyme activity is inhibited in IDH1/2-mutated tumors by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, an antagonist of -KG, linking 5mC oxidation to cancer development. We report here that the levels of 5hmC are dramatically reduced in human breast, liver, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancers when compared with the matched surrounding normal tissues. Associated with the 5hmC decrease is the substantial reduction of the expression of all three TET genes, revealing a possible mechanism for the reduced 5hmC in cancer cells. The decrease of 5hmC was also observed during tumor development in different genetically engineered mouse models. Together, our results identify 5hmC as a biomarker whose decrease is broadly and tightly associated with tumor development. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84876302461	Enhanced RegIV expression predicts the intrinsic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in advanced gastric cancer	Aim: RegIV, a member of the Regenerating (REG) gene family, may be a marker for the prediction of resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. However, the relationship between the intrinsic drug resistance of gastric cancer (GC) cells to 5-FU used alone (single FU) or in multidrug therapeutic regimens (5-FU combinations) and RegIV expression has not been investigated. Methods: The patient cohort comprised 45 patients with primary GC. The chemoresistance of GC cells to therapeutic regimens consisting of single 5-FU or FU combinations was investigated using the ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay. The level of RegIV mRNA transcripts was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. RegIV expression was evaluated as a novel predictive biomarker for the intrinsic drug resistance of primary GC cells to single 5-FU or 5-FU combinations. Results: Upregulation of RegIV mRNA transcripts was observed in 36 of the 45 tumor specimens and was positively correlated with the invasive depth of the tumor cells (p = 0.000), the clinical stages (p = 0.000) and the in vitro intrinsic drug resistance of primary GC cells to 5-FU (p = 0.000) or 5-FU combinations. Conclusion: RegIV mRNA transcript level was strongly associated with the intrinsic resistance of GC cells to single 5-FU or 5-FU combinations, suggesting that RegIV may play an important role in the intrinsic resistance of GC cells to 5-FU and that targeted therapy against the RegIV gene could be applied to overcome 5-FU resistance in the treatment of GC. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84878280844	The correlation among hMLH1, NIS and TSHR genes with promoter methylation in papillary thyroid carcinoma and its clinical significance	Objective: To investigate the aberrant methylation status of hMLH1 (human mutL homologue 1) gene in PTC (papillary thyroid carcinoma) tissues, and its correlations with the aberrant methylation of NIS (sodium iodide symporter) and TSHR (thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor) genes. Methods: qMSP (quantitative methylation-specific PCR) was carried out to detect the promoter methylation status of hMLH1, NIS and TSHR genes in PTC tissues and adjacent normal thyroid tissues from 152 patinets with PTC. The correlation between the clinicopathologic characteristics and the promoter methylation status of hMLH1 gene was analyzed. The relationships among the methylation status of hMLH1, NIS and TSHR genes and their independent or synergistic effects on the progression of PTC were investigated. Results: The promoter methylation rate of hMLH1 gene in PTC tissues (37.5%) was significantly higher than that in the adjacent normal thyroid tissues (5.3%) (P < 0.05). The promoter methylation of hMLH1 gene in PTC tissues was significantly correlated with the tumor size, number of lesions, local invasion, T stage and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), but not correlated with gender, age, clinical TNM stage and distant metastasis (P > 0.05). There was a weak correlation among aberran promoter methylation of hMLH1, NIS and TSHR genes (r < 0.400). The synergistic effect of aberrant promoter methylation of these three genes had no relationship with the clinicopathologic characteristics of PTC (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The aberrant methylation of hMLH1 gene promoter in PTC tissues might be associated with the progression of the tumor. There exists no correlation among the aberrant methylation of hMLH1, NIS and TSHR genes, and their independent or synergistic effect also may not be associated with the progression of PTC.

Here, we investigated if XAF1 methylation in GC could be a useful biomarker.Methods:Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect XAF1 mRNA expression; immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to examine XAF1 protein expression in GC tissues (n = 202) and their corresponding para-cancerous histological normal tissues (PCHNTs). Real-time methylation specific-PCR was used to investigate XAF1 promoter methylation in the same panel of GC tissues, their PCHNTs and sera.Results:We confirmed frequent XAF1 down-regulation in both mRNA and protein levels in GC tissues as compared to normal controls and PCHNTs. XAF1 hypermethylation was evidenced in 83.2% (168/202) of GC tissues and 27.2% (55/202) of PCHNTs, while no methylation was detected in the 88 normal controls. The methylation level in GC tissues was significantly higher than that in PCHNTs (p<0.05). The hypermethylation of XAF1 significantly correlated with the down-regulation of XAF1 in GC tissues in both mRNA and protein levels (p<0.001 each). Moreover, we detected high frequency of XAF1 methylation (69.8%, 141 out of 202) in the sera DNAs from the same patients, while the sera DNAs from 88 non-tumor controls were negative for XAF1 methylation. The XAF1 methylation in both GC tissues and in the sera could be a good biomarker for diagnosis of GC (AUC = 0.85 for tissue and AUC = 0.91 for sera) and significantly correlated with poorer prognosis (p<0.001). In addition, after-surgery negative-to-positive transition of XAF1 methylation in sera strongly associated with tumor recurrence.Conclusions:1) Dysfunction of XAF1 is frequent and is regulated through XAF1 promoter hypermethylation; 2) Detection of circulating methylated XAF1 DNAs in the serum may be a useful biomarker in diagnosis, evaluating patient's outcome (prognosis and recurrence) for GC patients. © 2013 Ling et al.

84880554495	The overexpression of VEGF in esophageal cancer is associated with a more advanced TMN stage: A meta-analysis	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the impact of VEGF overexpression on prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer (EC). METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed on studies reporting overall survival (OS) or clinicopathological parameters to compare the outcomes of EC patients with VEGF overexpression to the outcomes of patients without VEGF overexpression. RESULTS: There was a significantly increased risk for patients with VEGF overexpression to have an advanced stage of the disease (III and IV) with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.14. Additionally, patients with VEGF overexpression had a 2.03-fold increased risk for distant metastasis and shorter OS (HR=1.55). CONCLUSIONS: VEGF overexpression is associated with a more advanced TMN stage and shorter OS in EC patients. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

84890058719	Down-regulation of PTEN expression modulated by dysregulated miR-21 contributes to the progression of esophageal cancer	Background and Aim: miR-21, a putative tumor oncomiR, is a frequently overexpressed miRNA in a variety of tumors. Because it targets tumor-suppressor genes it has been linked to tumor progression. In this study we investigated the role of miR-21 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and its possible mechanism. Methods: Expression of miR-21 was detected by stem-loop RT-PCR in tissue from 76 invasive ESCC at stage I-IV and in their corresponding para-cancerous histological normal tissues (PCHNT). Thirty endoscopic esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens from non-tumor patients were used as controls. Expression of PTEN in 76 paired ESCC and PCHNT was investigated by real-time RT-PCR and an immunohistochemical method, respectively. Paired tumor and PCHNT specimens of 20 ESCC cases were randomly selected for western blot analysis. The effect of miR-21 on PTEN expression was assessed in the ESCC cell line with an miR-21 inhibitor to reduce miR-21 expression. Furthermore, the roles of miR-21 in cell biology were analyzed by use of miR-21 inhibitor-transfected cells. Results: Stem-loop RT-PCR revealed miR-21 was significantly overexpressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-21 correlated with tumor status, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage. We demonstrated that knockdown of miR-21 significantly increased expression of PTEN protein. Consequent PTEN expression reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that miR-21 could be a potential oncomiR, probably by regulation of PTEN, and a novel prognostic factor for ESCC patients. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84891488381	Overexpression of ILK1 in breast cancer associates with poor prognosis	Integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1), a member of the serine/threonine kinases, has been demonstrated to be associated with numerous biological and pathological processes. However, the role of ILK1 in breast cancer has not been thoroughly elucidated. The purpose of this study was to assess ILK1 expression and to explore its contribution to breast cancer. The ILK1 mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, ILK1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 163 clinicopathologically characterized breast cancer cases. The relationship between ILK1 expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed by appropriate statistics. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the correlation between ILK1 expression and prognosis of breast cancer patients. The relative mRNA expression of ILK1 was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). In addition, ILK1 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.016), grade (P = 0.024), stage (P = 0.029), lymph node metastases (P = 0.007), and estrogen receptor status (P = 0.002). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high ILK1 expression had poor overall survival (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that high ILK1 expression was an independent predictor of overall survival. In conclusion, our data suggest for the first time that the increased expression of ILK1 in breast cancer is associated significantly with aggressive progression and poor prognosis. ILK1 may be an important molecular marker for predicting the carcinogenesis, progression, and prognosis of breast cancer. © 2013 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

84892477219	The impact of E-cadherin expression on the prognosis of esophageal cancer: A meta-analysis	E-cadherin is a 120-KD transmembrane calcium-dependent cell adhesion protein that has been demonstrated drownregulated in a large amount of invasive tumors. However, its effect on the prognosis of esophageal cancer (EC) remains controversial. All the relevant English articles that reported survival data or clinicopathological parameters were enrolled in this meta-analysis. A total of 24 studies, including 2691 cases, were included in this study. Twelve studies containing 1669 cases were enrolled to synthesize with hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The pooled HR for all 12 studies enrolled in this meta-analysis was 1.33 (95% CI 1.16-1.52; z = 3.99, P = 0.00). When the study measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is excluded, the pooled HR-evaluated E-cadherin to reduce the expression in EC, and in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was 1.39 (95% CI 1.22-1.58; z = 5.08, P = 0.00) and 1.38 (95% CI 1.21-1.56; z = 4.87, P = 0.00), respectively. The risk of reduced E-cadherin expression on poor differentiation degree was 1.636 (95% CI 1.33-2.02). The pooled odds ratio of reduced E-cadherin expression on deeper tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and higher clinical stage were 2.63 (95% CI 1.75-3.94), 1.77 (95% CI 1.06-2.97), and 3.39 (95% CI 1.85-6.23). Reduced E-cadherin expression detected by immunohistochemistry could be a valid prognostic marker in patients with EC, especially in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Reduced E-cadherin expression is significantly associated with poorer differentiation degree. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.

84896039817	shRNA-mediated silencing of ZFX attenuated the proliferation of breast cancer cells	Purpose: Breast cancer is the cause for highest number of cancer-related death among women worldwide. This study was focused on investigating the role of zinc-finger protein X-linked (ZFX) in human breast cancer. Methods: Expression levels of ZFX were analyzed in 99 patients and four breast cancer cell lines. Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference was applied to silence ZFX expression, and the effects of ZFX knockdown on the growth of breast cancer cells were investigated. Results: The immunohistochemical expression of ZFX was higher in more advanced tumor tissues. ZFX was also overexpressed in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of ZFX inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, ZFX silencing resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Depletion of ZFX decreased the phosphorylation level of AKT and increased the phosphorylation level of ERK2 and the expression of cyclin D1, which is involved in cell survival and cell cycle regulation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that ZFX plays an important role in breast cancer development and could be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84899523521	Enhanced serum methylated p16 DNAs is associated with the progression of gastric cancer	Objective: The present study is to evaluate the effect of methylated p16 on the progression in patients with gastric cancer (GC), and develop a useful biomarker for predicting patient's prognosis. Design and methods: Methylation status of p16 in GC, their corresponding para-cancerous histological normal tissues (PCHNTs), preoperative peritoneal washes (PPWs) and serum were assessed using real-time methylation specific-PCR (MSP). Results: The frequency of p16 methylation was significantly higher in GC tissues (85.9%; 79/92) than that in paired PCHNTs (12.0%; 11/92) (P<0.0001). p16 methylation correlated closely with lymph node metastasis, peritoneal metastasis, TNM stage, et al (all P<0.05). Both frequency of p16 methylation in PPWs and serum were 79.7% (63/92). The Aζ value of the receiver-operator characteristic curve for methylated p16 was 0.899 for serum and PPWs, compared to that in GC tissues. The patients with elevated methylated p16 levels in tumor tissues had poorer disease-free survival (DFS) rates than those without (P=0.042). There is a narrow significant difference in median survival time of more than 30 months between patients with and without preoperatively detectable methylated p16 in serum (P=0.057). Methylated p16 in PPWs revealed no significant association with survival (P=0.129). Cox regression analysis showed that serum methylated p16 DNAs was an independent risk factor for GC patients, with a remarkable decrease in DFS 30 months after surgical resection of the gastric tumor. Conclusions: Serum methylated p16 DNAs might serve as a potential biomarker for the progression and a prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients.

84902288515	Circulating methylated MINT2 promoter DNA is a potential poor prognostic factor in gastric cancer	Background and Aim: Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with the growth, development, metastasis, and prognosis of tumors. Methylated DNAs may be suitable biomarkers for cancer patients. Here, we investigated whether circulating methylated MINT2 DNAs represent a potential poor prognostic factor in gastric cancer (GC). Methods: MINT2 methylation was detected by real-time methylation-specific PCR in tumor tissues, pairing preoperative peritoneal lavage fluid (PPLF) and blood from 92 GC patients. The theory meaning and clinical practicality value of MINT2 methylation in different specimens were analyzed. Results: The methylation status of the MINT2 gene was found to be significantly higher in tumor tissues (44.6 %, 41/92) than in adjacent normal tissues (3.3 %, 3/92). No MINT2 methylation was found in healthy controls, and partial MINT2 methylation was observed in three (6.25 %, 3/48) patients with chronic atrophic gastritis. The frequency of MINT2 methylation in pairing PPLF and blood samples from 92 GC patients was 40.2 % (37/92) and 39.1 % (36/92), respectively. Methylated MINT2 in tumor tissues, pairing PPLF, and blood samples were very approximate. Aberrant MINT2 methylation in tumor tissues and pairing PPLF or blood samples were closely related to peritoneal dissemination, tumor progression, and poor prognosis (all P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Aberrant MINT2 methylation in PPLF/blood may predict peritoneal micrometastasis for GC patients, which is a potential poor prognostic factor in GC. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

84903688501	A Golgi-specific protein PAQR3 is closely associated with the progression, metastasis and prognosis of human gastric cancers	Background: The aim of this study is to determine whether PAQR3, a protein specifically localized in the Golgi apparatus, is associated with tumor progression, metastasis and survival of human patients with gastric cancer. Patients and methods: PAQR3 expression status was investigated in a large panel of gastric cancer (n = 300) and their corresponding para-cancerous histological normal tissues (PCHNT) at both mRNA and protein levels. The correlation of PAQR3 expression levels with clinical features such as metastasis and prognosis was analyzed. The effect of PAQR3 on the growth and migration of gastric cancer cells was also determined. Results: PAQR3 was frequently down-regulated in gastric cancer samples compared with PCHNT at both mRNA and protein levels (both P < 0.0001). The expression level of PAQR3 was negatively correlated with Helicobacter pylori infection (P < 0.0001), tumor size (P < 0.0001), tumor stage (P < 0.0001), venous and lymphatic invasion (P < 0.0001), distant and nodal metastasis (P < 0.0001), and patient survival (P < 0.0001). Down-regulation of PAQR3 was highly correlated with increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer samples. In addition, PAQR3 overexpression was able to negatively modulate cell proliferation, migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells. Conclusion: PAQR3 is markedly down-regulated in human gastric cancers. PAQR3 expression level is closely associated with the progression and metastasis of gastric cancers. PAQR3 is also a new genetic signature that can predict the prognosis of the patients with gastric cancer. © The Author 2014.

84903317314	Regulation of G6PD acetylation by SIRT2 and KAT9 modulates NADPH homeostasis and cell survival during oxidative stress	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and plays an essential role in the oxidative stress response by producing NADPH, the main intracellular reductant. G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect, affecting more than 400 million people worldwide. Here, we show that G6PD is negatively regulated by acetylation on lysine 403 (K403), an evolutionarily conserved residue. The K403 acetylated G6PD is incapable of forming active dimers and displays a complete loss of activity. Knockdown of G6PD sensitizes cells to oxidative stress, and re-expression of wild-type G6PD, but not the K403 acetylation mimetic mutant, rescues cells from oxidative injury. Moreover, we show that cells sense extracellular oxidative stimuli to decrease G6PD acetylation in a SIRT2-dependent manner. The SIRT2-mediated deacetylation and activation of G6PD stimulates PPP to supply cytosolic NADPH to counteract oxidative damage and protect mouse erythrocytes. We also identified KAT9/ELP3 as a potential acetyltransferase of G6PD. Our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism by which acetylation negatively regulates G6PD activity to maintain cellular NADPH homeostasis during oxidative stress. Synopsis The pentose phosphate pathway plays an important role in the oxidative stress response by supplying the reductant NADPH. SIRT2-mediated deacetylation and activation of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, stimulates the production of cytosolic NADPH to counteract oxidative damage. K403 acetylation decreases G6PD activity by inhibiting dimer formation. SIRT2 and KAT9/ELP3 regulate G6PD K403 acetylation. Regulation of G6PD K403 acetylation modulates NADPH homeostasis and cell survival during oxidative stress. Following oxidative stress, production of the reductant NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway is stimulated by SIRT2-mediated deacetylation and activation of G6PD. © 2014 The Authors.

84904103942	The role of TET family proteins and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in human tumors	Tumorigenesis correlates with hypermethylation of tumor suppressors and hypomethylation of oncogenes. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyze DNA methylation, and mutations and aberrant expression in DNMT genes are found in multiple human tumors. The discovery of the DNA demethylation function of TET proteins has opened up new avenues for the study of DNA methylation regulation. TET proteins regulate the DNA demethylation pathway through oxidizing 5-mC into 5-hmC, 5-fC, and 5-aC. TET genes have been reported to be frequently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies and are associated with the malignant transformation of cells. Loss-of-function mutations in TET genes have not been reported in human solid tumors. However, 5-hmC has been found to be reduced in various solid tumors, indicating that TET genes may contribute to cellular transformation via regulation of DNA demethylation. As a new epigenetic modification, 5-hmC may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of cancers. To better understand the roles of TET and 5-hmC in tumors, the biological functions of TET and 5-hmC should be studied further.

84923887072	Methylated TIMP-3 DNA in body fluids is an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer	Context. - Fluid methylated DNA may be a suitable biomarker for cancer patients. Objective. - To investigate whether circulating methylated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3 ) DNA in body fluids is a useful prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer (GC). Design. - TIMP-3 methylation was detected by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in tumor tissues, paired preoperative peritoneal washes (PPWs), and paired serum samples from 92 GC patients. Results. - The frequency of TIMP-3 methylation was significantly elevated in GC tissues (63.04%; 58 of 92) compared with that in paired adjacent normal tissue (4.3%; 4 of 92) (P < .001). TIMP-3 methylation correlated closely with peritoneal metastasis and TNM stage (all P < .001). The frequency of TIMP-3 methylation in preoperative peritoneal washes and serum samples was 53.3% (49 of 92) and 58.7% (54 of 92), respectively. The Aζ values of the receiver operator characteristic curve for methylated TIMP-3 were 0.966 and 0.922 for serum and preoperative peritoneal washes, respectively, compared with those in GC tissues. The patients with elevated methylated TIMP-3 levels in body fluids had poorer disease-free survival rates than those without (all P < .001). Cox regression analysis showed that detection of methylated TIMP-3 DNA in body fluids was an independent risk factor for GC patients, with a remarkable decrease in disease-free survival 30 months after surgical resection of the gastric tumor. Conclusion. - Presence of methylated TIMP-3 DNA in body fluids is a useful biomarker for predicting the progression and prognosis of GC patients.
