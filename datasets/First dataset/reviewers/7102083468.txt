20544457803	Study on inner fin tube type catalyst with metal wall and catalytic layer	The preparation method of the catalyst with metal wall and catalytic layer has been developed by anodic oxidation, pore sealing and impregnation of the catalytic composition. The relationship between alumina film thickness and the time of anodic oxidation, pore size distribution in various sealing conditions, and the change in the amount of Pd supported with time have been discussed. In the same condition of anodic oxidation, the alumina film thickness of the tube is not the same as that of the plate. Pore size distribution changes with the change of the sealing condition.

The effect of operation condition (temperature, pressure and superficial velocity) and dimension of equipment (obliquity of separator) on liquid entrainment was studied. The entrainment in three-phase bed reactor is in contrast with that in two-phase bed reactor, which indicates entrainment in three-phase bed can be regarded as that in two phases bed approximatively. Furthermore, the mechanism of liquid entrainment and the efficiency of separation were studied. The mechanism of carrying out liquid was also discussed.

32544459919	Continuous distribution kinetics for degradation of polystyrene in sub- and supercritical toluene	When the degradation of polystyrene is carried out above 300 °C, the process of degradation is very complex with concurrent random scission and chain-end scission including depolymerization, intramolecular transfer and followed β-scission which produce volatile products. A quick- depolymerization assumption was proposed to simplify the reaction mechanism of this process. Based on this assumption, continuous distribution kinetics was used to describe the model of polystyrene degradation at the mechanistic level. Toluene was used as solvent to study the sub- and supercritical degradation of polystyrene at 310-370 °C and high yields of volatile products were obtained. The experimental data supported the assumption and determined rate coefficients of random scission and chain-end scission. The activation energies of random scission and chain-end scission, determined from the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients, were 43.2 and 42.7 kcal/mol, respectively.

Supercritical solvents have unique properties such as excellent heat and mass transfer. Compared with thermal degradation without solvents, supercritical degradation obtains high conversion in a very short reaction time. The supercritical degradation of polystyrene is a typical free radical reaction mechanism, including chain fission, disproportionation, radical recombination, β-scission. intermolecular abstraction and intramolecular abstraction. Based on the reaction mechanism, the process of polystyrene degradation in supercritical toluene was modeled at the mechanistic level by using population balance equations formulated via the method of moments.

34248564855	Effect of different supercritical solvents on the degradation of polystyrene	The degradation properties of polystyrene in supercritical benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene were studied between 340-370°C using a quick process. Benzene hydrocarbons are the fine solvents of polystyrene. All the solvents have unique properties such as excellent heat transfer and mass transfer at supercritical conditions, and the degradation conversions of polystyrene were similar using different solvents. The conversion of polystyrene was close to thorough degradation when the temperature reached 370°C. Supercritical degradation of polystyrene in toluene improved the liquid product yield close to 97% while reducing the gas and residue oil less than 1% and 3%, respectively. The products are mainly composed of benzene, ethylbenzene, xylene, styrene, α-methylstyrene etc. But it is noted that the yield of styrene was quite different in different supercritical solvents. The experiments showed that the yield of styrene was much higher using supercritical toluene as solvent than that with other solvents. The yield of styrene obtained from polystyrene in supercritical toluene at 350°C for 30 min reached a value of 75.5 wt%. The reaction mechanism consists of depolymerization of polystyrene and secondary reactions. The result showed that supercritical solvents affected the secondary reaction differently, because the styrene obtained from degradation could not separate out from the system quickly. Moreover, among the solvents employed in our work, toluene was founded to be the most effective supercritical solvent to recovery styrene from polystyrene. Based on the continuous distribution kinetics, the model of polystyrene degradation was developed at the mechanistic level using population balance equations formulated via the method of moments. The activation energy of polystyrene degradation in supercritical toluene obtained from Arrhenius equation is 138.4 kJ·mol

The effects of impregnation solvents on the performances of catalysts were examined. The catalyst was prepared with ethanol solution and high Co dispersion was obtained, exhibiting highest activity of CO hydrogenation, very low methane selectivity, and high heavy hydrocarbon C5+ selectivity. The catalysts were prepared with aqueous solution and methanol solution, and the reaction behaviors were similar. The solvent isopropanol caused the lowest catalytic activity and highest methane selectivity. Increasing the reaction temperature enhanced the CO hydrogenation rate, and the CO conversion slightly increased the CO2 selectivity and favored the formation methane and light hydrocarbons, while the chain growth probability decreased. For the catalyst prepared with ethanol, the CO conversion, the CH4 selectivity, and the C5+ selectivity were 94.16%, 5.65%, and 88.2%, respectively, and the chain growth probability was 0.87 at 493 K, 1.5 MPa, 800 h-1, and n(H2):n(CO) = 2.0 in feed.

The apparatus and procedures are applied to several specimens of cobalt-based catalyst powder compacts. Specimens with different degrees of porosity are produced by pressing cobalt-based catalyst powder with a particle size of (80 to 360) mesh. The thermal conductivity of cobalt-based catalyst powder compacts is investigated as functions of temperature, specimen density, porosity, and powder size. The results indicate that the thermal conductivity of the catalyst specimens increases linearly with temperature and density and is practically independent of the particle size of the powder in an atmosphere of air, while the porosity dependence of the thermal conductivity is inverse to that of density. In addition, the effects of some measuring factors on the thermal conductivity show that the reliability of the thermal conductivity measurements of cobalt-based catalyst specimens are influenced easily by parallelism, specimen roughness, and moisture content, whereas the specimen thickness and water bath temperature have only a slight effect on the reliability. © US Government 2010.

53849128185	Effect of weak acids as a catalyst on the transesterification of soybean oil in supercritical methanol	To obtain a high biodiesel yield, the conditions of transesterification of vegetable oil with supercritical methanol are harsh. The reaction temperature is required between 350 and 400 °C, and the reaction pressure is required above 20 MPa. To reduce the operating temperature and pressure, many researchers adopted various methods, such as the selection of a new reactor, the addition of a co-solvent, or the usage of microwave irradiation. According to the characteristics of transesterification, a small amount of organic or inorgnic acid was added into the reaction system, and the effects of an acidic condition on transesterification was investigated in this paper. The experiment was conducted in a continuous flow tubular reactor; the temperature ranged from 270 to 350 °C; the pressure covered the range from the normal pressure to 15 MPa; the molar ratio of methanolloil was from 20:1 to 60:1; and the acidity of acidified soybean oil was from 5 to 30 mg of KOH/g. The results showed that the higher yield of biodiesel was obtained at the conditions with the addition of acid compared to the corresponding conditions without acid and the increase of the yield was more remarkable under lower pressure and temperature correspondingly. Besides, it was found that the effect of inorgnic acid on transesterification was more obvious than that of organic acid. The yield of biodiesel could reach 91.4% when the reaction temperature, the reaction pressure, the methanol/oil molar ratio, and the acidity of acidified soybean oil were 350 °C, 15 MPa, 40:1, and 15.0 mg of KOH /g, respectively.

70549087994	Calculation and analysis of sub/supercritical methanol preheating tube for continuous production of biodiesel via supercritical methanol transesterification	Biodiesel is an important renewable energy. Supercritical methanol transesterification for biodiesel has recently been concerned because of its obvious advantages. The tubular reactor is an ideal reactor for continuous preparation of biodiesel via supercritical methanol transesterification. A methanol preheating tube is necessary for the tubular reaction system because the reaction temperature for supercritical methanol transesterification is usually 520-600 K. Therefore, in the range of 298-600 K, changes of the density, isobaric capacity, viscosity and thermal conductivity of sub/supercritical methanol with temperature are first discussed. Then on the basis of these thermophysical properties, an integration method is adopted for the design of sub/supercritical methanol preheating tube when methanol is preheated from 298 K to 600 K at 16 MPa and the influencing factors on the length of the preheating tube are also studied.

By the use of a special sample basket and relatively higher methanol concentration, the TGA instrument can be viewed as fixed-bed reactor, while both coking rate and reaction results for MTO reaction can be recorded in situ. The influences of reaction conditions over coking rate are discussed, while the effect of temperature is emphasized. Both weight change and color interchanging phenomenon at different reaction temperatures indicate that the severity of hydrothermal atmosphere is partly responsible for the different species of coke formation as temperature varies. A simplified coking model with exponential mathematical expression is established and verified. Coking has a very close relationship with MTO results. The different trend of product distribution as coking occurs proves the selective deactivation phenomenon. DME can be viewed as an indicator of the deactivation level in this process. The coking model is valuable to express the catalyst activity change during reaction as well as kinetic modeling for further investigations, while the catalyst coke content during MTO process can be predicted simultaneously. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of gas flow mode in gas-cooled reactor on combined converter was investigated with the yield of methanol was 1 400 kt/a. The results show that if the flow mode of the cooling pipe gas and the catalytic bed gas change from countercurrent to concurrent, the catalytic bed temperature distribution does not fit the most optimum temperature curve of reversible exothermic reaction and the heat duty of heat changer in whole process increased seriously, which means that there is much more equipment investment and more operating cost. The gas flow mode of gas-cooled reactor affects the methanol yield slightly.

80051485113	The weight change of SAPO-34 catalyst during MTO process in TGA reactor	The Thermax 700 thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) instrument is introduced for the investigation of the weight change of SAPO-34 catalyst during methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process. By the use of a special sample basket with screen bottom, the TGA instrument can be viewed as fixed-bed reactor, while the weight change of SAPO-34 during MTO reaction can be recorded online. It is noticed that the SAPO-34 catalyst experiences a procedure of dehydration as furnace temperature rises; hence the weight increase of SAPO-34 during MTO reaction should be calculated based on the weight after dehydration.

84858110995	An experimental study on optimization utilization of deasphalted oil	As the crude oil reserves become depleted and of deteriorating quality, maximizing the economy of refining plant is increasingly difficult. In the present work, an additional unit of liquid-liquid extraction with deasphalted oil (DAO) as feedstock was proposed to modify the current solvent deasphalting process, for the purposes of improving the quality of deasphalted oil and providing aromatic-rich compounds to blend asphalt. It is important to select a suitable solvent to perform this proposed liquid-liquid extraction process with the aims of improving the quality of FCC feedstock from DAO and supplying aromatic-rich for asphalt-blending. A set of comparative experiments was conducted to observe the extraction performance of five kinds of solvents widely-used in industry. N-methylpyrrolidone was found to perform best with regards to both the yield and the quality of extract. Investigation on operation conditions illustrated that higher temperature facilitated an increase of extract yield at expense of its quality loss. More solvent usage would enhance the raffinate's quality. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84864675896	Effect of incorporation manner of Zr promoter on precipitated ironbased catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis	The promotional effects of Zr on the structure, reduction, carburization and catalytic behavior of precipitated iron-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts were investigated. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and Mössbauer effect spectroscopy (MES) techniques. As revealed by N2 physisorption, Zr decreased the BET surface area and pore volume of the catalyst. The results of TPR and MES show that Zr suppresses the reduction and carburization of Fe catalysts because of the interaction between Fe and Zr. The FTS reaction results indicate that Zr decreases the FTS activity of Fe catalysts but improves the catalysts' stability. In addition, Zr promoter restraines the formation of light hydrocarbons (methane and C2∼C4) and shifts the production distribution to the heavy hydrocarbons. © The Editorial Office of Journal of Coal Science and Engineering (China) and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

84872838407	Reaction-diffusion model of multi-component parallel reaction in methanol synthesis catalyst and optimization of the size of catalyst particle	In this paper, a multi-component reaction-diffusion model of parallel reaction is developed in methanol synthesis catalyst. The orthogonal collocation method as well as Broyden quasi-Newton method is applied to solving the model and the model is validated by global kinetics data with satisfactory results. The internal effectiveness factor of different size of catalyst particles is obtained, and smaller particle is favor for improving the catalytic efficiency. A two-dimensional model is set up to simulate industrial methanol synthesis reactor. The effect of particle size on the methanol yield is investigated by comparing different capacity of reactor packed with different size of catalyst. The methanol yield is increasing with decreased particle size, but smaller catalyst can lead to higher pressure drop of reactor and increase the energy consumption. An optimized catalyst is proposed by considering both catalyst activity and power consumption. The method developed can provide supportive information for catalyst modification and reactor design.

The effects of operating conditions including the reactor inlet air temperature, the heating pipe temperature and the air flow rate on the cross-flow heat transfer were investigated and results show that the temperature profile of the area in front of the heating pipe is slightly affected by all the operating conditions. The main area whose temperature profile is influenced is located behind the heating pipe. The heat transfer direction is related to the direction of the flow. In order to obtain the basic parameters for radial flow reactor designing calculation, the dimensionless number group method was used for data fitting of the bed effective thermal conductivity and the wall heat transfer coefficient which were calculated by the mathematical model with the product of Reynolds number and Prandtl number. The comparison of experimental data and calculated values shows that the calculated values fit the experimental data satisfactorily and the formulas can be used for reactor designing calculation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84901712319	Kinetics of hydrogenolysis of glycerol to ethylene glycol over Raney Ni catalyst	The rapid development of biodiesel production yields large amount of glycerol as a by-product. It is a resource-utilization efficient and biological technical process to employ hydrogenolysis of glycerol aqueous solution for ethylene glycol generation. In this work, Raney Ni catalyst was prepared through conventional means and tested for hydrogenolysis of glycerol to produce ethylene glycol. The experiments were performed by varying the reaction time and rotate speed at a hydrogen pressure of 6.0-10.0MPa over a temperature range of 453-493K using a batch reactor. The effect of reaction conditions on the conversion of glycerol and the product distribution were also investigated and discussed. The results indicated that with the increase of reaction time the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity of 1,2-PDO tended to rise but the concentration of ethylene glycol decreased after reaching a peak point. The conversion of glycerol reached as much as 100% and the selectivity of ethylene glycol reached a maximum of 40%. Based on the experimental data, the reaction kinetics was studied and the parameters involved a two-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood model were acquired by the parameter estimation method. In the end, residual error distribution and statistic test showed that the obtained kinetic model was suitable and acceptable. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84905991030	The simulation of an industrial fixed bed reactor for methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether	Compared to methane and methanol, dimethyl ether seems to be a superior candidate for high quality diesel fuel in the near future. To meet the continuously increasing global requirements, a larger scale reactor is needed to produce more dimethyl ether. A heterogeneous one-dimensional model was developed to simulate a staged adiabatic fixed bed reactor for the catalytic dehydration of methanol to dimethyl ether. To verify the proposed model, the simulated catalyst bed temperature has been compared to available data from an industrial reactor. A good agreement has been found between the simulation and plant data. Also, the effects of some operational parameters, such as feed flow rates, the inlet temperatures of methanol, pressure, and catalyst particle diameter on reactor behavior were investigated. The simulated results show that this model is reasonable and reliable. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
