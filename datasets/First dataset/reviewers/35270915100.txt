18744398416	Comparing techniques for detecting the number of somatic cells in raw milk	Evaluating the quality of milk and monitoring for cow mastitis requires an evaluation of the somatic cell count (SCC), an important parameter in the dairy industry. We studied the somatic cells of raw milk using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM), flow cytometry (FCM), and a light microscope (LM). The CLSM method gave a good correlation (r=0.987) with the LM counts of somatic cells in raw milk. The FCM method also correlated well (r=0.904) with the LM method. The CLSM method gave a good correlation (r=0.908) with the FCM method. This study shows that the CLSM method and the FCM method both offer rapid and simple approaches to somatic cell detection. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

21044449929	Control of postharvest Rhizopus rot of peach by microwave treatment and yeast antagonist	The potential of using microwave power alone, or in combination with antagonistic yeast, for control of Rhizopus stolonifer on peach, and its effects on the postharvest quality of peach were investigated. In in vitro tests, the growth of R. stolonifer was completely inhibited by a 2,450 MHz microwave heating for 2 min or more. The population density of R. stolonifer in surface wounds of microwave treatment fruits was significantly lower than that in the control. In vivo studies of inoculation of peach fruit with R. stolonifer followed by microwave treatment, Cryptococcus laurentii or both of them, microwave power and C. laurentii, as stand-alone treatments, were capable of reducing the percentage of decayed fruit from 95% in control, untreated fruit to 42.1% and 75%, respectively. However, in fruit treated with a combination of microwave power and C. laurentii, the percentage of decayed fruits was only 23.7%. The experiments on reducing natural decay development of fruit gave similar results. The microwave treatment, C. laurentii, or both of them did not impair the quality parameters of the fruit. Thus, the combination of microwave and C. laurentii could be an alternative to chemicals for control of postharvest Rhizopus rot on peach fruits. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

22344451433	In vivo and in vitro encystment of Echinochasmus liliputanus cercariae and biological activity of the metacercariae	In vivo and in vitro encystment of the cercariae of Echinochasmus liliputanus and biological activity of the metacercariae were studied. In vivo encystment of cercariae occurred in the gills of goldfish, the second intermediate host. However, the cercariae also encysted in vitro in Locke solution (0.6X to 1.2X strength), 0.7-1.2% NaCl, artificial gastric juice, and human gastric juice. Locke or NaCl solutions were shown to be appropriate for in vitro encystment to occur within 24 hr; however, full-strength Locke solution was shown to be optimal. The 1-day-old metacercariae formed in vivo and treated in 0.1% sodium deoxycholate excystation medium at 37 C for 1 hr showed 88.5% excystation. The metacercariae formed in vitro, however, showed 88.6% and 85.0% excystation for normal and abnormal ones, respectively. Abnormal cysts at room temperature usually die within 10 days. About 70% of the normal cysts, both in vivo and in vitro, can still excyst after being stored in Locke 0.5X solution at 4 C for 3 mo. Cysts formed in vivo and in vitro were equally infective. The encystment of the cercariae in vitro could be inhibited when the cercariae were treated with 1 μmol silver nitrate. Because silver nitrate binds to the papillae, especially to the ciliated papillae, on the cercaria surface, it is suggested that papillary chemoreceptors may be involved in encystment of the cercariae. The finding of E. liliputanus cercariae encysting in vitro, especially in human gastric juice, might be helpful in elucidating mechanisms of the definitive hosts that are directly infected by the cercariae. © American Society of Parasitologists 2005.

In vitro test, growth of Penicillium expansum was completely inhibited by a 2450 MHz microwave heating for 2 or 3 min. The population density of P. expansum in surface wounds of fruit treated with microwave for 2-3 min was significantly lower than that of control. In vivo test, microwave power and antagonist yeast, as stand-alone treatments, were capable of reducing the percentage of infected wounds from 100% to 72.6% and 65.5%, and lesion diameter from 2.81 mm to 2.20 mm and 1.85 mm respectively. However, in fruit treated with combination of microwave power and Cryptococcus laurentii, the percentage of infected wounds and lesion diameter was only 20.2% and 1.1 mm respectively, incidence of natural decay on treated fruits were similar to that of inoculated fruit. None of the treatments did impair quality parameters of fruit. Thus, the combination of microwave and C. laurentii could be an alternative to chemicals for the control of postharvest blue mold rot on pear fruits. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33745964126	Effect of yeast antagonist in combination with hot water dips on postharvest Rhizopus rot of strawberries	The potential of using an antagonistic yeast alone or in combination with short hot water dips (at 55 °C for 30 s) for the control of postharvest Rhizopus rot and natural infections of strawberries, and its effects on postharvest quality of fruit was investigated. Cryptococcus laurentii was effective in controlling Rhizopus rot of strawberries. The concentrations of antagonist had significant effects on biocontrol effectiveness: the higher the concentrations of the antagonist, the lower the disease incidence. Rapid colonization of the yeast in wounds was observed during the first 2 days at 20 °C, and then the populations stabilized for the remaining storage period. On strawberry wounds kept at 4 °C, the increase in population density of C. laurentii was lower than at 20 °C, but continued over 20 days after application of the antagonist until it reached a high level. In the experiment to evaluate the effect of hot water dips and yeast antagonist on decay development in artificially inoculated fruits, hot water dips and antagonist yeast, as stand-alone treatments, were capable of reducing the percentage of infected wounds from 96.7% to 65% and 63.3%, respectively. However, in fruit treated with combination of hot water dips and C. laurentii, the percentage of infected wounds was only 43.3%. Incidence of natural decay on treated fruits were similar to that of inoculated fruit. None of the treatments did impair quality parameters of fruit. Thus, the combination of C. laurentii and short hot water dips could be an alternative to chemicals for the control of postharvest Rhizopus rot on strawberries. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

33747818288	Studies on catalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde with immobilized yeasts in organic solvents	Catalytic hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol with a number of yeasts in aqueous phase or organic phase was investigated. The factors such as types of organic solvents, original concentration of substrates, quantity of yeasts and activating treatment of yeasts were investigated further through the baker's yeasts immobilized with calcium alginate. The results showed that catalytic hydrogenations of benzaldehyde with the Candida sp and baker's yeast are relatively better, and that catalytic hydrogenations of benzaldehyde by the activated yeast and in organic solvents with higher value of lg P are preferable. This work has established the experimental foundation for applications of the yeasts in the organic reaction.

33748938365	Bioreduction of geraniol catalyzed by immobilized whole yeast cells in organic solvents	Biocatalysts in organic solvent with whole cells have been studied in current research of biotechnological fields, with significant advantages over traditional biotransformation in aqueous environment. Reductive conversion of geraniol to citronellol is adopted as a model reaction, and several factors in the reaction are discussed using gas-chromatography method. The influence of n-hexane and butyl acetate, as organic solvents, on biocompatibility was studied; the influences of methanol, ethanol, glycol, n-butanol and 1-hexanol, as energy substance, on the transformation efficiency were compared, respectively; the catalysis capabilities of Baker's yeast, XST-KO yeast, LP yeast, alcohol yeast, dry yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Angel yeast and Meishan yeast were discussed. It has been proved that biocompatibility of n-hexane is much better than that of butyl acetate, and the hexane has been demonstrated to be the most effective in terms of the influence on biotransformation, Baker's yeast has shown the highest transformation efficiency among the eight yeast strains.

33750833445	Control of Alternaria alternata by cassia oil in combination with potassium chloride or sodium chloride	Aims: To compare antifungal effects of cassia oil alone and in combination with potassium chloride (KCl) or sodium chloride (NaCl) against Alternaria alternata in vitro and in vivo. Methods and Results: The inhibitory effect of cassia oil alone, or in combination with KCl and NaCl were tested in vitro. The spore germination and germ tube elongation of the pathogen was evaluated in potato dextrose broth with light microscopy analysis. The inhibitory effect of cassia oil alone, or in combination with KCl and NaCl, was determined on cherry tomatoes in vivo. The cassia oil in combination with KCl and NaCl exhibited strong antifungal effect in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions: The antifungal effect of cassia oil against Alt. alternata was enhanced significantly by combining with KCl and NaCl both in vitro and in vivo. Significance and Impact of the Study: The combination of cassia oil and KCl or NaCl may enhance antifungal effect of cassia oil and reduce cost. © 2006 The Authors.

33847114437	Synergistic effect of chitosan and Cryptococcus laurentii on inhibition of Penicillium expansum infections	This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of chitosan at different concentrations with various intrinsic viscosities alone, and in its combination with a yeast antagonist Cryptococcus laurentii in reducing the blue mold rot caused by Penicillium expansum in apple fruit. The results indicated that application of chitosan alone was effective in inhibiting the blue mold rot in apple fruit wounds, especially with the high concentrations and low viscosities. But its efficacy was declining with the incubation time so that chitosan alone could not provide enduring protection of apple fruit from P. expansum infections. When applied at the concentration range from 0.001 to 0.1% (wt/vol), chitosan did not influence the population growth of C. laurentii in vivo, whereas it markedly repressed the yeast growth as its concentrations were increased up to 0.25% (wt/vol) or higher. Moreover, combination of chitosan and C. laurentii resulted in a synergistic inhibition of the blue mold rot, being the most effective at the optimal concentration of 0.1% of chitosan with the lowest viscosity (12 cP). The possible mode of action of the combination of chitosan and C. laurentii was discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33847273714	Essential oils to control Alternaria alternata in vitro and in vivo	The inhibitory effects of five essential oils (thyme, sage, nutmeg, eucaptus and cassia) against Alternaria alternata were tested at different concentrations (100-500 ppm) in vitro. The cassia oil and thyme oil both exhibited antifungal activity against A. alternata. The cassia oil inhibited completely the growth of A. alternata at 300-500 ppm. The thyme oil exhibited a lower degree of inhibition 62.0% at 500 ppm. Spore germination and germ tube elongation of the pathogens in potato dextrose broth was strongly inhibited in the presence of 500 ppm cassia oil. Irreversible inhibition of fungal growth could be caused by exposure to 300 ppm and 400 ppm cassia oil for 6 days and 500 ppm cassia oil for 3 days. Cassia oil at 500 ppm reduced the percentage of decayed tomatoes. The experiments on reducing natural decay development of tomatoes gave similar results. Therefore, essential oils could be an alternative to chemicals for control of postharvest phytopathogenic fungi on fruits or vegetables. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In vitro tests, spore germination of pathogens in PDB was greatly controlled by the heat treatment of 37 °C for 2 d. In vivo test to control blue mold decay of peaches, heat treatment and antagonist yeast, as stand-alone treatments, were capable of reducing the percentage of infected wounds from 92.5% to 52.5% and 62.5%, respectively, when peach fruits stored at 25 °C for 6 d. However, in fruit treated with combination of heat treatment and Cryptococcus laurentii, the percentage of infected wounds of blue mold decay was only 22.5%. The test of using heat treatment alone or in combination with C. laurentii to control Rhizopus decay of peaches gave a similar result. The application of heat treatment and C. laurentii resulted in low average natural decay incidences on peaches after storage at 4 °C for 30 days and 20 °C for 7 days ranging from 40% to 30%, compared with 20% in the control fruit. The combination of heat treatment and C. laurentii was the most effective treatment, and the percentage of decayed fruits was 20%. Heat treatment in combination with C. laurentii had no significant effect on firmness, TSS, ascorbic acid or titratable acidity compared to control fruit. Thus, the combination of heat treatment and C. laurentii could be an alternative to chemicals for the control of postharvest decay on peach fruits. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34047161071	Immunomodulatory activity of aqueous extract of Actinidia macrosperma	Actinidia macrosperma (AM) is a medicinal plant in China and has been well known for its activities against cancers, especially of lung, liver and digestive system. The immunomodulatory effects of AM aqueous extract were examined using S180-bearing mice. Young adult (20 ± 2 g) ICR mice inoculated with S180 cells were divided randomly into six groups: S180-bearing control group, normal control group, positive control group (Ginseng Radix Rubra 2000 mg/kg) and 50, 100, 250 mg/kg AM treatment groups. Each group consisted of ten mice. Body and tumor weights were obtained after 12 consecutive days, and their humoral, cellular and nonspecific immune functions were also determined by relative assays. The results showed that the aqueous extract of AM was lack of significant inhibit on transplantable sarcoma S180, with a inhibit rate of 1.5%-14.8% (dose at 250 mg/kg was the best), but significantly increased the overall immune functions (especially at 100 and 250 mg/kg). The immunomodulatory effect was dose-dependent in a nonlinear fashion with the optimal dose of 100 mg/kg. The AM-induced antitumor effects were at least partially indirect and were associated with the modulation of immune functions.

34547160324	An integrated strategy to control postharvest blue and grey mould rots of apple fruit by combining biocontrol yeast with gibberellic acid	Summary Strains of Cryptococcus laurentii are useful biocontrol yeasts in controlling postharvest fruit diseases. Gibberellic acid (GA3), as a plant growth regulator, is associated with many plant growth and development processes. The results from this study showed that the combination of C. laurentii at 1 × 108 cells mL-1 and GA3 at 200 μg mL-1 could produce a more efficient control of both the blue and grey mould rots of apple fruit caused by Penicillium expansum and Botrytis cinerea, respectively. Moreover, this combined treatment could stimulate a great increase in the activities of both superoxide dismutase and catalase, however, it suppressed the increase of peroxidase activity in apple fruit. In addition, GA3 alone at 200 μg mL-1 had little influence on the incidence and development of both the diseases on apple wounds, and it had no effect on the spore germination of both P. expansum and B. cinereain vitro as well as the population of C. laurentiiin vivo. Therefore, we deduced that the efficacy of this combined treatment in controlling the postharvest diseases in apple fruit could be linked to its capability of adjusting the fruit-mediated resistance on the basis of the antagonistic activity of the biocontrol yeast itself. © 2007 Institute of Food Science and Technology Trust Fund.

34648825696	Antimicrobial effect of food-grade GML microemulsions against Staphylococcus aureus	Food-grade GML (Glycerol Monolaurate, the glycerol monoester of lauric acid) microemulsions based on multi-component mixtures and enhanced antimicrobial effects have been studied. The compositions included water, GML, several surfactants (ethoxylated sorbitan esters, sucrose esters), alcohols (pentanol and dodecanol), salt (potassium sorbate). The influence of surfactants, alcohols and salt on the phase behavior is discussed in this paper. Four improved formulations of microemulsion systems with large O/W regions have been obtained and demonstrated the enhanced antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, compared to Glycerol Monolaurate. Subsequently, one formulation with the highest antimicrobial activity was further studied with respect to the influence of each component on the antimicrobial effect. The results showed that among all the components, GML had the significantly highest (P < 0.01) inhibition ratio 63.52% and played a dominating role in the antimicrobial activities. Therefore, it was concluded that food-grade GML microemulsions had enhanced antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, with a major contribution of GML. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

38049144501	Formulation of food-grade microemulsions with glycerol monolaurate: Effects of short-chain alcohols, polyols, salts and nonionic surfactants	The formulation of food-grade microemulsions with glycerol monolaurate (GML) for antimicrobial applications has been studied. The compositions included water, GML, short-chain alcohols (such as ethanol), polyols (propylene glycol and glycerol), salts (organic, such as sodium benzoate, sodium lactate and sodium propionate, and inorganic, such as NaCl) and several nonionic surfactants [such as ethoxylated sorbitan esters, sucrose esters (SEs)]. The phase behavior of these systems is discussed with respect to the influence of composition on the degree of oil solubilization in the aqueous phase. The oil solubilization was dramatically improved in the presence of the short-chain alcohols and polyols, organic salts contributed to the improvement of oil solubilization as hydrotropes. Tween 20 being the most hydrophilic surfactant in Tweens solubilized the maximum oil, but in the presence of SEs it is hard to form oil-in-water microemulsions. Viscosity measurements along selected dilution lines indicate that at a certain composition the system inverts from a water-in-oil to an oil-in-water microemulsion. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

39149109951	Effect of chitin on the antagonistic activity of Cryptococcus laurentii against Penicillium expansum in pear fruit	This study was designed to evaluate the impact of chitin on the antagonistic activity of Cryptococcus laurentii against the postharvest blue mold rot caused by Penicillium expansum in pear fruit. The results showed that the antagonistic activity of C. laurentii obtained from the culture media of nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDB) amended with chitin at 0.5-1.0% was improved greatly compared with the case that without chitin. The addition of chitin to NYDB did not influence the growth of C. laurentii, however, its population was found to increase rapidly thereafter in pear fruit wounds compared to that harvested from NYDB without chitin. Moreover, the cell-free filtrate of the chitin-supplement culture media in which the yeast was incubated for 24 h emerged a direct antifungal activity against P. expansum in pear fruit wounds, with the associated high level of chitinase activity. These results suggested that the use of chitin may be an effective method to induce the antagonistic activity of C. laurentii. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the chitin could enhance the efficacy of postharvest biocontrol yeasts. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

32044473772	Human NK cells positively regulate γδ T cells in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The decrease in NK cell activity and the loss of γδ T cells in active pulmonary tuberculosis patients have been reported. In this study, we observed that the proliferating response of γδ T cells to the heat-treated Ags of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from different individuals was noted to be dependent on the content or function of NK cells in PBMC in a population study. We also found that NK cells were directly rapidly activated by the heat-treated Ags from M. tuberculosis (H37Ra) in vitro; in turn, the activated NK cells improved γδ T cell proliferation both by CD54-mediated cell-cell contact through the forming immune synapse and by soluble factors TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-12, but not IFN-γ. Our results demonstrated that an interaction between NK cells and γδ T cells existed in antituberculosis immunity. Up-regulating the function of NK cells might be beneficial to the prevention and control of pulmonary tuberculosis. Copyright © 2006 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

41149125660	Keratinase production and keratin degradation by a mutant strain of Bacillus subtilis	A new feather-degrading bacterium was isolated from a local feather waste site and identified as Bacillus subtilis based on morphological, physiochemical, and phylogenetic characteristics. Screening for mutants with elevated keratinolytic activity using N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis resulted in a mutant strain KD-N2 producing keratinolytic activity about 2.5 times that of the wild-type strain. The mutant strain produced inducible keratinase in different substrates of feathers, hair, wool and silk under submerged cultivation. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed the degradation of feathers, hair and silk by the keratinase. The optimal conditions for keratinase production include initial pH of 7.5, inoculum size of 2% (v/v), age of inoculum of 16 h, and cultivation at 23 °C. The maximum keratinolytic activity of KD-N2 was achieved after 30 h. Essential amino acids like threonine, valine, methionine as well as ammonia were produced when feathers were used as substrates. Strain KD-N2, therefore, shows great promise of finding potential applications in keratin hydrolysis and keratinase production. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

58049121118	Microarray analysis of gene expression profile induced by the biocontrol yeast Cryptococcus laurentii in cherry tomato fruit	To obtain an overall view on transcript modification during the cherry tomato fruit responding to biocontrol yeast Cryptococcus laurentii, we performed a microarrary analysis, using Affymetrix Tomato Genechip arrays, representing approximately 10,000 genes. The results showed that 194 and 312 genes were up- or down-regulated, respectively, more then ten time fold (log2 change ratio ≥ 2 or log2 change ratio ≤ - 2) in biocontrol yeast treated tomato fruit as compared with control fruits. Those up-regulated included genes involved in metabolism, signal transduction, and stress response. Conversely, genes related to energy metabolism and photosynthesis were generally down-regulated. Our results suggest that biocontrol yeast treatment induces fruit resistance response, suppresses energy metabolism and photosynthesis. A number of transcripts encoding proteins/enzymes which are known to be up-regulated under some biotic and abiotic stress are also up-regulated after the applying biological control yeast to cherry tomato fruit. The expression of these proteins might increase the fruit resistance towards postharvest pathogen infection and damage. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 34 most promising SNPs were carried forward for replication in samples from individuals of the Chinese Han (5,910 cases and 9,916 controls) and Chinese Uygur (713 cases and 824 controls) populations.

77954315269	Characterization and antimicrobial activity of a pharmaceutical microemulsion	The characterization of a pharmaceutical microemulsion system with glycerol monolaurate as oil, ethanol as cosurfactant, Tween 40 as surfactant, sodium diacetate and water, and the antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium expansum have been studied. The influence of ethanol and sodium diacetate on oil solubilization capability was clearly reflected in the phase behavior of these systems. One microemulsion formulation was obtained and remained stable by physical stability studies. The antimicrobial assay using solid medium diffusion method showed that the prepared microemulsion was comparable to the commonly used antimicrobials as positive controls. The kinetics of killing experiments demonstrated that the microemulsion caused a complete loss of viability of bacterial cells (E. coli, S. aureus and B. subtilis) in 1. min, killed over 99% A. niger and P. expansum spores and 99.9% C. albicans cells rapidly within 2. min and resulted in a complete loss of fungal viability in 5. min. The fast killing kinetics of the microemulsion was in good agreement with the transmission electron microscopy observations, indicating the antimembrane activity of the microemulsion on bacterial and fungal cells due to the disruption and dysfunction of biological membranes and cell walls. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79951575897	Molecular cloning of a PR-5 like protein gene from cherry tomato and analysis of the response of this gene to abiotic stresses	LePR-5, a putative PR5 like protein gene was amplified from a cherry tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), which encodes a precursor protein of 250 amino acid residues, and shares high degrees of homology with a number of other PR5 genes. Expression of LePR-5 in different tomato organs was analyzed with Semi-quantitative RT-PCR, showing that LePR-5 expressed at different levels in leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits. In addition, expression of LePR-5 under different abiotic stresses was carried out at different time points. Three of the four tested abiotic stimuli, ethophen, salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate, triggered a significant induction of LePR-5 after treatment. However, LePR-5 was weaker induced by abscisic acid than by others. The positive responses of LePR-5 to the three abiotic stimuli suggested that LePR-5 may play an important role in response to abiotic stresses, and it may also be involved in plant defense system against pathogens. In addition, different expression patterns between tomato fruit and seedling suggested that LePR-5 may play a distinctive role in the defensive system protecting tomato fruit and seedling. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Then, the protein concentration was determined and it was expressed at high levels up to 14.2 mg/L in the culture medium. Meanwhile, the population growth was assayed in vivo. The population growth of recombinant strain GS115/ CEC was higher than that of non-transformed strain GS115 in red Fuji apples wounds. Recombinant yeast strains GS115/CEC significantly inhibited growth of germinated P. expansum spores in vitro and inhibited decay development caused by P. expansum in apple fruits in vivo when compared with apple fruits inoculated with sterile water or the yeast strain GS115/pPIC (plasmid pPIC9k transformed in GS115).

In this method, each kind of antibodies is tagged with oligonucleotides of a specific sequence;on the other hand, complementary strands are synthesized on a solid substrate. Antibodies are subsequently immobilized onto the solid surface via a hybridization process. The feasibility of this method was first verified on magnetic beads surface. An immunochip against transgenic Bt Cry1Ac protein was further developed and the characteristics of antibody assembly were analyzed by Cy3 labeled secondary antibody tracking. The sensitivity of the formed array was tested by detecting the gradient concentrations of Bt Cry1Ac protein solutions. The result showed that the chip using this immobilization method achieved specific and uniform assembly of antibody probes, little non-specific adsorption, as well as low detection limit of 0.01-0.05 ng mL

84897037578	γ-Aminobutyric acid induces resistance against Penicillium expansum by priming of defence responses in pear fruit	The results from this study showed that treatment with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), at 100-1000 μg/ml, induced strong resistance against blue mould rot caused by Penicillium expansum in pear fruit. Moreover, the activities of five defence-related enzymes (including chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, phenylalnine ammonialyase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase) and the expression of these corresponding genes were markedly and/or promptly enhanced in the treatment with GABA and inoculation with P. expansum compared with those that were treated with GABA or inoculated with pathogen alone. In addition, the treatment of pear with GABA had little adverse effect on the edible quality of the fruit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that GABA can effectively reduce fungal disease of harvested fruit. Its mechanisms may be closely correlated with the induction of fruit resistance by priming activation and expression of defence-related enzymes and genes upon challenge with pathogen. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides T cell and NK cell, NKT cell played an important role in low incidence of GVHD during allogeneic transplantation. IL-2 and IL-15 can stimulate T cell and NK cell proliferation, survival and activation in vitro. But they exhibited different effects on the GVHD during allogeneic transplantation. In this study, we explored the different effects of exogenous IL-2 and IL-15 on the expansion of CD3

44149096248	Integrated control of postharvest blue mold decay of pears with hot water treatment and Rhodotorula glutinis	The potential of using Rhodotorula glutinis alone or in combination with hot water for the control of postharvest blue mold decay of pear fruit, and their effects on postharvest quality of fruit was investigated. Spore germination of Penicillium expansum was inhibited by hot (46 °C) water. Both hot water for 10-20 min and R. glutinis, as stand-alone treatments, reduced the incidence of blue mold decay, but complete control was not achieved by either treatment. However, a combination of hot water treatment and R. glutinis completely controlled decay of inoculated fruit. In addition, the combination of hot water treatment with R. glutinis on naturally infected, intact fruit, reduced decay from 66.7% in the control fruit to 13.3% after 15 days at 20 °C, and from 46.7 to 6.7% after 4 °C for 60 days followed by 20 °C for 15 days. None of the treatments impaired fruit quality. The combination of hot water and R. glutinis could be an alternative to synthetic fungicides for the control of postharvest blue mold decay on pears. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

44349151508	Characterization and synergistic antimicrobial activities of food-grade dilution-stable microemulsions against Bacillus subtilis	The physicochemical characterization of a food-grade glycerol monolaurate (GML)/ethanol/Tween 20/sodium lactate (SL)/water microemulsion system and the antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis have been studied in this paper. The influence of ethanol and SL on oil solubilization capability was clearly reflected in the phase behavior of these systems. The addition of ethanol in GML/Tween 20/water system greatly improved the oil solubilization and induced the formation of a U-type microemulsion system, while a transition from U-type to S-type microemulsion system was observed with the increasing concentration of sodium lactate. Two microemulsion formulations were obtained and remained stable by physical stability studies. Antimicrobial results showed that the microemulsions were effective in inhibiting the viable bacteria cells and the bacteria growth. Later it was found that the microemulsions had synergistic antimicrobial activities with a major contribution of GML and the solubilization of SL enhanced the antimicrobial effects. This work indicated that microemulsions are promising delivery vectors for antimicrobial applications in food industry. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

45849136332	Biocontrol of Botrytis cinerea in apple fruit by Cryptococcus laurentii and indole-3-acetic acid	This study evaluated the effect of a yeast antagonist Cryptococcus laurentii and a plant regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on inhibition of Botrytis cinerea infection in harvested apple fruit. The results showed that the combined treatment with C. laurentii and IAA at 20 μg/ml was a more effective approach to reduce the gray mold rot in apple wounds than the C. laurentii alone. After 4 days of incubation, gray mold incidence in the combined treatment with C. laurentii and IAA was about 18%, which was a 50% reduction in incidence compared to the treatment with C. laurentii alone. Although IAA had no direct antifungal activity against B. cinerea infection when the time interval between IAA treatment and pathogen inoculation was within 2 h, application of IAA strongly reduced gray mold infection when IAA was applied 24 h prior to inoculation with B. cinerea in apple fruit wounds. Moreover, combination of IAA and C. laurentii stimulated the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase with above 1.5-fold higher than that treatment with C. laurentii alone at 48 h. Therefore, combination of C. laurentii with IAA, which integrated the dual biological activity from the antagonistic yeast and plant regulator, might be developed to be a useful approach to control gray mold in harvested apple fruit. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

47949099853	Control of postharvest pear diseases using Rhodotorula glutinis and its effects on postharvest quality parameters	Rhodotorula glutinis was evaluated for its activity in reducing postharvest gray mold decay and blue mold decay of pear caused by Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum respectively, and in reducing natural decay development of pear fruits, as well as its effects on postharvest quality of fruits. There was a significant negative correlation between concentrations of the yeast cells and infectivity of the pathogens. At concentrations of R. glutinis at 5 × 108 CFU/ml, the gray mold decay was completely inhibited after 7 days incubation at 20 °C, while the control fruit had 100% disease incidence and 2.15 cm lesion diameter respectively, at challenged with B. cinerea spores suspension of 1 × 105 spores/ml; No completely control was got to blue mold, when pear fruits stored at 20 °C for 7 d (challenged with P. expansum spores suspension of 5 × 104 spores/ml), but the decay was distinctly prevented with 20% and 0.60 cm of disease incidence and lesion diameter respectively, while the control fruits were 100% and 2.74 cm, respectively. Rapid colonization of the yeast in wounds was observed during the first 1 d at 20 °C, and then the populations stabilized for the remaining storage period. On pear wounds kept at 4 °C, rapid colonization of the yeast in wounds was observed during the first 3 d, and then the increase in population density of R. glutinis turned slow, which continued over 6 d after application of the antagonist until it reached a high level. Then, the populations stabilized for the remaining storage period. In the test on PDA plates, R. glutinis significantly inhibit the growth of B. cinerea and P. expansum. Spore germination of pathogens in PDB was greatly controlled in the present of living yeast cell suspensions. R. glutinis significantly reduced the natural development of decay of pear following storage at 20 °C for 7 days or at 4 °C for 30 days followed by 20 °C for 5 days, and did not impair quality parameters, including mass loss, firmness, TSS, ascorbic acid or titratable acidity. Thus, the application of R. glutinis can be an alternative to chemicals for control of postharvest diseases on pear fruits. © 2008.

Washed cell suspensions of yeast controlled gray mold better than yeast in culture broth. Treatment of wounds with autoclaved cell cultures or cell-free culture filtrate did not prevent decay. Rapid colonization of the yeast in wounds was observed during the first day at 20 °C, then the populations stabilized for the remaining storage period. Spore germination and germ tube elongation of Botrytis cinerea in PDB was controlled by the living cell of R. glutinis: the percentage of spore germination of B. cinerea incubated with R. glutinis was reduced by 69.3% compared with control; similarly, the length of germ tube of B. cinerea incubated with R. glutinis was reduced by 65.8% compared with control. SA (100 μg/mL) could enhance the biocontrol activity of R. glutinis against gray mold decay in peach fruit. The application of SA and R. glutinis as stand-alone treatments did not produce significant control efficacy to natural infection of peach fruits. However, R. glutinis in combination with SA resulted in low average natural infection incidence in fruit, 16.67%, compared with 46.67% in the water-treated control fruit. SA, the yeast antagonist and the combination of them both had no significant effect on quality parameters after 7 days at 20 °C. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

51649100029	Purification and characterization of keratinase from a new Bacillus subtilis strain	The aim of this study was to purify and characterize a keratinase produced by a new isolated Bacillus subtilis KD-N2 strain. The keratinase produced by the isolate was purified using ammonium sulphate precipitation, Sephadex G-75 and DEAE (diethylaminoethyl)-Sepharose chromatographic techniques. The purified enzyme was shown to have a molecular mass of 30.5 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The optimum pH at 50 °C was 8.5 and the optimum temperature at pH 8.5 was 55 °C. The keratinase was partially inactivated by some metal ions, organic solvents and serine protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) had positive effect on the keratinase activity. Reducing agents including dithiothreitol (DTT), mercaptoethanol, L-cysteine, sodium sulphite, as well as chemicals of SDS, ammonium sulfamate and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) stimulated the enzyme activity upon a feather meal substrate. Besides feather keratin, the enzyme is active upon the soluble proteins ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein and insoluble ones as sheep wool and human hair. Calf hair, silk and collagen could not be hydrolyzed by the keratinase. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.

52049121622	Development and antifungal evaluation of a food-grade U-type microemulsion	Aims: Food-grade microemulsions have been of increasing interest to researchers as potential delivery systems for bioactive compounds. However, food-grade microemulsions are difficult to formulate and no microemulsion has been documented for antifungal purpose. The physicochemical characterization of a food-grade glycerol monolaurate (GML)/ethanol (EtOH)/Tween 80/potassium sorbate (PS)/water microemulsion system and the antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum have been studied in this paper. Methods and Results: The influence of EtOH and PS on oil solubilization capability was clearly reflected in the phase behaviour of U-type microemulsion systems. One dilution-stable formulation ME (GML/EtOH/Tween 80/PS/water = 3 : 3 : 3.5 : 10.5 : 16) was selected. After 4 days of incubation, ME showed 80%A. niger growth inhibition at 0.2% and 72%P. italicum growth inhibition at 0.1%, respectively, and a delay of conidiation of 2 days compared with the control. In the antifungal activities of the microemulsion, GML and PS made major contributions with similar antifungal activities at a GML/PS weight ratio of 1: 3.5. Conclusions: Food-grade dilution-stable microemulsions prepared with GML as oil phase for antifungal purpose are feasible and solubilization of a hydrotrope contributes to the formation of microemulsions and enhanced antifungal activities. Significance and Impact of the Study: The present report represents the first to develop a food-grade microemulsion system for antifugal purpose. © 2008 The Authors.

62249158472	Indole-3-acetic acid improves postharvest biological control of blue mold rot of apple by cryptococcus laurentii	Cryptococcus laurentii is a well-known postharvest biocontrol yeast; however, it cannot provide satisfactory levels of decay control when used alone. Here, we evaluated the effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a plant growth regulator, on the biocontrol efficacy of the yeast antagonist C. laurentii against blue mold rot caused by Penicillium expansum in apple fruit. Results showed that the addition of IAA at 20 μg/ml to suspensions of C. laurentii greatly enhanced inhibition of mold rot in apple wounds compared with that observed with C. laurentii alone. The addition of IAA at 20 μg/ml or lower did not influence the population growth of C. laurentii in wounds, but adverse effects were seen on C. laurentii when the concentration of IAA was increased to 200 μg/ml or above in vitro and in vivo. P. expansum infection in apple wounds was not inhibited when the pathogen was inoculated into the fruit wounds within 2 h after application of IAA; however, infection was reduced when inoculated more than 12 h after IAA application. Treatment of wounds with IAA at 20 μg/ml 24 h before pathogen inoculation resulted in significant inhibition of P. expansum spore germination and host infection. Application of IAA at 20 μg/ml also reduced P. expansum infection when it was applied 48 h before pathogen inoculation in the intact fruit. Thus, IAA could reinforce the biocontrol efficacy of C. laurentii in inhibiting blue mold of apple fruit by induction of the natural resistance of the fruit. © 2009 The American Phytopathological Society.

64049089658	Design of constant-current driver IC for power white LEDs	A monolithic constant-current driving integrated circuit (IC) is designed and fabricated by using CSMC 0.6um standard CMOS process to drive two power white light-emitting diode (LED) strings with 350 mA each. The output-stage power MOSFETs are designed with CMOS bent-gate structure, and it makes possible the compatible integration of power device with conventional CMOS signal processing circuits. In the typical operating circuit with single power supply, it is able to supply 3W power white LED, and the input voltage range is 4 V to 7 V. When 5 V single voltage supply changes by 10% or ambient temperature varies from 10°C to 90°C, the variance of the driving current can be controlled within 1.42% and 1.75%, while the currents of the two paths are mismatched within 2.84% and 3.15% respectively.

A linear relation between junction temperature and emission peak wavelength was found for AlGaInP based on red and yellow on LEDs. For the InGaN+YAG white LED, the junction temperature is inversely proportional with the ratio of the total radiation power (W) to the blue radiation power (B) W/B. The experiment results reveal that spectral characteristics measurement method is a good approach for determining junction temperatures of AlGaInP based and phosphor-converted LEDs.

The results showed that ozone signi?cantly decreased the incidence of gray mold rot in strawberry fruits and inhibited the growth of B. cinerea in vivo and in vitro. After three-day storage, the gray mold rot incidence of strawberry fruits that treated with the combination of ozone and C. laurentii was 29.63%, which was significantly lower than that of the control (70.37%) or the treatments of ozone and C. laurentii as single use (48.15% and 44.44% respectively). The population of the yeast in wounded fruits increased remarkably after inoculation at 20°C or 4°C, and it remained at a high level. The treatments of ozone alone or in combination with C. laurentii resulted in a transient increase in the activities of polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonialyase, catalase, lipoxgenase and β-1,3-glucanase, and restrained the increase in the activity of lipoxgenase in strawberry fruits.

67649770225	Identification of differentially expressed genes from cherry tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum) after application of the biological control yeast Cryptococcus laurentii	Postharvest decay of fruit may be controlled by the use of a variety of diverse microorganisms acting as biocontrol agents, but the mechanisms associated with control are not fully understood. In order to gain insight into the action of antagonistic microorganisms on fruit, a forward subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) cDNA library was constructed. SSH was performed with cDNA from cherry tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum) inoculated with water as the "driver" and cDNA from tomato fruit inoculated by Cryptococcus laurentii as the "tester". A total of 150 clones in the SSH library were sequenced and found to represent 50 unigenes. BLASTX results reveal that 35 cDNAs had significant sequence homologies with known sequences in the NCBI database. The identified cDNAs encode proteins involved in cellular processes such as primary metabolism, signal transduction, defense and responses to pathogens, stress-related, cell wall assembly, and photosynthesis and transcription related sequences. Six cDNA clones were selected for temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR. The results show that a number of transcripts encoding proteins/enzymes which are known to be up-regulated under some biotic and abiotic stresses are also up-regulated after the application of biological control yeast to cherry tomato fruit. The expression of these proteins may play a role in increasing fruit resistance to postharvest pathogen infection. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

69249118593	LFA-1 and CD2 synergize for the Erk1/2 activation in the natural killer (NK) cell immunological synapse	Natural killer (NK) cell recognition and formation of a conjugate with target cells, followed by intracellular signal pathway activation and degradation of cytolytic granules, are essential for NK cell cytotoxicity. In this study, NK92 cells were used to investigate synapse formation and subsequent signaling after binding to the target cell. The binding rate of the NK92-target cell was associated with NK92 cell cytotoxicity. Confocal results showed that adhesion molecules, LFA-1 (CD11a) and CD2, accumulated at the interface of the NK92-K562 contact. Ligation with K562 cells activated the Erk1/2 signal pathway of NK92 cells. The blocking of the NK-target conjugate by EDTA or anti-CD11a or/ and anti-CD2 antibody decreased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and NK cell cytotoxicity. Inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by the chemical inhibitor U0126 suppressed the cytolytic activity of NK92 cells, but had no effect on NK-target conjugate formation. Thus, conjugate formation of the NK92-target cell was prerequisite to NK cell activation, and subsequent signal transduction was also required for NK cell cytotoxicity. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

70349782018	Antimicrobial activity of a food-grade fully dilutable microemulsion against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus	Microemulsions are colloidal nanodispersions of oil and water stabilized by an interfacial film of surfactant molecules, typically in conjunction with a cosurfactant. There is a limited number of reports in the literature on microemulsion use for antimicrobial purposes. The physicochemical characterization of a food-grade fully dilutable microemulsion system with glycerol monolaurate (GML) as oil, organic acids as cosurfactant, Tween 80 as surfactant, and the antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus have been studied in this paper. The influence of organic acids on oil solubilization was clearly reflected in the phase behavior of these systems. Propionic acid demonstrated the greatest capability to improve the oil solubilization among the tested linear and nonlinear chain organic acids and contributed to the formation of U-type microemulsion systems. One microemulsion formulation with an average particle size of 8 nm was selected, the composition is GML/propionic acid/Tween 80/water = 3:9:8:12. The kinetics of killing experiments demonstrated that the undiluted microemulsion caused a complete loss of viability of E. coli or S. aureus cells in 1 min and still had effective bactericidal effects even when diluted, more than 99% viable E. coli cells were killed within 15 min and a complete loss of viability was achieved at 45 min while more than 99% viable S. aureus cells were killed within 30 min and a complete loss of viability was achieved at 60 min in the presence of the 10-fold diluted microemulsion. The fast killing kinetics of the ten-fold serial dilutions of microemulsions were in good agreement with the mode of action studies, indicating that the interaction between the antimicrobial microemulsions and bacterial membranes significantly decreased the bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and induced the quick release of 260 nm absorbing materials. This work suggests the potential use of food-grade fully dilutable microemulsions for antimicrobial purposes in beverages or seafood products. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The weight ratio of the formulated microemulsion is glycerol monolaurate (GML)/propionic acid/Tween 80/sodium benzoate (SB)/ water=3:9:14:14:24. Results of anti-yeast activity on solid medium by agar diffusion method showed that the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion at 4.8 mg/ml was comparable to that of natamycin at 0.1 mg/ml as positive control. Results of anti-yeast activity in liquid medium by broth dilution method showed that the growth of both C. albicans and S. cerevisiae was completely inhibited when the liquid medium containing 106 cfu/ml was treated with 1.2 mg/ml micro- emulsion, which was determined as minimum fungicidal concentration. The kinetics of killing results showed that the microemulsion killed over 90% yeast cells rapidly within 15 min and caused a complete loss of viability in 120 min. Among the components, SB and GML had a similar anti- yeast activity, followed by propionic acid, while Tween 80 exhibited no activity and could not enhance the anti-yeast activities of these components, and it was revealed that the anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion was attributed to a combination of propionic acid, GML, and SB. The anti-yeast activity of the microemulsion was in good agreement with the leakage of 260-nm absorbing materials and the observation of transmission electron microscopy, indicating that the microemulsion induced the disruption and dysfunction of the cell membrane. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

77957328230	Up-regulation of NKG2F receptor, a functionally unknown killer receptor, of human natural killer cells by interleukin-2 and interleukin-15	The NKG2 family receptors are C-type lectin, type II transmembrane molecules, and play important roles in regulation of natural killer (NK) cell functions against tumor and virus. NKG2F is a new member of NKG2 family, and may possibly associate with DAP 12 to activate NK cells. Since lacking available antibody against human NKG2F, the features of NKG2F expression on NK cells remains unclear. In this study, human NKG2F recombinant expression in E. coli was carried out by using pET-28a with a hexahistidine (6X His) tag and a thrombin digestion sequence to the N-terminus of the recombinant protein NKG2F. IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside) induction resulted in high expression of recombinant NKG2F protein, which was then purified and identified by anti-His Western blotting and LC-MS/MS. Polyclonal antibody was produced by immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant NKG2F, and then used to detect NKG2F in Western blotting and flow cytometry. Our results demonstrated that NKG2F was expressed only by PBMCs but not by human NK cell lines such as NKL and YT at mRNA level. It was observed that NKG2F was expressed on surface of human blood NK cells, and may be up-regulated at mRNA level and protein level after IL-2 or IL-15 stimulation.

Keissl in vitro and in vivo as fumigant and contact treatments. Thyme oil possessed great fumigant and contact toxicity against A. alternata at different concentrations in vitro. Irreversible inhibition of fungal growth could be caused by exposure to 500 μL/L thyme oil as a fumigant for 6 and 12 days. The spores of A. alternata were completely suppressed 6 h after incubation in potato dextrose broth (PDB) by 2000 μL/L of thyme oil. The thyme oil as a fumigant at 66.7 μL/L showed a significant inhibition effect on A. alternata of cherry tomatoes stored at 25 °C for 5 days. Thyme oil at 500 μL/L showed a significant contact inhibition effect on A. alternata of cherry tomatoes stored at 25 °C for 3 days. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79955042186	Antibacterial activities of a food-grade dilution-stable microemulsion	The antibacterial activities of a food-grade dilution-stable microemulsion, which has an oil phase of glycerol monolaurate (5% w/w), propionic acid (15%) and a surfactant phase of Tween 80 (21%), sodium benzoate (21%), have been studied in this work. By broth dilution method, the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of the microemulsion against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were achieved at 250, 500 and 250ppm, respectively. The bactericidal kinetic results showed that over 90% viable bacterial cells were killed within 5min by the microemulsion at the concentrations determined by MBC; a nearly 4 log reduction in S. aureus or B. subtilis titer was obtained while a complete loss of viability was achieved against E. coli in 60min. The fast-killing kinetics of the microemulsion was in good agreement with the cell surface hydrophobicity, membrane permeability experiments and the observation of transmission electron microscopy. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79953100069	Biocontrol of postharvest gray and blue mold decay of apples with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and possible mechanisms of action	The efficacy of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa against postharvest gray mold, blue mold and natural decay development of apples and the possible mechanisms involved were investigated. The decay incidence and lesion diameter of gray mold and blue mold of apples treated by R. mucilaginosa were significantly reduced compared with the control fruits, and the higher concentration of R. mucilaginosa, the better the efficacy of the biocontrol. R. mucilaginosa also significantly reduced the natural decay development of apples following storage at 20 °C for 35. days or at 4 °C for 45. days followed by 20 °C for 15. days. Germination and survival of spores of Penicillium expansum and Botrytis cinerea were markedly inhibited by R. mucilaginosa in an in vitro test. Rapid colonization of the yeast in apple wounds was observed whether stored at 20 °C or 4 °C. In apples, the activities of peroxidase (POD) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO) were significantly induced and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde (MDA) content) was highly inhibited by R. mucilaginosa treatment compared with those of the control fruits. All these results indicated that R. mucilaginosa has great potential for development of commercial formulations to control postharvest pathogens on fruits. Its modes of action were based on competition for space and nutrients with pathogens, inducement of activities of defense-related enzymes such as POD, PPO and inhibition of lipid peroxidation (MDA content) of apples, so as to enhance the resistance and delay the ripening and senescence of apples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960126972	RETRACTED ARTICLE: Keratin degradation and dehairing application of keratinase from a new Bacillus subtilis strain	Feathers and other keratin containing material had not been widely utilized and lead environmental pollution. Feathers are composed of over 90% keratins and are potential feed protein resource. Microbial degradation by keratinase of feathers will be beneficial to the environment and could contribute to the feed industry. Keratinase can hydrolyze keratin-containing materials such as feathers and hair and keratinases have been utilized in feed, leather and pharmaceutical industries. Detailed mechanisms of keratindegradation have not been elucidated and keratinases play important role in the keratin degradation. A new isolated Bacillus subtilis strain high keratinase activity could degrade keratin from feather, hair and silk showed application potential. In order to estimate the application potential of keratinae produced by the new strain, the optimal feather degradation conditions and dehairing capabilities were studied. The results showed that 10 and 15 g/L feather content, initial pH value 8.5, 32°C, 2% inoculum size, 20 h inoculum age got the optimal feather degradation rate; the feather degradation rate got 45% and 68% after 121 and 128°C treatments for 20 min; the keratinase cultivated in feather substrates had good abilities to dehair the calf and goat skin in 8-12 and 12-16 hours respectively. © 2011 IEEE.

80052397183	Photonic crystal cavity with one-way rotating state and its coupling with photonic crystal waveguide	A photonic crystal (PhC) cavity formed by a closed interface between a dielectric PhC and a magnetooptical (MO) material PhC is proposed and analyzed theoretically. It is shown that such a cavity can support one-way rotating modes and thus the modal fields at different frequencies have a similar pattern. The loss effect of MO material is taken into consideration for the solution of quality-factors for the cavity. The coupling between a cavity with one-way state and a PhC waveguide is also studied through numerical simulations. Simulation results show that cavity mode only interacts with the waveguide mode propagating in a particular direction. This work paves the way to control waveguide-cavity interaction. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

80053057581	Enhancement of defense responses by oligandrin against botrytis cinerea in tomatoes	Oligandrin is an elicitin-like protein with a molecular mass of ~10 kDa secreted by Pythium oligandrum. Here, the effect of oligandrin on defense response against Botrytis cinerea in tomato leaves is reported. Tomato seedlings were pretreated with 5 ml oligandrin (10 μg/ml) by root submerging and then inoculated with B. cinerea. Disease severity was subsequently evaluated and compared with the control. Results indicate that oligandrin pretreatment reduced disease index by 78.6% on day 7 after inoculation. On day 3 after inoculation, oligandrin pretreatment caused up-regulation of peroxidases (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in leaves by 20.0, 5.56 and 32.88%, compared with inoculation without oligandrin pretreatment, respectively. On day 5 after inoculation, POD, PPO and PAL were up-regulated by 46.24, 32.61 and 57.14%, respectively. 24 h after the treatment with oligandrin, the expression of pathogenesis-related protein (PRs) genes, PR-2a (extracellular β-1,3-glucanase) and PR-3a (extracellular chitinase), were up-regulated by 7.75 fold and 4.56 fold in tomato leaves, compared with the control, respectively. The expression of LeERF2, a member of ethylene-dependent signaling pathway, was also significantly elevated by 7.41 fold. At the same time, the expression of ethylene receptor homologue PR-6 protein was also induced. These results indicate that oligandrin can induce resistance to B. cinerea in tomatoes, and the induction of resistance involves the activation of the ethylene-dependent signaling pathway. Oligandrin is potentially useful for gray mould prevention in tomato crop. © 2011 Academic Journals.

80053470632	Impact of ellipsometric parameters measurement error on measurement accuracy of thin film parameters	The error relationship between ellipsometric parameters and thin film parameters (i. e., film thickness and refractive index) contained implicitly in the ellipsometric equation of a transparent homogenous dielectric thin film was analyzed based on the error transfer formula and the inverse functions theorem. Partial derivatives of ellipsometric parameters to thin film parameters at nominal thickness and refractive index were found so as to reverse their partial derivatives to ellipsometric parameters. Relationship curves of the thickness error as well as the refractive index error versus the ellipsometric parameters measurement error under different incident angles were drawn. The curves show that the above two errors caused by the ellipsometric parameters measurement error aren't the minimum at a same incident angle. The optimal incident angle corresponding to their respective minimum error varies with the incident wavelength, the nominal thickness, the nominal refractive index and the substrate refractive index. The measurement accuracy can be improved effectively if the measured thickness and refractive index under their respective optimal incident angles are taken as thin film parameters measurements. The above analysis is in accordance with experimental results measured on a laser ellipsometer. The above method has certain reference to the analysis of multiple variables error relationship and the optimal selection of their values in other transcendental equations.

80054988302	HMBOX1, homeobox transcription factor, negatively regulates interferon-γ production in natural killer cells	HMBOX1 is a new member of homeobox family and predicted to be a transcriptional repressor, its function in NK cells is completely unclear. Previously we found that overexpression of HMBOX1 downregulated mRNA level of IFN-γ in NK cells during our gene screening work. In present study, we investigate the relationship between HMBOX1 and IFN-γ in detail. Firstly, we describe the properties of HMBOX1 gene transcription in activated NK cells, and found that the transcriptional levels of HMBOX1 were significantly decreased in NK cells after activated by IL-2, IL-15 and IL-12, which was opposite to the expression profile of IFN-γ. Subsequently, over-expression of HMBOX1 significantly inhibited the expression and production of IFN-γ in NK cells in response to the stimulation of tumor cell K562 or PMA/ionomycin. Additionally, by luciferase reporter assay, HMBOX1 displayed suppressive effect on the transcription activity of IFN-γ promoter. These findings indicated that HMBOX1 may function as a negative regulator of IFN-γ in NK cells. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

80053637348	Statistical media optimization for the biomass production of postharvest biocontrol yeast rhodosporidium paludigenum	A cane molasses-based medium for the biomass production of biocontrol agent Rhodosporidium paludigenum was statistically optimized. Molasses concentration (after pretreatment), yeast extract, and initial pH were identified by the Plackett-Burman design to show significant influence on the biomass production. The three factors were further optimized by central composite design and response-surface methodology. The statistical analysis indicated the optimum values of the variables were 89.98g/L for cane molasses, 2.35g/L for yeast extract and an initial pH of 8.48. The biomass yield at the optimal culture achieved 15.89g/L in flask fermentation, which was 2.1 times higher than that at the initial NYDB medium. In a 10-L fermenter, 18.97g/L of biomass was obtained after 36hr of cultivation. Moreover, the biocontrol efficacy of the yeast was investigated after culture optimization. The results showed the yeast harvested in the optimal medium maintained its initial biocontrol properties by reducing the percen age of decayed apples to below 20%.

80055024892	Preparation and functional identification of a monoclonal antibody against the recombinant soluble human NKp30 receptor	NKp30 is an important activating receptor of human natural killer (NK) cells that participates in NK cell activation and cytotoxicity against tumor and infected cells. To study the function of NKp30, anti-human NKp30 monoclonal antibody was prepared. The human NKp30 ectodomain (rhNKp30) was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and refolded using the dilution method. The refolded rhNKp30 was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The activity of soluble rhNKp30 was confirmed by flow cytometry and NK cytotoxicity assays. Four hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies against rhNKp30 were obtained. One of the monoclonal antibodies, designated as "3G5", was highly specific and could be used in western blotting, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and flow cytometry assays. The preparation of soluble rhNKp30 and a monoclonal antibody against NKp30 may provide useful tools for further functional studies of human NKp30. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

80755143731	Biocontrol of fungal decay of citrus fruit by Pichia pastoris recombinant strains expressing cecropin A	Cecropin A gene was cloned into the expression vector pPIC9k and was successfully expressed in methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris GS115. The yeast had effective antimicrobial activity on Geotrichum citri-aurantii spores by the thiazolyl blue (MTT) assay. There was no large growth difference between nontransformed strain GS115 and recombinant strain GS115/CEC in citrus fruits wounds. Yeast transformants could significantly inhibit growth of germinated G. citri-aurantii spores and inhibited decay development caused by G. citri-aurantii in citrus fruits compared to the yeast strain GS115/pPIC. This study demonstrates the potential of expression of an antifungal peptide in yeast for enhancing suppression of postharvest diseases and represents a new approach for the biological control of postharvest diseases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84861166433	Analysis of tomato MicroRNAs expression profile induced by Cucumovirus and Tobamovirus infections	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs that affect the morphological and physiological development of plants. In recent years, there is accumulating evidence that miRNAs are involved in defense mechanism of host plants. Therefore, investigating the alteration of miRNAs expression profiles after virus infection will provide new insights for understanding the sophisticated virus-host plant interaction. The current miRNA sequence database (miRBase) contains more than 1669 mature plant miRNAs across 25 species, but few tomato miRNAs are reported. Here we created a microarray suitable for detection of plant miRNAs based on the conservative character of miRNAs, and a total of 105 conserved plant miRNAs were detected from tomato leaf tissues. Among them, 85% of the detected miRNAs showed significant expression alterations when infected by different strains of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and N5 strain of tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). Combination with their symptoms development, interferences of CMV 2b protein and alleviated/aggravated satellite RNA on host miRNA pathway were discussed, and the differences in interference mechanisms between CMV and ToMV on host miRNA pathway were compared. Our results represent the comprehensive investigation of tomato miRNAs on a genome scale thus far and provide information to study the interaction between plant viruses and host plants.

Under the optimal condition of ethanol addition, the maximal Val-A production titer reached 18. g/L, which increased by 60% compared to the control. To provide an insight into cell response to ethanol, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene transcription and enzyme activity were determined. Intracellular ROS as the molecular signal was increased in the ethanol condition. Global regulators afsR and glnR were involved in regulation of Val-A biosynthesis, and the transcription of eight Val-A structural genes was enhanced. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was enhanced while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was inhibited. A signal transduction cascade from cell signal response to activated transcription of Val-A biosynthetic genes and enhanced antibiotic production is proposed. The information can be helpful for the improvement of large-scale fermentation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862565201	Interaction between two one-way waveguides	The interaction between two (parallel) one-way waveguides formed by photonic crystals is investigated theoretically. It is shown that when the two waveguides support modes propagating in opposite directions, they can effectively interact with each other only within a narrow guiding region where their propagation constants are nearly zero. In this coupling window, the waveguides are contra-directionally coupled and the efficiency grows monotonously with the coupling length, reaching 100% as the coupling length is large enough. When the one-way waveguides support the modes propagating in the same direction, they may be efficiently coupled through the whole guiding regime, and their coupling exhibits the same behavior as the conventional uniform waveguides. The coupling between the one-way waveguides is first analyzed with the coupled-mode approximation and then verified by rigorous numerical simulation. © 2012 IEEE.

84862575790	Important role for NKp30 in synapse formation and activation of NK cells	Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in host defense against viral infections and tumor cells. NK cells require contact with target cells and must subsequently form an NK cell immunological synapse (NKIS). The NKIS represents the interface formed between NK cells and their target cells via receptor recognition and adhesion molecule binding, and it is essential for NK cell cytotoxicity, which is mediated through degranulation and release of cytolytic enzymes. In this study, NKp30-mediated signaling and the role of NKp30 in the formation of the NKIS were investigated. The results from confocal microscopy studies showed that the activating receptor, NKp30, and the adhesion molecule, LFA-1 (CD11a), accumulated at the interface between NK92 cells, which are a human NK cell line, and HeLa cells, which are a human tumor cell line (NK92-HeLa). Blockade of NKp30 inhibited NK cell degranulation, cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion but did not affect the conjugation between NK and target cells. Additionally, ligation with HeLa cells activated the Erk1/2 signaling pathway in NK92 cells, and blockade of NKp30 decreased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Therefore, NKp30 is a triggering receptor downstream of adhesion and plays an important role in NK cell activation, degranulation and cytotoxicity. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Various shapes of the pillars are analyzed, and it is shown that the pillar shape only has weak influence on the dispersion of spoof SPPs. However, the loss of spoof SPPs is closely dependent on the pillar shape. It is also shown that spoof SPPs on textured surfaces with pillars can exhibit much better confinement than those on pierced surfaces with holes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84862907862	Biochemical characterization of indole prenyltransferases: Filling the lastgapofprenylation positions bya5-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase from aspergillus clavatus	The putative prenyltransferase gene ACLA-031240 belonging to the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase superfamily was identified in the genome sequence of Aspergillus clavatus and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The soluble His-tagged protein EAW08391 was purified to near homogeneity and used for biochemical investigation with diverse aromatic substrates in the presence of different prenyl diphosphates. It has shown that in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the recombinant enzyme accepted very well simple indole derivatives with L-tryptophan as the best substrate. Product formation was also observed for tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides but with much lower conversion yields. In contrast, no product formation was detected in the reaction mixtures of L-tryptophan with geranyl or farnesyl diphosphate. Structure elucidation of the enzyme products by NMR and MS analyses proved unequivocally the highly regiospecific regular prenylation at C-5 of the indole nucleus of the simple indole derivatives. EAW08391 was therefore termed 5-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase, and it filled the last gap in the toolbox of indole prenyltransferases regarding their prenylation positions. K

84863264452	Simulation of conoscopic interference in uniaxial crystal using optical software-advanced system analysis program	In order to simulate conoscopic interference in uniaxial crystal under different optical axis directions, beam divergence angles, crystal thicknesses or incident wavelengths, a method of writing and running an Advanced System Analysis Program (ASAP) command script was adopted. Functions of main commands were as follows: define geometries and optical properties of a polarizer, a crystal, an analyzer and a plane for observing interferograms. Create a set of divergence Gaussian beams and specify their coherence and propagation. Trace rays, calculate and display the exact complex field energy distribution characteristic on the observing plane. Simulation results show that, when the optical axis is perpendicular to the crystal surface, the interferogram consists of concentric interference fringes centered on the optical axis and is separated by a cross. When the optical axis is parallel to the crystal surface, the interferogram consists of two sets of hyperbola interference fringes with their symmetrical axis separately perpendicular and parallel to the optical axis. Their fringe densities both increase from inside to outside. When the optical axis is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the crystal surface, characteristics of the interference fringe vary with the specific directions of the optical axis. Once increase the beam divergence angle and the crystal thickness, or reduce the incident wavelength, fringes of the interferogram will move toward inside with their numbers increasing, and vice versa. The interferogram appearing when the polarizer is perpendicular to the analyzer is complementary to that appearing when the polarizer is parallel to the analyzer.

84866180198	In vitro and in vivo antifungal activity of a water-dilutable cassia oil microemulsion against Geotrichum citri-aurantii	Background: Recently, food-grade microemulsions have been of increasing interest to researchers and have shown great potential in industrial applications. In this study a food-grade water-dilutable microemulsion system with cassia oil as oil, ethanol as cosurfactant, Tween 20 as surfactant and water was developed and its antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo against Geotrichum citri-aurantii was assessed. Results: The phase diagram results confirmed the feasibility of forming a water-dilutable microemulsion based on cassia oil. One microemulsion formulation, cassia oil/ethanol/Tween 20 = 1:3:6 (w/w/w), was selected with the capability to undergo full dilution with water. The average particle size was 6.3 nm. The in vitro antifungal experiments showed that the microemulsion inhibited fungal growth on solid medium and prevented arthroconidium germination in liquid medium and that cassia oil had stronger activity when encapsulated in the microemulsion. The in vivo antifungal experiments indicated that the water-dilutable microemulsion was effective in preventing postharvest diseases of citrus fruits caused by G. citri-aurantii. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest a promising utilisation of water-dilutable microemulsions based on essential oils for the control of postharvest diseases. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

84866933028	Exome sequencing identifies MVK mutations in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis	Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited epidermal keratinization disorder whose etiology remains unclear. We performed exome sequencing in one unaffected and two affected individuals from a DSAP family. The mevalonate kinase gene (MVK) emerged as the only candidate gene located in previously defined linkage regions after filtering against existing SNP databases, eight HapMap exomes and 1000 Genomes Project data and taking into consideration the functional implications of the mutations. Sanger sequencing in 57 individuals with familial DSAP and 25 individuals with sporadic DSAP identified MVK mutations in 33% and 16% of these individuals (cases), respectively. All 14 MVK mutations identified in our study were absent in 676 individuals without DSAP. Our functional studies in cultured primary keratinocytes suggest that MVK has a role in regulating calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation and could protect keratinocytes from apoptosis induced by type A ultraviolet radiation. Our results should help advance the understanding of DSAP pathogenesis. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, C4 gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the association and the possible phenotype significance remain to be determined intensely in the Chinese population. This study was designed to validate the distribution of C4 GCNs in Chinese Han and the correlation between C4 GCNs and SLE using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 924 SLE patients and 1,007 controls. The results presented distribution of C4 GCNs in healthy populations and also showed that lower C4 GCN was a risk factor for SLE and higher C4 GCN was a protective factor against the disease susceptibility, which was similar to the report in the Caucasian population. Furthermore, we found the association between C4A GCN and disease subphenotypes of arthritis with SLE. We conclude that the association of C4 GCN with SLE was replicated in Chinese Han population, which highlighted the importance of C4 in SLE pathogenesis of diverse populations. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84868611680	Andrographolide induces autophagic cell death in human liver cancer cells through cyclophilin D-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore	Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide and about half of the patients with liver cancer require adjuvant therapy after surgical resection. Therefore, development of novel agents to eradicate cancer cells may constitute a viable approach to treat patients with liver cancer. Andrographolide, a diterpenoid lactone isolated from Andrographis paniculata, is known to possess potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and antiviral properties. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of andrographolide on human liver cancer cells and explored the cell death mechanism. Andrographolide induced a cell death distinct from apoptosis in multiple human liver cancer cells. The death was characterized by autophagy as evidenced by the accumulation of LC3 II and autophagosomes, and the formation of puncta GFP-LC3. This autophagy as well as cytotoxicity caused by andrographolide could be effectively prevented by 3-methyladenine (a chemical inhibitor of autophagy). Mechanistic study indicated that andrographolide induced autophagic cell death by disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and elevation of reactive oxygen species, which were correlated with mitochondrial permeability transition pore Inhibition of cyclophilin D (a component of MPTP) by cyclosporin A or abrogation of its expression by small interfering RNA significantly suppressed the cytotoxicity of andrographolide, suggesting that cyclophilin D may play an important role in mediating andrographolide-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, our findings unveil a novel mechanism of drug action by andrographolide in liver cancer cells and suggest that andrographolide may represent a promising novel agent in the treatment of liver cancer. © The Author 2012.

84870282813	Exome sequencing identifies a COL14A1 mutation in a large Chinese pedigree with punctate palmoplantar keratoderma	Background: Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPPK) is a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder characterised by numerous hyperkeratotic papules irregularly distributed on the palms and soles. To date, no causal gene for this disease has been identified. Methods: We performed exome sequencing analysis of four affected individuals and two unaffected controls from one Chinese PPPK family where disease locus was mapped at 8q24.13-8q24.21 by our previous linkage analysis. Results: We identified a novel heterozygous mutation in COL14A1 gene (c.4505C→T (p.Pro1502Leu)), which located within the linkage region that we previously identified for PPPK. The mutation was shared by the four affected individuals, but not for the two controls of the family. Sanger sequencing confirmed this mutation in another four cases from this family. This mutation was invisible in the normal controls of this family as well as the additional 676 unrelated normal controls and 781 patients with other disease. The shared COL14A1 mutation, p.Pro1502Leu, is a missense substitution at a highly conserved amino acid residue across multiple species. Conclusions: The power of combining exome sequencing and linkage information in the study of genetics of autosomal dominant disorders, even in simplex cases, has been demonstrated. Our results suggested that COL14A1 would be a casual gene for PPPK, which was helpful for advancing us on understanding of the pathogenesis of PPPK.

84871756732	Highly efficient photonic-crystal splitters based on one-way waveguiding	Magneto-optical and regular photonic crystals with triangular lattice are designed to construct one-way waveguides. Accordingly, two types of efficient beam splitters with one-way input channels are proposed and investigated. One of the proposed beam splitters is a 1 × 2 splitter, which achieves 50/50 splitting based on the structural symmetry. Since both output channels are one-way waveguides, this splitter is immune to interferences at the output ends. The other is a 1 × 3 beam splitter, in which one output channel is a regular waveguide and the others are one-way waveguides. It is shown that the 1 × 3 splitter can provide equal splitting ratios in the guiding band if defects with proper parameters are introduced in the splitting region. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

84872012648	Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation of EPS8L3 in Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis	Background: Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis (MUHH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by coarse, wiry, twisted hair developed in early childhood and subsequent progressive hair loss. MUHH is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. No gene in 1p21.1-1q21.3 region responsible for MUHH has been identified. Methods: Exome sequencing was performed on two affected subjects, who had normal vertex hair and modest alopecia, and one unaffected individual from a four-generation MUHH family of which our previous linkage study mapped the MUHH locus on chromosome 1p21.1-1q21.3. Results: We identified a missense mutation in EPS8L3 (NM_024526.3: exon2: c.22G->A:p.Ala8Thr) within 1p21.1-1q21.3. Sanger sequencing confirmed the cosegregation of this mutation with the disease phenotype in the family by demonstrating the presence of the heterozygous mutation in all the eight affected and absence in all the seven unaffected individuals. This mutation was found to be absent in 676 unrelated healthy controls and 781 patients of other disease from another unpublished project of our group. Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that EPS8L3 is a causative gene for MUHH, which was helpful for advancing us on understanding of the pathogenesis of MUHH. Our study also has further demonstrated the effectiveness of combining exome sequencing with linkage information for identifying Mendelian disease genes.

84875751633	1 × 2 beam splitter with high efficiency based on nonreciprocal photonic crystal waveguide	This paper presents a new method for designing efficient 1 × 2 beam splitter in two-dimensional triangular lattice photonic crystals (PhCs). The proposed splitter is based on the one-way edge mode of gyromagnetic PhC, thus can prevent scattering losses even when there are defects or obstacles in its channels. The incident electromagnetic wave can be evenly split into two output channels as long as structural symmetry is kept in a small area around the Y-junction. The loss effect of gyromagnetic material on the splitting behavior is examined. Moreover, power ratio between the two outputs can be tuned by introducing a defect at a proper position in the splitter. The advantages of the proposed splitter have been validated through numerical simulations. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

84877612610	Terahertz Plasmonic Microcavity with High Quality Factor and Ultrasmall Mode Volume	In this paper, the characteristics of a novel terahertz plasmonic microcavity consisting of a circular hole and a coaxial (metallic) cylindrical core machined on a planar metal surface is theoretically investigated. It is shown that such a structure can sustain plasmonic modes, whose resonant wavelengths are much larger than the hole diameter and fields tightly localized within the cavity. For this cavity, both high quality factor and ultrasmall mode volume can be achieved in the terahertz range. As this type of microcavity is particularly compatible with planar technology, it has promising applications in the miniaturization and integration of terahertz optical components. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84877615435	Dietary supplementation with purified mulberry (Morus australis Poir) anthocyanins suppresses body weight gain in high-fat diet fed C57BL/6 mice	We present our experiment about adding anthocyanins to the daily food of mice. Three kinds of antho-cyanins (cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside and pelargonidin-3-glucoside) purified from Chinese mulberry (Morus australis Poir) were evaluated for suppressing body weight gain of the male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). The results from a 12-week experiment show that consumption of purified mulberry anthocyanins (MACN) of 40 or 200 mg/kg can significantly inhibit body weight gain, reduce the resistance to insulin, lower the size of adipocytes, attenuate lipid accumulation and decrease the leptin secretion. Thus, dietary supplementation with MACN can protect against body weight gain of the diet-induced obese mice. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84878237423	Myricitrin protects against peroxynitrite-mediated DNA damage and cytotoxicity in astrocytes	Peroxynitrite, a potent oxidising and nitrating species, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This study was undertaken to investigate the protective effect of myricitrin on per-oxynitrite-mediated toxicity and the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that the presence of myricitrin was found to significantly inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated DNA damage. EPR spectroscopy demonstrated that myricitrin potently diminished the DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct signal from peroxynitrite. Further study showed that glutathione (GSH) depletion caused by peroxynitrite can be effectively prevented by pre-incubation of astrocytes with myricitrin. Moreover, co-incubation of astrocytes with myricitrin and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) eliminated the myricitrin-induced GSH increase. In contrast, co-incubation of myricitrin with BSO slightly protected astrocytes against cytotoxicity and DNA damage mediated by peroxynitrite. These results revealed that myricitrin can protect against perox-ynitrite-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity, which might have implications for myricitrin-mediated neuroprotection. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that large magnetic-field-induced (MFI) bandgap is obtainable by optimizing the parameters of the PhC. The interface between a PhC with MFI bandgap and air may support unidirectional or bidirectional propagating edge modes, or even no mode, closely depending on the boundary shape of the truncated PhC. The transmission property of one-way mode sustained by the gyromagnetic PhC boundary is discussed through numerical simulation. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

It is generally considered to be a polygenic heritable trait. Several susceptibility genes/loci, such as AR/EDA2R, HDAC9 and 20p11, have been identified as being involved in its development in European populations. In this study, we aim to validate whether these loci are also associated with AGA in the Chinese Han population.Methods:We genotyped 16 previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 445 AGA cases and 546 healthy controls using the Sequenom iPlex platform.

84883294272	Preharvest application of antagonistic yeast Rhodosporidium paludigenum induced resistance against postharvest diseases in mandarin orange	Preharvest application of biocontrol agents has been employed as a preferred strategy to minimize a wide range of postharvest decays. Rhodosporidium paludigenum as a novel biocontrol yeast significantly inhibited the development of various postharvest fruit diseases. However, whether preharvest treatment with R. paludigenum might suppress postharvest pathogens has not been investigated. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of preharvest applications of R. paludigenum against postharvest diseases in mandarin orange. Our results showed that preharvest applications of R. paludigenum significantly reduced postharvest decays of mandarin orange caused by. Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum, by 20.8% and 30.7% reduction in disease percentage, and by 14.6% and 37.3% reduction in disease severity, respectively. The population growth of R. paludigenum on the mandarin orange surface did not show any significant changes compared with the initial concentration during 20. days of storage after harvest. Moreover, it was found that the activities of some defense-related enzymes, comprising β-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase, increased significantly in response to preharvest application of R. paludigenum. In addition, preharvest treatment of R. paludigenum did not impair fruit quality during postharvest storage. Therefore, the preharvest application of yeast antagonist R. paludigenum would be a useful biocontrol strategy to reduce the fungal diseases of harvested mandarin orange. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84884782663	CRACC-CRACC Interaction between Kupffer and NK Cells Contributes to Poly I:C/D-GalN Induced Hepatitis	CD2-like receptor activating cytotoxic cells (CRACC) is known as a critical activating receptor of natural killer (NK) cells. We have previously reported that NK cells contribute to Poly I:C/D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced fulminant hepatitis. Since natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) is considered critical but not the only activating receptor for NK cells, we investigated the role of CRACC in this model. We found that CRACC was abundant on hepatic NK cells but with low expression levels on Kupffer cells under normal conditions. Expression of CRACC on NK cells and Kupffer cells was remarkably upregulated after poly I:C injection. Hepatic CRACC mRNA levels were also upregulated in Poly I:C/D-GalN-treated mice, and correlated positively with the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. CRACC expression on Kupffer cells was specifically silenced by nano-particle encapsulated siRNA in vivo, which significantly reduced Poly I:C/D-GalN-induced liver injury. In co-culture experiments, it was further verified that silencing CRACC expression or blockade of CRACC activation by mAb reduced the production of interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Collectively, our findings suggest that CRACC-CRACC interaction between NK cells and resident Kupffer cells contributes to Poly I:C/D-GalN-induced fulminant hepatitis. © 2013 Li et al.

84884569602	Protective properties of tanshinone I against oxidative DNA damage and cytotoxicity	Tanshinone I, a naturally occurring diterpene from Danshen, has been shown to possess hepatocyte protective, anticancer, and memory enhancing properties. However, there are few stringent pharmacological tests for neuroprotection of tanshinone I thus far. Since peroxynitrite is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, this study was undertaken to investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of tanshinone I is associated with inhibition of peroxynitrite-caused DNA damage, a critical event leading to peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity. Our results show that tanshinone I can significantly inhibit peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage both in φX-174 plasmid DNA and rat primary astrocytes. EPR spectroscopy indicates that tanshinone I potently diminished the DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct signal from peroxynitrite. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that tanshinone I can protect against peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage, hydroxyl radical formation and cytotoxicity, which might have implications for tanshinone I-mediated neuroprotection. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant activity of natural dietary compound myricitrin and its protective role against acrylamide cytotoxicity. We found that myricitrin can effectively scavenge multiple free radicals (including DPPH free radical, hydroxyl radical, and ABTS free radical) in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results further indicated that the presence of myricitrin (2.5-10 g/mL) was found to significantly inhibit acrylamide-induced cytotoxicity in human gastrointestinal Caco-2 cells. Moreover, acrylamide-induced cytotoxicity is closely related to oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, myricitrin was able to suppress acrylamide toxicity by inhibiting ROS generation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that myricitrin had a profound antioxidant effect and can protect against acrylamide-mediated cytotoxicity. © 2013 Wei Chen et al.

We discovered two independent missense SNVs in IL23R and GJB2 of low frequency and five common missense SNVs in LCE3D, ERAP1, CARD14 and ZNF816A associated with psoriasis at genome-wide significance. Rare missense SNVs in FUT2 and TARBP1 were also observed with suggestive evidence of association. Single-variant and gene-based association analyses of nonsynonymous SNVs did not identify newly associated genes for psoriasis in the regions subjected to targeted resequencing. This suggests that coding variants in the 1,326 targeted genes contribute only a limited fraction of the overall genetic risk for psoriasis. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

84892822686	Identification of a missense variant in LNPEP that confers psoriasis risk	Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex genetic architecture. To further advance gene discovery, we extended our genome-wide association study data set of 1,139 cases and 2,234 controls and replicated two independent cohorts of 7,200 cases and 10,491 controls. We identified the missense variant rs2303138 (p.Ala763Thr) within the LNPEP gene associated with psoriasis (P combined =1.83 × 10 -13, odds ratio=1.16) and validated four previously reported genes: IL28RA, NFKBIA, TRAF3IP2, and CARD14 (9.74 × 10 -11 ≤P≤9.37 × 10 -5), which confirmed the involvement of the nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway in psoriasis pathogenesis. LNPEP, also named insulin-responsive aminopeptidase, was identified as an angiotensin IV receptor. Protein function prediction suggested that this missense variant of LNPEP was most likely deleterious. Expression analysis showed that LNPEP was significantly downregulated in psoriatic lesions compared with the control skin (P=1.44 × 10 -6) and uninvolved patient skin (P=2.95 × 10 -4). Pathway analysis indicated that LNPEP was involved in the renin-angiotensin system, which also has a key role in cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These results provided genetic evidence that psoriasis might share common mechanisms with hypertension and diabetes, which was consistent with clinical observations. Our study identified a genetic susceptibility factor and provided genetic evidence of insight into psoriasis pathogenesis with the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system pathway. © 2014 The Society for Investigative Dermatology.

Our results showed that biocontrol efficacy and population growth of R. paludigenum were greatly enhanced when it was harvested from nutrient yeast dextrose with added chitin (NYCB) medium compared with that harvested from nutrient yeast dextrose (NYDB) medium. The ability of R. paludigenum produced in NYCB to induce resistance to blue mold in apple fruit was significantly enhanced. The enhanced disease control efficacy was correlated with higher levels of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in apple fruit treated with R. paludigenum. Moreover, the SOD and catalase (CAT) activities of R. paludigenum were stimulated by cultivating in NYCB, while malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in the yeast cells was suppressed. These results indicated that adding chitin to normal media might be an effective method to improve the antagonistic activity of R. paludigenum and the active oxygen metabolism of R. paludigenum might be closely related to the biocontrol activity of the yeast. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84893618838	Recombinant soluble CD226 protein directly inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro	Interactions between CD155 and nectins on tumor cells have been reported to potentially inhibit tumor growth. CD226, a receptor that recognizes CD155 and CD112, is an activation receptor of NK and T cells by which immune cells may attack a tumor. The purpose of this study is to explore whether soluble CD226 (sCD226) directly inhibits tumor growth by binding CD155 or CD112 on tumor cells. We expressed, purified and confirmed the identity of recombinant sCD226 (19 aa-248 aa) and then examined the effect of sCD226 on tumor cell growth using CD226 ligand (CD155 and CD112)-expressing cancer cell lines (K562, HeLa). After 3 days of co-culture with sCD226, we found that the numbers of K562 and HeLa cells were significantly reduced but those of a CD226-blocking mAb specifically attenuated the inhibitory effects of sCD226. We also noted that the sCD226 protein could compete with a PE-conjugated anti-CD112 antibody in flow cytometric analysis and block the binding of the PE-conjugated anti-CD112 antibody to tumor cells. Mechanistic studies using flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that sCD226 inhibited the division of CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester)-labeled K562 cells by delaying the cell cycle. In addition, we observed that sCD226 might have an impact on the metastatic potential of solid tumors in vitro. These results demonstrated that sCD226 molecule might be a potential biotherapy against tumor for further development. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84894080552	Detection of a novel missense mutation in the mevalonate kinase gene in one Chinese family with DSAP	Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is the most common form of porokeratosis and a severe chronic autosomal dominant cutaneous disorder with high genetic heterogeneity. Recently, the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene has been identified as a candidate gene responsible for DSAP and multiple mutations have been reported. Here, we report identification of a novel missense mutation in the MVK gene in a Chinese family with DSAP. A 50-year-old male was diagnosed as proband of DSAP based on the clinical and histological findings, which show numerous hyperpigmented macules by physical examination and cornoid lamella by skin biopsy. Similar skin symptoms were also observed in his father, who died many years ago. We prepared genomic DNA from the proband, unaffected individuals from his family members, as well as 100 unrelated healthy controls. PCR was then conducted using the above genomic DNA as template and the MVK gene-specific primers. The PCR product was subjected to direct sequencing and the sequence was compared to that of MVK gene within the NCBI database. We detected a heterozygous C to G transition at nucleotide 643 in exon 7 of MVK gene of the proband. This will result in an amino acid change at codon 215 (P.Arg215Gly.), which is from an arginine codon (CGA) to a Glycine codon (GGA). We did not detect any mutation in the unaffected family members or the 100 unrelated healthy controls, demonstrating that this is a novel missense mutation in MVK gene and therefore, contributes to the molecular diagnosis of DSAP.

The relative spectral reflectances are obtained with calculation for three different incident angles which indicate light sources with high output in the long wavelength region may be more effective. The measured average luminance coefficient for HPS and MH are 17% larger than that of LED.

CACN prevented HFD-induced obesity in C57BL/6 mice. In vivo experiment revealed that 40 and 200mg/kg of CACN in food reduced the body weight by 5.2% and 11.2%, respectively. CACN supplementation could also reduce the size of adipocytes, leptin secretion, serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and liver triglycerides. Furthermore, CACN could effectively reduce the expression levels of IL-6 and TNFα genes, markedly increase the SOD and GPx activity.

R. paludigenum grown in malic and lactic acid treatments were stimulated after 12 h incubation. Moreover, medium modified with malic and lactic acid significantly enhanced the acid tolerance of R. paludigenum (p>0.05). In acid tolerance response test, the highest viability of R. paludigenum was obtained at initial pH of 5.5 in the NYDB medium modified with malic acid (91.6 %). In addition, all R. paludigenum treatments significantly reduced the disease incidences and lesion diameters of blue mold in apples. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between acidadapted and unadapted yeasts in the apple wounds after 48 h dynamics. Acid stress improved R. paludigenum viability under acidic conditions. However, there was no significant difference between acid-adapted and unadapted yeasts in controlling P. expansum on apple fruit (p>0.05).

Oxidative stress was considered to be associated with acrylamide cytotoxicity, but the link between oxidative stress and acrylamide cytotoxicity is still unclear. In the present study, hispidin produced from the edible fungus Phellinus linteus displayed dramatically antioxidant activities against DPPH radicals, ABTS radicals, ferric reducing and hydroxyl radicals, as well as superoxide anion radicals. Moreover, the cytoprotective effect of hispidin against AA-induced oxidative stress was verified upon Caco-2 cells according to evaluate the cell viability, intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and glutathione (GSH) in the presence or absence of AA (5 mM) in a dose-dependent manner.

A combination of R. glutinis with rhamnolipids at 500. μg/mL was more effective in suppressing A. alternata infection than application of R. glutinis or rhamnolipids alone. Moreover, integration of R. glutinis with rhamnolipids significantly stimulated peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase and phenylalanine ammonialyase activities of cherry tomato fruit, which were stronger than the single treatments. Rhamnolipids with reduced concentrations did not affect the growth of R. glutinis in vitro, but were utilized as carbon sources by yeasts under conditions of limited carbon sources. Moreover, rhamnolipids themselves reduced decay incidence of A. alternata on cherry tomato fruit and promoted the population growth of R. glutinis in vivo. This combined treatment could induce natural resistance as well as accelerate colonization of yeasts on the fruit surface, providing an effective and safe strategy to control postharvest diseases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84905169047	Quaternary chitosan oligomers enhance resistance and biocontrol efficacy of Rhodosporidium paludigenum to green mold in satsuma orange	This study investigated the capacity of chitosan oligomers (COS), applied before harvest singly or in combination with antagonists, in controlling postharvest green mold caused by Penicillium digitatum in satsuma orange. Oranges treated with COS or Rhodosporidium paludigenum were observed having a delay in onset and progression of disease symptoms relative to wounded controls. Preharvest application of COS at different concentrations achieved similar biocontrol efficiency rates in green mold control after 4 days storage. However, the combination of pre-COS (1%, w/v) and R. paludigenum showed a more effective decay control than any other treatments. COS (1%, w/v) alone did not negatively affect R. paludigenum growth in wounds, but severely inhibited P. digitatum spore germination than lower dose treatments in vitro. The expression levels of the defense-related genes chitinase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase increased with decreased disease symptoms. Moreover, this phenomenon was more prominent in the integrated treatments than in the individual ones. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84908049865	Five regulatory genes detected by matching signatures of eQTL and GWAS in psoriasis	Background: Psoriasis is a common immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease with strong genetic dispositions. Although more than 40 susceptibility loci have been revealed mostly through psoriasis genome wide association studies, genetic variants with small effect remain to be identified. Objective: In order to explore the susceptibility genes with potential regulatory function, we queried jointly two psoriasis genome wide association cohorts and an expression dataset. Methods: We integrated conventional genome-wide association evidences in 2326 Han Chinese and 2719 Caucasian populations, and the signature of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in lymphoblastoid B cells, with application of Bayesian algorithm. Results: Five genes with implied regulatory effect were revealed to be associated significantly with the risk of psoriasis, with one novel signal in FAM20B gene which is significantly expressed (P=3.24×10<sup>-5</sup>). Besides, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified to be involved in the mechanism of psoriasis through eQTL effect. Conclusions: We identified FAM20B as a risk regulatory gene in the etiology of psoriasis at first time. This study shed a spotlight on the immune regulatory mechanism in psoriasis.

84908339437	Fundamental issues related to the origin of melatonin and melatonin isomers during evolution: relation to their biological functions	Melatonin and melatonin isomers exist and/or coexist in living organisms including yeasts, bacteria and plants. The levels of melatonin isomers are significantly higher than that of melatonin in some plants and in several fermented products such as in wine and bread. Currently, there are no reports documenting the presence of melatonin isomers in vertebrates. From an evolutionary point of view, it is unlikely that melatonin isomers do not exist in vertebrates. On the other hand, large quantities of the microbial flora exist in the gut of the vertebrates. These microorganisms frequently exchange materials with the host. Melatonin isomers, which are produced by these organisms inevitably enter the host’s system. The origins of melatonin and its isomers can be traced back to photosynthetic bacteria and other primitive unicellular organisms. Since some of these bacteria are believed to be the precursors of mitochondria and chloroplasts these cellular organelles may be the primary sites of melatonin production in animals or in plants, respectively. Phylogenic analysis based on its rate-limiting synthetic enzyme, serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), indicates its multiple origins during evolution. Therefore, it is likely that melatonin and its isomer are also present in the domain of archaea, which perhaps require these molecules to protect them against hostile environments including extremely high or low temperature. Evidence indicates that the initial and primary function of melatonin and its isomers was to serve as the first-line of defence against oxidative stress and all other functions were acquired during evolution either by the process of adoption or by the extension of its antioxidative capacity.

84912128135	Tumor-released galectin-3, a soluble inhibitory ligand of human NKp30, plays an important role in tumor escape from NK cell attack	Human Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a β-galactoside-binding protein expressed by tumor cells, has been reported to act as an immune regulator in antitumor T cells. However, its effect on natural killer (NK) cells is elusive. Using a recombinant human NK cell-activating receptor, NKp30 fusion protein (NKp30-Fc), we found that soluble NKp30-Fc could immunoprecipitate Galectin-3. The direct interaction between NKp30 and Galectin-3 was further confirmed using surface plasmon resonance experiments. Because Galectin-3 was mainly released from tumor cells in a soluble form in our study, the binding assay was performed to show that soluble Galectin-3 specifically bound to NK cells and NKp30 on the surface of the NK cells. Functionally, when soluble Galectin-3 was added to the NK-tumor cell coculture system, the NKp30-mediated, but not NKG2D-mediated, cytolysis and CD107a expression in the NK cells were inhibited, and these phenotypes could be restored by preincubation of soluble Galectin-3 with NKp30-Fc fusion protein or the addition of anti-Gal-3 antibody alone. Moreover, genetic down-regulation of Galectin-3 (shGal-3) resulted in tumor cells being more sensitive to NK cell lysis, and, reversely, Galectin-3-overexpressing HeLa cells (exGal-3) became less sensitive to NK cell killing. The results of these in vitro experiments were supported by studies in shGal-3-HeLa or exGal-3-HeLa xenograft non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice after NK cell adoptive immunotherapy, indicating that Galectin-3 strongly antagonizes human NK cell attack against tumors in vivo. These findings indicate that Galectin-3 may function as an immune regulator to inhibit NK cell function against tumors, therefore providing a new therapeutic target for tumor treatment.

84917733043	A novel MVK missense mutation in one Chinese family with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis	Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a severe chronic autosomal dominant cutaneous disorder with high genetic heterogeneity. mevalonate kinase, (MVK) a gene know to play an important role in regulation of calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, has recently been suggested as the disease-causing gene for DSAP. Here we report a direct sequencing analysis of this gene in 3 DSAP families, 6 sporadic cases, and 100 unrelated healthy controls. We detected a heterozygous T to A transition at nucleotide 205 in exon 3 of MVK gene in one familial case. This mutation will result in an amino acid change at codon 69 (P.Ser69Thr), which is from a serine codon (TCA) to a threonine codon (ACA). No such mutation was detected in the unaffected family members or the 100 unrelated healthy controls. Our results demonstrated a novel missense mutation in MVK gene. This will be valuable for the diagnosis of DSAP as well as for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of affected families.

84919782186	Cellular multi-objective particle swarm algorithm based on multi-strategy differential evolution	In order to strengthen the diversity of Pareto sets obtained by multi-objective optimization algorithms and balance the exploration and exploitation of the algorithms, a cellular multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on multi-strategy differential evolution (MPSOCell) is proposed. This algorithm is composed by integrating the cellular automate mechanism into the basic particle swarm optimization algorithm, and it is aimed at promoting the communication and information transmission among the particles. To avoid the local convergence caused by the fast flying speed of particles, a strategy used to limit the flying speed is designed; to strengthen the disturbance to the particles, a multi-strategy differential evolution operator is also brought into the algorithm. The experiments demonstrate that MPSOCell has better performance in terms of convergence and diversity.

11144312980	Postharvest biological control of gray mold rot of pear with Cryptococcus laurentii	Cryptococcus laurentii was evaluated for its activity in reducing postharvest gray mold decay of pear caused by Botrytis cinerea. Washed cell suspensions of yeast controlled gray mold better than yeast in culture broth. Treatment of wounds with autoclaved cell cultures or cell-free culture filtrate did not prevent decay. The interval between inoculation with the pathogen and application of the antagonist significantly influenced the efficacy of biocontrol. Efficacy was maintained when C. laurentii was applied simultaneously or prior to inoculation with B. cinerea but reduced if applied after inoculation with B. cinerea. The concentrations of antagonist had significant effects on biocontrol effectiveness: the higher the concentrations of the antagonist, the lower the disease incidence and the smaller the lesion diameter regardless of whether the fruit was stored at 25°C for 7 days or 2°C for 30 days followed by 20°C for 7 days. The efficacy of C. laurentii was enhanced by the addition of 2% CaCl

11444257067	Screening of Bacillus subtilis natto and optimization of nattokinase fermentation	Nattokinase, which is extracted from traditional Japanese food Natto is a fibrinolytic enzyme with strong and specific thrombolytic activity. A wild type Bacillus subtilis natto strain was screened from traditional Japanese food Natto with an improved medium-fibrinogen plate. The screening strategy included casein plate selecting and shaking culturing. The highest production of Nattokinase was 970 IU/mL. The fermentation condition of nattokinase production by Bacillus subtilis natto was optimized with response surface methodology (RSM). In the fist optimization step, Plackett-Burman design was used to evaluate the influence of related factors. Tryptone influenced nattokinase production positively while Na

12344274528	The inhibitory effects of synthetic short peptides, mimicking MICA and targeting at NKG2D receptors, on function of NK cells	NKG2D is an activating receptor expressed on most of human NK cells, one of whose ligands is MICA. Based on the crystal structure of NKG2D-MICA complex, we synthesized three short peptides (P1, P2 and P3), mimicking functional α1 and α2 domain of MICA. The inhibitory effects of three peptides on NK-92 cells, a human NK cell line against Hela cells were observed and the inhibitory percentage was 38% at maximum for P1 + P2 + P3 in concentration of 1 nM. The same peptides had no effect on NK-92 cell against target cells lacking MICA (K562 cells line). The unrelated peptides as controls had no effect on the system. Two peptides (P2 and P3) were prolonged at one or both ends, and the longer forms of peptides exerted stronger inhibitory effects than their shorter forms. Each combination of two peptides exerted a stronger function than single peptide (P1, P2, P3), indicating that shedding of longer amino acid sequence of α1 domain or more domain sites of MICA are better than shorter sequence and fewer sites. P1 + P2 + P3 revealed the almost same inhibitory rate as the soluble MICA (sMICA). P1 + P2 + P3 were also able to alleviate the concanavalin A-induced murine autoimmune hepatitis in vivo, conforming the similarity of NKG2D between human and mice. The results demonstrate that MICA-mimicking peptides will be useful to search the specific functional sites for NKG2D-MICA interaction, but also promising in explaining NKG2D-related autoimmunity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1242321986	Effects of Cryptococcus laurentii (Kufferath) Skinner on biocontrol of postharvest decay of arbutus berries	Cryptococcus laurentii was tested as a biocontrol agent for reducing natural decay of arbutus berries caused by Penicillium citrinum and Verticicladiella abielina in semi-commercial postharvest trials. Three different preparations of C. laurentii were compared for antagonistic efficiency. Washed C. laurentii cells provided better protection against decay than yeast cultured in broth without washing while the culture supernatant free of yeast cells provided no protection. The protection provided by the washed yeast cells was dose-dependent. Cryptococcus laurentii was also effective in controlling decay at low temperature (4°C). The efficacy of C. laurentii was enhanced by the addition of 2% CaCl
