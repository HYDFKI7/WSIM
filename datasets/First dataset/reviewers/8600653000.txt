18944382554	Construction and characterization of chimeric BHIV (BIV/HIV-1) viruses carrying the bovine immunodeficiency virus gag gene	Aim: To explore the possibility of the replacement of the gag gene between human immunodeficiency virus and bovine immunodeficiency virus, to achieve chimeric virions, and thereby gain a new kind of AIDS vaccine based on BHIV chimeric viruses. Methods: A series of chimeric BHIV proviral DNAs differing in the replacement regions in gag gene were constructed, and then were transfected into 293T cells. The expression of chimeric viral genes was detected at the RNA and protein level. The supernatant of 293T cell was ultra centrifuged to detect the probable chimeric virion. Once the chimeric virion was detected, its biological activities were also assayed by infecting HIV-sensitive MT4 cells. Results: Four chimeric BHIV proviral DNAs were constructed. Genes in chimeric viruses expressed correctly in transfected 293T cells. All four constructs assembled chimeric virions with different degrees of efficiency. These virions had complete structures common to retroviruses and packaged genomic RNAs, but the cleavages of the precursor Gag proteins were abnormal to some extent. Three of these virions tested could attach and enter into MT4 cells, and one of them could complete the course of reverse transcription. Yet none of them could replicate in MT4 cells. Conclusion: The replacement of partial gag gene of HIV with BIV gag gene is feasible. Genes in chimeric BHIVs are accurately expressed, and virions are assembled. These chimeric BHIVs (proviral DNA together with virus particles) have the potential to become a new kind of HIV/AIDS vaccine. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

22144470091	Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway by HSV-1 immediate early protein ICP0	The immediate early protein ICP0 encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is believed to activate transcription and consequently productive infection. The precise mechanisms of ICP0-mediated transactivation are under intensive study. Here, we demonstrate that ICP0 can strongly activate AP-1 responsive genes specifically. This activation is inhibited by c-Jun (S73A), c-Jun (S63/73A), TAK1 (K63W), but not by p38 (AF), ERK1 (K71R), ERK2 (K52R) and TRAF6 (C85A/H87A). We further investigate the relevancy of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways using their respective inhibitors PD98059, SP600125 and SB202190. Only SP600125 significantly attenuates the AP-1 responsive gene activation by ICP0. Consistent with these, the JNK is remarkably activated in response to ICP0, and this JNK activation is shown to be significantly attenuated by TAK1 (K63W). It turns out that ICP0 interacts specifically with TAK1 and stimulates its kinase activity. These findings reveal a new molecular mechanism ICP0 explores to regulate gene expression. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33645542490	JDV Tat has strong transactivate ability because of its RNA binding domain	In order to find the cause of different transactivate abilities among JDV, BIV and HIV-1 Tat, four chimeric Tat cDNA expression constructs, JH, HJ, JB and BJ, were generated with the crossover points at the boundary of activation and binding domains based on functional domain division of HIV-1 Tat and amino acid sequence comparision among HIV-1, JDV and BIV Tat. These chimeric Tat proteins were co-transfected with JDV, BIV and HIV-1 LTR report plasmids in Hela. Transient assay showed that different transactivate abilities among JDV, BIV and HIV-1 Tat were mainly caused by different binding abilities of their binding domains. We further excluded some possibilities that may cause the poor transactivate ability of JH on HIV-1 LTR, such as incomplete functional domains and the lack of related cytokines.

33748927967	Internalization of Jembrana disease virus Tat: Possible pathway and implication	Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a lentivirus highly related to the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV). It causes an acute disease with high mortality rate within 1-2 weeks. JDV encodes the most potent Tat (JTat) of any of the lentiviruses. JTat can transactivate all LTRs and functionally substitute for HIV Tat in the viral genome and may function as a pivotal regulator in the acute pathogenesis of JDV. The goal of this paper is to study JTat internalization by cells, the mechanisms involved in internalization, and the effect of JTat on neighbouring cells. By quantification and fluorescence microscopy, we found that the internalization of extracellular EGFP-JTat fusion protein was both time and dose-dependent, but endocytosis and energy independent. We identified that arginines which were responsible for the internalization. Internalized JTat was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, could transactivate JDV LTR and modulate cellular gene expression. Based on our findings, we propose that secretion and internalization of JTat may be a way for JDV to influence neighbouring cells and make the cellular environment more amenable to viral infection. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33749665293	BICP0 and its RING finger domain act as ubiquitin E3 ligases in vitro	Bovine infected-cell protein 0 (BICP0) encoded by bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1) immediate early gene is necessary for efficient productive infection, in a large part, because it activates all 3 classes of BHV-1 genes. It also has the ability to efficiently transactivate promoters that are not derived from BHV-1. To investigate the mechanism by which BICP0 achieves these effects, we expressed and purified BICP0 and its different mutants in E. coli. In vitro assays showed that both full-length BICP0 and its isolated RING finger domain induce the accumulation of polyubiquitin chains. Mutations within the RING finger region that abolish the in vitro ubiquitination activity also cause severe reductions in BICP0 activity in other assays. Based on these, we conclude that BICP0 has the potential to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase during viral infection and its RING finger domain is necessary for this function. These strongly support the hypothesis that BICP0 might influence virus infection through its ability to interact with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

33947200657	Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 and its role in innate immunity	Virus infection or interferon can stimulate robust expression of the protein ISG15 that is encoded by interferon stimulated gene 15, which was the first unbiquitin-like molecule identified two decades ago. While ubiquitin and its many important functions have been well established, the functions of ISG15 and its post-translational conjugation are still largely unknown. Recently, some specific enzymes have been identified to be involved in the ISG15 modification system, suggests that ISG15 and its modification system play important roles in the innate immune response and regulation of interferon signaling. The history of ISG15 discovery and its biochemical characterization were briefly introduced. Then such topics as the ISG15 gene expression and the ISG15 modification will be focued on, and finally summarize new findings which have implications for ISG15 and its modification system in immunology and interferon signal transduction were summarized.

33847346784	MicroRNAs and their role in viral infection	Recently, a class of about 22 nucleotides (nt) small RNA has been discovered in many eukaryotes, termed microRNAs (miRNAs), which have a variety of functions. Many recent findings have demonstrated that viruses can also encode their own miRNAs. Meanwhile, other findings reveal a relationship between host miRNA and viral infection. These findings suggest a tight relationship between host and viral infection via miRNA pathway.

34347403900	Detection and analysis of bovine foamy virus infection by an indicator cell line	Aim: To determine the infectivity and replication strategy of bovine foamy virus (BFV) in different cultured cells using the BFV indicator cell line (BICL) system. Methods: BFV infection was induced by the co-culture method or the transient transfection of the infectious BFV plasmid [pCMV (cytomegalovirus) - BFV] clone. The infectivity of BFV was monitored by the percentage of green fluorescent protein-positive cells in the BICL. The effect of reverse transcriptase inhibitor zidovudine (AZT) on BFV replication was also evaluated in the BICL. Results: The titer of BFV in fetal bovine lung cells was 4-5-folds more than that in either 293T or HeLa (Cells from Henrietta lacks) cells using the co-culture method, and in the meantime was significantly higher than that produced by the infectious clone pCMV-BFV in the same cells. AZT had only a minor effect on viral titers when added to cells prior to the virus infection. In contrast, viral titers reduced sharply to the level of the negative control when the virus was produced from cells in the presence of AZT. Conclusions: BICL can be used for the titration of the BFV viral infection in non-cytopathic condition. In addition, we provide important evidence to show that reverse transcription is essential for BFV replication at a late step of viral infection. © 2007 CPS and SIMM.

35348933693	Regulation of microtubule assembly and stability by the transactivator of transcription protein of Jembrana disease virus	Microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers consisting of tubulin subunits that take part in diverse cell activities. Many viruses hijack cellular motor proteins to move on microtubules toward the cell interior during the entry process and toward the plasma membrane during the egress period. In addition, viruses often remodel microtubules to facilitate the generation of infectious progeny. In this study, we found that the transactivator of transcription protein of Jembrana disease virus (Jtat) bound tubulin and microtubules both in cells and in the purified system. Microtubule co-sedimentation and co-localization assays revealed a robust interaction of Jtat with microtubules. Tubulin turbidity assay further showed that Jtat promoted tubulin polymerization in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, Jtat promoted the partitioning of cellular tubulin toward the polymeric form, increased the level of tubulin acetylation, and significantly enhanced the cold stability of cellular microtubules. In addition, Jtat-mediated disruption of microtubule dynamics induced the release of Bim from microtubules, leading to profound apoptosis. These results not only identify Jtat as an important viral regulator of microtubule dynamics but also indicate that Jtat-induced apoptosis might contribute to Jembrana disease pathogenesis. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

36749071590	Guanine tetrad and palindromic sequence play critical roles in the RNA dimerization of bovine foamy virus	Retroviruses are unique in having a diploid genome. However, the RNA sequences and structures that link the two RNA molecules are different. To identify the dimer linkage site of bovine foamy virus (BFV), complementary DNAs were used to interfere with RNA dimerization of BFV. We found that two sites, designated SI and SII, within a 53-base RNA fragment, were essential for BFV dimerization in vitro. SI consists of a potential guanine tetrad (GGGGC), which overlaps the primer binding site, while SII contains 15 nucleotides including a palindromic sequence, UCCCUAGGGA. Masking either of the sites completely abolished RNA dimer formation. Furthermore, a deletion of SII was introduced into a BFV infectious DNA clone; we found that deletion of SII significantly increased expression of BFV transactivator Borf-1. Interestingly, we also found that this deletion abolished viral infectivity. These results suggest that dimerization might play a unique role in the BFV life cycle. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

36949016245	BTat, a trans-acting regulatory protein, contributes to bovine immunodeficiency virus-induced apoptosis	Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) is a member of the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses highly related to human immunodeficiency virus in morphologic, antigenic and genomic features. BIV is known to induce chronic pathological changes in infected hosts, which are often associated with the development of immune-mediated lesions. However, the molecular events underlying the cytopathic effect of BIV remain poorly understood. In this study, BIV was found to induce apoptotic cell death, and a small trans-acting regulatory protein encoded by BIV, BTat, was found to participate in the pro-apoptotic action of BIV. Introduction of exogenous BTat to cells triggered apoptosis dramatically, as revealed by assays such as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling, nuclear morphology analysis, flow cytometry, and cleavages of caspases and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic effect of BTat was found to be mediated through its interaction with cellular microtubules and its interference with microtubule dynamics. These results provide the first evidence that induction of apoptosis may contribute to the cytopathic effect of BIV. In addition, these results uncover a novel role for BTat in regulating microtubule dynamics in addition to its conventional role in regulating gene transcription. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

38849207629	Molecular basis of the internalization of bovine immunodeficiency virus Tat protein	Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus (BIV) is a nonacute, pathogenic, and horizontally transmitted lentivirus. It shares the parallel properties in morphology and genetics with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and other lentiviruses. BIV encodes its own transactivator (BTat), which transactivates its cognate long terminal repeat (LTR). However, the mechanism involved in the transactivation is different from that in HIV and other lentiviruses. We determined the mechanisms of BTat internalization by cells and the effect of BTat on neighboring cells. The green fluorescent protein fusion analysis indicated that the internalization of extracellular BTat was a time and dose-dependent, but endocytosis and energy-independent manner. Arginine residues in the arginine-rich motif (ARM) of BTat were definitively responsible for the internalization. Internalized BTat is predominantly present in the nucleus, resulting in LTR activation and NF-κB induction. These results propose that the secretion and internalization of BTat facilitates BIV in influencing neighboring cells and makes the cellular environment propitious to viral replication. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40349114912	Subcellular Localization Analysis of Bovine Foamy Virus Borf1 Protein	The Borf1 protein is encoded by an immediate-early gene of the bovine foamy virus (BFV) and plays a key role in the viral life cycle. Borf1 is a DNA binding protein which can transactivate both the long terminal repeat (LTR) and the internal promoter (IP) of BFV by specifically binding to the transactivation responsive element (TRE). To analyze the subcellular localization of Borf1 during the BFV life cycle, this gene was cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector and expressed in a soluble form. After the purification and immunization, we raised the mouse anti-Borf1 serum with a high titer based on ELISA results. Western blot analysis showed that the antiserum could specifically recognize the Borf1 protein that was expressed in 293T cells. With this specific serum, we revealed the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Borf1 in HeLa cells that was transfected with Borf1. Moreover, the immuno-fluorescence assay also showed that the localization of Borf1 during the infection and transfection of BFV was identical.

84861602512	Design, synthesis and antiviral activity of novel quinazolinones	HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a validated therapeutic target for antiviral drug design. However, the emergence of viral strains resistant to clinically studied IN inhibitors demands the discovery of novel inhibitors that are structurally as well as mechanistically different. Herein, a series of quinazolinones were designed and synthesized as novel HIV-1 inhibitors. The new synthetic route provides a practical method for the preparation of 5-hydroxy quinazolinones. Primary bioassay results indicated that most of the quinazolinones possess anti-HIV activity, especially for compound 11b with 77.5% inhibition rate at 10 μM emerged as a new active lead. Most of the synthesized compounds were also found to exhibit good anti-TMV activity, of which compound 9a showed similar in vivo anti-TMV activity to commercial plant virucide Ribavirin. This work provides a new and efficient approach to evolve novel multi-functional antiviral agents by rational integration and optimization of previously reported antiviral agents. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84887953605	The mechanisms of host restriction on LINE-1 element	Approximately 45% of the human genome is occupied by transposable elements. Transposable elements have had an important impact on the structure and function of human genomes. Some of these elements are still capable of transposing, and their movements often cause diseases. Long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) is the only active autonomous transposon in humans, and it mediates the mobilization of nonautonomous elements. Recently, great progress has been made in understanding the biology of LINE-1. Here, we briefly review the structure of LINE-1, the mechanism of its mobilization, and its impact on human genome and human health. We also highlight the mechanisms that host cell has evolved to control LINE-1 replication. Given the similarity of the life cycle between LINE-1 and retroviruses, the LINE-1 research may also shed new light on the biology of retroviruses.

42449091104	IFP35 is involved in the antiviral function of interferon by association with the viral Tas transactivator of bovine foamy virus	Interferon-induced proteins (IFPs) exert multiple functions corresponding to diverse interferon signals. However, the intracellular functions of many IFPs are not fully characterized. Here, we report that IFP35, a member of the IFP family with a molecular mass of 35 kDa, can interact with the bovine Tas (BTas) regulatory protein of bovine foamy virus (BFV). The interaction involves NID2 (IFP35/Nmi homology domain) of IFP35 and the central domain of BTas. The overexpression of IFP35 disturbs the ability of BTas to activate viral-gene transcription and inhibits viral replication. The depletion of endogenous IFP35 by interfering RNA can promote the activation of BFV, suggesting an inhibitory function of IFP35 in viral-gene expression. In addition, IFP35 can interact with the homologous regulatory protein of prototype FV and arrest viral replication and repress viral transcription. Our study suggests that IFP35 may represent a novel pathway of interferon-mediated antiviral activity in host organisms that plays a role in the maintenance of FV latency.

43749104419	Dimerization of BTas is required for the transactivational activity of bovine foamy virus	The BTas protein of bovine foamy virus (BFV) is a 249-amino-acid nuclear regulatory protein which transactivates viral gene expression directed by the long terminal repeat promoter (LTR) and the internal promoter (IP). Here, we demonstrate the BTas protein forms a dimeric complex in mammalian cells by using mammalian two hybrid systems and cross-linking assay. Functional analyses with deletion mutants reveal that the region of 46-62aa is essential for dimer formation. Furthermore, our results show that deleting the dimerization region of BTas did not affect the localization of BTas, but that it did result in the loss of its transactivational activity on the LTR and IP. Furthermore, BTas (Δ46-62aa) retained binding ability to the LTR and IP similar to that of the wild-type BTas. These data suggest the dimerization region is necessary for the transactivational function of BTas and is crucial to the replication of BFV. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

54049087008	Establishment of an indicator cell line to quantify Bovine Foamy Virus infection	A cell line derived from baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells was transfected with the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene driven by the bovine foamy virus (BFV) long terminal repeat (LTR) to establish a BFV indicator cell line (BICL). Among 48 clones, one clone was chosen for its little constitutive enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression and high level of EGFP expression after activation by BFV infection. By detecting the EGFP expression of the BFV indicator cell line, the titers of BFV were quantified by the end point method. As a result, the titer determined by the EGFP based assay 5-6 days post infection (d.p.i.) was 100 fold higher than traditional assays measuring cytopathic effects 8-9 d.p.i.. Moreover, the EGFP based assay was also used to determine the titer of those cells infected by BFV without inducing cytopathic effects. Using this simple and rapid assay, we examined the in vitro host range of BFV. It was found that BFV can productively infect various cell lines derived from bovine, human, rat and monkey. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

70349250166	ISG15 expression in response to double-stranded RNA or LPS in cultured Fetal Bovine Lung (FBL) cells	Fetal bovine lung (FBL) cells are used in the culture of viruses which infect cattle and ISG15 plays a role in innate immunity against viral infections. However, whether the expression of ISG15 gene can be induced in FBL cells is still unknown. In this work, the expression of ISG15 in cultured FBL cells was detected after stimulated with poly I:C or LPS. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that the transcript of ISG15 can be induced by poly I:C or LPS. The increased expression of free ISG15 was confirmed via Western blotting. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that IRF-3 was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the FBL cells treated with poly I:C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that IRF-3 can bind to the promoter of the bISG15 gene. To demonstrate IRF-3 can promote the expression of bISG15, we establish a luciferase-reporter system of bovine ISG15 gene in 293 T cells. The luciferase assay showed that the over-expression of bovine IRF-3 could activate the promoter of bISG15 gene. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of bISG15 can be induced in FBL cells stimulated with poly I:C or LPS, and IRF-3 may play a role in inducing the expression of ISG15 in FBL cells. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

70649103012	Establishment of an indicator cell line for monitoring bovine immunodeficiency virus infection and inhibitor susceptibility	Indicator cell lines are useful biological tools for monitoring virus infection. In order to monitor infection with bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) in vitro, an indicator cell line derived from baby hamster kidney cells which contains integrated copies of an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene driven by the BIV long terminal repeat was constructed. The BIV indicator cell line, designated BIVE, can detect BIV infection more easily and effectively than the established method, which involves the observation of cell cytopathic effects. Furthermore, viral titration using an assay based on the indicator cells is 100 times more sensitive than the assay based on cytopathic effect. The finding that BIV can infect the hamster cell line expands the known host range of BIV in vitro. The BIV indicator cell line could also be used for the evaluation of the inhibitory effect of antiviral agents. The fusion inhibition effect of the heptad repeat 2 region of the BIV envelope protein could also be quantified. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

71149114448	Transcription factor AP1 modulates the internal promoter activity of bovine foamy virus	Foamy virus contains two promoters, which are the canonical long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and the internal promoter (IP). FV gene expression was considered to initiate at the internal promoter. However, little was known about how basal transcription of IP was triggered by the host cellular factors. Previous studies found some cellular proteins could affect HFV viral replication, but it was no known whether the AP1 signal pathway was involved in the activation of viral replication or not. In this study, we reported that treatment with TPA or AP1 increased basal transcription of IP and did not affect basal transcription of the promoter in the LTR. In addition, the c-Jun mutant blocked the IP activity stimulated by TPA. Two AP1 binding sites located in BFV-IP promoter were found by bioinformatics and mutants of two AP1 binding sites decreased luciferase reporter activity of IP activated by AP1. EMSA assay showed that two AP1 binding sites could bind to c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimeric. We also found TPA and AP1 enhanced BFV3026 replication. Taken together, these data suggested that AP1 was a positive regulator of BFV internal promoter. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

72749124037	Comparative functional analysis of Jembrana disease virus Tat protein on lentivirus long terminal repeat promoters: Evidence for flexibility at its N-terminus	Background. Jembrana disease virus (JDV) encodes a potent regulatory protein Tat that strongly stimulates viral expression by transactivating the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. JDV Tat (jTat) promotes the transcription from its own LTR as well as non-cognate LTRs, by recruiting host transcription factors and facilitating transcriptional elongation. Here, we compared the sequence requirements of jTat for transactivation of JDV, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) LTRs. Results. In this study, we identified the minimal protein sequence for LTR activation using jTat truncation mutants. We found that jTat N-terminal residues were indispensable for transactivating the HIV LTR. In contrast, transactivation of BIV and JDV LTRs depended largely on an arginine-rich motif and some flanking residues. Competitive inhibition assay and knockdown analysis showed that P-TEFb was required for jTat-mediated LTR transactivation, and a mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed the robust interaction of jTat with cyclin T1. In addition, HIV LTR transactivation was largely affected by fusion protein at the jTat N-terminus despite the fact that the cyclin T1-binding affinity was not altered. Furthermore, the jTat N-terminal sequence enabled HIV Tat to transactivate BIV and JDV LTRs, suggesting the flexibility at the jTat N-terminus. Conclusion. This study showed the distinct sequence requirements of jTat for HIV, BIV and JDV LTR activation. Residues responsible for interaction with cyclin T1 and transactivation response element are the key determinants for transactivation of its cognate LTR. N-terminal residues in jTat may compensate for transactivation of the HIV LTR, based on the flexibility. © 2009 Su et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

74549172907	Construction and characterization of a new simian/human immunodeficiency viruses clone carrying an env gene derived from a CRF07-BC strain	Background: The CRF07-BC recombinant strain has been one of the most predominantly circulated HIV-1 strains in China, it is therefore necessary and urgent to develop a relevant animal model to evaluate candidate vaccines targeting HIV-1 CRF07-BC. A highly replication-competent simian/human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) construct containing the Chinese CRF07-BC HIV-1 env gene with the ability to infect Chinese rhesus monkeys would serve as an important tool in the development of HIV vaccines. The aim of this study was to examine whether SHIV XJDC6431 with the env fragment from a Chinese HIV-1 isolate virus could infect the human and monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), establish infection in Chinese rhesus macaque. Methods: A SHIV strain was constructed by replacing the rev/env genes of SHIV KB9 with the corresponding fragment derived from the HIV-1 CRF07-BC strain. The infectious activity of the SHIV clones was determined in vitro in PBMCs from both non-human primate animals and humans. Finally, one Chinese rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) was infected with one SHIV via intravenous infusion. Results: One SHIV clone designated as SHIV XJDC6431, was generated that could infect macaque and human PBMC. The virus produced from this clone also efficiently infected the CCR5-expressing GHOST cell lines, indicating that it uses CCR5 as its coreceptor. Finally, the virus was intravenously inoculated into one Chinese rhesus macaque. Eventually, the animal became infected as shown by the occurrence of viremia within 3 of infection. The viral load reached 105 copies of viral RNA per ml of plasma during the acute phase of infection and lasted for 10 weeks post infection. Conclusions: We conclude that SHIV XJDC6431 is an R5-tropic chimeric virus, which can establish infection not only in vitro but also in vivo in the Chinese rhesus macaque. Although the animal inoculated with SHIV XJDC6431 became infected without developing a pathologic phenotype, the virus efficiently replicated with a persistent level of viral load in the plasma. This suggested that the SHIV could be used as a tool to test candidate AIDS vaccines targeting the Chinese HIV-1 CRF-07BC recombinant strain.

77149156953	Analysis of bovine foamy virus btas mRNA transcripts during persistent infection	Foamy virus (FV) is an unconventional retrovirus that possesses a complex genome and a special mechanism for gene expression regulation. The genome encodes transcriptional protein Tas which is found to regulate both the internal promoter (IP) and the long terminal repeat promoter (LTR). However, the detailed mechanism of Tas-mediated gene expression remains unknown. In this study, we provided the first evidence for the temporal production and utilization of four different bovine foamy virus (BFV) btas mRNAs during persistent infection. These four forms of btas mRNA transcripts initiated either at BFV LTR or IP and spliced or unspliced have a differential ability to activate BFV promoters. Furthermore, by developing an MS2 translational operator/coat protein combined system to track mRNA exportation from the nucleus and distribution throughout the cytoplasm, we observed that the IP spliced transcript could be exported into the cytoplasm more efficiently than unspliced transcripts. These findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that the functional interplay of both promoters contributes to the temporal pattern of BFV transcription and suggest that a post-transcriptional regulation exist in BFV replication. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Both cellular IKKβ and IΚBα also participate in this activation. In addition, we demonstrate that BTas induces the processing of p100, which implies that BTas can activate NF-ΚB through a noncanonical pathway as well. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that BTas interacts with IKK catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ), which may be responsible for regulation of IKK kinase activity and persistent NF-κB activation. Furthermore, our results indicate that the level of BTas-mediated LTR transcription correlates with the activity of cellular NF-κB. Together, this study suggests that BFV activates the NF-κB pathway through BTas to enhance viral transcription. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77952554981	First isolation of tryptophan from edible lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn) rhizomes and demonstration of its antioxidant effects	Various vegetables were investigated for antioxidant activities in two assays, namely, inhibition of lysis of erythrocytes induced by peroxyl radicals and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn) rhizome showed the strongest antioxidant activity in both assays. The crude extract (L) of lotus rhizome was chromatographed on a macroporous adsorption resin named NKA. The resulting three fractions were designated L1, L2 and L3, respectively. L2 showed the highest antioxidant activity and was further fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography. Eight fractions were obtained and named from L2a to L2h, respectively. L2c showed the strongest activity in inhibiting hemolysis of erythrocytes and was further purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. L2c-3 was identified as tryptophan. Its inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) value in inhibiting hemolysis of erythrocytes was 156.3 μg/ml (i.e. 765.4 μM). This is the first report on isolation of tryptophan from the aqueous extract of lotus rhizome and demonstration of their antioxidant activities. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

77953703562	Bovine ISG15: An antiviral and inducible protein in BIV infected fetal bovine lung cells	Bovine ISG15 (bISG15) is an interferon inducible ubiquitin-like protein that is responsible for the establishment of early pregnancy in ruminant, understanding the properties of bISG15 capable of being inducible in fetal bovine lung (FBL) cells upon infection of bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) is of significant importance. In this study, we investigated the expression of bISG15 in poly I:C treated FBL cells. The increased expression of bISG15 was observed, and the inhibition of BIV replication was also detected in FBL cells. Elimination of bISG15 expression by small interfering RNA reversed the bISG15 mediated inhibition of BIV replication. These findings demonstrate that bISG15 plays an important role in inhibition of the BIV replication in FBL cells. Furthermore, real-time PCR and western blot assay revealed that bISG15's expression can also be induced in BIV infected FBL cells. Taken together, bISG15 is an antiviral and inducible protein in BIV infected FBL cells. © 2010 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77953329307	A quantitative assay for measuring of bovine immunodeficiency virus using a luciferase-based indicator cell line	In order to quantitate the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) infection in vitro, a BIV indicator cell line (BIVL) was established by transfecting baby hamster kidney cells with reporter plasmids containing the firefly luciferase gene driven by a BIV long terminal repeat promoter. The BIV activates promoter activity of the LTR to express luciferase upon infection. BIV infection could therefore by quantified by detection of luciferase activity. Compared to standard assays used to detect BIV infection, the BIVL-based assay is 10 times more sensitive than the the CPE-based assay, and has similar sensitivity with the viral capsid protein Western blot assay. BIV indicator cell line could detect BIV infection specifically. Luciferase activity of BIV infected BIVL cells showed a time dependent manner, and 60 h post infection is the optimal time to detect BIV infection. Luciferase activity of BIVL cells correlates with the BIV capsid protein expression. Moreover, a linear relationship was found between MOI and the activated intensity of luciferase expression. In brief, the BIV indicator cell line is an easy, robust and quantitive method for monitoring BIV infection. © 2010 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77953348293	Preparation of bfv gag antiserum and preliminary study on cellular distribution of BFV	Viruses (e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus, Human simplex virus and Prototype foamy virus) are obligate intracellular parasites and therefore depend on the cellular machinery for cellular trafficking. Bovine foamy virus (BFV) is a member of the Spumaretrovirinae subfamily of Retroviruses, however, details of its cellular trafficking remain unknown. In this study, we cloned the BFV gag gene into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a and purified the denaturalized Gag protein. The protein was used to immunize BALB/c mouse to produce antiserum, which could specifically recognize the BFV Gag protein in BFV-infected cells through western blot assay. Additionally, these results demonstrated that both the optimal and suboptimal cleavage of Gag protein occur in BFV-infected cells. Subsequently, the Gag antiserum was used to investigate subcellular localization of BFV. In immunofluorescence microscopy assays, colocalization microtubules (MTs) and assembling viral particles were clearly observed, which implied that BFV may transport along cellular MTs in host cells. Furthermore, MTs-depolymerizing assay indicated MTs were required for the efficient replication of BFV. In conclusion, our study suggests that BFV has evolved the mechanism to hijack the cellular cytoskeleton for its replication. © 2010 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77955654074	Identification and functional characterization of BTas transactivator as a DNA-binding protein	The genome of bovine foamy virus (BFV) encodes a transcriptional transactivator, namely BTas, that remarkably enhances gene expression by binding to the viral long-terminal repeat promoter (LTR) and internal promoter (IP). In this report, we characterized the functional domains of BFV BTas. BTas contains two major functional domains: the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (residues 1-133) and the C-terminal activation domain (residues 198-249). The complete BTas responsive regions were mapped to the positions -380/-140 of LTR and 9205/9276 of IP. Four BTas responsive elements were identified at the positions -368/-346, -327/-307, -306/-285 and -186/-165 of the BFV LTR, and one element was identified at the position 9243/9264 of the BFV IP. Unlike other foamy viruses, the five BTas responsive elements in BFV shared obvious sequence homology. These data suggest that among the complex retroviruses, BFV appears to have a unique transactivation mechanism. © 2010.

77957135233	Microtubule-dependent retrograde transport of bovine immunodeficiency virus	Summary: Microtubules are essential components of the cytoskeleton that participate in a variety of cellular processes such as cell division and migration. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence implicating a role for microtubules in intracellular viral transport. In this study, we found that pharmacological disruption of microtubules remarkably blocked bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) movement from the cell periphery to the perinuclear region, a process known as retrograde transport. A similar effect was observed by inhibiting function of the microtubule-associated motor protein dynein. By yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the capsid protein (CA) of BIV interacted with the dynein light-chain component LC8. Immunoprecipitation and GST-pulldown assays further demonstrated an interaction between CA and LC8 in mammalian cells. In addition, our data revealed LC8 as a linker between BIV particles and microtubules. Retrograde transport of BIV was significantly inhibited by knockdown of LC8 expression. Our findings present the first evidence that incoming BIV particles employ host microtubule/dynein machinery for transport towards the perinuclear region. In addition, our data indicate that the LC8-CA interaction is a potential target for the design of antiviral strategies. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

78049523406	Bovine foamy virus transactivator BTas interacts with cellular RelB to enhance viral transcription	Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that depend on cellular machinery for their efficient transcription and replication. In a previous study we reported that bovine foamy virus (BFV) is able to activate the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway through the action of its transactivator BTas to enhance viral transcription. However, the mechanism used by NF-κB to enhance BFV transcription remains elusive. To address this question, we employed a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen for BTas-interacting proteins. We found that RelB, a member of NF-κB protein family, interacts with BTas. We confirmed the putative RelB-BTas interaction in vitro and in vivo and identified the protein regions responsible for the RelB-BTas interaction. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we next showed that RelB enhances BFV transcription (BTas-induced long terminal repeat [LTR] transactivation) and that this process requires both the localization of the RelB-BTas interaction in the nucleus and the Rel homology domain of RelB. The knockdown of the cellular endogenous RelB protein using small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly attenuated BTas-induced LTR transcription. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that endogenous RelB binds to the viral LTR in BFV-infected cells. Together, these results suggest that BFV engages the RelB protein as a cotransactivator of BTas to enhance viral transcription. In addition, our findings indicate that BFV infection upregulates cellular RelB expression through BTas-induced NF-κB activation. Thus, this study demonstrates the existence of a positive-feedback circuit in which BFV utilizes the host's NF-κB pathway through the RelB protein for efficient viral transcription.

79952073766	Crystal structures of catalytic core domain of BIV integrase: Implications for the interaction between integrase and target DNA	Integrase plays a critical role in the recombination of viral DNA into the host genome. Therefore, over the past decade, it has been a hot target of drug design in the fight against type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) integrase has the same function as HIV-1 integrase. We have determined crystal structures of the BIV integrase catalytic core domain (CCD) in two different crystal forms at a resolution of 2.45 Å and 2.2 Å, respectively. In crystal form I, BIV integrase CCD forms a back-to-back dimer, in which the two active sites are on opposite sides. This has also been seen in many of the CCD structures of HIV-1 integrase that were determined previously. However, in crystal form II, BIV integrase CCD forms a novel face-to-face dimer in which the two active sites are close to each other. Strikingly, the distance separating the two active sites is approximately 20 Å, a distance that perfectly matches a 5-base pair interval. Based on these data, we propose a model for the interaction of integrase with its target DNA, which is also supported by many published biochemical data. Our results provide important clues for designing new inhibitors against HIV-1. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79953203531	Regulation of Tat acetylation and transactivation activity by the microtubule-associated deacetylase HDAC6	Reversible acetylation of Tat is critical for its transactivation activity toward HIV-1 transcription. However, the enzymes involved in the acetylation/deacetylation cycles have not been fully characterized. In this study, by yeast two-hybrid assay, we have discovered the histone deacetylase HDAC6 to be a binding partner of Tat. Our data show that HDAC6 interacts with Tat in the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent manner. In addition, HDAC6 deacetylates Tat at Lys-28 and thereby suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter. Inactivation of HDAC6 promotes the interaction of Tat with cyclin T1 and leads to an increase in Tat transactivation activity. These findings establish HDAC6 as a Tat deacetylase and support a model in which Lys-28 deacetylation decreases Tat transactivation activity through affecting the ability of Tat to form a ribonucleoprotein complex with cyclin T1 and the transactivation-responsive RNA. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79955455033	Tetherin inhibits prototypic foamy virus release	Background: Tetherin (also known as BST-2, CD317, and HM1.24) is an interferon- induced protein that blocks the release of a variety of enveloped viruses, such as retroviruses, filoviruses and herpesviruses. However, the relationship between tetherin and foamy viruses has not been clearly demonstrated. Results: In this study, we found that tetherin of human, simian, bovine or canine origin inhibits the production of infectious prototypic foamy virus (PFV). The inhibition of PFV by human tetherin is counteracted by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu. Furthermore, we generated human tetherin transmembrane domain deletion mutant (delTM), glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor deletion mutant (delGPI), and dimerization and glycosylation deficient mutants. Compared with wild type tetherin, the delTM and delGPI mutants only moderately inhibited PFV production. In contrast, the dimerization and glycosylation deficient mutants inhibit PFV production as efficiently as the wild type tetherin. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that tetherin inhibits the release and infectivity of PFV, and this inhibition is antagonized by HIV-1 Vpu. Both the transmembrane domain and the GPI anchor of tetherin are important for the inhibition of PFV, whereas the dimerization and the glycosylation of tetherin are dispensable. © 2011 Xu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80052024168	Lysine acetylation sites in bovine foamy virus transactivator BTas are important for its DNA binding activity	Cellular acetylation signaling is important for viral gene regulation, particularly during the transactivation of retroviruses. The regulatory protein of bovine foamy virus (BFV), BTas, is a transactivator that augments viral gene transcription from both the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and the internal promoter (IP). In this study, we report that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT), p300, specifically acetylates BTas both in vivo and in vitro. Further studies demonstrated that BTas acetylation markedly enhances its transactivation activity. Mutagenesis analysis identified three lysines at positions 66, 109 and 110 in BTas that are acetylated by p300. The K110R mutant lost its binding to BFV promoter as well as its ability to activate BFV promoter. The acetylation of K66 and K109 may contribute to increased BTas binding ability. These results suggest that the p300-acetylated lysines of BTas are important for transactivation of BFV promoters and therefore have an important role in BFV replication. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

80054952003	A new indicator cell line established to monitor bovine foamy virus infection	In order to improve the accuracy for quantitating the bovine foamy virus (BFV) in vitro, we developed a baby hamster kidney cell (BHK)-21-derived indicator cell line containing a plasmid that encodes the firefly luciferase driven by the BFV long terminal repeat promoter (LTR, from -7 to 1012). The BFV titer could be determined by detecting the luciferase expression since the viral trans-activator BTas protein activates the promoter activity of the LTR. One clone, designated BFVL, was selected from ten neomycin-resistant clones. BFVL showed a specific and inducible dose- and time-dependent luciferase activity in response to BFV infection. Although the changes in luciferase activity of BFVL peaked at 84 h post infection, it was possible to differentiate infected and uninfected cells at 48 h post infection. A linear relationship was established between the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of BFV and the activated ratio of luciferase expression in BFVL. Moreover, the sensitivity of the BFVL-based assay for detecting infectious BFV was 10,000 times higher than the conventional CPE-based assay at 48 h post infection. These findings suggest that the BFVL-based assay is rapid, easy, sensitive, quantitative and specific for detection of BFV infection. © 2011 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84855241519	Bovine Herpesvirus 1 protein bICP0 represses the transcription of bISG15 in fetal bovine lung cells	The ubiquitin-like modifier bISG15 is an antiviral protein found in fetal bovine lung (FBL) cells. Bovine Herpesvirus 1(BHV-1), which is a viral pathogen of cattle, can infect FBL cells and induce cytopathic effects. Real-time PCR assays showed that BHV-1's infection could repress the basal or inducible transcription of bISG15 in FBL cells. It demonstrates that this repression effect depends on BHV-1 viral infection and new protein synthesis. Our previous work showed that bIRF-3 was the key factor in the stimulation of bISG15 in FBL cells, so the effect of BHV-1 viral protein on bIRF-3 activating the promoter of bISG15 was confirmed. The luciferase assay showed the BHV-1 viral protein bICP0 inhibited the activation of bISG15 promoter stimulated by bIRF-3. Taken together, our work suggested that BHV-1 had some molecular mechanism to resist the cellular bISG15's antiviral functions. © 2011 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84870714987	The N-terminal region of IFITM3 modulates its antiviral activity by regulating IFITM3 cellular localization	Interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family members IFITM1, -2, and -3 restrict the infection of multiple enveloped viruses. Significant enrichment of a minor IFITM3 allele was recently reported for patients who were hospitalized for seasonal and 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu. This IFITM3 allele lacks the region corresponding to the first amino-terminal 21 amino acids and is unable to inhibit influenza A virus. In this study, we found that deleting this 21-amino-acid region relocates IFITM3 from the endosomal compartments to the cell periphery. This finding likely underlies the lost inhibition of influenza A virus that completes its entry exclusively within endosomes at low pH. Yet, wild-type IFITM3 and the mutant with the 21-amino-acid deletion inhibit HIV-1 replication equally well. Given the pH-independent nature of HIV-1 entry, our results suggest that IFITM3 can inhibit viruses that enter cells via different routes and that its N-terminal region is specifically required for controlling pHdependent viruses. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

84870761501	Interferon-γ Upregulates Expression of IFP35 Gene in HeLa Cells via Interferon Regulatory Factor-1	Background: Interferon-induced 35-kDa protein (IFP35) plays important roles in antiviral defense and the progression of some skin cancer diseases. It can be induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in multiple human cells. However, the mechanisms by which IFN-γ contributes to IFP35 induction remain to be elucidated. Methods/Principal Findings: We identified the transcription start sites of IFP35 by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and cloned the promoter of IFP35. Sequence analysis and luciferase assays revealed two GC boxes and an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the 5′ upstream region of the transcription start sites, which were important for the basal transcription of IFP35 gene. Furthermore, we found that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and IRF-2 could bind to IFP35 promoter and upregulate endogenous IFP35 protein level. Depletion of endogenous IRF-1 by interfering RNA reduced the constitutive and IFN-γ-dependent expression of IFP35, whereas depletion of IRF-2 had little effect on IFN-γ-inducible IFP35 expression. Moreover, IRF-1 was recruited to the ISRE site in IFP35 promoter in IFN-γ treated HeLa cells, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Conclusions/Significance: These findings provide the first evidence that IRF-1 and IRF-2 are involved in constitutive IFP35 expression in HeLa cells, while IRF-1 also activates IFP35 expression in an IFN-γ-inducible manner. Our data therefore identified a new IRF-1 and IRF-2 target gene, which may expand our current understanding of the versatile functions of IRF-1 and IRF-2. © 2012 Yang et al.

To reveal the exact mechanism of its protective functions in humans, in this study we isolated and identified the active compound PB3 of P. adiposa for the first time by a combination of chromatography techniques, including NKA macroporous resin and Sephadex G-15. PB3, with molecular mass of 267.2 Da and molecular formula of C10H13N5O4 discovered by mass spectrum (MS) was identified to be adenosine. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with purified fraction PB3. Seven days after injection, we found a 1.5-fold increase of IL10 at the mRNA level, while a down regulated expression of IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-γ to 49.0%, 56.9% and 73.4%, respectively, was detected in spleen by real-time quantitative PCR. What's more, SOD expression level was significantly increased by 1.6-fold compared to control. Fraction PB3 displayed anti-inflammatory potency and heightened SOD activity on the transcriptional level, which could be considered of further pharmaceutical or medication value. © 2013 by the authors.

84874996875	HIV-1 Vpr activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathway by enhancing the phosphorylation of IKKα/Β	The human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) Vpr plays an essential role in viral replication. A number of studies have reported that Vpr modulates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. Yet, the reported effects of Vpr on NF-κB signaling are controversial. In this study, we investigate the interplay between Vpr and NF-κB pathway. We discover that HIV-1 infection elevates the phosphorylation of IκBα and p100, and that this increase is greatly reduced when a Vpr-negative HIV-1 is used for infection. Our data further show that Vpr regulates the activity of IKKα/Β through interactions. In addition, Vpr modulates the phosphorylation of p65 and p100, suggesting that Vpr activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Knock down of endogenous IKKα/Β result in a decrease in Vpr-mediated NF-κB and HIV-1 LTR activation. Given that Vpr is present in HIV-1 particles, our data suggest that Vpr activates the NF-κB pathway immediately after HIV-1 entry. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The approximate molecular weight was demonstrated to be 18.5 kDa by SDS-PAGE and ultracentrifugation analysis and N-terminal sequence was detected as AGRTFIGYNG by Edman degradation. Biochemical characterization showed that it exhibited significant antioxidant activity by effectively scavenging hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl radicals compared to standard antioxidant butylated hydroxy anisole. PNAP had deoxyribonuclease activity with the optimum pH and temperature were 5.0 and 60 C respectively, as well as it can act on both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, but preferentially on double-stranded DNA. PNAP displayed antitumor activity against cancer cell lines such as MCF7 and Hela cells. Human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with PNAP produced typical apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation, accumulation of sub-G1 cells and alternation of mitochondrial permeability. The PNAP induced apoptosis of MCF7 cells entailed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in release of cytochrome c into cytosol, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which are responsible for the execution of apoptosis, implying intrinsic signal pathway is involved in PNAP induced apoptosis. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84899081437	Structural and biochemical insights into the V/I505T mutation found in the EIAV gp45 vaccine strain	Background: The equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus of the Retrovirus family, which causes persistent infection in horses often characterized by recurrent episodes of high fever. It has a similar morphology and life cycle to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Its transmembrane glycoprotein, gp45 (analogous to gp41 in HIV), mediates membrane fusion during the infection. However, the post-fusion conformation of EIAV gp45 has not yet been determined. EIAV is the first member of the lentiviruses for which an effective vaccine has been successfully developed. The attenuated vaccine strain, FDDV, has been produced from a pathogenic strain by a series of passages in donkey dermal cells. We have previously reported that a V/I505T mutation in gp45, in combination with other mutations in gp90, may potentially contribute to the success of the vaccine strain. To this end, we now report on our structural and biochemical studies of the gp45 protein from both wide type and vaccine strain, providing a valuable structural model for the advancement of the EIAV vaccine.Results: We resolved crystal structures of the ecto-domain of gp45 from both the wild-type EIAV and the vaccine strain FDDV. We found that the V/I505T mutation in gp45 was located in a highly conserved d position within the heptad repeat, which protruded into a 3-fold symmetry axis within the six-helix bundle. Our crystal structure analyses revealed a shift of a hydrophobic to hydrophilic interaction due to this specific mutation, and further biochemical and virological studies confirmed that the mutation reduced the overall stability of the six-helix bundle in post-fusion conformation. Moreover, we found that altering the temperatures drastically affected the viral infectivity.Conclusions: Our high-resolution crystal structures of gp45 exhibited high conservation between the gp45/gp41 structures of lentiviruses. In addition, a hydrophobic to hydrophilic interaction change in the EIAV vaccine strain was found to modulate the stability and thermal-sensitivity of the overall gp45 structure. Our observations suggest that lowering the stability of the six-helix bundle (post-fusion), which may stabilizes the pre-fusion conformation, might be one of the reasons of acquired dominance for FDDV in viral attenuation. © 2014 Du et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84900341921	Characterization of a full-length infectious clone of bovine foamy virus 3026	The biological features of most foamy viruses (FVs) are poorly understood, including bovine foamy virus (BFV). BFV strain 3026 (BFV3026) was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an infected cow in Zhangjiakou, China. A full-length genomic clone of BFV3026 was obtained from BFV3026-infected cells, and it exhibited more than 99% amino acid (AA) homology to another BFV strain isolated in the USA. Upon transfection into fetal canine thymus cells, the full-length BFV3026 clone produced viral structural and auxiliary proteins, typical cytopathic effects, and virus particles. These results demonstrate that the full-length BFV3026 clone is fully infectious and can be used in further BFV3026 research. © 2014 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer-Verlag.

84901323640	N-Myc interactor inhibits prototype foamy virus by sequestering viral tas protein in the cytoplasm	Foamy viruses (FVs) are complex retroviruses that establish lifelong persistent infection without evident pathology. However, the roles of cellular factors in FV latency are poorly understood. This study revealed that N-Myc interactor (Nmi) could inhibit the replication of prototype foamy virus (PFV). Overexpression of Nmi reduced PFV replication, whereas its depletion by small interfering RNA increased PFV replication. The Nmi-mediated impairment of PFV replication resulted from the diminished transactivation by PFV Tas of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) and an internal promoter (IP). Nmi was determined to interact with Tas and abrogate its function by sequestration in the cytoplasm. In addition, human and bovine Nmi proteins were found to inhibit the replication of bovine foamy virus (BFV) and PFV. Together, these results indicate that Nmi inhibits both human and bovine FVs by interfering with the transactivation function of Tas and may have a role in the host defense against FV infection. IMPORTANCE From this study, we report that the N-Myc interactor (Nmi), an interferon-induced protein, can interact with the regulatory protein Tas of the prototype foamy virus and sequester it in the cytoplasm. The results of this study suggest that Nmi plays an important role in maintaining foamy virus latency and may reveal a new pathway in the interferon-mediated antiviral barrier against viruses. These findings are important for understanding virus-host relationships not only with FVs but potentially for other retroviruses as well. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

84901587506	Identification and functional characterization of Bet protein as a negative regulator of BFV3026 replication	Foamy virus (FV) establishes persistent infection in the host without causing apparent disease. Besides the transactivator Tas protein, another auxiliary protein - Bet - has been reported in prototype foamy virus, equine foamy virus, and feline foamy virus. Here, we found the putative bbet gene in clone C74 from a cDNA library of bovine foamy virus strain 3026 (BFV3026) by comparison of gene localization, composition, and splicing features with other known bet genes. Subsequently, BBet protein was detected in BFV3026-infected cells by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Analysis of the BBet mutant infectious clone (pBS-BFVdelBBet) revealed that BBet could inhibit BFV3026 replication. Consistent with this result, overexpression of BBet in Cf2Th cells reduced BFV replication by approximately threefold. Furthermore, virus replication levels similarly were reduced by approximately threefold in pBS-BFV-transfected and BFV3026-infected Cf2Th cells stably expressing BBet compared with control cells. After three passages, BFV3026 replicated more slowly in BBet-expressing cells. This study implicates BBet as a negative regulator of BFV replication and provides a resource for future studies on the function of this protein in the virus lifecycle. © Springer Science+Business Media 2014.

84902496017	HIV-1 Vpr stimulates NF-κB and AP-1 signaling by activating TAK1	Background: The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays an important role in viral replication. It has been reported that Vpr stimulates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling pathways, and thereby regulates viral and host cell gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism behind this function of Vpr is not fully understood.Results: Here, we have identified transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) as the important upstream signaling molecule that Vpr associates with in order to activate NF-κB and AP-1 signaling. HIV-1 virion-associated Vpr is able to stimulate phosphorylation of TAK1. This activity of Vpr depends on its association with TAK1, since the S79A Vpr mutant lost interaction with TAK1 and was unable to activate TAK1. This association allows Vpr to promote the interaction of TAB3 with TAK1 and increase the polyubiquitination of TAK1, which renders TAK1 phosphorylation. In further support of the key role of TAK1 in this function of Vpr, knockdown of endogenous TAK1 significantly attenuated the ability of Vpr to activate NF-κB and AP-1 as well as the ability to stimulate HIV-1 LTR promoter.Conclusions: HIV-1 Vpr enhances the phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of TAK1, and as a result, activates NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways and stimulates HIV-1 LTR promoter. © 2014 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84902682338	Identification of an endocytic signal essential for the antiviral action of IFITM3	Summary: Members of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family inhibit the entry of a wide range of viruses. Viruses often exploit the endocytosis pathways to invade host cells and escape from the endocytic vesicles often in response to low pH. Localization to these endocytic vesicles is essential for IFITM3 to interfere with the cytosolic entry of pH-dependent viruses. However, the nature of the sorting signal that targets IFITM3 to these vesicles is poorly defined. In this study, we report that IFITM3 possesses a YxxΦ sorting motif, i.e. 20-YEML-23, that enables IFITM3 to undergo endocytosis through binding to the μ2 subunit of the AP-2 complex. IFITM3 accumulates at the plasma membrane as a result of either mutating 20-YEML-23, depleting the μ2 subunit or overexpressing μ2 mutants. Importantly, blocking endocytosis of IFITM3 abrogates its ability to inhibit pH-dependent viruses. We have therefore identified a critical sorting signal, namely 20-YEML-23, that controls both the endocytic trafficking and the antiviral action of IFITM3. This finding also reveals that as an endocytic protein, IFITM3 first arrives at the plasma membrane before it is endocytosed and further traffics to the late endosomes where it acts to impede virus entry. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84907494135	IFN-stimulated gene LY6E in monocytes regulates the CD14/TLR4 pathway but inadequately restrains the hyperactivation of monocytes during chronic HIV-1 infection	Owing to ongoing recognition of pathogen-associatedmolecular patterns, immune activation and upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are sustained in the chronically infected host. Albeit most ISGs are important effectors for containing viral replication, some might exert compensatory immune suppression to limit pathological dysfunctions, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we report that the ISG lymphocyte Ag 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) is a negative immune regulator of monocytes. LY6E in monocytes negatively modulated CD14 expression and subsequently dampened the responsiveness to LPS stimulation in vitro. In the setting of chronic HIV infection, the upregulation of LY6E was correlated with reduced CD14 level on monocytes; however, the immunosuppressive effect of LY6E was not adequate to remedy the hyperresponsiveness of activated monocytes. Taken together, the regulatory LY6E pathway in monocytes represents one of negative feedback mechanisms that counterbalance monocyte activation, which might be caused by LPS translocation through the compromised gastrointestinal tract during persistent HIV-1 infection and may serve as a potential target for immune intervention.
