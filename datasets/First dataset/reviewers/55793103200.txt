84930900964	Multiple Analytical Approaches Demonstrate a Complex Relationship of Genetic and Nongenetic Factors with Cisplatin- and Carboplatin-Induced Nephrotoxicity in Lung Cancer Patients	Background. Cisplatin and carboplatin cause nephrotoxicity by forming platinum-DNA adducts and lead to cell death. Methods. One-hundred and sixteen Taiwanese lung cancer patients who received cisplatin or carboplatin more than twice were recruited, and their genotypes were determined. The risk of renal dysfunction, injury to the kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria were used to evaluate the occurrence of nephrotoxicity. A logistic regression, multiple regression with a classification and regression tree (CART), and the Framingham study risk score were used to analyze interactions between genetic and nongenetic factors in producing platinum-induced nephrotoxicity. Results. ERCC1 118C and TP53 72Arg polymorphisms were associated with increased risks of platinum-induced nephrotoxicity. Other risk factors found included the platinum type, baseline serum creatinine (Scr), coadministration of vinorelbine, and the number of chemotherapy cycles. The overall prediction rate of the CART was 82.7%, with a sensitivity of 0.630 and specificity of 0.896. The Framingham study risk prediction model contained 7 factors. Its prediction rate was 84.5%, with a sensitivity of 0.643 and specificity of 0.909. Conclusions. Genetic polymorphisms of ERCC1 and TP53 are risk factors for nephrotoxicity. The CART analysis may provide a clinically applicable model to predict the risk of cisplatin- and carboplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

0029855524	Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Taiwan	Eighty-seven patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) diagnosed between 1988 and 1990 were treated with isoniazid and at least three other effective second-line drugs based on in vitro susceptibility tests. Of these patients, 10% failed to adhere to the regimen and 43% remained sputum positive after 6 months of treatment. Only 47% showed sputum conversion within 6 months of treatment and 12% of them relapsed during the first year of follow-up. From September 1987 to July 1989, 36 patients with MDR-TB were treated with a regimen containing rifabutin, isoniazid and at least three other susceptible drugs. Only 47% achieved a sustained sputum conversion. Four died during treatment due to disease progression. From March 1992 to July 1993, 17 cases of MDR-TB were treated with an ofloxacin-containing anti-TB regimen for 12-24 months. Two failed to adhere to the regimen for more than 1 month during the first 6 months of therapy. Among the remaining 15, 26% failed to achieve sputum conversion, 73% achieved bacterial conversion, 9 within 1 month and the other 2 within 2 months. No significant adverse effect was associated with ofloxacin use. We concluded that ofloxacin is a better choice among the more toxic and less potent second-line drugs, and should be used along with other anti-TB drugs in treating patients with MDR-TB.

0031058451	In vitro activity of ofloxacin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis	For the past 3 years, ofloxacin has been widely used in treating patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Taiwan. To study its usefulness in treating these patients, 139 isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients treated at the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau from September 1994 to September 1995 were tested to determine the in vitro antituberculosis activity of ofloxacin. Of these, 131 had not been previously exposed to ofloxacin, and 130 (99.2%) were susceptible to ofloxacin. Sixty-four isolates were found to be susceptible to all conventional antituberculosis drugs, and all of these were also susceptible to ofloxacin. Of the remaining 67 isolates that were resistant to one or more conventional antituberculosis drugs, 66 (98.5%) were susceptible to ofloxacin. There was no association between susceptibility of ofloxacin and susceptibility to conventional antituberculosis drugs among the isolates tested. Of the eight isolates of M. tuberculosis previously exposed to ofloxacin, seven (87.5%) were resistant. Our results indicate that patients with multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis who have not received prior ofloxacin treatment may be safely treated with ofloxacin, even without knowing the result of pretreatment ofloxacin susceptibility tests. We also found that ofloxacin resistance emerges frequently. Therefore, an adequate combination of antituberculosis drugs, along with ofloxacin, should be prescribed to prevent the development of resistance to ofloxacin.

0031688983	Drug resistance patterns of tuberculosis in Taiwan	To evaluate the patterns of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Taiwan, a total of 1,091 isolates collected from patients from January 1996 through December 1996 were tested for drug susceptibility using the absolute concentration method at the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau. The overall drug rate of resistance to at least one drug was 35.5%. Among the 249 isolates from patients who had never been treated for tuberculosis, 16.1% were resistant to one or more drugs; 1.6% were resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Of 200 patients with prior antituberculosis treatment, 67.0% had isolates resistant to one or more drugs and 46.0% had isolates resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin. We conclude that drug-resistant M. tuberculosis is an important issue in tuberculosis treatment in Taiwan, especially when dealing with patients with a prior history of antituberculosis treatment. More aggressive interventions, such as directly observed therapy, short-course, are needed to improve the cure rate of pulmonary tuberculosis and to decrease resistance rates.

0031413265	Initial drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Taiwan	The prevalence and mortality rate of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults are high in Taiwan. Because the emergence of drug- resistant tuberculosis is one of the major causes of this sustained high tuberculosis mortality, surveillance of initial drug resistance is important. We tested Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 1,935 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients from January 1990 through December 1995 at the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau. The overall initial drug resistance rate was 12.3%: 8.7% of isolates were resistant to only one drug, 2.6% to two drugs, 0.7% to three drugs, and 0.3% to four drugs. The resistance rates to individual drugs were: streptomycin, 5.7%; isoniazid, 9.2%; ethambutol, 0.7%; and rifampin, 1.5%. The frequency of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin) was 1.2%. In view of the high initial isoniazid resistance rate and low initial ethambutol resistance rate, ethambutol should be added to the regimen for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in Taiwan. The emergence of multidrug- resistant M. tuberculosis is ominous and should be considered when treating patients in Taiwan.

0031887051	Screening of human immunodeficiency virus infection in pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Taiwan	The impact of HIV infection on Taiwan's tuberculosis epidemic was investigated in a prospective study of all 378 pulmonary tuberculosis patients (mean age, 53.5 years) admitted to the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau in 1996. Bacteriologic or pathologic evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis was obtained in 306 cases (81%); the remaining 72 patients had chest radiographs and clinical courses consistent with a tuberculosis diagnosis. In the former group, the sputum smear yielded acid-fast bacilli in 279 patients (73.8%) and sputum cultures grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 263 (69.6%). Only 1 patient, an overseas Chinese man with a history of encounters with prostitutes, was HIV-positive. His symptoms included cough, weight loss, and malaise of 4 months' duration. His sputum culture was positive for M. tuberculosis and the chest radiograph revealed diffuse non-cavity infiltration lesions over the bilateral lung parenchyma and mediastinum lymphadenopathy. These findings suggest that the impact of HIV infection on Taiwan's tuberculosis epidemic is not significant at present, in part because HIV remains uncommon. However, continued monitoring of dual infection is essential to guide tuberculosis control efforts.

0031927545	Report of invasive Rhodococcus equi infections in Taiwan, with an emphasis on the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains	From November 1995 to October 1997, seven patients with invasive infections due to Rhodococcus equi were treated in Taiwan. Four patients had pulmonary lesions, and one each of the remaining three patients had a recurrent Port-A-Cath (Kabi-Pharmacia, North Ryde, New South Wales, Australia)- related bacteremia, a primary bacteremia, and a brain abscess. Three patients had underlying hematologic malignancies, and one each of the remaining four patients had diabetes mellitus, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, long-term use of steroids, and AIDS. The 13 isolates of R. equi recovered from these patients were identified by using API Coryne System (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), VITEK GPI card (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, MO), supplemental biochemical tests, and cellular fatty acid chromatograms. Susceptibilities of these isolates to 16 antimicrobial agents, with use of the agar dilution method, varied; among them, amikacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were the most active agents. Different random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns of isolates from different patients documented the lack of epidemiological relatedness of the causative organisms of these infections. This study confirms the emergence of multidrug- resistant R. equi infection in Taiwan and documents the relapsing or reactivating nature of this infection.

0031945305	Short-course chemotherapy for isoniazid-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	Standard short-course chemotherapy including isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol has been the recommended treatment for tuberculosis in Taiwan since November 1990. The effectiveness of this treatment was evaluated retrospectively in 108 patients with isolates resistant to isoniazid alone and 115 patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed and treated at the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau from November 1990 through December 1995. The success rate of treatment was 94.4% in patients with isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, which was not significantly different from the 97.4% rate in patients with susceptible strains. Of the patients treated successfully, no bacteriologic relapse was found in 97 patients with isoniazid-resistant strains or 103 patients with drug-susceptible strains 12 months after the end of chemotherapy. No significant advantage in treatment outcome was found in patients infected with isoniazid-resistant strains who received chemotherapy for more than 6 months (successful treatment rate, 95.0% vs 92.8%), but the failure rate was higher in patients with a previous history of antituberculosis therapy (17.6% vs 3.3%). We conclude that short- course chemotherapy is effective for isoniazid-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis and that there is no significant difference in treatment outcome between patients with or without isoniazid-resistant disease.

0032461162	Tuberculous empyema	The clinical courses of 35 tuberculous empyema patients were investigated retrospectively from November 1990 through November 1995. Most patients had nonspecific symptoms and signs but with far-advanced pulmonary parenchymal lesions in their chest roentgenographs. The effusions showed neutrophilic leukocytosis with a 60% positive culture rate for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Multidrug resistant strains were found in 7 out of 18 cultures. All patients received chemotherapy and eight of them underwent additional surgical management. Twenty-two (62.9%) patients had been treated successfully and one patient is still under treatment. The remaining 12 patients either died during treatment or defaulted; and four (11.4%) of them had died of tuberculosis. We conclude that the treatment outcome of tuberculous empyema is less satisfactory than that of pulmonary tuberculosis, however, modem multidrug chemotherapy with repeated drainage and opportune surgical interventions could be in prospect of successful treatment of tuberculous empyema.

31144451326	Age transition of tuberculosis patients in Taiwan, 1957-2001	Background: The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has been falling in many developed countries; however, there is a trend of an increasing proportion of TB among the elderly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the age transition of patients with TB in Taiwan from 1957 to 2001. Methods: Data on the number of TB cases and patient age were collected from the National Tuberculosis Registry for three different 5-year periods: 1957-1961, 1977-1981, and 1997-2001. The distribution of TB cases in these three different periods was analyzed. Results: The age distributions of TB patients were different among the 1957-61 (n = 26,000), 1977-81 (n = 31,363) and 1997-2001 (n = 71,447) groups. During the 1957-61 period, the most common age group was 25-44 years (50.9%). During 1977-81, the most common age group was 45-64 years (44.9%). In 1997-2001, the most common age group had shifted to people aged 65 years or older (43.7%). For the whole period from 1957 to 2001, after adjusting for age shifts in the general population, the proportion of TB patients had significantly increased in persons 65 years or older, slightly increased in persons aged 0-14 years, and decreased in the 15-24, 25-44, and 45-64-year-old age groups. For the period 1977-2001, age-specific registered case rates increased with age. Conclusion: The age of TB patients in Taiwan showed a rising trend from 1957 to 2001. A high index of suspicion and prompt investigation of elderly patients with signs and symptoms characteristic of TB may allow earlier diagnosis and treatment. ©2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33847382372	Outcome of pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: A 6-yr follow-up study	A retrospective study was performed to determine factors associated with the outcome of pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Taipei, Taiwan. All patients newly diagnosed with pulmonary MDR-TB in a referral centre from 1992-1996 were enrolled and their outcome over the subsequent 6 yrs was determined. A total of 299 patients were identified, comprising 215 (71.9%) males and 84 (28.1%) females with a mean age of 47.3 yrs. The patients received a mean of 3.7 effective drugs. Out of the 299 patients, 153 (51.2%) were cured, 31 (10.4%) failed, 28 (9.4%) died and 87 (29.1%) defaulted. Of the 125 patients receiving second-line drugs with ofloxacin, 74 (59.2%) were cured. Those who received ofloxacin had a lower risk of relapse than those receiving only first-line drugs (hazard ratio (HR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.03-0.81) and a lower risk of TB-related death than those receiving second-line drugs but not ofloxacin (adjusted HR 0.50, 95% Cl 0.31-0.82). In conclusion, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients who received ofloxacin were more likely to be cured, and were less likely to die, fail or relapse. The utility of new-generation fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin, in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis needs to be evaluated. Default from treatment is a major challenge in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Copyright © ERS Journals Ltd 2006.

0032816145	Annual risk of tuberculous infection in Taiwan, 1996-1998	Tuberculosis is still an important public health issue in Taiwan, and monitoring the trend of annual risk of infection (ARI) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is essential. In this study, we conducted tuberculin skin tests to estimate the prevalence and annual risk of M. tuberculosis infection in first-grade schoolchildren in Taiwan Province. Because mass bacille Calmette- Guerin (BCG) vaccination programs have been carried out here, only non-BCG- vaccinated students were tested. From September 1996 through June 1998, there were 520,866 registered first-grade elementary school students in Taiwan Province. Of them, 15,147 (2.9%) were non-BCG-vaccinated, as determined by the absence of a BCG scar. All of them were tested for M. tuberculosis infection with 1 tuberculin unit (0.1 mL injection) of purified protein derivative RT23, by means of the Mantoux technique. Among the tested schoolchildren, 430 (2.8%) had a positive tuberculin reaction. Thus, the calculated ARI was 0.44%. The ARI varied in different areas of Taiwan, being highest (1.04%) in Nantou County and lowest (0.14%) in Miaoli and Tainan Counties. The ARI in aboriginal areas (1.16%) was 2.7 times that in nonaboriginal areas (0.42%). Our results indicate that the M. tuberculosis ARI is still high in Taiwan. To achieve the World Health Organization target of less than 0.1% for industrialized countries, we must intensity, tuberculosis control programs in Taiwan.

Methods:A total of 56 clinical isolates of MTB, including 23 multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates and 33 susceptible isolates, were tested for susceptibility to rifampin and rifabutin using the absolute concentration method. The concentrations of drugs tested were 2.5 and 5 mg/mL for rifampin and 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2,5, 5, and 10 mg/mL for rifabutin. Results: All 33 MTB isolates that were susceptible to rifampin were also susceptible to rifabutin. None of the 23 MDR-MTB isolates were inhibited by rifabutin at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Among these 23 MDR isolates, three were susceptible to rifabutin at concentrations ≥ 0.5 mg/mL, six were susceptible to rifabutin at concentrations ≥ 5 mg/mL, 18 were susceptible to rifabutin at concentrations ≥ 10 mg/mL and five were not inhibited at any of the concentrations tested. The cross-resistance rate between rifampin and rifabutin was 87%. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the in vitro activity of rifabutin against drug- susceptible MTB isolates is greater than that of rifampin. For MDR-MTB isolates, the cross-resistance is high between rifampin and rifabutin.

0033817071	Comparison of the BACTEC MGIT 960 with Lowenstein-Jensen medium for recovery of mycobacteria from clinical specimens	SETTING: Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate of recovery and the mean time to detection (TTD) of mycobacteria in clinical specimens with two culture systems, the BACTEC MGIT 960 and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium. DESIGN: We studied 365 specimens, collected from 166 patients. Specimens were processed with standard N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method, then inoculated onto BACTEC MGIT 960 and onto LJ slants. RESULTS: A total of 124 mycobacterial isolates (114 Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 10 non-tuberculous mycobacteria) were detected. The recovery rates were 94% (117/124) with BACTEC MGIT 960 and 75.8% (94/124) with LJ. The rates of contamination for each of the systems were 5.5% with BACTEC MGIT 960 and 4.1% with LJ. The TTDs for mycobacteria were 10.7 days with BACTEC MGIT 960 and 30.6 days with LJ. Excluding the non-tuberculous mycobacteria, the TTDs for M. tuberculosis were 11.1 days with BACTEC MGIT 960 and 30.7 days with LJ. The difference in TTD between smear-positive and smear-negative specimens for either mycobacteria (10.0 vs 12.6 days; P = 0.06) or M. tuberculosis (10.1 vs 12.7 days; P = 0.06) with BACTEC MGIT 960 was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The BACTEC MGIT 960 system can expedite the recovery of mycobacteria in culture. Combined with conventional solid medium, it also increases the overall recovery of mycobacteria in culture.

58149396527	Tuberculosis outcomes in Taipei: Factors associated with treatment interruption for 2 months and death	SETTING: All individuals reported as being treated for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among citizens of Taipei City, Taiwan, in 2003. OBJECTIVES: To investigate risk factors associated with treatment interruption for at least 2 consecutive months and death. DESIGN: The outcome of PTB cases was determined by consulting medical charts. RESULTS: Of 1127 PTB patients registered, 824 (73.1%) were successfully treated, 189 (16.8%) died, 65 (5.8%) interrupted treatment, 17 (1.5%) were still on treatment 15 months after commencing treatment and 32 (2.8%) failed. The only significant factor associated with treatment interruption was visits to other health facilities after commencing tuberculosis (TB) treatment. TB patients had a standardised mortality ratio of 8.7 (95%CI 7.5-10.0). Factors significantly associated with death were age (adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] 1.06. 95%CI 1.05-1.08), sputum culture not performed/unknown (adjHR 2.07, 95%CI 1.47-2.92), and comorbidity with respiratory disease (adjHR 1.68,95%CI 1.24-2.27), infectious disease (adjHR 2.80, 95%CI 2.07-3.78), renal disease (adjHR 2.58,95%CI 1.82-3.66) or cancer (adjHR 3.31, 95%CI 2.35-4.65), compared with other patients. CONCLUSION: Visits to other health facilities were associated with interruption of treatment for at least 2 months. A high proportion of deaths was due to old age and comorbidity. © 2009 The Union.

79951889240	Hepatitis associated with prothionamide for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Timely and intensive monitoring for, and management of, adverse effects caused by anti-tuberculosis drugs are essential components of control programs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This retrospective case series was conducted in northern Taiwan from January 2007 to December 2008 at Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital, a 750-bed tertiary-care center and MDR-TB referral center. Hepatitis associated with prothionamide was defined as the recurrence of hepatitis after a second prothionamide treatment re-challenge. In total, 47 patients with MDR-TB enrolled in the Directly Observed Therapy, Short Course-Plus Program were identified during the study period, and 44 (93.6%) were treated with prothionamide. Seven of these 44 patients (15.9%) developed hepatitis after being treated with prothionamide concurrent with other anti-tuberculosis agents. Hepatitis associated with prothionamide occurred in three of these seven patients (6.8%). In these three patients, hepatitis developed following treatment with prothionamide for 28 days, 39 days or 45 days. Hepatitis developed rapidly after re-challenge with prothionamide at 4 days, 4 days and 3 days, respectively. Liver function returned to the normal range after cessation of prothionamide treatment for 19 days, 27 days or 28 days. Close monitoring of liver function was necessary in MDR-TB patients who received prothionamide treatment. © 2010 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

44949128156	Tuberculosis among foreign-born persons in Taiwan, 2002-2005	Background/purpose: The foreign-born population has been growing in Taiwan. Most foreign-born persons come from countries with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB). Monitoring the trend and characteristics of TB in this population is essential for TB control in Taiwan. Methods: Information about foreign-born persons residing in Taiwan and data of all foreign-born TB cases notified during 2002-2005 were obtained from the national authorities and analyzed. Results: A total of 2444 foreign-born TB cases were notified during 2002-2005, which accounted for 3.6% of all notified TB cases during that period in Taiwan. The proportion of foreign-born TB cases was constant, without any significant yearly variation. The average annual TB notification rate in the foreign-born population was higher than that in the Taiwan-born population (94.0/100,000 vs. 72.0/100,000). There were significant differences in age, sex and regional distribution between foreign-born and Taiwan-born TB cases (p<0.001). Foreign-born cases were predominantly female (65.4%) and aged 25-44 years (70.9%), whereas the majority of cases among the Taiwan-born population were male (69.4%) and aged ≥ 65 years (49.6%). Most foreign-born TB patients (62.7%) lived in northern Taiwan but only about one-third (36.1%) of Taiwan-born TB cases were notified from that region. Among foreign-born TB cases whose original countries were recorded, the majority came from Mainland China and Vietnam, which accounted for 73.0% of all cases, followed by the Philippines (7.4%), Thailand (7.3%) and Indonesia (6.0%). Conclusion: Foreign-born TB patients have different profiles and a higher case rate compared to Taiwan-born patients. Monitoring the epidemiologic trend of TB among foreign-born persons, especially those who come from high TB-burden countries, is essential in the fight against TB in Taiwan. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

61449201882	NAT2 fast acetylator genotypes are associated with an increased risk for lung cancer with wildtype epidermal growth factor receptors in Taiwan	Identifying the risk factors responsible for lung cancer especially for nonsmokers is critical for both its prevention and treatment. Studies have linked the polymorphisms in N-acetyltransferases (NAT2), a key enzyme for metabolism of hydrocarbons, with lung cancer in Asian female nonsmokers. Since a high percentage of lung adenocarcinoma in Asian female nonsmokers contains activating hotspot mutations in epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), we hypothesized that NAT2 polymorphisms might represent a risk factor in lung cancer with EGFR mutations. We studied NAT polymorphisms in 117 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and in 119 healthy controls and EGFR hotspot mutations in exons 18-21 in 100 of the 117 patients using polymerase chain reactions. NAT2 fast acetylator genotypes were significantly associated with patients with lung cancer (P = 0.04, odds ratio (OR): 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-3.57). Further analyses revealed that NAT2 fast acetylator genotypes were significantly associated with NSCLC with wildtype EGFR (P = 0.008, OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.31-7.63), but not with those with EGFR mutations (P = 0.40). Therefore, NAT2 fast acetylator genotypes are a potential risk factor especially for lung cancer with wildtype EGFR. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

62749171844	Nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infection in medical intensive care unit: The incidence, patient characteristics, and clinical significance	Background: The clinical significance of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary infection in medical intensive care unit (ICU) is still unclear. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective study in the medical ICUs of a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to June 2007. Patients with NTM isolated from respiratory specimens within 1 month before or during the ICU course were identified. Those who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of NTM pulmonary infection were identified and compared with patients with NTM colonization and control subjects who were culture-negative for mycobacteria. Results: Among the 5,378 patients admitted to medical ICUs, 2,866 (53.3%) had received mycobacterial culture for respiratory specimens. NTM were isolated from 169 (5.8%) patients. Of them, 47 (27.8%) were considered NTM pulmonary infection. M. avium complex and M. abscessus were the most common pathogens. Within 100 days after ICU admission, significantly more patients with NTM infection died than those with NTM colonization and control subjects (47 vs. 8 vs. 14%, P < 0.001). Twenty-one (49%) patients with NTM pulmonary infection received anti-NTM treatment, with four experiencing adverse effects. Although statistically insignificant, anti-NTM treatment was associated with prolonged survival for those who died in the ICU and shorter ICU stay for those who survived the ICU course. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that NTM pulmonary infection seems to associate with higher mortality in medical ICUs. Anti-NTM treatment is probably associated with a better outcome. Therefore, keeping a high suspicion when NTM is isolated and using careful consideration when starting anti-NTM treatment should be emphasized. © The Author(s) 2008.

67649229153	Thrombin-induced connective tissue growth factor expression in human lung fibroblasts requires the ASK1/JNK/AP-1 pathway	Thrombin plays an important role in lung inflammatory diseases. Thrombin can induce connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression in lung fibroblasts. However, little is known about the signaling pathway in thrombin-induced CTGF expression. In this study, we investigated the role of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in thrombin-induced CTGF expression in human lung fibroblasts. Thrombin caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in CTGF expression in WI-38 cells and primary lung fibroblasts. Thrombin-induced CTGF expression and CTGF-luciferase activity were inhibited by a protease-activated receptor 1 antagonist (SCH79797), the dominant-negative mutants (DNs) of ASK1 and JNK1/2, and an AP-1 inhibitor (curcumin).

0035035155	Pulmonary resection in the treatment of patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in taiwan	SETTING: Chronic Disease Control Bureau, Department of Health, Taiwan. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of pulmonary resection in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin (MDR-TB). DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort study, 27 MDR-TB patients who underwent pulmonary resection between December 1990 and March 1999 were reviewed. Individually-tailored treatment regimens were selected at a once-weekly staff conference following review of the patient's case history and drug susceptibility results. Surgery was performed for selected patients, essentially those: 1) whose medical treatment had failed, or for whom treatment failure seemed highly likely, or for whom post-treatment relapse seemed likely, 2) with predominantly localised disease, 3) with adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, and 4) whose treatment regimen had been composed of at least two effective drugs to diminish the mycobacterial burden. RESULTS: There was no surgical mortality apart from one peri-operative death (4%). Three patients (11%) developed complications, and 24 (92%) patients demonstrated sputum conversion and/or remained negative after surgery. Twenty-three patients have already completed treatment, and during a mean of 42 ± 18 follow-up months (range 15-80 months), one patient relapsed. This patient was disease-free after another course of treatment. CONCLUSION: For selected patients, pulmonary resection may improve the outcome of pulmonary MDR-TB.

74549202127	Use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids is associated with pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	The use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has recently been shown to increase the incidence of pneumonia. However, to our knowledge, the impact of high-dose ICS on pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has never been investigated. To study that impact, we conducted a retrospective study including patients aged more than 40 years old with irreversible airflow limitation between August 2000 and July 2008 in a medical center in Taiwan.Of the 36,684 patients who underwent pulmonary function testing, we included 554 patients. Among them, patients using high-dose ICS (equivalent to >500 μg/d of fluticasone) were more likely to have more severe COPD and receive oral corticosteroids than those using medium-dose, low-dose, or no ICS. Sixteen (3%) patients developed active pulmonary TB within a follow-up of 25,544 person-months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the use of high-dose ICS, the use of 10 mg or more of prednisolone per day, and prior pulmonary TB were independent risk factors for the development of active pulmonary TB. Chest radiography and sputum smear/culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be performed before initiating high-dose ICS and regularly thereafter.

74949113382	Tuberculosis-related deaths without treatment	Of 536 culture-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients notified in 2003 in Taipei, 507 (94.6%) received anti-tuberculosis treatment in reporting health facilities and 29 (5.4%) did not. Of these 29 patients, 26 (89.7%) died, 2 (6.9%) were re-notified 1 year later and 1 (3.5%) was lost to follow-up. In multivariate analysis, patients aged ≥65 years, patients with negative smear or smear not done, patients with sepsis and/or respiratory failure and patients with liver diseases were significantly less likely to receive anti-tuberculosis treatment. Overall, of the 536 TB patients, 97 (18.1%) died, of whom 26 (26.8%) died without anti-tuberculosis treatment. © 2009 The Union.

79951724050	Clinical and microbiological characteristics of urine culture-confirmed genitourinary tuberculosis at medical centers in Taiwan from 1995 to 2007	All patients with urine culture-confirmed genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) diagnosed between 1995 and 2007 at two medical centers in northern Taiwan were included in this retrospective study. Genotypes of 48 preserved Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from these patients were determined by spoligotyping and double repetitive element PCR (DRE-PCR) analysis. Among the 64 patients, 38 (59.4%) were male with a mean ±SD age of 60.3 ± 16.1 years old. The overall mortality rate was 26.2%. Poor prognostic factors included age over 65 years (HR = 4.03; 95%; CI: 1.27-12.76), cardiovascular disease (HR = 5.96; 95% CI: 1.98-17.92), receiving steroids (HR = 10.16; 95% CI: 2.27-45.47), not being treated (HR 4.81; 95% CI 1.12-20.67). Spoligotyping and DRE-PCR of the 48 MTB isolates revealed that 20 (41.7%) belonged to the Beijing family and 40 (83.3%) had a clustering pattern. Identification of a Beijing family isolate was not correlated with drug resistance or mortality. Clustering strains were likely to be resistant to isoniazid (OR = 4.71; 95% CI: 1.10 to 23.53). In this study of patients with urine culture-confirmed GUTB, age and coexisting diseases were independently associated with an unfavorable outcome. The Beijing family was the dominant genotype of GUTB isolates, but did not correlate with drug resistance or outcome. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79956011071	Contribution of rural-to-urban migration in the prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis in China	Increased drug resistance rates to the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs and multidrug resistance (MDR) were observed in China. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in urban China and, more specifically, to determine the contribution of migration to case burden and drug resistance rates of urban cities. A facility-based epidemiological study of all active TB patients reported in the four districts of Shanghai and Ningbo between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 was conducted. Residents had significantly higher drug-resistance rates than migrants (any drug resistance: 29.8% vs. 23.5%, respectively, P=0.038; MDR: 10.9% vs. 6.1%, P=0.048). Previously treated migrant patients were more likely to harbor drug-resistant TB and MDR-TB than new migrant cases, with adjusted odds ratios of 3.85 and 6.52, respectively. In total, 46.2% of the previously treated cases were resistant to INH, 38.5% to SM, 33.3% to RMP and 30.8% to EMB, while 13.1%, 17.5%, 7.0% and 6.8% of new cases were resistant to the four agents, respectively. To prevent the transmission of drug-resistant TB among migrants and residents, improved case management and appropriate treatment regimens should be sustained to prevent acquired drug resistance. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

79960668738	Mixed infection with Beijing and non-Beijing strains in pulmonary tuberculosis in Taiwan: Prevalence, risk factors, and dominant strain	Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) can be simultaneously infected with different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mixed infection). We investigated the prevalence and risk factors of mixed infection by Beijing and non-Beijing strains in pulmonary TB patients in Taiwan. We developed a quantitative PCR method to simultaneously detect the presence of Beijing and non-Beijing strains. A total of 868 pretreatment samples (from 868 patients), including 563 sputum samples smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli and 305 liquid medium samples culture-positive for mycobacteria, were tested. Medical records of patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB were reviewed. The detection limit of our quantitative PCR method was five copies of target sequences. With mycobacterial culture result as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of our quantitative PCR method were 95% and 98%, respectively. M. tuberculosis strains were isolated in 466 samples, of which 231 (49.6%) were infected with a Beijing strain. Another 14 patients (3.0%) had mixed infection, with the Beijing strain being the dominant strain in 13 (93%). Age <25 years with pulmonary cavities was associated with mixed infection. In patients infected with non-Beijing strains, the bacterial load of non-Beijing strains was lower among those with mixed infection than among those without. Our quantitative PCR method was accurate in detecting Beijing and non-Beijing strains in smear-positive sputum and culture-positive liquid medium samples. Mixed infection was present in pulmonary TB patients (3.0%), especially in those aged <25 years with pulmonary cavities. Beijing strains seem to be more dominant than non-Beijing strains in patients with mixed infection. © 2010 The Authors.

80052738117	Initial presentations predict mortality in pulmonary tuberculosis patients - a prospective observational study	Background: Despite effective anti-TB treatments, tuberculosis remains a serious threat to public health and is associated with high mortality. Old age and multiple co-morbidities are known risk factors for death. The association of clinical presentations with mortality in pulmonary tuberculosis patients remains an issue of controversy. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled newly diagnosed, culture-proven pulmonary tuberculosis patients from five medical centers and one regional hospital, which were referral hospitals of TB patients. Radiographic findings and clinical symptoms were determined at the time of diagnosis. Patients who died for any reason during the course of anti-TB treatment were defined as mortality cases and death that occurred within 30 days of initiating treatment was defined as early mortality. Clinical factors associated with overall mortality and early mortality were investigated. Results: A total of 992 patients were enrolled and 195 (19.7%) died. Nearly one-third (62/195, 31.8%) of the deaths occurred before or within 30 days of treatment initiation. Older age (RR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.03-1.05), malignancy (RR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.77-3.31), renal insufficiency (RR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.12-2.80), presence of chronic cough (RR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.47-0.84), fever (RR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.09-1.94), and anorexia (RR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.07-2.06) were independently associated with overall mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly higher mortality in patients present with fever (p<0.001), anorexia (p = 0.005), and without chronic cough (p<0.001). Among patients of mortality, those with respiratory symptoms of chronic cough (RR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.33-0.98) and dyspnea (HR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27-0.98) were less likely to experience early mortality. The radiological features were comparable between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions: In addition to demographic characteristics, clinical presentations including the presence of fever, anorexia, and the absence of chronic cough, were also independent predictors for on-treatment mortality in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. © 2011 Feng et al.

80053196838	Use of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 in non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease	BACKGROUND: Serum biomarkers are rarely studied in patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTM-LD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) and other inflammatory markers in NTM-LD. DESIGN: From April 2009 to March 2010, patients with NTM culture-positive respiratory specimens who were clinically and radiographically suspected of NTM-LD were evaluated for serum levels of sTREM-1, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and interferon-gamma. RESULTS: Of the 86 patients enrolled, 60 fulfilled the diagnosis of NTM-LD. Using the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, serum sTREM-1 had the highest discriminative power for NTM-LD and colonisation (area under the curve = 0.714). Using a cut-off value of 180 pg/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of sTREM-1 were respectively 58% and 89%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Mycobacterium avium complex, M. kansasii, positive sputum acid-fast smear and higher serum sTREM-1 level were independent risk factors for NTM-LD. Age ≥65 years and higher serum sTREM-1 level were associated with worse 6-month survival. CONCLUSION: In patients with respiratory specimens that are culture-positive for NTM with clinical suspicion of NTM-LD, serum sTREM-1 level measurements may be helpful in diagnosing and predicting outcome for NTM-LD. © 2011 The Union.

81255135743	Thrombin induces inducible nitric oxide synthase expression via the MAPK, MSK1, and NF-κB signaling pathways in alveolar macrophages	In this study, we investigated the roles of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), mitogen stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in thrombin-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in alveolar macrophages (NR8383). Treatment of NR8383 cells with thrombin caused an increase in iNOS expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of NR8383 cells with SB203580 (4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-2-[4-(methylsulfinyl)phenyl]-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H- imidazole, a p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD98059 (2′-amino-3′- methoxyflavone, a MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor), and SP600125 (anthra[1-9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one, a JNK inhibitor) all inhibited thrombin-induced iNOS expression. Stimulation of cells with thrombin caused an increase in p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with Ro 31-8220 (an MSK1 inhibitor) and MSK1 small interfering RNA (MSK1 siRNA) both inhibited thrombin-induced iNOS expression. Thrombin caused time-dependent activation of MSK1 Ser531 phosphorylation, which was inhibited by SB203580 and PD98059, but not by SP600125. Treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, an NF-κB inhibitor) inhibited thrombin-induced iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of NR8383 cells with thrombin induced κB-luciferase activity and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation. Thrombin-induced increases in p65 Ser276 phosphorylation and κB-luciferase activity were inhibited by SB203580, PD98059, Ro 31-8220, and MSK1 siRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the signaling pathways of MAPK, MSK1, and NF-κB play important roles in thrombin-induced iNOS expression in alveolar macrophages. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

83555177194	The analysis between functional human telomerase reverse transcriptase MNS16A polymorphisms and the risk of developing non-small cell lung cancer in the taiwanese population	Background: MNS16A is a functional polymorphic tandem repeat in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Its variant (long-long, LL genotype) has been associated with an increased risk for developing lung cancer in Caucasians. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of MNS16A genotypes in non-small cell lung cancers and whether these variant genotypes represent a genetic risk factor for lung cancer in Taiwan. Methods: A retrospective case study and the genotypes of MNS16A were compared between 205 lung cancer patients and 219 normal individuals using conventional polymerase chain reactions. Results: In the Taiwanese population, the distribution of the MNS16A variants LL and LS was 89.95% and 10.06%, respectively; less than 1% of our study population had the SS genotype. Statistical analysis revealed that MNS16A variants were not associated with an increased risk for lung cancer, after stratification for age, sex, pathology, stages, smoking history, or the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Conclusion: In contrast with the early study obtained from the Caucasian population, MNS16A polymorphisms might not be a key genetic risk factor for developing non-small cell lung cancer in the Taiwanese population. © 2011.

83555177226	Association of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes and clinical and epidemiological features - A multi-center study in Taiwan	Genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) are related to the geographic origin of the patients and population migration. The relationship between genotypes of MTB and clinical presentations has mainly focused on transmission of multi-drug resistant MTB strain in population. This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology and dynamic change of MTB genotypes in Taiwan, and their association with clinical presentation among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. A multi-center, two-year study which enrolled 516 patients with 516 MTB isolates was conducted, including: (1) 254 isolates from northern Taiwan; (2) 38 isolates from mid-western Taiwan; (3) 211 isolates from southern Taiwan; and (4) 13 isolates from the east coast of Taiwan. The isolates were genotyped with spoligotyping and standardized 12-loci-MIRU-VNTR method. The results showed Beijing/Beijing-like family was the major genotype of MTB in the northern (58%), eastern (53%), and southern (33%) regions. The second most widely spread lineage were the EAI-Manila (20% in the west and south) and Haarlem family (13-27% in the south, west, and east). According to the cluster analysis of 12-MIRU-VNTR genotypes, there were differences in distribution of MTB genotype between the northern and southern regions, and a temporal relationship between isolation year and 12-MIRU-VNTR genotype especially in loci 26 and 39 might exist. Furthermore, some patients with cavity lesions on chest films were associated with a cluster of Beijing family MTB strains, which can be defined by cluster analysis of 12-MIRU-VNTR genotype. However, the results of 12-loci-MIRU-VNTR genotyping in a longitudinal study should be interpreted with caution due to its short term instability. Further investigations of different molecular methodologies are necessary. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84860511960	Osthole inhibits the invasive ability of human lung adenocarcinoma cells via suppression of NF-κB-mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression	The induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is particularly important for the invasiveness of various cancer cells. Osthole, a natural coumarin derivative extracted from traditional Chinese medicines, is known to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells, but the effect of osthole on the invasiveness of tumor cells is largely unknown. This study determines whether and by what mechanism osthole inhibits invasion in CL1-5 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Herein, we found that osthole effectively inhibited the migratory and invasive abilities of CL1-5 cells. A zymographic assay showed that osthole inhibited the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 in CL1-5 cells. Inhibition of migration, invasion, and MMP2 and/or MMP-9 proteolytic activities was also observed in other lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H1299 and A549). We further found that osthole inhibited MMP-9 expression at the messenger RNA and protein levels. Moreover, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that osthole inhibited the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 by suppressing the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-κB in the MMP-9 promoter. Using reporter assays with point-mutated promoter constructs further confirmed that the inhibitory effect of osthole requires an NF-κB binding site on the MMP-9 promoter. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that osthole inhibited NF-κB activity by inhibiting IκB-α degradation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that osthole inhibits NF-κB-mediated MMP-9 expression, resulting in suppression of lung cancer cell invasion and migration, and osthole might be a potential agent for preventing the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862785589	Super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for use in extrapulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis	E149-E157 The limited sensitivity of serological tests for mycobacterial antigens has encouraged the development of a nanoparticle probe specific for the extrapulmonary form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We developed an innovative probe comprised of super-paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles conjugated with Mtb surface antibody (MtbsAb-nanoparticles) to provide ultrasensitive imaging of biomarkers involved in extrapulmonary Mtb infection. MtbsAb-nanoparticles were significantly conjugated with Mtb bacilli. The extent of contrast enhancement reduction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for Mtb and human monocytic THP1 cells was proportional to the concentration of MtbsAb-nanoparticles. When MtbsAb-nanoparticles were intravenously injected into mice bearing Mtb granulomas, the granulomatous site showed a 14-fold greater reduction in signal intensity enhancement on T

84863172644	UGT1A1 polymorphisms associated with risk of induced liver disorders by anti-tuberculosis medications	First-line drug treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is frequently associated with liver toxicity. The goal of this study was to examine the association between UDP-glucuronosyl- transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) genetic variations and anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH). A total of 98 patients, including 17 patients with ATDH, were enrolled; compound UGT1A1*27 and UGT1A1*28 were associated with an increased risk for developing ATDH after adjusting for age (OR 13.859; 95%CI 1.085-177.056). These findings require confirmation. However, screening for genetic variations prior to TB treatment may reduce the incidence of ATDH and improve treatment adherence. © 2012 The Union.

84863131841	Association of low activity of UGT1A7 with Lung Cancer in Taiwan: A preliminary case control study	This study was aimed to evaluate the correlation between the polymorphisms of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases1A7 (UGT1A7) gene and the risk of lung carcinogenesis in the Taiwanese population. A total of 230 lung cancer patients and 230 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals were enrolled in this case control study. UGT1A7*1 was defined as a high activity allele, while UGT1A7*2, UGT1A7*3 and UGT1A7*4 were categorized as low activity alleles. The relationship between EGFR mutations and UGT1A7 polymorphisms was investigated in this study. The frequency of UGT1A7*2 and UGT1A7*3 was significantly higher in the lung cancer group than in the control group (p = 0.03, odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.99 for UGT1A7*2; and p = 0.01, OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.11-2.18 for UGT1A7*3). The frequency of lower activity alleles was significantly higher in the lung cancer group than in the control group (p = 0.03, OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.04-2.40 for the high-activity allele/low-activity allele (H/L) group; and p < 0.01, OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.29-3.84 for the low-activity allele/low-activity allele (L/L) group). This difference was only significant in the male subgroup, with odds ratio of 1.87 (95% CI = 1.05-3.36, p = 0.03) for the H/L group and 2.638 (95% CI = 1.28-5.42, p < 0.01) for the L/L allele group. Yet, pathologic type and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations did not affect the distribution of UGT1A7 in the patient group. The results suggested that the polymorphisms of the metabolic gene, UGT1A7, may contribute to reduced enzyme activity and subsequently affect the detoxification of carcinogens. It is therefore concluded that UGT1A7 polymorphism is associated with lung carcinogenesis for the Taiwanese population.

84865300822	Gender differences in treatment outcomes of tuberculosis patients in Taiwan: A prospective observational study	Gender disparities in tuberculosis (TB) cases are reported worldwide, and socio-cultural factors have been proposed as possible causes. To date, gender differences in treatment outcomes of TB patients remain controversial. In this prospective observational study, newly diagnosed, culture-proven TB patients from six hospitals in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. Gender differences in demographic characteristics and treatment outcomes, including sputum conversion and on-treatment mortality, were analysed accordingly. From January 2007 through to December 2009, a total of 1059 patients were enrolled, including 819 (77.3%) males and 240 (22.7%) females. The ratio of male gender was around 50∼60% in TB patients below 35years and >80% for those older than 65years. When compared with the female patients, the male patients were older, more likely to have the habit of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, malignancy and liver cirrhosis, and more likely to present with haemoptysis, body weight loss and pleural effusion. Regarding treatment outcomes, male gender is associated with a lower 2-month sputum culture conversion rate (78.8% vs. 89.3%, p0.002) and higher on-treatment mortality (21.1% vs. 12.1%, p0.002). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly higher mortality in the men (p0.005). In multivariate analysis, male gender was an independent risk factor for 2-month sputum culture un-conversion (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.12-3.41). Our findings suggest that male gender is associated with older age, more co-morbidities and worse treatment outcomes. Gender-specific strategies, including active case finding in elderly women and smoking cessation in male patients, are warranted to optimize TB management. © 2012 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

84865433355	Improved consistency in dosing anti-tuberculosis drugs in Taipei, Taiwan	Background: It was reported that 35.5% of tuberculosis (TB) cases reported in 2003 in Taipei City had no recorded pre-treatment body weight and that among those who had, inconsistent dosing of anti-TB drugs was frequent. Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have taken actions to strengthen dosing of anti-TB drugs among general practitioners. Prescribing practices of anti-TB drugs in Taipei City in 2007-2010 were investigated to assess whether interventions on dosing were effective. Methodology/Principal Findings: Lists of all notified culture positive TB cases in 2007-2010 were obtained from National TB Registry at Taiwan CDC. A medical audit of TB case management files was performed to collect pretreatment body weight and regimens prescribed at commencement of treatment. Dosages prescribed were compared with dosages recommended. The proportion of patients with recorded pre-treatment body weight was 64.5% in 2003, which increased to 96.5% in 2007-2010 (p<0.001). The proportion of patients treated with consistent dosing of a 3-drug fixed-dose combination (FDC) increased from 73.9% in 2003 to 87.7% in 2007-2010 (p<0.001), and that for 2-drug FDC from 76.0% to 86.1% (p = 0.024), for rifampicin (RMP) from 62.8% to 85.5% (p<0.001), and for isoniazid from 87.8% to 95.3% (p<0.001). In 2007-2010, among 2917 patients treated with either FDCs or RMP in single-drug preparation, the dosage of RMP was adequate (8-12 mg/kg) in 2571(88.1%) patients, too high in 282(9.7%), too low in 64(2.2%). In multinomial logistic regression models, factors significantly associated with adequate dosage of RMP were body weight and preparations of RMP. Patients weighting <40kg (relative risk ratio (rrr) 6010.5, 95% CI 781.1-46249.7) and patients weighting 40-49 kg (rrr 1495.3, 95% CI 200.6-11144.6) were more likely to receive higher-than-recommended dose of RMP. Conclusions/Significance: Prescribing practice in the treatment of TB in Taipei City has remarkably improved after health authorities implemented a series of interventions. © 2012 Chiang et al.

84866151483	Future individualized therapy for lung cancer in post-genomic era	Since lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, patients usually require systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or targeted agents, to control their disease. In the past, patients are treated in a trial-and-error fashion. Now with the advances in genomic sequencing, the application of mutation screening particularly in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-ras to predict the response to targeted agents has gradually become a routine practice. In addition, multiple biomarkers have been identified to correlate not only the response but also the side effects of cancer treatment. However, translating the new information into the care of lung cancer has yet been fully realized. To accomplish the goal of individualized therapy, we need a comprehensive approach to integrate current individual genomic information into our clinical practice in the post-genomic era. In this chapter, we review current development in the integration of pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics and new biomarkers and hope to depict the future of individualized therapy for lung cancer. The integration might allow us to optimize the efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents with minimized toxicity, so patients with lung cancer will receive the right agents with the right dose at the right time in the modern post-genomic era. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

0036980796	Screening for pulmonary tuberculosis among military conscripts in Taiwan	Background and Purpose: Military service is obligatory for young men who are medically fit in Taiwan. Each year, all 19-year-old men are notified to undergo a required health check to determine their eligibility for military service. This study determined the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) among military conscripts in 1997 and 1998 and evaluated the effect of the mass radiographic screening program for military conscripts on the reported TB case rate. Methods: During the annual health check, all 19-year-old men in Taiwan undergo miniature (70 × 70 mm) chest roentgenography (CXR). Those who have suspicious lesions on miniature films are notified to undergo follow-up CXR (14 × 14 inch) and sputum examinations. All these data for the period from 1997 to 1998 were analyzed to determine the prevalence of pulmonary TB. To evaluate the effect of the mass radiographic screening program among military conscripts on the reported TB case rates, annual data for newly diagnosed pulmonary TB in 1997 and 1998 were obtained from the National TB Register and analyzed by age and sex. Results: A total of 305,140 men eligible for military service underwent the required examination in 1997 and 1998. Pulmonary TB was diagnosed in 237 (0.08%) of these men, and 21 (6.9/100,000) had positive bacteriologic findings. In 1997 and 1998, the annual reported TB case rates for males and females were similar in both children and young adults, except for an early peak among men aged 19 years. Conclusion: The screening program resulted in a significant increase in the reported TB case rate among males aged 19 years. However, a low bacteriologic confirmation rate implies the possibility of over-diagnosis with CXR. Mass radiographic screening at the health check for military conscripts is inefficient in detecting bacteriologically confirmed TB, an observation with implications for screening policy development by the national TB program.

Two PKC inhibitors (Go 6976 and Ro 31-8220), an NF-κB inhibitor (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; PDTC), and long-term (24 h) 12-phorbol-13-myristate acetate (PMA) treatment each also inhibited LTA-induced iNOS expression and NO release. Treatment of cells with LTA caused an increase in PKC activity; this stimulatory effect was inhibited by D-609, U-73122, or Ro 31-8220. Stimulation of cells with LTA caused IκB-α phosphorylation and IκB-α degradation in the cytosol, and translocation of p65 and p50 NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus. Treatment of cells with LTA caused NF-κB activation by detecting the formation of NF-κB-specific DNA-protein complexes in the nucleus; this effect was inhibited by Go 6976, Ro 31-8220, long-term PMA treatment, PDTC, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and calpain inhibitor I. These results suggest that LTA might activate PC-PLC and PI-PLC to induce PKC activation, which in turn initiates NF-κB activation, and finally induces iNOS expression and NO release in RAW 264.7 macrophages.

84871953130	Thrombin-induced CCN2 expression in human lung fibroblasts requires the c-Src/ JAK2/STAT3 pathway	Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease and an important fibrotic mediator that induces CCN2 expression. We previously showed that thrombin induces CCN2 expression via an ASK1-dependent JNK/AP-1 pathway in human lung fibroblasts. In this study, we further investigated the roles of c-Src, JAK2, and STAT3 in thrombin-induced CCN2 expression. Thrombin-induced CCN2 expression and CCN2-Luc activity were attenuated by a JAK inhibitor (AG490) and JAK2DN, STAT3DN, and the STAT decoy ODN. Moreover, transfection of cells with a CCN2-mtSTAT-Luc construct inhibited thrombin-induced CCN2-Luc activity. Treatment of cells with thrombin caused JAK2 phosphorylation at Tyr1007/1008 and STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 in time-dependent manners. Thrombin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited by AG490 and JAK2DN. Thrombin-induced STAT3 binding to the CCN2 promoter was analyzed by a DNA-binding affinity pull-down assay. In addition, thrombin-induced CCN2 expression and CCN2-Luc activity were inhibited by c-SrcDN and PP2 (an Src inhibitor). Transfection of cells with c-SrcDN also inhibited thrombin-induced JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that thrombin might activate c-Src to induce JAK2 activation, which in turn, causes STAT3 activation, and finally induces CCN2 expression in human lung fibroblasts. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.

84874394770	Effectiveness of a Government-Organized and Hospital-Initiated Treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients-A Retrospective Cohort Study	Background: In contrast to the conventional model of hospital-treated and government directly observed treatment (DOT) for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patient care, the Taiwan MDR-TB Consortium (TMTC) was launched in May 2007 with the collaboration of five medical care groups that have provided both care and DOT. This study aimed to determine whether the TMTC provided a better care model for MDR-TB patients than the conventional model. Methods and Findings: A total of 651 pulmonary MDR-TB patients that were diagnosed nation-wide from January 2000-August 2008 were enrolled. Of those, 290 (45%) MDR-TB patients whose initial sputum sample was taken in January 2007 or later were classified as patients in the TMTC era. All others were classified as patients in the pre-TMTC era. The treatment success rate at 36 months was better in the TMTC era group (82%) than in the pre-TMTC era group (61%) (p<0.001). With multiple logistic regressions, diagnosis in the TMTC era (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-4.2) was an independent predictor of a higher treatment success rate at 36 months. With the time-dependent proportional hazards method, a higher treatment success rate was still observed in the TMTC era group compared to the pre-TMTC era group (adjusted hazard ratio 6.3, 95% CI 4.2-9.5). Conclusion: The improved treatment success observed in the TMTC era compared to the pre-TMTC era is encouraging. The detailed TMTC components that contribute the most to the improved outcome will need confirmation in follow-up studies with large numbers of MDR-TB patients. © 2013 Chan et al.

84875001127	Thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 release is mediated by c-Src-dependent Shc, Raf-1, and ERK pathways in lung epithelial cells	In addition to its functions in thrombosis and hemostasis, thrombin also plays an important role in lung inflammation. Our previous report showed that thrombin activates the protein kinase C (PKC)α/c-Src and Gβγ/Rac1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways to induce IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β) activation, NF-κB transactivation, and IL-8/CXCL8 expressions in human lung epithelial cells (ECs). In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of c-Src-dependent Shc, Raf-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways involved in thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 release. Thrombin-induced increases in IL-8/CXCL8 release and κB-luciferase activity were inhibited by the Shc small interfering RNA (siRNA), p66Shc siRNA, GW 5074 (a Raf-1 inhibitor), and PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor). Treatment of A549 cells with thrombin increased p66Shc and p46/p52Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/240 and Tyr317, which was inhibited by cell transfection with the dominant negative mutant of c-Src (c-Src DN). Thrombin caused time-dependent phosphorylation of Raf-1 and ERK, which was attenuated by the c-Src DN. Thrombin-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation was inhibited by GW 5074 and PD98059. Treatment of cells with thrombin induced Gβγ, c-Src, and p66Shc complex formation in a time-dependent manner. Taken together, these results show for the first time that thrombin activates Shc, Raf-1, and ERK through Gβγ, c-Src, and Shc complex formation to induce IKKα/β phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and IL-8/CXCL8 release in human lung ECs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84881667804	Impact of epidermal growth factor receptor mutations on intracranial treatment response and survival after brain metastases in lung adenocarcinoma patients	Introduction: Brain metastases (BM) commonly occur in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and usually lead to a poor prognosis and quality of life despite of radiotherapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) mutations have been widely demonstrated to be a predictive and prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinoma, however, its impact on BM from lung adenocarcinoma remains inconclusive. The present study aimed to elucidate the predictive role of EGFR mutations in BM treatment response and survival after BM in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Material and methods: From January 2006 through February 2012, 180 of 505 lung adenocarcinoma patients developed BM during their disease course were reviewed for eligibility, and 139 patients, including 89 EGFR-mutant and 50 EGFR wild-type patients, were identified for analysis. Results: Of the patients eligible for evaluation of treatment response, up to 85% received radiotherapy and the remaining took EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as the front modality for BM. EGFR-mutant patients, compared with EGFR wild-type patients, had significantly greater intracranial treatment response of BM (84% vs. 48%, P= 0.002), experienced higher therapeutic efficacy to radiotherapy (86% vs. 52%, P= 0.005), and had longer median survival after BM diagnosis (13.2 vs. 6.8 months, P<. 0.001). Furthermore, EGFR mutation ( P= 0.002) and performance status ( P= 0.009) were independently associated with BM treatment response. Additionally, EGFR mutation ( P= 0.005), good performance status ( P<. 0.001) and absence of extracranial metastases ( P= 0.033) correlated with better survival. Conclusion: EGFR mutation is an independent predictive factor for both BM treatment response and survival after BM in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Further prospective studies on incorporation of EGFR mutation status into therapeutic strategy and survival prediction system for lung adenocarcinoma with BM are warranted. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84882283779	Plasma long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) concentration is a novel marker of disease activity in patients with community-acquired pneumonia	Background: Long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is an acute-phase protein secreted by various cells, including leukocytes and endothelial cells. Like C-reactive protein (CRP), it belongs to the pentraxin superfamily. The aim of this study was to investigate the differential changes in plasma levels of PTX3 between before and after antibiotic treatment in hospitalized adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods: Plasma PTX3 levels were measured in 61 adult patients with CAP and 60 healthy controls using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon initial hospitalization, APACHE II, CURB-65, and pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores were determined to assess CAP severity in patients. Results: The results showed a decline in the number of white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophils, and decreases in the concentrations of CRP and PTX3 observed after antibiotic treatment. The plasma concentration of PTX3, but not CRP, was correlated with the severity of CAP based on the PSI (r = 0.290, p = 0.023), CURB-65 (r = 0.312, p = 0.015), and APACHE II scores (r = 0.427, p = 0.001). The PTX3 level also exhibited a significant correlation with the length of hospital stay (r = 0.500, p<0.0001). Conclusions: PTX3 may be able to play a role in the diagnosis and clinical assessment of the severity of CAP, which could potentially guide the development of treatment strategies.

84882805566	Connective tissue growth factor induces collagen I expression in human lung fibroblasts through the Rac1/MLK3/JNK/AP-1 pathway	Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) plays an important role in lung fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the role of Rac1, mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in CTGF-induced collagen I expression in human lung fibroblasts. CTGF caused concentration- and time-dependent increases in collagen I expression. CTGF-induced collagen I expression was inhibited by the dominant negative mutant (DN) of Rac1 (RacN17), MLK3DN, MLK3 inhibitor (K252a), JNK1DN, JNK2DN, a JNK inhibitor (SP600125), and an AP-1 inhibitor (curcumin). Treatment of cells with CTGF caused activation of Rac1, MLK3, JNK, and AP-1. The CTGF-induced increase in MLK3 phosphorylation was inhibited by RacN17. Treatment with RacN17 and the MLK3DN inhibited CTGF-induced JNK phosphorylation. CTGF caused increases in c-Jun phosphorylation and the recruitment of c-Jun and c-Fos to the collagen I promoter. Furthermore, stimulation of cells with the CTGF resulted in increases in AP-1-luciferase activity; this effect was inhibited by Rac1N17, MLK3DN, JNK1DN, and JNK2DN. Moreover, CTGF-induced α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression was inhibited by the procollagen I small interfering RNA (siRNA). These results suggest for the first time that CTGF acting through Rac1 activates the MLK3/JNK signaling pathway, which in turn initiates AP-1 activation and recruitment of c-Jun and c-Fos to the collagen I promoter and ultimately induces collagen I expression in human lung fibroblasts. agen I expression may help elucidate the role of CTGF in lung fibrosis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885960644	Human papillomavirus infections as a marker to predict overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma	Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been implicated in multiple cancers, but its significance in lung cancer has remained controversial. As the prevalence of HPV 16/18 infection was higher in lung adenocarcinoma among Taiwanese females, the aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical impact of HPV infections in lung adenocarcinoma. Two hundred and ten patients were enrolled to investigate the associations of HPV status in tumors with clinical characteristics as well as its impact on overall survival. The methods to assess HPV status were by immunohistochemistry for HPV L1 capsid protein and E6 protein and by nested polymerase chain reaction for HPV 16 and HPV 18. HPV infections were identified in 35.2% of patients, and associated with localized and smaller sized tumors (p = 0.022 and p = 0.002, respectively). Patients with HPV infections had a significantly better survival (p = 0.023, by log-rank test) and a significantly reduced mortality risk after adjustments of age, tumor extent, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations status and treatments [adjusted hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.49-0.96, p = 0.026, by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models]. Specifically, patients with both HPV infections and EGFR mutations had the best survival outcome [1-year survival rate, 68.5% (95% CI = 52.2-4.8%)]. Our findings indicate that HPV infections represent an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. © 2013 UICC.

84892802160	Future individualized therapy for lung cancer in post-genomic era	Since lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, patients usually require systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy or targeted agents, to control their disease. In the past, patients are treated in a trial-and-error fashion. Now with the advances in genomic sequencing, the application of mutation screening particularly in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-ras to predict the response to targeted agents has gradually become a routine practice. In addition, multiple biomarkers have been identified to correlate not only the response but also the side effects of cancer treatment. However, translating the new information into the care of lung cancer has yet been fully realized. To accomplish the goal of individualized therapy, we need a comprehensive approach to integrate current individual genomic information into our clinical practice in the post-genomic era. In this chapter, we review current development in the integration of pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics and new biomarkers and hope to depict the future of individualized therapy for lung cancer. The integration might allow us to optimize the efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents with minimized toxicity, so patients with lung cancer will receive the right agents with the right dose at the right time in the modern post-genomic era. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

84896114020	Plasma endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) in management of community-acquired pneumonia	Background: Endothelial cell-specific molecule (ESM)-1 is a soluble proteoglycan expressed by the vascular endothelium and which also circulates in the bloodstream. Inflammatory cytokines and proangiogenic growth factors increase its expression, and increased serum levels are found in immunocompetent patients with sepsis. The aim of this study was to investigate differential changes in plasma levels of ESM-1 before and after antibiotic treatment in hospitalized adult patients with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods: Plasma ESM-1 levels were measured in 82 adult patients with CAP and 82 healthy controls using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon initial hospitalization, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), CURB-65, and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) scores were determined to assess CAP severity in these patients. Results: Results showed a decline in the number of white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophils, and decreases in the concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and ESM-1 after antibiotic treatment. The plasma concentration of ESM-1, but not CRP or the WBC count, was correlated with the severity of CAP based on the PSI (r = 0.554, p < 0.001), CURB-65 (r = 0.510, p < 0.001), and APACHE II scores (r = 0.447, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Plasma levels of ESM-1 may be able to play a role in the diagnosis and clinical assessment of the severity of CAP, which could potentially guide the development of treatment strategies.

84899575373	Serum concentrations of cycloserine and outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Northern Taiwan	BACKGROUND: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been advocated to promote the efficacy of antituberculosis agents. Cycloserine (CS) is a second-line anti-tuberculosis drug whose serum concentrations in tuberculosis (TB) patients are largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate serum CS concentrations after drug ingestion in TB patients. METHODS: Multidrug-resistant TB patients who were taking CS in a tertiary care centre in northern Taiwan between 1 April 2009 and 31 October 2009 were enrolled in the study. Serum CS concentrations were measured at 2 and 6 h after drug administration. RESULTS: Of 32 patients enrolled, 23 were males and 9 females. The mean CS dose was 8.8 ± 1.3 mg/kg. The mean serum concentrations at 2 and 6 h were respectively 19.7 ± 8.3 and 18.1 ± 8.7 μg/ml. Seven patients (22%) had serum drug concentrations that were higher at 6 h than at 2 h, 12 (38%) had peak serum concentrations within the recommended range of 20-35 μg/ml; 18 patients (56%) had concentrations <20 μg/ml at both 2 h and 6 h; and 2 patients (6%) had at least one measurement >35 μg/ml. CONCLUSION: Lower than recommended serum CS concentrations and delayed absorption were common. It is essential to develop practical TDM to maintain proper serum drug concentrations. © 2014 The Union.

12344284773	Tuberculosis incidence and mortality in aboriginal areas of Taiwan, 1997-2001	Background and Purpose: People living in aboriginal areas of Taiwan are known to be at especially high risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). This study investigated the incidence and mortality of TB in aboriginal areas of Taiwan. Methods: The TB death statistics and notification data from the National TB Register and Department of Health in 1997-2001 were analyzed. Results: From 1997 to 2001, people living in aboriginal areas bore a disproportionate burden of TB disease in Taiwan, with mortality rates 5.5-6.5 times and incidence rates 3.6-5.2 times higher than those of people living in non-aboriginal areas. Among patients with TB living in aboriginal areas, 381 died, accounting for 5.1% of the 7480 TB deaths in Taiwan. A large proportion of the patients with TB who died were older than 65 years, in both aboriginal (40.2%) and non-aboriginal (78.5%) areas; however, the age of TB patients who died in non-aboriginal areas was significantly older (p < 0.001). TB patients living in the aboriginal areas accounted for 3.6% (2618/71,447) of the total number of reported TB patients in Taiwan, and 32.7% were in the age range from 24-45 years. In contrast, TB patients living in non-aboriginal areas were typically older, with only 20.1% in the 24-45 age range (p < 0.001) and 44.4% older than 65 years (p < 0.001). In terms of incidence and mortality rates, men predominated in both groups; however, this pattern was less prominent in aboriginal areas than in non-aboriginal areas. Conclusions: The mortality rates and incidence of TB in aboriginal areas are much higher than those in non-aboriginal areas in Taiwan. Concentration of resources and programs to control TB in aboriginal areas may represent the most effective use of resources for fighting TB.
