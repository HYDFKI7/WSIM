21944446182	PH domain and cell's sense of direction	The cell's sense direction is closely related with the proteins that contain PH (pleckstrin homology) domain. PH domain has been found in about 60 proteins, many of which could activate the sequent events of signal transduction via combining with the related binding sites on the surface of chematactic cells. The characteristics of this combining are: a. rapid and transient; b. It is only related to the concentration gradient of surroundings outside cells, which is the base of spatial model; c. The distribution of the binding sites on the cell membrane changes when the researchers altered the position of the chemoattractant. This is the base of temporal model. To deeply investigate the effects of all kinds of proteins which contain PH domain on cell's sense of direction will greatly promote the research of this field, and hence, has great theoretical significance.

2442484471	E-selectin and stroke	The expression of E-selectin was increased in stroke. E-selectin play various roles in regulating the functions of the cerebral vessels, and the most important of which is to mediate neutrophils adhesion to endothelial cell. E-selectin was expressed on the surface of endothelial cells activated by cytokines and then result in neutrophils activating, rolling, adhering, and migrating into injuried tissue and then leading to secondary tissue damage. Soluble E-selectin(sE) levels rose within 24 to 36 hours after cerebral ischemia, and dropped significantly near to the initial levels during the following days in most of stroke patients. Experimental studies also showed that the expression of E-selectin was increased in local cerebral ischemia, and the infarct volume was decreased and the survivial rate were improved in the IgG antibody of E-selection treated group. E-selectin expression and the brain function of stroke patients were alleviated by recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator(rtPA). Due to the inefficiency of anti-ICAM treatment on the stroke patients, more and more attentions was paid to humanized E-selectin antibody.

33745753729	Identification of an active site on the laminin α4 chain globular domain that binds to αvβ3 integrin and promotes angiogenesis	Angiogenesis is important for wound healing, tumor growth, and metastasis. The laminin α4 chain, a component of laminin-8 and -9, is expressed in endothelial cell basement membranes. It mediates endothelial cell adhesion by binding with its receptors such as αvβ3 integrin and participates in new blood vessel formation. In this study, we found the recombinant laminin α4LG modules (rLG1-3, rLG1, and rLG2) mediate HUVECs adhesion. The attachment of HUVECs to the rLG2 was specifically inhibited by a function-blocking monoclonal antibody LM609 specific for αvβ3 integrin. Using deletion mutants of the α4LG2 revealed the HUVECs-adhesion site is located in amino acids 1121-1139. A synthetic G

33847153057	Association between angiotensinogen, angiotensin II receptor genes, and blood pressure response to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor	BACKGROUND - To identify the genetic contribution to the variation in blood pressure (BP) response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin receptor 1 (AGTR1), and angiotensin receptor 2 (AGTR2) genes were evaluated for their association with BP response to ACEI in Chinese patients with hypertension in a 2-stage design. METHODS AND RESULTS - We selected 1447 hypertensive patients from a 3-year benazepril postmarket surveillance trial and genotyped them for 14 SNPs in the AGT, AGTR1, and AGTR2 genes. The AGT rs7079 (C/T) SNP (3′-untranslated region) was significantly associated with the response of diastolic BP to benazepril (diastolic BP response: -7.4 mm Hg for subjects with the CC genotype, -8.9 mm Hg for CA, and -10.1 mm Hg for AA; P=0.001). Although there was no association of individual SNPs in the AGTR1 gene, there was a graded response between common haplotypes and systolic BP reduction in the order of haplotype 2 (H2)/lack of haplotype 3 (non-H3) (-13.6 mm Hg) > non-H2/non-H3 (-10.9 mm Hg) > H3/non-H2 (-6.6 mm Hg) (P=0.004). The total variations in response to ACEI therapy that were explained by the AGT SNP and AGTR1 haplotype groups were 13% for systolic and 9% to 9.6% for diastolic BP, respectively. CONCLUSION - AGT SNP rs7079 and AGTR1 haplotypes were associated with BP reduction in response to ACEI therapy in hypertensive Chinese patients. This will be useful in future studies, providing genetic markers to predict the hypertensive response to ACEI therapy. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.

34547907626	Indomethacin-loaded polymeric nanocarriers based on amphiphilic polyphosphazenes with poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) and ethyl tryptophan as side groups: Preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation	The effects of copolymer composition, drug structure and initial drug feed on drug loading of polymeric micelles based on amphiphilic polyphosphazenes were investigated. It was found that the drug loading capacity of micelles based on this type of amphiphilic copolymers was mainly determined by copolymer composition and the chemical structure of drug. In addition to the compatibility between drug and micellar core, hydrogen bonding interaction between drug and hydrophilic corona may significantly influence drug loading as well. In vitro drug release in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) suggested that indomethacin (IND) in the micelles was released through Fickian diffusion, and no significant difference in release rate was observed for micelles based on copolymers with various EtTrp content. Compared with in vitro IND release profile, in vivo pharmacokinetic study after subcutaneous administration provides a more sustained release behavior. Additionally, in comparison with free drug solution at the same dose, IND concentration in rat plasma showed a prolonged retention when the drug was delivered through polymeric micelles. In vivo pharmacodynamic study based on both carrageenan-induced acute and complete Freund's adjuvant-induced adjuvant arthritis model indicated that sustained therapeutic efficacy could be achieved through intraarticular injection of IND-loaded micelles. Most importantly, local delivery of IND can avoid the severe gastrointestinal stimulation, which was frequently associated with oral administration. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34548572027	Local delivery of indomethacin to arthritis-bearing rats through polymeric micelles based on amphiphilic polyphosphazenes	Purpose. Preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of indomethacin-loaded polymeric micelles based on amphiphilic polyphosphazene. Methods. Amphiphilic polyphosphazenes (PNIPAAm/EAB-PPPs) with poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (EAB) as side groups were synthesized through thermal ring-opening polymerization and subsequent substitution reactions. Indomethacin (IND) loaded polymeric micelles based on PNIPAAm/EAB-PPPs were prepared by dialysis procedure. In vitro IND release kinetics was investigated in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), while in vivo pharmacokinetics was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats. In vivo pharmacodynamic study was carried out based on two animal models, i.e. carrageenan-induced acute paw edema and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced ankle arthritis model. Results. Drug loading capacity of micelles based on this type of amphiphilic copolymers was mainly determined by copolymer composition and the chemical structure of drug. In addition to the compatibility between drug and micellar core, hydrogen bonding interaction between drug and hydrophilic corona may significantly influence drug loading as well. In vitro drug release in PBS suggested that there was no significant difference in release rate between micelles based on copolymers with various EAB content. Compared with the rats administered with free IND aqueous solution, IND concentration in rats' plasma showed a prolonged maintenance in experimental group treated with IND-loaded polymeric micelles. In vivo pharmacodynamic study indicated that sustained therapeutic efficacy could be achieved through topical injection of the aqueous solution of IND-loaded micelles. Local delivery of IND can avoid the severe gastrointestinal stimulation, which was frequently associated with oral administration as evidenced by ulceration evaluation. Conclusions. The promising results of current preliminary study suggest that this type of amphiphilic copolymers could be used as injectable drug carriers for hydrophobic drugs. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

38049057749	Alterations of proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20 peptide in rats with pulmonary hypertension induced by high pulmonary blood flow	Objective: The mechanism of high pulmonary blood flow-induced pulmonary hypertension remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of proadrenomedullin N-terminal 20-peptide (PAMP) on pulmonary hypertension, through examining the alterations of pulmonary PAMP expression and plasma PAMP concentration in rats with pulmonary hypertension induced by high pulmonary blood flow. Methods: Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (n = 8) and shunt groups (n = 8). Aortocaval shunting was produced in the shunt group. After 11 weeks of shunting, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (dPAP) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) were evaluated by using a right cardiac catheterization procedure. The ultrastructural changes in intra-acinar pulmonary arteries were observed. The concentration of plasma PAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay. The expression of PAMP in pulmonary arteries was detected by immunohistochemical assay. Results: sPAP, dPAP and mPAP were significantly increased in shunt rats compared with controls (P < 0.01). Ultrastructural changes, such as hyperplasia and swelling of endothelial cells, irregularity of internal elastic laminar, and hypertrophy and increased number of synthetic phenotype of smooth muscle cells, were found in intra-acinar pulmonary muscularized arteries in the shunt group. Plasma PAMP concentration (616 ± 195 pg/mL vs 427 ± 90 pg/mL) and PAMP expression in endothelial cells (0.62 ± 0.09 vs 0.38 ± 0.12) and in smooth muscle cells (0.24 ± 0.07 vs 0.14 ± 0.05) of pulmonary arteries increased significantly in the shut group compared with controls. Conclusions: The up-regulation of pulmonary and plasm PAMP expression might be involved in the development of high pulmonary blood flow-induced pulmonary hypertension.

38949192896	Clinicopathologic analysis of dilated heart in cardiac transplant recipients	Objective: To study the pathologic features of dilated heart in cardiac transplant recipients, with clinicoradiologic correlation. Methods: Sixty recipient hearts from cardiac transplantation performed in Fuwai Hospital were analyzed by gross examination, histologic observation and electron microscopy. Clinicoradiologic correlation was available in 40 cases. Results: Amongst the 40 cases of dilated heart, 52. 5% (21/40) were due to dilated cardiomyopathy, 22. 5% (9/40) due to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 15.0% (6/40) due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the remaining 10.0% (4/40) due to miscellaneous causes, including local noncompaction of ventricular myocardium, giant cell myocarditis, alcoholic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive cardiomyopathy. The discrepancy rate between clinical and pathologic diagnosis was 37.5% (15/40). The erroneous categories included arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (7 cases), ischemic cardiomyopathy (5 cases), and giant cell myocarditis (1 case), which were all mistaken clinically as dilated cardiomyopathy. While ischemic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, noncompaction of ventricular myocardium and giant cell myocarditis have distinctive pathologic features, the diagnosis of alcoholic and hypertensive cardiomyopathies required clinicopathologic correlation. Dilated cardiomyopathy due to viral myocarditis was not identified in the cases studied. Conclusion: Pathologic examination is essential in analysis of transplant recipient heart and helps to rectify clinical diagnostic discrepancy.

31844453946	Effects of PNS on stability of atherosclerotic plaque and initial investigation for its mechanism	Aim: The instability of atherosclerotic plaque was the critical factor inducing heart events, and effective remedies for this are deficient at present. Rabbit atherosclerotic models were set up to study the effects of total saponin of Panax notoginseng (PNS) on stability of atherosclerotic plaques, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in plaques were detected by immunohistochemistry, which provided evidence for searching effective drug for amending stability of atherosclerotic plaque. Methods: Rabbit atherosclerotic models were set up by hypercholestermia diet. Total areas of endomembrane and plaque, thickness of endomembrane and tunica media, contents of lipid were all measured by Image Pro Plus 4.5. Contents of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in plaque were detected by immunohistochemical method. Results: In PNS group, area of plaque was smaller, endomembrane and fibrous cap were thinner compared with the control group. Contents of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and lipid found in PNS group decreased, but thickness of fibrous cap increased. Conclusion: PNS could enhance stability of atherosclerotic plaque by downregulating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in plaques.

Evidences suggested that the structure of capsule wall was different from that of conventional PE capsules, and the wall permeability of these PE capsules changed significantly. Lysozyme, a positively charged protein in neutral solution, was studied as a model protein to be encapsulated into the "micelles enhanced" PE capsules. Confocal laser scanning microscope was used to observe the entrapping process in real time, while UV-Vis spectroscope and scanning force microscope measurements suggested the high efficiency of encapsulation. In addition, the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique was employed to determine the existence form of deposited molecules. Further studies showed even negatively charged water-soluble peptides or proteins can be encapsulated into these hybrid capsules by modulating the pH value in bulk solution under its isoelectronic point as well. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

50649083057	Panax notoginseng saponins attenuate atherosclerosis in rats by regulating the blood lipid profile and an anti-inflammatory action	1. Previous studies have reported on the anti-atherosclerotic effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-atherosclerotic effects of PNS and the inflammatory response. 2. Thirty rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely a control group, a group, in which zymosan A was used to induce inflammation (Zym group) and a PNS-treated group. Rats in the three groups were administered liquid paraffin (i.p.), zymosan A (20 mg/kg, i.p., once every 3 days) or zymosan A and PNS (100 mg/kg, i.p., once daily), respectively. All animals were fed a high-fat diet for 9 weeks. At scheduled times, rats were killed, blood was collected and the aorta was removed. Pathological changes in aortas were observed using Sudan IV staining and transmission electron microscopy. Serum lipids were measured enzymatically. Whole-blood viscosity was observed at different shear rates. The expression of cardiovascular disease-specific genes was determined using GEArray (SuperArray, Frederick, MA, USA). Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression levels of nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p65 and its inhibitor IκBα in the aortic wall. 3. In the present study, typical pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis in rats following induction by zymosan A were alleviated by PNS treatment. In the PNS-treated group, there was a marked reduction in total serum cholesterol, triglycerides and blood viscosity. In addition, PNS treatment significantly decreased the gene expression of some inflammatory factors, such as integrins, interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1β and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. The expression of NF-κB/p65 was attenuated, whereas the expression of IκBα was significantly increased, after treatment with PNS. 4. In conclusion, it appears that PNS exerts its therapeutic effects on atherosclerosis through an anti-inflammatory action and regulation of the blood lipid profile and that an NF-κB signalling pathway is involved. © 2008 The Authors.

50149093853	Physicochemical characterization, in vitro, and in vivo evaluation of indomethacin-loaded nanocarriers self-assembled by amphiphilic polyphosphazene	Copolymeric nanocarriers assembled by amphiphilic polyphosphazene bearing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and ethyl glycinate (EtGly) as substitutes, were investigated as drug vehicles for indomethacin (IND). The physicochemical characteristics of the novel nanocontainers were studied, including lower critical solution temperature (LCST), critical micelle concentration (CMC) and drug loading capacity. LCST measurements revealed that copolymer is more sensitive to the introduction of salts into aqueous solution compared with homopolymer. A significant decrease in CMC was observed when the temperature increased above LCST. As evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement, morphological transformation from multicompartment into spherical nanoparticles was observed when nanocarriers with higher IND content were concerned. In vitro release tests suggested that IND-loaded nanocontainers exhibited pH dependent release profiles. In vivo pharmacokinetic study after subcutaneous administration provided a relatively sustained release behavior. Additionally, compared with free drug solution at the same dose, IND concentration in rat plasma showed a prolonged retention in experimental group treated with IND-loaded micelles. In vivo pharmacodynamic study based on both carrageenan-induced acute and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced adjuvant-arthritis models indicated that sustained therapeutic efficacy could be achieved through intraarticular injection of IND-loaded micelles. Most importantly, local delivery of IND can avoid the severe gastrointestinal stimulation, which is frequently associated with oral administration. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

55349132751	Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups in a Chinese Uygur population and their potential association with longevity	1. The haplogroups and polymorphisms of mitochondrial (mt) DNA are associated with longevity. This association is highly geographically dependent. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between mtDNA haplogroups, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and longevity in the Chinese Uygur population. 2. Ninety-eight Uygur Chinese subjects aged over 90 years (vitality 90+) and 117 healthy young controls living in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China were chosen for the present study. Frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups and SNPs in the subjects were analysed using polymerase chain reaction. The entire mtDNA genome was sequenced and the mtDNA haplogroups and SNPs were determined. 3. Nine haplogroups were identified in the Chinese Uygur population and the frequency of haplogroup J was higher in control subjects than in the vitality 90+ group (odds ratio = 0.384; 95% confidence interval = 0.163-0.906; P = 0.025). Interestingly, most of the SNPs were in the D-loop region, with frequencies higher in the control group than in the vitality 90+ group. 4. In conclusion, mtDNA haplogroups are potentially associated with longevity in the Uygur Chinese population and the D-loop region is strongly involved in ageing-related events. © 2008 The Authors.

55349149049	Prenatal exposure to zymosan results in hypertension in adult offspring rats	1. Events in utero appear to have a significant role in the development of cardiovascular dysfunction in adulthood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of prenatal exposure to zymosan, a non-infectious and non-bacterial agent capable of inducing inflammation, on mean systolic arterial pressure (MSAP) in rat offspring at 6-66 weeks of age. 2. Pregnant rats were divided into three groups: (i) a control group, administered 0.5 mL, i.p., saline on gestation Days 8, 10 and 12; (ii) a zymosan-treated group, given 2.37 mg/kg, i.p., zymosan on gestation Days 8, 10 and 12; and (iii) a pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) + zymosan-treated group, which was given 100 mg/kg, i.p., PDTC 1 h before zymosan. At 6, 16, 26, 36, 56 and 66 weeks of age, MSAP was determined in rat offspring from all three groups. Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined in dams, as well as in offspring at 24 and 56 weeks of age. In addition, protein levels of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65) in the myocardium and kidney of offspring were determined at 24 weeks of age. 3. The results showed that MSAP and NF-κB (p65) levels in the myocardium and kidney of offspring from the zymosan-treated group were increased significantly compared with control. This increase was inhibited by concomitant treatment with PDTC. Serum TNF-α levels in dams exposed to zymosan and in their offspring at 56 weeks of age (but not at 24 weeks of age) were significantly increased compared with levels in the control group. Following lipopolysaccharide treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.) of adult rat offspring at 24 weeks of age, there was a further increase in serum TNF-α levels in offspring in the zymosan-treated group compared with the other two groups. 4. The findings of the present study suggest that non-bacterial inflammation during gestation can lead to hypertension in offspring and that NF-κB signalling may play a critical role in this process. © 2008 The Authors.

54749151061	Novel mutations of mitochondrial DNA associated with type 2 diabetes in Chinese Han population	Mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (mtSNPs) have been reported to associate with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but mtSNPs appear to be considerably different among different populations and regions. To determine mtSNPs in Chinese Han patients with T2DM. the entire sequences of the mitochondrial genomes from 72 T2DM Chinese (59 ± 4 years) and 50 age-matched healthy subjects (controls) in Chongqing region of Western China were directly sequenced and mtSNPs were analyzed. We found that M8, M9, D, G, R and A haplogroups exist in Chinese Han population and the frequency of haplogroup M9 was significantly higher in patients with T2DM than in the controls (p = 0.0006, OR 0.06 195% CI 0.008-0.4761). MtSNPs T3394C in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), G4491A in ND2, T16189C and T16519C were found with significantly higher frequency in patients with T2DM than in the controls (T16189C, p = 0.0045; T16519C, p < 0.0001; T3394C, p = 0.0015; G4491A, p= 0.0015). In contrast, the frequency of C5178A in ND2 and A10398G in ND3 was higher in the controls than in patients with T2DM (C5178A, p = 0.014; A10398G, p = 0.0011). Our results indicate that mtSNPs T3394C, G4491A, T16189C and T16519C show susceptible tendency to T2DM and mtSNPs C5178A and A10398G seem to be genetic factors for against T2DM.

60749132856	GCIP-27 inhibits the right ventricle remodeling in monocrotaline-treated rats	Aim: The effect and mechanism of GCIP-27 on the right ventricle remodeling by monocrotaline (MCT) were explored. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the normal group, MCT group and the low and high dose GCIP-27 treatment group. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PADP) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) were measured by right cardiac catheter on the 22 th day. RV and left ventricle plus septum were weighed separately. Right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) was measured by the weight ratio of RV to left ventricle plus septum. The histological examination of right ventricle were executed by light microscope and transmission electron microscope. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the paraffin-embedded right ventricle tissue using the anti-PCNA primary antibodies. Results: GCIP-27 (90 μg · kg

63149164219	Gαq-protein carboxyl terminus imitation polypeptide (GCIP)-27 inhibits right ventricular hypertrophy induced by monocrotaline in rats	This study was to investigate the probable inhibitory effect of Gαq-protein carboxyl terminus imitation polypeptide-27 (GCIP-27), the optimized form of GCIP, which is a competition candidate of the activated binding sites on Gαq, on the right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy induced by monocrotaline (MCT) in rats. We have previously shown that GCIP-27, can prevent the hypertrophyc responses in cultured rat cardiomyocytes induced by noradrenaline and angiotensin II. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose (50 mg/kg) of MCT subcutaneouly to induce pulmonary hypertension (PH) and RV hypertrophy. GCIP-27 (30, 90 μg/kg) or vehicle was administered (twice daily, intraperitoneally) from day 1 to day 21. GCIP-27 (90 μg/kg) inhibited the elevated pulmonary arteria systolic pressure (PASP) and mean pulmonary arteria pressure induced by MCT, but its dose at 30 μg/kg only reduced the elevated PASP. And no effect could be seen on the pulmonary arteria diastolic pressure at both two doses. On the other hand, the two doses of GCIP-27 improved significantly the weight ratio of RV to left ventricle plus septum, the RV free wall thickness and pulmonary arteria acceleration time (PAAT). In morphometric observation, GCIP-27 (30, 90g/kg) could attenuate cardiomyocytes hypertrophy, interstitium fibrosis, mitochondria swelling and malformation markedly in RVs of MCT-treated rats. Furthermore, GCIP-27 (30, 90 μg/kg) significantly reduced the overexpression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) induced by MCT in RV cardiocytes. The results suggest that GCIP-27 can effectively attenuate the RV hypertrophy induced by MCT in rats, which may be mediated by both the direct effect on cardiomyocyte and the secondary effect by reducing PH, and may be involved in its influence on the Gq signal pathway. © 2009 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

61749104320	Morphology modulation of polymeric assemblies by guest drug molecules: TEM study and compatibility evaluation	Amphiphilic copolymers with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and ethyl tryptophan, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, or ethyl glycinate as side groups were synthesized. Assemblies based on these copolymers were employed as model systems to investigate the morphology transformation upon loading of various hydrophobic drugs. TEM observation suggested that the loading of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, ketoprofen, indomethacin, naproxen and mefenamic acid, can trigger a significant morphological transformation of assemblies based on copolymers with low substitution of hydrophobic group. On the other hand, the introduction of steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (medroxyprogesterone acetate, prednisone acetate and dexamethasone) and aliphatic acids (caprylic acid, tetradecanoic acid and stearic acid) has no significant effect on the morphology of assemblies derived from the same copolymers, although they do have some effect on the morphology of assemblies based on copolymers with high content of hydrophobic group. In addition, the morphology of assemblies is well correlated with drug loading efficiency. An occurrence of morphology transformation means a higher drug loading, and vice versa. Various physicochemical parameters including partition coefficient, molecular volume and solubility parameters were calculated according to group contribution method. Analysis of these data pointed to the fact that a combination of molecular volume and solubility parameters can be used as a measure to judge whether one molecule is 'active' or 'neutral'. This rule can also be applied to evaluate the compatibility between candidate drugs and nanocarriers based on these copolymers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

67649647647	Role of anandamide transporter in regulating calcitonin gene-related peptide production and blood pressure in hypertension	Objectives To explore the role of anandamide (AEA) transporter in regulating calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) production and blood pressure. Methods and results Plasma levels of AEA, CGRP, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and nitric oxide in patients with essential hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and 2 kidney 1 clip hypertensive rats and the CGRP mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglion of rats were measured. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated to examine the AEA transporter activity, the role of AEA transporter in regulating CGRP mRNA expression or the effect of exogenous ADMA on AEA transporter activity. In both hypertensive patients and SHRs, the plasma level of AEA was elevated, but the AEA transporter activity was attenuated concomitantly with decreased CGRP production. Moreover, plasma ADMA level in SHRs was elevated accompanied by decreased nitric oxide level. By contrast, the plasma AEA level was elevated accompanied by increased CGRP production in 2 kidney 1 clip hypertensive rats, and there were no significant changes in plasma levels of ADMA, nitric oxide and the AEA transporter activity. In vitro, exogenous administration of AEA upregulated CGRP mRNA expression in lymphocytes, which was inhibited by AEA transporter blocker, AM404, and the AEA transporter activity was reduced by ADMA. Conclusion Decreased plasma CGRP level in patients with essential hypertension or SHRs is likely due to the reduced AEA transporter activity, and the increased ADMA level may account for the reduced AEA transporter activity.© 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health.

67650915289	Asymmetric dimethylarginine induces tissue factor expression in monocytes via NF-kappaB-dependent pathway: Role in acute coronary syndromes	Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a major endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, is recently defined as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Tissue factor (TF) expression and procoagulant activity (PCA) of peripheral monocytes are increased in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), which resulted in blood procoagulant state tending to thrombus formation. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ADMA contribute to TF expression of peripheral monocytes in ACS. Twenty patients with unstable angina (UA), 20 patients with stable angina (SA) and 20 control subjects were recruited. Monocytic cell line THP-1 was incubated with different concentrations of ADMA (1-10 μM) for various periods (6-24 h). Our results showed that plasma level of ADMA in patients with UA was significantly higher than those in patients with SA or in the control group, and positively correlated with TF antigen level and PCA of circulating monocytes. Adjusting for all patient characteristics, we confirmed these findings in multivariate regression analyses. In cultured THP-1 cells, ADMA transcriptionally upregulated both TF antigen expression and PCA in a concentration-dependent manner. The experiments using nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor and transient transfection with wild-type and mutated TF promotor constructs showed that the NF-κB is an important transcriptional regulator of ADMA-induced TF expression. Our results suggest that elevated plasma level of ADMA induces TF expression in monocytes via NF-κB-dependent pathway, which contributes to procoagulant phenotype of circulating monocytes in ACS. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

69949102992	Novel mitochondrial dna mutations associated with chinese familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder that has a complex set of symptoms and potentially devastating consequences. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are responsible for the development of HCM, but the mtDNA mutations appear to differ considerably among different populations and regions. In the present study, three families with HCM were found and investigated: one in Shandong province and two in the Chongqing region of China. The entire mtDNA genome from the 18 affected and 66 unaffected family members was sequenced directly and the mtDNA mutations were determined. The frequency of haplogroup M10 was significantly higher in family members with HCM (HCM group) than in unaffected family members (normal group). Three mtDNA mutations were found with a significantly higher frequency in affected individuals than in unaffected family individuals, namely G7697A in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene (P < 0.0001; odds ratio (OR) 227.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.6-2194.8) and T12477C (P = 0.0037; OR 5.6; 95% CI 1.8-17.6) and G13135A in the NADH dehydrogenase 5 gene (P < 0.0001; OR 26.0; 95% CI 6.9-98.3), suggesting that these mutations are probably associated with susceptibility to HCM. In addition, mitochondrial Complex I activity was markedly decreased in the HCM group, suggesting that these mutations most likely affect mitochondrial respiratory function. In conclusion, the results of the present study imply that mtDNA mutations G7697A, T12477C and G13135A are genetic factors that indicate a susceptibility to HCM and that could be used for the large-scale screening of genetic markers as well as the early diagnosis of HCM. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

68349083490	The HMG-CoA Reductase gene and lipid and lipoprotein levels: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis	HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) is an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis. To investigate the contribution of the HMGCR gene to lipids and lipoprotein subfractions in different ethnicities, we performed an association study in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In total, 2,444 MESA subjects [597 African-Americans (AA), 627 Chinese-Americans (CHA), 612 European-Americans (EA), and 608 Hispanic-Americans (HA)] without statin use were included. Participants had measurements of blood pressure, anthropometry, and fasting blood samples. Subjects were genotyped for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After excluding SNPs with minor allele frequency <5%, a single block was constructed. The most frequent haplotype was H1 (41-56%) in all ethnic groups except AA (H2a, 44.9%). Lower triglyceride level was associated with the H2a haplotype in AA and H2 in HA. In HA, H4 carriers had higher levels of triglyceride and small low-density lipoprotein (s-LDL), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), while carriers with H7 or H8 had associations with these traits in the opposite direction. No significant association was discovered in both CHA and EA. The total variation for triglyceride that could be explained by H2 alone was 2.6% in HA and 1.4% in AA. In conclusion, HMGCR gene variation is associated with multiple lipid/lipoprotein traits, especially with triglyceride, s-LDL, and HDL-c. The impact of the genetic variance is modest and differs greatly among ethnicities. © 2009 US Government.

70349755412	Polymeric nano-assemblies as emerging delivery carriers for therapeutic applications: A review of recent patents	Multi-morphologic polymer nano-assemblies, such as micelles and vesicles, have been intensively studied recently by scientists in the multidisciplinary fields for their promising applications in bioengineering, biomedicine and pharmaceutics. With the success of several micellar formulations in clinical trials, more and more therapeutics based on polymer assemblies are on the pipeline for clinical applications. The current review summarizes some recent patents on the polymer nano-assemblies including micelles and vesicles, with the focus on drug delivery and gene therapy. For the lack of updated patents, the selected progress made most recently in this field has been presented based on the newly published articles. The future development in this active and exciting field has been discussed as well. Because of the huge literature of scientific papers on delivery systems based on polymer assemblies in recent years, this review attempts to limit the specific examples to those that are currently in clinical trials. Accordingly, it is impossible to properly credit all the scientists in this field. The author apologizes in advance for all omissions. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

73349127751	Demethylbellidifolin prevents nitroglycerin tolerance via improved aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 activity	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of demethylbellidifolin (DMB), a major xanthone compound of Swertia davidi Franch, on nitroglycerin (NTG) tolerance. In the in vivo portion of the study, pretreatment of Sprague-Dawley rats with NTG (10mg/kg) for 8 days caused tolerance to the depressor effect of NTG. This was evident because the depressor effect of NTG (150μg/kg, i.v.) was almost completely abolished in the tolerant rats. The tolerance could be diminished by treatment with DMB. In the in vitro study, the exposure of aortic rings of Sprague-Dawley rats to NTG (10μM) for 30min caused tolerance to the vasodilating effect of NTG. The tolerance is evident because of a substantial right shift of the NTG concentration-relaxation curves. This shift was reduced by pretreatment of the aortic rings with DMB. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), incubation of NTG for 16h increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, attenuated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and decreased the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH-2), the main enzyme responsible for NTG bioactivation. All the effects mentioned above were prevented by co-incubation with DMB. In conclusion, DMB prevents NTG tolerance via increasing ALDH-2 activity through decreasing ROS production. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

77349105084	Effect of epidermal growth factor receptor on airway remodeling in asthmatic mice and its mechanism	Objective: To explore the relationship of airway remodeling with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) levels in asthmatic mice and the effect of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AG1478) on airway remodeling. Methods: Twenty-four male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal control, asthma, AG1478-treated. Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and a mouse model of asthma was prepared. Collagen deposition was determined in Masson-stained lung sections. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining was used to observe the proliferation of goblet cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the protein expression of HB-EGF. RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression of HB-EGF and EGFR. Results: The characteristic changes of airway remodeling occurred in the asthma group. The expression of HB-EGF and EGFR in the epithelial cells of bronchi in the asthma group was significantly higher than that in the normal control group. Compared with the asthma group, the AG1478-treated group had decreased inflammation reactions, decreased collagen deposition and proliferation of goblet cells and lower expression of EGFR and HB-EGF. Conclusions: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AG1478) ameliorates the progression of airway remodeling in mice with asthma by inhibitions of EGFR and HB-EGF expression and EGFR signal pathway.

75649149810	Resveratrol inhibits right ventricular hypertrophy induced by monocrotaline in rats	Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol in red wine, exhibits cardioprotective effects in vitro, such as inhibition of angiotensin II- or phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in rat neonatal myocyte cultures and suppression of cardiac fibroblast proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of RSV against monocrotaline (MCT)-induced right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy in rats. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single injection of MCT (50 mg/kg, s.c.) and were then treated with either vehicle (normal saline) or RSV (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.g., twice daily) for 21 days. A separate group of control rats were not injected with MCT and were treated with normal saline for 21 days. At the end of the treatment period, all rats were subjected to echocardiography and haemodynamic measurements. In addition, after rats had been killed, the hearts were subjected to histopathological, untrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses. 3. In vehicle-treated rats, MCT injection resulted in 33% mortality, whereas mortality in RSV-treated MCT-injected rats was 0%. In vehicle-treated rats, MCT increased RV free wall thickness and RV systolic pressure and decreased pulmonary arterial acceleration time at the end of the experimental period. These dynamic changes were ameliorated by RSV in a dose-dependent manner. Histologically, MCT injection resulted in RV hypertrophy, swollen mitochrondria and cardiomyocyte apoptosis; all these morphological changes were dose-dependently improved in rats treated with RSV. 4. In conclusion, RSV inhibits the RV hypertrophy induced by MCT in rats and this effect is mediated by both a direct effect of RSV on cardiomyocytes and an indirect effect mediated via a reduction in pulmonary hypertension. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

76849092004	Tetrandrine attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced fulminant hepatic failure in d-galactosamine-sensitized mice	Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) remains an extremely poor prognosis and high mortality; better treatments are urgently needed. Tetrandrine (TET), a traditional anti-inflammatory drug, has been reported to exhibit hepatoprotective activities in several liver injury models. We now investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of TET on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and d-galactosamine (d-GalN)-induced FHF in mice. TET (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally 1 h before LPS/d-GalN injection in mice. The mortality and liver injury was evaluated subsequently. The results showed that administering TET to mice reduced mortality and improved liver injury induced by LPS/d-GalN in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, TET dose-dependently inhibited LPS/d-GalN-induced NF-κB activation, serum and hepatic tissues tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production, caspase-3 activation and hepatocellular apoptosis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (ECAM-1) expression. Our experimental data indicated that TET might alleviate the FHF induced by LPS/d-GalN through inhibiting NF-κB activation to reduce TNF-α production. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77249121045	Prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide results in cognitive deficits in age-increasing offspring rats	Studies have suggested that maternal infection/inflammation maybe a major risk factor for neurodevelopmental brain damage. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of prenatal exposure to a low level of inflammatory stimulation lipopolysaccharide (LPS) repeatedly on spatial learning and memory performances in rat offspring's lifetime. Sixteen pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups. The rats in the LPS group were treated i.p. with LPS (0.79 mg/kg) at gestation day 8, 10 and 12; meanwhile the rats in the control group were treated with saline. After delivery, the rat offspring at 3- (young), 10- (adult) and 20-mon-old (aged) were allocated. Spatial learning and memory abilities were tested by Morris water maze. The structure of hippocampal CA1 region was observed by light microscopy. The expression of synaptophysin (SYP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal CA1 region were measured by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that the rat offspring of LPS group needed longer escape latency and path-length in the Morris water maze and presented a significant neuron loss, decreased expression of SYP, increased expression of GFAP in CA1 region in histological studies. All these changes were more significant with the age increasing. These findings support the hypothesis that maternal systemic inflammation may alter the state of astrocytes in rat offspring for a long time, the alteration may affect neurons and synapse development in neural system, increase the neurons' vulnerability to environment especially as the age increasing, at last result in distinct learning and memory impairment. © 2010 IBRO.

77955172689	Smad-dependent and smad-independent induction of id1 by prostacyclin analogues inhibits proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells in vitro and in vivo	Rationale: Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR-II) are responsible for the majority of cases of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Mutations lead to reduced Smad1/5-driven expression of inhibitor of DNA binding protein 1 (Id1) and loss of the growth suppressive effects of BMPs. The impact of existing PAH therapies on BMP signaling is lacking. Objective: Because prostacyclin analogues are effective treatments for clinical PAH, we hypothesized that these agents enhance Smad1/Id1 signaling. Methods and results: Iloprost alone induced Id1 expression in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), an effect that was independent of Smad1/5 activation but dependent on a cAMP-responsive element in the Id1 promoter. In addition, iloprost and treprostinil enhanced BMP-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and Id1 expression in a cAMP-dependent manner. The mechanism involved suppression of inhibitory Smad, Smad6. Furthermore, iloprost rescued the deficit in Smad1/5 phosphorylation and Id gene expression in PASMCs harboring mutations in BMPR-II and restored growth suppression to BMP4 in mutant PASMCs. We confirmed a critical role for Id1 in PASMC proliferation. Reduced expression of Id1 was observed in concentric intimal lesions of heritable PAH cases. In the monocrotaline rat model of PAH, associated with reduced BMPR-II expression, we confirmed that treprostinil inhibited smooth muscle cell proliferation and prevented progression of PAH while enhancing Smad1/5 phosphorylation and Id1 gene expression. Conclusions: Prostacyclin analogues enhance Id1 expression in vitro and in vivo and restore deficient BMP signaling in BMPR-II mutant PASMCs. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.

77956098022	Panax notoginseng saponins attenuate atherogenesis accelerated by zymosan in rabbits	Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are highly valued traditional Chinese medicine. The effects of PNS (120 mg/kg, once daily administrated intragastrically (i.g.)) on atherosclerosis induced by a high-cholesterol diet and chronic inflammation, which was derived through zymosan (10 mg/kg, once every 2 d) administration intraperitoneally, were evaluated in rabbits for 8 weeks. A normal group, a simple high-fat diet group, and a zymosan plus high-cholesterol diet group (Zym) were used as controls. Typical pathologic changes associated with atherosclerosis in rabbits following induction by zymosan were alleviated by PNS treatment. After 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment, PNS decreased the serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein as well as increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level significantly in comparison with those in the Zym group, except for triglycerides at week 2. In addition, PNS treatment significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of monocyte chemoattactant protein-1 and nuclear factor- B/p65 in the aorta wall after 8 weeks of treatment compared with the Zym group. In conclusion, PNS attenuates atherogenesis through an antiinflammatory action and regulation of the blood lipid profile. © 2010 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

77957771962	Panax notoginseng saponins decrease cholesterol ester via up-regulating ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in foam cells	Aim: Accumulating evidence has indicated that Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the major ingredients in Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen which could be found widely in Asia, can attenuate atherogenesis in vivo. This study was designed to examine the relationship of PNS with cholesterol ester in foam cells sourced from macrophages and the effect of PNS on the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Materials and methods: Foam cells sourced from macrophages were cultured with PNS. The content of cholesterol ester in foam cells was analyzed and expressions of ABCA1 and liver X receptor α (LXRα) in foam cells were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting methods. Results: The results showed that PNS could significantly decrease the level of cholesterol ester in foam cells at middle and high dosages. The real-time PCR and western blotting assays indicated that the expression of ABCA1 was up-regulated by PNS in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis based on these results showed that the cholesterol ester level was negatively correlated with ABCA1 expression. Conclusions: As a result, we conclude that by up-regulating the expression of ABCA1, PNS could lower the cholesterol ester level, which resulted in the attenuation of the foam cell formation. This bioactivity might be associated with the special chemical structures of PNS that are similar to the natural agonist of LXRα. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77958532102	Reversal of isoprenaline-induced cardiac remodeling by rutaecarpine via stimulation calcitonin gene-related peptide production	Dysfunction of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves is involved in cardiac remodeling, and rutaecarpine has been shown to exert a beneficial effect on cardiac function through activating the sensory nerves. This study was conducted to explore the potential inhibitory effect of rutaecarpine on cardiac remodeling and the underlying mechanisms. A rat cardiac remodeling model was established by injection of isoprenaline (5 mg/kg per day, s.c.) for 10 days. Rutaecarpine (10 or 40 mg/kg, i.g.) was coadministrated with isoprenaline to evaluate the effect of rutaecarpine on cardiac remodeling. After echocardiographic analysis was performed, blood samples were collected to quantify calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), dorsal root ganglia were isolated for examining CGRP mRNA expression, and the hearts were weighed and saved for evaluating the parameters related to apoptosis and hypertrophy. Isoprenaline significantly increased the ratio of left ventricle weight to body weight, the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes, cardiac apoptosis, and collagen deposition concomitantly with decreased CGRP production, which were reversed by rutaecarpine treatment. The beneficial effects of rutaecarpine were attenuated by pretreatment with capsaicin, which selectively depleted CGRP. These results suggest that rutaecarpine was able to reverse isoprenaline-induced cardiac remodeling through stimulating CGRP production.

78349279285	Involvement of asymmetric dimethylarginine and Rho kinase in the vascular remodeling in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension	Recent studies have shown that the plasma level of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) was increased accompanied by the decreased dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and ADMA was able to regulate pulmonary endothelial cells mobility through increasing the activity of Rho kinase (ROCK). This work was conducted to explore the role of ADMA/DDAH pathway in vascular remodeling in PH and the underlying mechanisms. The rat model of PH was established by a single injection of monocrotaline (60. mg/kg, s.c.). The pulmonary arterial pressure, the remodeling of pulmonary artery, the hypertrophy of right ventricle, the plasma levels of ADMA and NO, the expression of DDAH2, ROCK1 or ROCK2 and the ROCK activity were determined. In vitro studies, the pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were isolated and cultured. The effect of ADMA on PASMCs proliferation and ROCK activation was investigated. The results showed that the injection of monocrotaline successfully induced PH characterized by the increased pulmonary arterial pressure, vascular remodeling and right ventricle hypertrophy. The plasma level of ADMA was elevated concomitantly with the increased ROCK activity and ROCK1 expression as well as the decreased DDAH2 expression in pulmonary arteries. In the cultured PASMCs, ADMA promoted cellular proliferation accompanied by the increased ROCK1 expression and ROCK activity, which was attenuated by the ROCK inhibitor or by the intracellular antioxidant. These results suggest that ADMA could promote the proliferation of PASMCs through activating ROCK pathway, which may account for, at least partially, the vascular remodeling in monocrotaline-induced PH. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was to explore the role of intrarenal renin-angiotensin (Ang) system in the development of hypertension programmed by prenatal exposure to zymosan. Pregnant rats were randomly divided into control group and zymosan group (n=6). Rats in these two groups were administered intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml vehicle and 2.37 mg/kg zymosan, respectively, on the eighth, tenth, and 12th day during gestation. The results showed the glomerular number and creatinine clearance rate decreased significantly in offspring of zymosan-treated rats. The renal cortex renin mRNA expression, Ang II-positive cells in renal cortex, and Ang II expression in renal medulla increased significantly in offspring of zymosan-treated rats at 7, 16, and 25 weeks of age. The plasma renin activity and Ang II concentration were unchanged. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to zymosan resulted in the activation of intrarenal renin-Ang system in adult offspring rats. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79958276405	Protective effects of asiaticoside on septic lung injury in mice	Asiaticoside (AS), a major triterpenoid saponin component isolated from Centella asiatica, has been described to exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study aimed to determine the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of AS on septic lung injury induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice were pretreated with the AS (45. mg/kg) or AS as well as GW9662 at 1. h before CLP, the survival, lung injury, inflammatory mediators and signaling molecules, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) were determined 24. h after CLP. The results showed that AS significantly decreased CLP-induced the mortality, lung pathological damage, the infiltration of mononuclear, polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes and total proteins. Moreover, AS inhibited CLP-induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein in lung tissues, and the production of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Interestingly, the expression of PPAR-γ protein in lung tissue was up-regulated by AS. Furthermore, GW9662 (the inhibitor of PPAR-γ) significantly reversed these beneficial effects of AS in septic mice. These findings suggest that AS could effectively protect from septic lung injury induced by CLP and the underlying mechanisms might be related to up-regulation of PPAR-γ expression to some extent, which inhibits MAPKs and NF-κB pathway. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

79958292650	Highly efficient nanomedicines assembled via polymer-drug multiple interactions: Tissue-selective delivery carriers	This study presents the construction and evaluation of highly efficient nanomedicines via self-assembly directed by multiple non-covalent interactions between carrier polymer and cargo molecules, including hydrophobic, host-guest recognition, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces. β-Cyclodextrin conjugated polyethyleneimine (PEI-CD) was employed as the model carrier material, while indomethacin (IND), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was used as the drug model. Spontaneous assembly of PEI-CD and IND led to core-shell structured nanoparticles with a positive surface and pH-triggering behavior as well as high drug loading capacity. These nano-assemblies can function as gastro-OFF/intestinal-ON delivery systems to selectively transport payload to enteric sites, thereby dramatically increasing the oral bioavailability of the loaded therapeutic, which can also serve as multifunctional nano-platforms for multiple delivery of various therapeutics. In addition, the strategy employed herein may provide new insights into the design of novel nanocarriers by self-assembling. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79959507758	Facile engineering of nano- and microparticles via self-assembly of homopolymers	We report an unprecedented assembling performance of amide-containing, homo-structured poly(N-alkylacrylamide)s, through which they can assemble into discrete spherical particles with size ranging from tens of nanometres to several micrometres. For a specific polymer, a facile control over topology and scale of assembled structures can be accomplished via solvent conditions. Assembling using appropriate solvent gives rise to capsule-like assemblies. The molecular structure of polymers, such as the side chain chemistry and topology display striking impact on the size and morphology of resulting assemblies. These polymers might function as novel model systems for investigating complex functions performed by amide moieties in proteins, while this assembling offers a simple, facile but powerful and cost-effective manufacturing route for nano- or microstructured materials that may find great potential in diverse applications varying from cosmetics, drug delivery, nanomedicine, to biotechnology. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

80255129688	Panax notoginseng saponins inhibit Zymosan A induced atherosclerosis by suppressing integrin expression, FAK activation and NF-κB translocation	Ethnopharmacological significance: Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are ingredients extracted from traditional Chinese medicinal herb Panax notoginseng. It has been demonstrated that PNS have extensive effects on the cardiovascular system, including inhibition of platelet aggregation, increasing blood flow, improving left ventricular diastolic function in hypertensive patients and anti-inflammatory effect. Aim of study: Recent researches indicated that PNS administration inhibited foam cells' formation. The present study was designed to study the effects of PNS on atherogenesis and to explore the relevant molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: The Zymosan A induced atherosclerosis models were used to investigate the anti-atherosclerosis effects of PNS. The integrin express array was used to check the changes of integrins. The foam cell formation was observed with transmission electron microscope. The effect of PNS on phosphorylation of FAK on threonine 397 and protein level of NF-κB was also evaluated in vitro. Results: PNS treated rats had less plaque spots on the aortas compared with Zym induced group. The formation of foam cell was inhibited by PNS. Compared with Zym treated group, the expression of most integrin families decreased except Itgav and Itgb2 after PNS treatment. PNS inhibited phosphorylation of FAK on threonine 397 and translocation of NF-κB. Conclusion: High fat diet together with Zym induces atherogenesis of rat. PNS inhibits zymosan A induced atherogenesis by suppressing FAK phosphorylation, integrins expression and NF-κB translocation. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84862662236	Stimuli-triggered structural engineering of synthetic and biological polymeric assemblies	Response to external stimuli is a fundamental and intrinsic behavior of living systems. There has been increasing interest for designing and constructing responsive polymeric superstructures by self-assembly. Stimuli-induced self-assembly and post-assembly triggering strategies provide an alternative approach for the manipulation of self-assembled architectures of either biological or synthetic polymeric materials. Stimuli-induced structural transformations may produce ensembles with new topologies or materials with exceptionally complex features inaccessible via conventional self-assembly processes. This is in contrast to materials that simply undergo stimuli-induced degradation, or disassembly processes. Since a variety of cellular processes depend on responses to environmental stimuli that lead to more complexity and increased function, and are related to structural transitions over the nano- to microscale, insights into stimuli-triggered morphogenesis can further deepen our understanding of cellular behaviors. Indeed, an understanding of these processes will likely inspire scientists to develop materials with advanced and tailored architectures for biosensing, diagnosis and therapy as well as other biomedical applications. Herein, we highlight state-of-the-art achievements in the stimuli-triggered structural manipulation of polymer assemblies. Furthermore, future developments in this nascent and growing field are briefly discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To explore the mechanism of DNA damage induced by Pice in the presence of copper (Cu)(II), gel electrophoresis, UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used. The results of gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the hydroxyl radical played a critical role in DNA cleavage. Spectroscopy confirmed that the mechanism of DNA cleavage induced by Pice-Cu(II) involves the Haber Weiss and Fenton reactions. Pice chelates with Cu(II) as a bidentate ligand, and the Pice-Cu(II) complex undergoes intramolecular electron transfer to form the semiquinone radical anion and Cu(I), which may be reoxidated by O

84863989034	Panax notoginseng saponins attenuate atherosclerosis via reciprocal regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammation by inducing liver X receptor alpha expression	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen has been used as a health product and natural remedy in traditional medicine for cardiovascular diseases for more than 1000 years in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) are the major effective ingredients extracted from Panax notoginseng. Aim of the study: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) attenuated atherosclerosis by inducing liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) expression and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the effects. Materials and methods: The AS rats were treated once daily with PNS (100 mg/kg, i.p.), and pathological changes in the aorta were observed using Sudan IV staining. The expression of LXRα in the aortic wall was measured by Western blot analysis. THP-1 macrophages were cultured with PNS in the presence or absence of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt (GGPP), an LXRα antagonist. The expression of LXRα and its target genes ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1 (ABCA1, ABCG1) were determined by qRT-PCR. The transcriptional activation of the LXRα gene promoter was analyzed by a reporter assay. The NF-κB DNA binding activity and the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) was evaluated respectively by Trans-AM NF-κB ELISA and ELISA in THP-1 macrophages that were stimulated with LPS after treatment with PNS and GGPP. Results: PNS treatment alleviated the typical pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis in rats. The expression of LXRα was increased in rat aortas after treatment with PNS. In vitro, PNS increased LXRα mRNA levels in THP-1 macrophages. The reporter assays showed that PNS enhanced transcriptional activation of the LXRα gene promoter and led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression. This upregulation could be reversed by treatment with GGPP. Additionally, PNS inhibited NF-κB DNA binding activity and reduced secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages. These effects could be reversed by GGPP. Conclusions: The results indicated that the PNS-mediated attenuation of AS may, at least partly, due to LXRα uprergulation. The mechanisms of action included enhancement transcriptional activation of the LXRα gene promoter by PNS and subsequent upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 and inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84869509832	Assembled nanomedicines as efficient and safe therapeutics for articular inflammation	Highly efficient nanomedicines were successfully fabricated by the indomethacin (IND) directed self-assembly of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-conjugated polyethyleneimine (PEI-CD), taking advantage of the multiple interactions between drug and polymer. These nanoscaled assemblies exhibited spherical shape and positively charged surface. Compared with the commercial tablet, the relative oral bioavailability of IND-nanomedicines was significantly enhanced. Evaluation based on either carrageenan-induced paw edema or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis suggested the newly developed nanomedicines were more effective than raw IND or IND tablet in terms of prophylactic effect and therapeutic activity. Even the low dose of nanomedicines offered the comparable results to those of control groups at the high dosage in most cases. Moreover, the nanoformulation exhibited ameliorated gastrointestinal stimulation. All these positive results indicated that this type of nanomedicines might serve as a highly efficient and effective delivery nanoplatform for the oral delivery of water-insoluble therapeutics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84871788547	Sildenafil potentiates bone morphogenetic protein signaling in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and in experimental pulmonary hypertension	Objective-Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR-II) are responsible for the majority of cases of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and BMPR-II deficiency contributes to idiopathic and experimental forms of PAH. Sildenafil, a potent type-5 nucleotide-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is an established treatment for PAH, but whether sildenafil affects bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in the pulmonary circulation remains unknown. Methods and Results-Studies were undertaken in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and in vivo in the monocrotaline rat model of PAH. In PASMCs, sildenafil enhanced BMP4-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5, Smad nuclear localization, and Inhibitor of DNA binding protein 1 gene and protein expression. This effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cyclic GMP. Pharmacological inhibition or small interfering RNA knockdown of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase I inhibited the effect of sildenafil on BMP signaling. In functional studies, we observed that sildenafil potentiated the antiproliferative effects of BMP4 on PASMC proliferation. Furthermore, sildenafil restored the antiproliferative response to BMP4 in PASMCs harboring mutations in BMPR-II. In the monocrotaline rat model of PAH, which is characterized by BMPR-II deficiency, sildenafil prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling, and partly restored Smad1/5 phosphorylation and Inhibitor of DNA binding protein 1 gene expression in vivo in monocrotaline exposed rat lungs. Conclusion-Sildenafil enhances canonical BMP signaling via cyclic GMP and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase I in vitro and in vivo, and partly restores deficient BMP signaling in BMPR-II mutant PASMCs. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of sildenafil in the treatment of PAH and suggest that targeting BMP signaling may be beneficial in this disease. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

84872895088	Polydatin protects against lipopolysaccharide-induced fulminant hepatic failure in D-galactosamine-sensitized mice	Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is a devastating clinical syndrome with extremely poor prognosis and high mortality. Therefore, better treatment is urgently needed. Polydatin (PD), a traditional anti-inflammatory drug, has been described to protect against liver injury induced by certain hepatotoxins. The present study investigated the protective effect of PD against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced FHF in mice and the underlying mechanism. Mice were pretreated with an increasing dose of PD (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg), following LPS/D-GalN challenge. The liver injury was assessed biochemically and histologically. We found that PD exerted a protective effect on LPS/D-GalN-induced FHF as evidenced by reducing sera alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, diminishing liver histopathological injury, and lowering mortality in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment mice with PD dose-dependently suppressed tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, intercellular adhesion molecule-l (ICAM-1) and endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (ECAM-1) expression, caspase-3 activation, and transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B(NF-κB) activity induced by LPS. These results suggested that PD could effectively protect from LPS/D-GalN-induced FHF and the protective effect afforded by PD probably contributed to reduce TNF-α production via inhibiting NF-κB activation.

84873738436	Nanocomplexation-assisted solubilization of pDNA in organic solvents for improved microencapsulation	With an attempt to solubilize plasmid DNA (pDNA) in organic solvents, we developed nanocomplexation strategy by using block copolymer of polyethylene glycol. -b-poly(L-lysine) (PEG. -b-PLL). Self-assembly of PEG. -b-PLL and pDNA in aqueous solution led to spherical nanocomplexes with core-shell structure when the +/- charge ratio (N/. P) was higher than 1:1. This complexation had no significant impact on the helical structure of pDNA. After lyophilization, PEG. -b-PLL/pDNA nanocomplexes originally formed in aqueous solution could be well dispersed in organic solvents such as THF and dichloromethane. Facilitating by nanocomplexation, pDNA could be encapsulated into PLGA nanoparticles with high efficiency, via oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation method. This complexation mediated pDNA solubilization in organic solvents may facilitate the development of novel nano- and micro-platforms for gene delivery. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP-)induced sepsis was employed. Pretreatment of mice with PD (15, 45, and 100 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced sepsis-induced mortality and lung injury, as indicated by alleviated lung pathological changes and infiltration of proteins and leukocytes. In addition, PD inhibited CLP-induced serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, lung cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase isoform (iNOS) protein expressions and NF-B activation. Notably, PD upregulated the expression and activity of heme oxygenase (HO-)1 in lung tissue of septic mice. Further, the protective effects of PD on sepsis were abrogated by ZnPP IX, a specific HO-1 inhibitor. These findings indicated that PD might be an effective antisepsis drug. © 2013 Xiao-hui Li et al.

Using both steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, we demonstrated that lipophilic drugs can be efficiently incorporated in either nanosheet-like or nanofibrous PLLA matrices. Thus entrapped drug was randomly distributed in the interconnected nanostructures in the form of nanoscaled crystals. In vitro release study revealed that drug release kinetics may be modulated, on the one hand, by the nanostructure of matrices, while on the other hand by the polymer concentration utilized for fabrication. As for hydrophilic compounds, they could be conveniently loaded into nanofibrous structure by post-fabrication absorption. In addition to the conceptual proof of potential applications of nanostructured PLLA matrices for controlled drug delivery, the strategy employed herein offers a new way to construct bioactive scaffolds, such as antibacterial or anti-inflammatory scaffolds, which may find broad applications for tissue regeneration and stem cells-based biotherapy.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Materials & methods: The surface topography and components, thickness, degradation behaviors and bFGF release profiles of the PEM coating were investigated. The effects of the PEM coating on osteoprogenitor cell growth and bone implant interfacial binding strength in the rabbit femur model were evaluated separately. Results: The formation of disulfide bonds improved the stability of the PEM coating, resulting in a coating that can release bFGF in a slow and sustained manner. Biological evaluations revealed that the resultant PEM coating on titanium promoted various cell behaviors and enhanced the binding strength. Conclusion: The employed cotreatment regimen enabled bFGF and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid to have a synergistic effect on the cell responses, which, in turn, improved the osseointegration.

84877049978	Cyclodextrin-derived pH-responsive nanoparticles for delivery of paclitaxel	Engineering of pH-responsive nanoplatforms can be facilely achieved from acetalated α-cyclodextrin materials. The hydrolysis period of nanoparticles can be precisely tailored by using materials with various acetal types that can be easily controlled by acetalation time. These nanomaterials with pH-modulated hydrolysis and pH-triggered drug delivery capability show good biocompatibility invitro and invivo. Incorporation of anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) into newly developed pH-sensitive nanosystems leads to nanotherapeutics with significantly improved cytotoxic activity against various tumor cells. Importantly, thus formulated nanomedicines can reverse the multidrug resistance of PTX-resistant cancer cells. Invivo antitumor studies also reveal the superior of pH-sensitive nanosystems over pristine PTX and pH-insensitive PLGA nanoformulations. Moreover, comparison with other two acid-labile materials evidenced the advantages of cyclodextrin-based nanovehicles with respect to drug loading capacity, invitro and invivo activity as well as alleviated adverse effects.

84878931203	Use of data mining to determine changes in the gene expression profiles of rat embryos following prenatal exposure to inflammatory stimulants	Numerous clinical epidemiology and laboratory studies have demonstrated a close association between inflammation or immunity and the occurrence of hypertension. Our group has previously shown that upon intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or zymosan (Zym) into pregnant rats, the offspring of the experimental group exhibited higher blood pressure levels compared with the control group, and these may be associated with the effects of an accumulation of gene expression changes on female rats during pregnancy. The present study used the Affymetrix GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array to examine gene expression profile changes in the embryos of experimental pregnant rats intraperitoneally injected with LPS or Zym vs. the untreated controls. We discovered that genes associated with DNA replication and mRNA processing were significantly upregulated by the stimuli from analysis using GenMAPP. By contrast, genes involved in the calcium regulatory pathway in cardiac myocytes and the signaling pathway in smooth muscle contraction and relaxation were the most downregulated. Results of the microarray analysis showed that immuno-inflammatory stimuli during pregnancy affected the gene expression profiles of the embryos. These changes in gene expression may affect the developmental and metabolic status of the offspring, thereby increasing their susceptibility to hypertension and obesity.

84879177846	Protection of polydatin on sepsis-induced acute kidney injury in mice	Objective: To investigate the protective effect and mechanism of polydatin (PD) on sepsis-induced acute kidney injury in mice suffered from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Methods: The mice were divided into five groups: model group, Sham group, and PD (50, 100, and 300 mg/kg) groups. The model of septic kidney injury in Kunming mice was made by CLP. One hour before the operation, PD and saline were ip administered into mice, respectively. Twenty-four hours after the operation, mice were decapitated for the measurement of urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr) levels in serum using kit, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were detected by ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. Besides, the kidney tissue was assessed pathologically and kidney injury was observed histologically. Results: Compared with CLP group, the levels of BUN, Cr, IL-6, and iNOS were much lowered in PD groups. In addition, PD significantly attenuated the pathologic changes in kidney tissues induced by sepsis in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: PD has a protective effect against sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition on the expression of IL-6 in serum and iNOS protein in kidney tissues.

Transport across the plasma membrane is a critical step in regulating the action of this peptide drug. This study was designed to explore the mechanisms underlying the transmembrane transport of GCIP-27. The peptide drug was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and measured in a time- and concentration-dependent manner using laser confocal microscopy. Various transport inhibitors, including energy and endocytosis inhibitors, were used to identify the factors that regulate its transmembrane transport. GCIP-27 transport was examined in cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and hepatocytes. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the ultrastructure of the cardiomyocyte membranes. The results showed that GCIP-27 was transported through the plasmalemma in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The rate of uptake and the level of GCIP-27 in the cells decreased significantly after treatment with energy inhibitors, methyl-ß-cyclodextrin chlorpromazine or heparin. GCIP-27 levels in VSMCs and cardiomyocytes were significantly greater than the levels observed in hepatocytes, cardiac fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. Treatment with GCIP-27 led to a marked increase in the surface roughness of the cellular membrane. In conclusion, the transmembrane transport of GCIP-27 is mediated by endocytosis, which requires energy, and GCIP-27 preferentially enters myocardial cells and VSMCs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84888149891	Panax notoginseng saponins promote endothelial progenitor cell mobilization and attenuate atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein e knockout mice	Background: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from the bone marrow (BM) play a key role in the homeostasis of vascular repair by enhanced reendothelialization. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease. The present research was designed to explore the contribution of progenitor cells to the progression of atherosclerotic plaques and the possible modulatory role of PNS in this process. Methods: PNS (60 or 120 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection) was administered over 8 weeks in apolipoprotein E knockout mice on an atherogenic diet. The sizes and histochemical alteration of atherosclerotic lesions and numbers of EPCs in BM and peripheral blood were analyzed. The expression of chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptor, CXCR4, was monitored as well. Results: PNS significantly reduced the lesion area and intima-to-media ratio compared to vehicle treatment. PNS also augmented endothelialization and reduced the smooth muscle cell (SMCs) content of the lesions. The number of c-kit and sca-1 double-positive progenitor cells and flk-1 and sca-1 double-positive progenitor cells were significantly increased in the BM and the peripheral blood of the PNS-treated groups. PNS treatment increased the plasma levels of SDF-1 and SCF as well as the BM levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, the mRNA levels of SDF-1 and protein levels of CXCR4 were both increased in the BM of mice treated with PNS, while SDF-1 expression decreased. Conclusion: PNS reduce the size of atherosclerotic plaques, and this effect appears to involve progenitor cell mobilization. SDF-1-CXCR4 interactions and the possible modulatory role of PNS in this process may contribute to the increased progenitor cell mobilization. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84889052572	Prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide results in myocardial remodelling in adult murine offspring	Background: The epigenetic plasticity hypothesis indicates that pregnancy exposure may result in adult-onset diseases, including hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in offspring. In a previous study, we discovered that prenatal exposure to inflammatory stimulants, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), could lead to hypertension in adult rat offspring. In the present study, we further demonstrate that maternal inflammation induces cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction via ectopic over-expression of nuclear transcription factor κB (NF- κB), and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) can protect cardiac function by reducing maternal inflammation. Methods. Pregnant SD rats were randomly divided into three groups and intraperitoneally injected with a vehicle, LPS (0.79 mg/kg), or LPS (0.79 mg/kg) plus PDTC (100 mg/kg) at 8 to 12 days of gestation. The offspring were raised until 4 and 8 months old, at which point an echocardiographic study was performed. The left ventricular (LV) mass index and apoptosis were examined. Results: At 4 months of age, the LPS offspring exhibited augmented posterior wall thickness. These rats displayed left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy and LV diastolic dysfunction as well as a higher apoptotic index, a higher level of Bax and a lower level of Bcl-2 at 8 months of age. The protein levels of NF-κB (p65) in the myocardium of the offspring were measured at this time. NF-κB protein levels were higher in the myocardium of LPS offspring. The offspring that were prenatally treated with PDTC displayed improved signs of blood pressure (BP) and LV hypertrophy. Conclusions: Maternal inflammation can induce cardiac hypertrophy in offspring during aging accompanied with hypertension emergence and can be rescued by the maternal administration of PDTC (the inhibitor of NF-κB). © 2013 Wei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84899652042	Facile route to versatile nanoplatforms for drug delivery by one-pot self-assembly	There is still unmet demand for developing powerful approaches to produce polymeric nanoplatforms with versatile functions and broad applications, which are essential for the successful bench-to-bedside translation of polymeric nanotherapeutics developed in the laboratory. We have discovered a facile, convenient, cost-effective and easily scalable one-pot strategy to assemble various lipophilic therapeutics bearing carboxyl groups into nanomedicines, through which highly effective cargo loading and nanoparticle formation can be achieved simultaneously. Besides dramatically improving water solubility, the assembled nanopharmaceuticals showed significantly higher bioavailability and much better therapeutic activity. These one-pot assemblies may also serve as nanocontainers to effectively accommodate other highly hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX). PTX nanomedicines thus formulated display strikingly enhanced in vitro antitumor activity and can reverse the multidrug resistance of tumor cells to PTX therapy. The special surface chemistry offers these assembled entities the additional capability of efficiently packaging and efficaciously transfecting plasmid DNA, with a transfection efficiency markedly higher than that of commonly used positive controls. Consequently, this one-pot assembly approach provides a facile route to multifunctional nanoplatforms for simultaneous delivery of multiple therapeutics with improved therapeutic significance. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

84902195131	Prenatal exposure to lipolysaccharide result in expression changes of myocardial renin angiotensin system in offspring rats	Objective: To explore expression changes of myocardial renin angiotensin system induced by prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide in offspring rats. Methods: Twelve pregnant SD rats were randomly divided into three groups; LPS model group; intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.79 mg/kg) at 8, 10, 12 days of pregnancy; control group; intraperitoneal injection of sterile saline (0.5 ml) at 8, 10, 12 days of pregnancy; LPS + PDTC group; intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.79 mg/kg) at 8, 10, 12 days of pregnancy plus daily intraperitoneal injection of NF-κB inhibitor-pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 mg/kg) on day 8 to 14 pregnancy day. Protein expression of Angiotensin II (Ang II) in heart was detected by immunohistochemistry; myocardial ACE, ACE2 mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR; protein expression of ACE and ACE2 in heart was detected by Western blot in offspring rats of various groups. Results: Compared with control group (0.07 ± 0.02, 0.11 ± 0.01), Ang II protein levels (0.14 ± 0.04) were significantly increased at 6 weeks (P < 0.01) and 16 weeks (0.17 ± 0.04, P < 0.05) in offspring rats of LPS model group, which could be significantly attenuated by PDTC intervention (0.10 ± 0.01, 0.13 ± 0.03, respectively, all P < 0.05). Similarly, myocardial ACE mRNA expression in 16 weeks offspring rats of LPS model group was significantly upregulated compared with control group (1.10 ± 0.26 vs. 0.72 ± 0.22, P < 0.05), which was significantly attenuated by PDTC intervention (0.67 ± 0.01, P < 0.01 vs. LPS group). Myocardial protein expression ACE2 in 16 weeks offspring rats of LPS model group was significantly downregulated compared to control group, which was slightly upregulated by PDTC intervention (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Pregnancy exposure to lipopolysaccharide increases myocardial ACE and Ang II expression while reduces myocardial ACE2 expression in offspring rats, which might be one of the pathomechanisms of offspring hypertension.

84903884382	Effect of maternal lipopolysaccharides exposure during pregnancy on vascular structure in neonatal offspring rats	Objective: To explore the role of prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on aortic morphology in the neonatal offspring rats. Methods: Twelve pregnant rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, LPS group, and PDTC (pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, LPS + PDTC) group. The rats were intraperitoneally administered vehicle, LPS (0.79 mg/kg), or LPS plus PDTC(100 mg/kg), respectively. LPS was given on the 8th, 10th and 12th days, whereas vehicle and PDTC were given daily from the 8th to the 14th day during gestation. Histopathological alteration of the thoracic aorta was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy, thoracic aortic mRNA and protein expression of connexin (Cx) molecules including Cx37, Cx40, Cx43 and Cx45 in offspring was detected by Real Time PCR and confocal laser-scanning microscope, respectively, offspring body weight was measure at day 1 and week 1. Results: Body weight at 1 day and 1 week-old offspring was significantly lower in LPS group than in control group (P < 0.01), which were significantly higher in PDTC group compared to LPS group (P < 0.01): [1 day: control group (7.425 ± 0.146) g, LPS group (6.742 ± 0.128) g, PDTC group (7.137 ± 0.141) g; 1 week: control group (20.173 ± 3.982) g, LPS group (13.264 ± 2.581) g, PDTC group (17.863 ± 3.412) g]. In 1 week-old offspring of LPS group, the thoracic; aortas exhibited lesions, including impaired endothelial cells, thickening and fibrous changes of intimae, and migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells; the number of gap junction was decreased versus control group and pathological changes were similar between PDTC group and IPS group. Cx43 protein expression in LPS group was obviously lower than in control group and which could be partly reversed in PDTC group. Expression of Cx43 mRNA was significantly lower in 1 day and 1 week offspring of LPS group compared to control group (P < 0.05), which could be reversed in PDTC group (P < 0.05) (1 day: control group 1.530 ± 0.296, LPS group 1.226 ± 0.209, PDTC group 1.619 ± 0.324; 1 week: control group 9.357 ± 1.917, LPS group 7.204 ± 1.165, PDTC group 9.271 ± 1.514). Conclusion: Our results indicate that maternal LPS exposure during pregnancy leads to vascular changes in neonatal offspring which might increase the susceptibility to adult hypertension.

84904261245	Lipopolysaccharide exposure during pregnancy leads to aortic dysfunction in offspring rats	Background: Prenatal exposure to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produces hypertension in adult offspring rats. The present study was to explore the effects of prenatal inflammation on morphological and functional changes in the aorta from offspring rats and to further assess its susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. Methods and Results: Pregnant rats were treated intraperitoneally on gestation Days 8, 10 and 12 with saline, LPS (0.79 mg/kg), or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 mg/kg)+LPS, respectively. Aortic ring reactivity and histopathological alteration were analyzed in offspring at the age of 12 weeks. The detections of connexin (Cx) 37, Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45, including immunofluorescent patterns, protein levels and mRNA expression in the aorta, were performed as well. Furthermore, the expressions of Nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65), IκBα, phospho-IκBα and IκBβ were determined. The results showed that prenatal LPS exposure leads to morphological abnormalities and impaired aortic reactivity in offspring. Prenatal LPS exposure also decreased the protein and mRNA expression of Cx37 in the aorta from offspring rats. NF-κB and phospho- IκBα levels were both increased, IκBα level, however, was decreased in the aorta of offspring from the maternal LPS exposure compared to the controls. Simultaneously, PDTC treatment markedly reversed the action of LPS. Conclusions: Decreased expression of Cx37 contributed to the aortic dysfunction of prenatal LPS exposure offspring, which should be associated with NF-κB activation. © 2014 Zhao et al.

84907528976	Cyclopeptide histone deacetylase inhibitors	Histone deacetylase inhibitor is a novel class of histone deacetylase targeted anti-cancer drug, which takes excellent effects on anti-proliferation, pro-apoptosis, pro-differentiation, cell cycle arrest, anti-angiogenesis and so on. Histone deacetylase inhibitor plays an important role in the development of anticancer drug with its unique anti-tumor mechanism. Among the histone deacetylase inhibitors, the cyclopeptide histone deacetylase inhibitor with the most complicated structure has good antagonism on various types of solid tumors and hematologic cancer. In this review, the structural features of the metal binding region, the surface recognition region and the linker region of natural and synthetic cyclic peptide histone deacetylase inhibitors are summarized, and the inhibitory activity and anti-tumor proliferative activity of various inhibitors are described. Modification of different structure domains can make inhibitors with high efficiency and specificity on different tumor cells. We expect to find the structure rule of the high efficient and low toxic targeted peptide inhibitors through structure-activity relationships, providing new sights for investigation of anti-cancer drugs.

84908042318	Over-expression of beclin-1 facilitates acquired resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitor-induced apoptosis	Apoptotic cell death plays a predominant role in histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity. Nuclear morphological changes and activation of apoptotic executors are involved in CTS203-induced cell death. However, emerging issues of HDAC inhibitor-resistance have been observed in patients. Herein, MCF-7 cells were continuously exposed to CTS203 until the derived cells could proliferate normally in its presence. The newly obtained CTS203-resistant cells were nominated as MCF-7/203R. Compared to MCF-7 original cells, the MCF-7/203R cells were less sensitive to CTS203-induced apoptosis, with a minimal 6-fold higher IC50 value. In contrast, the expression of Beclin-1 was dramatically up-regulated, positively correlated to the acquisition of CTS203-resistance. Our results revealed the participation of autophagy in acquired HDAC inhibitor-resistance and further identified Beclin-1 as a promising target for anti-drug resistance.

84912117469	Control of β-sheet crystal orientation and elastic modulus in silk protein by nanoconfinement	Silk fibers featuring exceptional mechanical strength and high extensibility are composed of fibril bundles with diameters in the range of 20-150 nm. Regeneration of silk fibers with similar superstrong mechanical properties from reconstituted silk protein remains a challenge because controlled self-assembly of macromolecular components on the nanoscale is required. The self-assembly of silk protein in nanoconfined geometry and the mechanical properties are investigated in this study. Using a template-filling method, cylindrical nanofibers of silk protein are fabricated for different diameters within nanopores (50-120 nm) of anodic alumina oxide. By exposing to organic solvent, e.g. methanol, the proteins self-assemble to β-sheet crystals in which the c-axis is aligned normal to the fiber axis, in stacking contrast to the natural silk fibers in which the c-axis is aligned along the fiber axis. Such highly ordered structures contribute to the enhanced mechanical property which reaches the theoretical mechanical level. In addition, the Youngs modulus of the nanofibers linearly increases with decreasing the diameter of the nanofibers. This is important, on the one hand, to understand the self-assembly of macromolecules under spatial confinement and, on the other hand, to understand the structure-property relationships of nanomaterials and to fabricate soft nanostructures with controllable properties.

84920664287	Permanent target for optical payload performance and data quality assessment: Spectral characterization and a case study for calibration	To regularly evaluate the optical payload performance (geometric, radiometric, and spatial resolution) and the data quality for high-resolution airborne and satellite imaging systems, two new permanent targets (the knife-edge target and the fan-shaped target) made of gravel and with the advantages of year-round availability, lower maintenance operations, and a long lifetime were established in the Academy of Opto-Electronics Baotou site in China. The spectral properties of these targets are investigated in this study. Note that the anisotropy factor at 550 nm for the white gravel is approximately 6%, 12.5% 16.5%, 17.5%, 11.5%, and 5% at the principal plane for the observer zenith angle of 60 deg, 50 deg, 40 deg, 30 deg, 20 deg, and 10 deg (backscatter), respectively. The corresponding value for the gray gravel is 20.8%, 24.8%, 29.4%, 23.8%, 13%, and 3.7%, respectively, and 62.8%, 65.7%, 59.2%, 40.3%, 22.3%, and 9.0%, respectively, for the black gravel. The anisotropy of the black gravel is larger than that of the gray and white gravel areas. The nonuniformity of the target reflectivity is within 2.5%. Furthermore, a calibration for the optical payloads onboard the GF-1 satellite is performed with the knife-edge target, and the uncertainty analysis demonstrates that the uncertainty for this calibration is <2.12% when the relative error for the surface reflectance measurement, the aerosol optical depth, and the total column water vapor are approximately 1%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.

84923283780	High dynamic range image acquisition method using proportion integration differentiation controller	The extensive application of surface mount technology requires various measurement methods to evaluate the printed circuit board (PCB), and visual inspection is one critical method. The local oversaturation, arising from the nonconsistent reflectivity of the PCB surface, will lead to an erroneous result. This paper presents a study on a high dynamic range image (HDRI) acquisition system which can capture HDRIs with less local oversaturation. The HDRI system is composed of the liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) and chargecoupled diode (CCD) sensor. In this system, the LCoS uses a negative feedback to extend the dynamic range of the system, and the proportion integration differentiation (PID) theory is used to control the system for its rapidity. The input of the PID controller is images captured by the CCD sensor and the output is the LCoS mask, which controls the LCoS's reflectivity. The significant characteristics of our method are that the PID control can adjust the image brightness pixel to pixel and the feedback procedure is accomplished by the computer in less time than the traditional method. Experimental results demonstrate that the system could capture HDRIs with less local oversaturation.
