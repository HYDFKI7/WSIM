34548731896	Inhibitory effect of Chinese herbs with anti-mutation activity on a mismatch-repair-gene-deficient colorectal cancer cell line	AIM: To study the inhibitory effect of Chinese herbs with anti-mutation activity on the mismatch-repair-gene-deficient colorectal cancer cell line. METHODS: Fourteen Chinese herbs were used to treat the hMSH2-deficient colorectal cancer Lovo cell line and mismatch-repair-gene-deficient colorectal SW480 cell line, and growth rate was evaluated by the MTT method. The microsatellite instability change was examined by multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Tea polyphenols, orindonin, baicalin and andrographolide had obvious inhibition effects on colorectal cancer cell lines. The effects of orindonin, tea polyphenols and baicailin on the Lovo cell line were better than on SW480 cells. In particular, the effect of baicalin on Lovo cells was five times better than that on SW480 cells, but the effect of andrographolide on SW480 cells was better than that on Lovo cells. The proliferation rate of the two cell lines was low after resveratrol, aloin, tanshinone IIA and curcumin treatment, and increasing drug concentration had no effect. These results demonstrated that epimedium brevicornum and the other five drugs had no inhibitory effect on the two cell lines, but they did have a proliferative effect. The microsatellite instability had no changes in the different drug group concentrations. CONCLUSION: Chinese herbs with anti-mutation effects, such as orindonin, tea polyphenols and baicailin, exert an inhibitory effect on mismatch-repair-gene-deficient colorectal cancer cell lines. These effects are independent of the dose and duration of exposure. The mechanism may result from some yet unknown factors.

4043049375	Procyanidins from grape seeds protect against phorbol ester-induced oxidative cellular and genotoxic damage	AIM: To evaluate the inhibitory effects of Vitis vinifera procyanidins (PAs) on carcinogen-induced oxidative stress. METHODS: The single cell gel electrophoresis technique (comet assay) was employed to detect DNA damage induced by the carcinogen phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). The release of hydrogen peroxidase from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was assayed by the horseradish peroxidase-mediated oxidation of phenol red. The microplate assay was used to detect the presence of oxidative products by means of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA). The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of liver mitochondria was assayed, based on the ability of SOD to inhibit the generation of superoxidate anions by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level was determined by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. RESULTS: DNA of NIH3T3 cells was significantly damaged after addition of PMA. The length of the comet tail was observed, while in normal cells the comet tail could not be observed. PAs showed significant protective effects on carcinogen PMA-induced DNA damage. Through assessment of DCFH-DA oxidation, PAs were shown to inhibit the PMA-induced release of hydrogen peroxide by PMNs, and to inhibit respiratory burst activity in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Ex vivo study showed that serum from rats administered with PAs displayed similar effects in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, PAs suppressed liver mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by PMA. PAs protected the activity of SOD and decreased the level of MDA in liver mitochondria damaged by PMA, CONCLUSION: Dietary PAs from grape seeds protect against carcinogen-induced oxidative cellular and genotoxic damage.

79952340060	Cell charge: Potential important target of anti-tumor research	Activity of cell electrophysiology runs through the whole life process, indicating its importance in the cellular biology. There is apparent difference between tumor cells and normal cell of their cell electrophysiology, because of the alteration of the membrane structure and permeability. Cellular surface charge affects functional protein through electrostatic attraction, and then mediates signal transduction, leading to tumor malignant behavior such as invasion and metastasis. Recently many researches have suggested that alteration of tumor charge could change malignant behavior. Tumor charge may be an important potential target of tumor therapy. So this article summarizes the correlative achievements in tumor charge and some hot spots, in order to provide reference for tumor research.

79952358633	Effect of immunocytes on the process of hepatic fibrosis	Hepatic fibrosis is often caused by chronic inflammatory liver injury. In the progress of liver fibrosis, immunocytes mediate inflammatory reaction by synthesizing and secreting many kinds of chemical mediators including cytokines and chemokines. At the same time, immunocyte, cytokine, and chemokine construct the immune microenvironment for hepatic stellate cells. In this microenvironment, every factor can interact with each other, effecting the progress of the disease. Regulating the overall immune microenvironment in liver with medication, and guiding the functions of immunocytes to invert the development of hepatic fibrosis, may open up the new possibility of the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.

84861603289	Inhibition of hypoxia-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition by luteolin in non-small cell lung cancer cells	Hypoxia-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential step in cancer metastasis. Luteolin, a flavonoid that is widely distributed in plants, is a novel anticancer agent. However, the mechanism underlying its anticancer effects remains undefined. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that luteolin inhibits hypoxia-induced EMT in human non-small cell lung cancer cells in culture, which is demonstrated by the fact that hypoxia-induced EMT reduced the expression of E-cadherin and other epithelial markers and increased the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and other mesenchymal markers; these effects were markedly attenuated by luteolin. In addition, luteolin also inhibited hypoxia-induced proliferation, motility and adhesion in the cells. Furthermore, we reveal that luteolin inhibits the expression of integrin β1 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK).Since integrin β1 and FAK signaling are closely related to EMT formation, these results suggest that luteolin inhibits hypoxia-induced EMT, at least in part, by inhibiting the expression of integrin β1 and FAK.

84866694009	Tumor-associated macrophages: A novel potential target for cancer treatment	Special emphasis about cancer metastasis was concentrated on tumor cells themselves, and we usually considered the ability of migration and invasion was the final decider. Recently, bewaring of tumor microenvironment is a fundamental determinant in metastasis has become the most outstanding breakthrough. Considerable "microbes" in the microenvironment are closely linked with tumor metastatic behaviors, and the major proportion of them is tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Actually, TAMs conserve immediate "cross-talk" with cancer cells throughout tumor development. It is generally accepted that TAMs have mostly pro-tumoral functions and play an important role in several stages of tumor progression. This progression involves a series of events that leads from the primary site to the metastatic site, including tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, intravasation and finally extravasation at distant site where the process begins again (metastasis). Thereby, TAMs has attracted substantial attentions in recent years and could become a promising therapeutic strategy. In this review, we focus on the multi-functions of TAMs in cancer and certain drugs targeting TAMs for cancer treatment those are under experimental research procedures or have even been entered human clinical tests.

84877153476	Tetramethylpyrazine induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and stimulates mitochondrial-mediated and caspase-dependent apoptosis through modulating ERK/p53 signaling in hepatic stellate cells in vitro	Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Pharmacological induction of HSC apoptosis could be a promising strategy for fibrosis regression. Natural product tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) exhibits potent antifibrotic activities in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be defined. The present study aimed at investigating the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of TMP on HSCs and elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that TMP had no apparent cytotoxic effects on hepatocytes, but significantly inhibited HSC proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 checkpoint. These effects were associated with TMP regulation of cyclin D1, p21, p27 and p53. Furthermore, we found that TMP disrupted mitochondrial functions and led to activation of caspase cascades in HSCs. Mechanistic investigations revealed that TMP selectively blocked the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and activated p53, which was required for TMP induction of caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in HSCs. Autodock simulations predicted that TMP could directly bind to ERK2 with two hydrogen bonds and low energy score, indicating that ERK2 could be a direct target molecule for TMP within HSCs. Moreover, TMP altered expression of some marker proteins relevant to HSC activation. These data collectively revealed that TMP modulation of ERK/p53 signaling led to mitochondrial-mediated and caspase-dependent apoptosis in HSCs in vitro. These studies provided mechanistic insights into the antifibrotic properties of TMP that may be exploited as a potential option for hepatic fibrosis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84877851692	Research development on the integration effect of traditional Chinese medicine and its prescriptions	Definitely, an important task of the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is to elucidate the complex material basis and mechanisms effect. However, the work was not well done in the past several decades. On the one hand, the action targets of TCM are based on "Zheng" in Chinese Mandarin and can't be understood as the diseases targets in the West, while "Zheng" goes far beyond disease phenotypes and emphasizes the linkages among them. Western medicine is characterized by one drug with one specific target and quite differently, the evidence of TCM is a combination of drug targets; On the other hand, Chinese material medicines contain a variety of components involved in each prescription, and prescription is exactly established on the rational compatibility and subtraction upon the "Zheng" theory. Therefore, Western medicine is recognized as an exclusive target for treatment of a disease, but TCM serves as an appropriate combination of targets in "Zheng". Since that TCM constitutes the active substance group, a multi-component and multi-target integration effect leads to its terminal pharmacological action based on correspondence of prescription with the syndrome of TCM. Recently, the use of the effective ingredients of TCM to simplify the study in integration effect of TCM has become a universal research model and practice, and in addition to the conventional experimental pharmacology, mathematics, biology information science, quantitative pharmacology, reverse pharmacology, polypharmaeology or network pharmacology and other interdisciplinary technology may help to understand the holistic, systematic characteristics embodied in TCM in the treatment of complex diseases.

84897533178	TIBS: A web database to browse gene expression in irritable bowel syndrome	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder. Its symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, bloating gas, diarrhea and constipation. Many IBS patients also have psychological symptoms like depression or anxiety. These unpleasant symptoms significantly lower patients[U+05F3] quality of life. The prevalence of IBS in Europe and North America is about 10-15% of the population, which makes IBS a disorder with a high social cost. The pathophysiology of IBS is considered to be multifactorial and the exact cause of the disease remains poorly understood. Recently, a genome-wide expression microarray technique has been applied to investigate the possible mechanisms of IBS. However, a user-friendly database that allows scientists without bioinformatics background to query gene expression levels in these data sets and compare gene expression patterns across different tissues has not yet been established. Therefore, we have integrated four public expression microarray data (320 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases into an online database called Transcriptome of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (TIBS). The gene expression change in IBS patients compared to healthy volunteers or UC patients in jejunum, sigmoid colon, rectum, and descending colon can be queried by gene symbols. Users can compare gene expression levels of IBS patients across these tissues. Sex difference of gene expression in IBS patients was also shown in the database. The current version of TIBS database contains 42,400 annotated gene probe sets represented on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 platform. TIBS will be an invaluable resource for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBS at the molecular level and for drug development.

43249106012	Hypothesis of active components in volatile oil from a Chinese herb formulation, 'Shao-Fu-Zhu-Yu decoction', using GC-MS and chemometrics	Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with few or no side effects has increasingly attracted attention all over the world. However, the bioactive components and the therapeutic mechanisms are usually not understood because of the complex chemical compositions of these medicines. In this paper, GC-MS coupled with a chemometric method was developed for analysis of active components in volatile oil from a Chinese herb formulation, "Shao-Fu-Zhu-Yu Decoction". The volatile oils, obtained by hydrodistillation from "Shao-Fu-Zhu-Yu Decoction" (SFZYD) and its constituent herbs with abundant volatile oil (Angelica sinensis, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Cinnamomum cassia, Foeniculum vulgare, Zingiber officinale), were chemically analyzed using GC-MS and bioassayed using oxytocin-induced uterine contraction assay in vitro. Then, a mathematic model relating the chemical compositions and their activities in inhibiting mice uterine contraction was established for hypothesis of the bioactive compounds based on chemometrics. As a result, nine compounds which might contribute to the inhibition of oxytocin-induced uterine contraction were selected, and the activities of some of them were further confirmed by our experiments and/or the literature. The data suggest that the developed method is helpful for screening bioactive components from complex mixtures, such as the extracts of TCM. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

Methods: Isolated uterine contraction model induced by oxytocine was used to observe the inhibitory effect of Siwu Decoction and its derived formulaes. The method for screening COX-2 inhibitors was used to evaluate the COX-2 inhibitory activity of those formulas. In vitro platelet aggregation was used to assess their effects on platelets. Results: SW notablely inhibited the frequency of uterine contraction, but it was found that the total activity of was reduced. QL not only inhibited the frequency and the total activity of uterine contraction, but also weakened the mean contraction force. TH and SF inhibited the frequency, the amplitude and the mean contraction force, resultin g in the decreased total activity of uterine contraction. Data showed that XF yielded the strongest inhibitory effects on the frequency, the amplitude and the mean contraction force of uterine contraction. The total activity of uterine contraction was decreased. COX-2 inhibitory activities of those formulae was ranked in the order of QL> XF> SF> TH> SW. Their inhibitory activities on the platelet aggregation were ranked in the order of TH> SW> XF> SF> QL. Conclusion: The Basic formula Siwu Decoction and its developed formulae in the treatment of the syndromes of primary dysmenorrheal show different compatible characteristics. These results provide evidences in support of the 'formula related to syndrome' theory of traditional Chinese medicines.

67649439052	Ligustrazine inhibits B16F10 melanoma metastasis and suppresses angiogenesis induced by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor	Angiogenesis is crucial for tumor metastasis, with many compounds that inhibit tumor metastasis acting through suppression of angiogenesis. We investigated anti-angiogenic properties of Ligustrazine in a series of in vitro and in vivo models. Ligustrazine inhibited VEGF-induced HUVECs migration and tube formation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, and had limited cytotoxicity to HUVECs and normal fibroblasts even at a dose up to 100 μg/ml. Ligustrazine also suppressed VEGF-induced rat aortic ring sprouting dose-dependently. In vivo, Ligustrazine reduced the Hb content in a Matrigel plug implanted in mice and inhibited new vessel formation in CAM. In addition, in a B16F10 spontaneous metastasis model, Ligustrazine decreased the expression of CD34 and VEGF in primary tumor tissue and reduced the number of metastasis nodi on the lung surface. Our data suggests that Ligustrazine may inhibit tumor metastasis, at least in part, through its anti-angiogenic activity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In vitro, HS inhibited the growth of B16F10 cells and proliferation of VEGF-induced HUVEC dose-dependently compared to the control, VEGF-induced capillary-like tube networks and the numbers of migratory and invasive cells were significantly inhibited by HS in a dose-dependent manner under the cytotoxic doses. Additionally, VEGF-induced vessel sprouting of rat aortic ring was also inhibited by HS. It also has been demonstrated that the invasive ability of B16F10 melanoma cells through the Matrigel-embedded Boyden chamber was suppressed by 0.5 μM HS. The protein level secreted by B16F10 cells of MMP-2,-9 and VEGF were decreased by HS treatment. In vivo, a tumor growth inhibition study was carried out using mice bearing B16F10 cells model of metastasis, no matter experimental or spontaneous, showed that HS at 5.2, 11.6 and 26 mg/kg (weight of mice) could markedly decreased the metastatic tumors in mouse lung in a dose-dependent manner. In CAM assay and Matrigel plug assay in vivo, HS (50 μg/egg and 100 μg/egg) inhibited new blood vessel formation on the growing chick chorioallantoic membrane, and HS (5.2 and 26 mg/kg body weight) reduced the vessel density in Matrigel plugs implanted in mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HS has antimetastasic properties possibly via its antiangiogenesis induced by downregulation of VEGF and suppression of invasive ability of cancer cells mediated by downregulation of MMP-2, -9 and their activities. ©2009 Landes Bioscience.

In this paper, the contents of eight phthalides, including Z-ligustilide, E-ligustilide, Z-butylenephthalide, E-butylenephthalide, 3-butylphthalide, neocnidilide and senkyunolide A were determined or estimated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed GC-MS was a simple, rapid, and high sensitive method for analyzing phthalides in Si-WuTang, Fo-Shou-San, Radix Angelica and Rhizoma Chuanxiong, and the extractable contents of each phthalides including Z-ligustilide, E-ligustilide, Z-butylenephthalide, etc. varied after Radix Angelica, Rhizoma Chuanxiong were combined into a formulation, such as Si-Wu-Tang and Fo-Shou-San. Furthermore, inhibition activity of essential oils from SiWu-Tang, Fo-Shou-San, Radix Angelica and Rhizoma Chuanxiong on uterine contraction was tested in an in vitro assay, and the results showed that the activity of the essential oil is higher as the content of the phthalides increase, which demonstrated that phthalides are possibly main active components inhibiting mice uterine contraction in vitro. All of the results suggested that comparative analysis of chemical components and pharmacological activities of each herb and formula is possibly helpful to elucidate the active components in traditional Chinese medicine, and to reveal the compatibility mechanism of TCM formulae.

This study was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of danshensu in a series of in vitro and in vivo models. The effect of danshensu on B16F10 melanoma cell and HUVEC proliferation were assessed by MTS assay, and cell invasion and migration were investigated by transwell chamber assay. The effect of danshensu on angiogenesis was evaluated by HUVEC migration assay, tube formation assay and chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. The expression of MMP-2, -9 and VEGF in B16F10 melanoma cell were detected by western blotting after danshensu treatment. The role of danshensu in tumor metastasis in vivo was evaluated by spontaneous and experimental B16F10 melanoma metastasis model. Although danshensu had no inhibitory effect on B16F10 melanoma cell and HUVEC proliferation, it significantly inhibited B16F10 melanoma cell invasion (at 0.05, 0.5, 5μM) and migration (at 0.5, 5μM). It also dramatically suppressed VEGF-induced endothelial migration (at 0.5, 5μM), tube formation in vitro (at 4, 20μM) and new vessel formation in CAM in vivo (100μg/egg). Danshensu (at 5, 50μM) significantly down-regulates protein expression of MMP-2, -9 and VEGF in B16F10 melanoma cell. In animal model, danshensu (20, 40. mg/kg) also possessed inhibitory effect on lung metastasis in spontaneous (46-day treatment) and experimental (23-day treatment) B16F10 melanoma metastasis model. All these results suggest that danshensu has anti-tumor activity by affecting on tumor angiogenesis and tumor invasion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77955537607	Cadmium suppresses the proliferation of piglet Sertoli cells and causes their DNA damage, cell apoptosis and aberrant ultrastructure	Objective: Very little information is known about the toxic effects of cadmium on somatic cells in mammalian testis. The objective of this study is to explore the toxicity of cadmium on piglet Sertoli cells.Methods: Sertoli cells were isolated from piglet testes using a two-step enzyme digestion and followed by differential plating. Piglet Sertoli cells were identified by oil red O staining and Fas ligand (FasL) expression as assayed by immunocytochemistry and expression of transferrin and androgen binding protein by RT-PCR. Sertoli cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the absence or presence of various concentrations of cadmium chloride, or treatment with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 and with cadmium chloride exposure. Apoptotic cells in seminiferous tubules of piglets were also performed using TUNEL assay in vivo.Results: Cadmium chloride inhibited the proliferation of Piglet Sertoli cells as shown by MTT assay, and it increased malondialdehyde (MDA) but reduced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Inhibitor SB202190 alleviated the proliferation inhibition of cadmium on piglet Sertoli cells. Comet assay revealed that cadmium chloride caused DNA damage of Piglet Sertoli cells and resulted in cell apoptosis as assayed by flow cytometry. The in vivo study confirmed that cadmium induced cell apoptosis in seminiferous tubules of piglets. Transmission electronic microscopy showed abnormal and apoptotic ultrastructure in Piglet Sertoli cells treated with cadmium chloride compared to the control.Conclusion: cadmium has obvious adverse effects on the proliferation of piglet Sertoli cells and causes their DNA damage, cell apoptosis, and aberrant morphology. This study thus offers novel insights into the toxicology of cadmium on male reproduction. © 2010 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods: Inhibitive effect of β-elemene on B16F10 cells was performed by cell proliferation assay. Angiogenesis assays in vitro including rat aortic ring and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane were used, as well as melanoma growth and metastasis assay in C57BL/6 mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in vitro and in vivo was measured respectively by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry analysis of CD34 and VEGF expression in primary melanoma was also presented. Results: β-Elemene inhibited B16BF10 cell proliferation starting from 200 μM, but VEGF from 20 μM. Both 20 and 50 μM β-elemene in vitro inhibited VEGF-induced sprouting vessel of rat aortic ring and microvessel formation of chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane. In vivo, tumor size of primary melanoma in mice intraperitoneally treated with β-elemene was significantly smaller than that of the control; CD34 expression of primary melanoma was also suppressed; and the metastatic melanoma colonies and content of melanin in lung were detected obviously decreased in mice of β-elemene-treated groups. Furthermore, results of VEGF expressing in primary melanoma, serum and lung of mice also disclosed that VEGF was inhibited in vivo. Conclusions: β-Elemene inhibited melanoma growth and metastasis through suppressing VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. It is a natural potential antiangiogenic agent. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79953657039	Injectable caltrop fruit saponin protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brain	The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of injectable caltrop fruit saponin preparation (ICFSP) on ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brain. Rats were injected with ICFSP and then subjected to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Then the neurological deficit score was evaluated by Bederson's method. The infarct size was assessed by TTC staining. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat cerebrum were measured with kits, and the content of 6 K prostaglandin F1α (6-K-PGF 1α), thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and endothelin (ET) in blood plasma was measured by radioimmunoassay. The results demonstrated that ICFSP led to a decrease in infarct size (p < 0.01), neurological deficit score (p < 0.05) and plasma content of TXB2 and ET (p < 0.05), and an increase of the plasma level of 6-K-PGF 1α (p < 0.05) and SOD activity in cerebrum, where the MDA and NO content were decreased. The treatment improved forelimb function. ICFSP showed a similar potency compared to that of Ligustrazine hydrochloride parenteral solution (LHPS) and nimodipine (Nim). We concluded that ICFSP protects the brain damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, and this may be closely related to the regulation of reactive oxygen species (MDA and SOD activity) and NO levels in the rat cerebrum, as well as vasoactive factors in the plasma (6-K-PGF 1α, TXB2 and ET). © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company & Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

Sertoli cells were isolated from piglet testes using a two-step enzyme digestion and followed by differential plating. Piglet sertoli cells were cultured and classified into five groups, that is, group A, the control without gossypol, group B with 2.5 μg/ml gossypol, group C with 5 μg/ml gossypol, group D with 10 μg/ml gossypol and group E with 20 μg/ml gossypol. We found that sertoli cells' growth was inhibited by gossypol at dose 2.5 μg/ml when compared with the control group. The oxidase activity of sertoli cell also decreased at 2.5 μg/m gossypol. Moreover, DNA damage of sertoli cells was observed at 5 μg/ml gossypol. Putting this into consideration, our study suggests that exposure of gossypol to sertoli cells leads to an inhibition of sertoli cell growth and oxidase activity of sertoli cells at a low concentration, whereas gossypol results in DNA damage of sertoli cells at a higher concentration. © 2011 Academic Journals.

79955843162	The progress of estrogen regulating tumor angiogenesis	Gynecological tumor has been the most harmful disease for women now. Although the exact mechanism about it is not understood, it is confirmed to be related with estrogen. Recently , molecular mechanism research in the relationship between gynecological tumor and abnormal level estrogen has become a hotspot. Clinical and experimental data indicated that estrogen can regulate several signaling pathways via binding estrogen receptor, resulting in the significant change in endothelium cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, sprouting, adhesion and aberrant angiogenesis, thus, finally influencing the progress of tumor initiation, development, metastasis. Here we introduced main protein molecules and signaling pathways involved in the process of estrogen regulating angiogenesis, and discussed the possibility for estrogen-mediated antitumor research in traditional Chinese medicine.

79956277944	Research progress on myofibroblasts: Their sources and roles in liver fibrogensis	Liver fibrosis is characterized by the pathobiology of excessive deposition of extracellular matrix due to a variety of pathogenic factors including chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholism, drug interactions, metabolic disorders, etc., in which hepatic connective tissues are dramatically increased. Formation and activation of myofibroblasts (MFB), which have contractility and are strongly capable of producing collagen, are thought to be the key events in hepatic firbogenesis. Although the sources of myofibroblasts implicated in hepatic fibrosis have not been characterized definitely, it has been widely accepted that the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) is the primary source of myofibroblasts. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that there are some new supplementary mechanisms underlying the origins of myofibroblasts, including recruitment of bone marrow-derived fibrocytes, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocytes, and transformation of peripheral blood cell to fibroblast-like cells. The article focuses on the progress in the novel origins of hepatic myofibroblasts and their roles in hepatic fibrosis progression.

79959623733	Cryptotanshinone has diverse effects on cell cycle events in melanoma cell lines with different metastatic capacity	Purpose: Cryptotanshinone is a major active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza, which is often used as Chinese herbal medicine in cancer therapy. Here, we systematically assessed the anti-tumor effect of Cryptotanshinone on two melanoma cell lines with low/high-metastatic capacity (B16/B16BL6). Methods: MTT and LDH assays were used to evaluate cell growth and cytotoxicity. We assessed the effect of Cryptotanshinone on cell apoptosis or proliferation by Annexin V, TUNEL or BrdU assay. Cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. The integrity of cell cycle checkpoints was determined by mutational analyses of B-RAF and N-RAS, and the expression of cell cycle-associated proteins by western blotting. Results: Treatment with Cryptotanshinone had no obvious effect on cell apoptosis but significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Cryptotanshinone slightly increased the expression of p53, Chk1, and Chk2 in both B16 and B16BL6. Interestingly, Cryptotanshinone induced G1 arrest with a concomitant increase in p21 expression in B16BL6 cells. However, in B16 cells, Cryptotanshinone induced the G2/M arrest through its induction of Cdc25c. Regulation of Cyclin A1, Cyclin B1 and Cdk1/cdc2 expression might contribute to the different cell cycle patterns in B16 and B16BL6 after Cryptotanshinone treatment. Conclusions: Cryptotanshinone could have diverse effects on cell cycle events in melanoma cell lines with different metastatic capacity. This property might offer an opportunity to study underlying mechanisms for the different antitumor effects of administered Cryptotanshinone in B16 and B16BL6 cells. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

80054095041	Role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in tumor metastasis	Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a member of lysophospholopid (LP) family, is an important extracellular signal transmitter and intracellular second messenger. Under physiological conditions, LPA can promote mitosis, affect cellular morphology, and accelerate wound healing. Recently, clinical data have shown that LPA is closely associated with tumor progression including tumorigenicity, invasion and metastasis. However, the relationships between LPA expression and tumor metastasis at molecular level are poorly understood. Basically, current studies of this issue are positioned in preclinical stage and effective drugs targeting LPA against tumor metastasis are lacking in clinical settings. This review based on the key steps of tumor metastasis summarized the role and underlying mechanisms of LPA implicated in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and migration in the hope of providing new approaches for LPA-targeted antitumor agent development and clinical management of tumors.

83055195221	Cryptotanshinone inhibits lymphatic endothelial cell tube formation by suppressing VEGFR-3/ERK and small GTPase pathways	Cryptotanshinone (CPT), isolated from the plant Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, is a potential anticancer agent. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. Here, we show that CPT inhibited lymphangiogenesis in an in vitro model (tube formation). This effect was partly attributed to inhibiting expression of VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) in murine lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), as overexpression of VEGFR-3 conferred resistance to CPT inhibition of the tube formation, whereas downregulation of VEGFR-3 mimicked the effect of CPT, blocking the tube formation. Furthermore, CPT inhibited phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Overexpression of VEGFR-3 attenuated CPT inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas downregulation of VEGFR-3 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in LECs. Expression of constitutively active MKK1 resulted in activation of ERK1/2 and partially prevented CPT inhibition of LEC tube formation. In addition, CPT also inhibited protein expression and activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 and Cdc42 concurrently, but not Rac1 or Cdc42 alone, conferred resistance to CPT inhibition of LEC tube formation. Taken together, the results suggest that CPT inhibits LEC tube formation, in part, by inhibiting VEGFR-3-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and, in part, by inhibiting expression of the small GTPases. ©2011 AACR.

81455138244	Molecular basis of hepatic stellate cell-driven angiogenesis implicated in liver fibrosis	Hepatic fibrogenesis coexists with pathological angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, constituting barriers to fibrosis regression and recovery. Angiogenesis has been emerging as a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis, and several antiangiogenic agents have indeed exhibited antifibrotic profiles in preclinical studies. Hepatic stellate cells as liver specific pericytes modulate multiple stages of liver pathological angiogenesis by expressing a number of proangiogenic cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, leptin and angiopoietin-1. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms of fibrotic angiogenesis driven by stellate cells in the hope of providing new insight into hepatic fibrogenesis beneficial to the discovery of novel pharmacological targets.

The substituted urea derivative URD12 introduced in this study exhibits cytotoxic activity against the K562 human leukemia and KB human mouth epidermal carcinoma cell lines. To further study the bioactivity of URD12 and examine its feasibility as a new antitumor drug, we applied in vivo and in vitro assays to investigate the antitumor activity of URD12. URD12 was prepared and its cytotoxicity was evaluated using the BGC-823 human gastric carcinoma, MGC-803 human gastric carcinoma, SMMC-7721 human hepatoma and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using MTT assays. Antitumor activity in vivo was confirmed in mice bearing H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Organ coefficient was used to further elucidate the cytotoxic mechanisms of URD12. URD12 inhibited the growth of tested tumor cell lines in vitro and the growth of H22 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo with no effects on the weight, spleen and thymus coefficient of tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that URD12 is an effective antitumor agent without evident immunosuppression effects.

84855589241	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ cross-regulation of signaling events implicated in liver fibrogenesis	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor with transcriptional activity controlling multiple physical and pathological processes. Recently, PPARγ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Its depleted expression has strong associations with the activation and transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells, the central event in liver fibrogenesis. Studies over the past decade demonstrate that PPARγ cross-regulates a number of signaling pathways mediated by growth factors and adipokines, and cellular events including apoptosis and senescence. These signaling and cellular events and their molecular interactions with PPARγ system are profoundly involved in liver fibrogenesis. We critically summarize these mechanistic insights into the PPARγ regulation in liver fibrogenesis based on the updated findings in this area. We conclude with a discussion of the impacts of these discoveries on the interpretation of liver fibrogenesis and their potential therapeutic implications. PPARγ activation could be a promising strategy for antifibrotic therapy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..

Methods: The primary rat HSCs were isolated, purified and cultured in vitro. The MTT assay was used to detect the effects of PDGF on HSC proliferation. Western blot assay and Real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of PDGF-βR and CTGF, the expression of ECM components α-SMA, α1 (I) collagen and fibronectin, and the expression of ECM regulatory proteins MMP-2 and TIMP-1, respectively. Results: MTT assay showed that PDGF promoted HSC proliferation in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. PDGF stimulated its receptor PDGF-βR and CTGF expression. Activated PDGF signaling further upregulated the protein and mRNA levels of α-SMA, α1 (I) collagen and fibronectin. Moreover, the dynamic ECM equilibrium was affected by PDGF, which upregulated TIMP-1, but downregualted MMP-2 expression. Conclusion: PDGF/PDGF-βR signaling cascade can significantly stimulate HSC activation and ECM production, and inhibit ECM degradation. Our results may provide evidence for developing antifibrotic drugs targeting PDGF pathway.

84860252660	Xanthatin induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis via disrupting NF-κB pathway in A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cells	Xanthatin, a natural sesquiterpene lactone, has significant antitumor activity against a variety of cancer cells, yet little is known about its anticancer mechanism. In this study, we demonstrated that xanthatin had obvious dose-/time-dependent cytotoxicity against the human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549. Flow cytometry analysis showed xanthatin induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Xanthatin also had pro-apoptotic effects on A549 cells as evidenced by Hoechst 33258 staining and annexin V-FITC staining. Mechanistic data revealed that xanthatin downregulated Chk1, Chk2, and phosphorylation of CDC2, which contributed to the cell cycle arrest. Xathatin also increased total p53 protein levels, decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio and expression of the downstream factors procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, which triggered the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, xanthatin blocked phosphorylation of NF-κB (p65) and IκBα, which might also contribute to its pro-apoptotic effects on A549 cells. Xanthatin also inhibited TNFα induced NF-κB (p65) translocation. We conclude that xanthatin displays significant antitumor effects through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in A549 cells. These effects were associated with intrinsic apoptosis pathway and disrupted NF-κB signaling. These results suggested that xanthatin may have therapeutic potential against NSCLC. © 2012 by the authors.

In the present study, we demonstrated the significant antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of xanthatin on human gastric carcinoma MKN-45 cells. MTS assay showed that xanthatin produced obvious cytotoxicity in MKN-45 cells with ICvalues of 18.6, 9.3, and 3.9 M for 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. Results of flow cytometry analysis indicated that the antiproliferative activity induced by xanthatin might be executed via G2/M cell cycle arrest and proapoptosis in MKN-45 cells. Western blot analysis elucidated that: a) xanthatin downregulated expression of Chk1 and Chk2 and phosphorylation of CDC2, which are known as key G2/M transition regulators; b) xanthatin increased p53 activation, decreased the bcl-2/bax ratio and the levels of downstream procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, which are key regulators in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway; c) xanthatin blocked phosphorylation of NF-κB (p65 subunit) and of IκBα, which might contribute to its proapoptotic effects on MKN-45 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that xanthatin may have therapeutic potential against human gastric carcinoma. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

84862908121	Zearalenone induces apoptosis and necrosis in porcine granulosa cells via a caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent mitochondrial signaling pathway	Zearalenone is a mycotoxin produced mainly by Fusarium. There are numerous incidences of mycotoxicosis in laboratory and domestic animals, especially in pigs. However, little is known about molecular mechanisms of zearalenone toxicity. Granulosa cells are the maximal cell population in follicles, and they play an essential role in the development and maturation of follicles. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of zearalenone at high concentrations on proliferation and apoptosis of porcine granulosa cells and uncover signaling pathway underlying the cytotoxicity of zearalenone. We found that zearalenone reduced the proliferation of porcine granulosa cells in a dose-dependent manner as shown by the MTT assay and zearalenone resulted in an obvious apoptosis and necrosis in porcine granulosa cells as determined by the TUNEL analysis and flow cytometry. In addition, TUNEL assay with caspase inhibitors showed that zearalenone triggered a caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent apoptotic process in porcine granulosa cells. Fluorescence spectrophotometer displayed that zearalenone led to a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential of porcine granulosa cells but enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of the cells. Notably, Western blots revealed that caspase-3 and caspase-9 were activated by zearalenone in porcine granulosa cells. Collectively, our results suggest that zearalenone induces apoptosis and necrosis of porcine granulosa cells in a dose-dependent manner via a caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent mitochondrial pathway. This study thus offers a novel insight into molecular mechanisms by which zearalenone has adverse cytotoxicity on reproduction. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84863127098	Feedback activation mechanism of mTOR pathway and antitumor application of its inhibitors	mTOR is a very important kinase which plays a central role in regulating cell metabolism, growth, and proliferation. Interfering or inhibiting mTOR activity would stop cell growth and subsequently, death in normal cells, especially in cancer cells. Therefore, mTOR has been considered as a critical potential target for cancer therapy. Subsequently, a series of mTOR inhibitors have already been invented and tested in clinics. However, an anti-tumor effect was not indicated as expected. Therefore, it was thought that some factors blocking the mTOR pathway and considerably weakening the clinical efficacy of its inhibitors must be in existence. After intensive studies, feedback mechanisms of mTOR signaling pathway were identified. Simultaneously, the inhibition of mTOR has been observed to activate multi pathways related to cell growth and proliferation. Thus, the feedback mechanisms were regarded as the direct reasons that attenuated the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors and resulted in unsatisfactory clinical effects. In the present paper, the feedback-activated pathways of mTOR-AKT, mTOR-ERK, and mTOR-eIF4E will be discussed in detail, as well as other strategies that rapamycin analogs and specified pathway inhibitors can be combined to treat cancer. The present paper is aimed to fully discuss the potential antitumor activity of mTOR inhibitors.

Method: DPPH radical scavenging, ferric reducing, ferrous iron chelating assay and DCFH-DA fluorescence staining of ROS were introduced to detect antioxidant activity and ROS scavenging activity in vitro; MTT was adopted to analyze the effect of DSS on A549 cells viability at different time and dose. Western blot was used to detect the effect of DSS on the protein expression of hypoxiainducible factor HIF-1α and redox regulating transcription factor Nrf2 in A549 cells and the phosphorylation of upstream Akt, ERK1/2 MAPK. Result: DSS could reduce the ROS level in A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was related to it's strong DPPH radical scavenging activity. Moreover, DSS inhibited A549 cells proliferation in both dose- and time- dependent manner. Further study on molecular mechanism indicated that DSS suppressed redox regulator Nrf2, and down-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. However, DSS had no effect on HIF-1α expression. Conclusion: DSS might have the effect on treating non-small cell lung cancer by scavenging ROS and then inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2 and down-regulating Nrf2 expression in A549 cells.

84866177086	Cryptotanshinone activates p38/JNK and inhibits Erk1/2 leading to caspase-independent cell death in tumor cells	Cryptotanshinone (CPT), a natural compound isolated from the plant Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, is a potential anticancer agent. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that CPT induced caspase-independent cell death in human tumor cells (Rh30, DU145, and MCF-7). Besides downregulating antiapoptotic protein expression of survivin and Mcl-1, CPT increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c- jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2). Inhibition of p38 with SB202190 or JNK with SP600125 attenuated CPT-induced cell death. Similarly, silencing p38 or c-Jun also in part prevented CPT-induced cell death. In contrast, expression of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MKK1) conferred resistance to CPT inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation and induction of cell death. Furthermore, we found that all of these were attributed to CPT induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is evidenced by the findings that CPT induced ROS in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; CPT induction of ROS was inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger; and NAC attenuated CPT activation of p38/JNK, inhibition of Erk1/2, and induction of cell death. The results suggested that CPT induction of ROS activates p38/JNK and inhibits Erk1/2, leading to caspase-independent cell death in tumor cells. ©2012 AACR.

Cellular mobility and adhesion were assessed using Boyden chamber transwell assay and cell adhesion assay, respectively. EMT-related proteins, such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, were examined using Western blotting. Female C57BL/6 mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were injected with B16F10 cells (1×10 6 cells in 0.2 mL per mouse) via the lateral tail vein. The mice were treated with luteolin (10 or 20 mg/kg, ip) daily for 23 d. On the 23rd day after tumor injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the lungs were collected, and metastatic foci in the lung surfaces were photographed. Tissue sections were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and HE staining.Results:Hypoxia changed the morphology of B16F10 cells in vitro from the cobblestone-like to mesenchymal-like strips, which was accompanied by increased cellular adhesion and invasion. Luteolin (550 μmol/L) suppressed the hypoxia-induced changes in the cells in a dose-dependent manner. Hypoxia significantly decreased the expression of E-cadherin while increased the expression of N-cadherin in the cells (indicating the occurrence of EMT-like transformation), which was reversed by luteolin (5 μmol/L). In B16F10 cells, luteolin up-regulated E-cadherin at least partly via inhibiting the β3 integrin/FAK signal pathway. In experimental metastasis model mice, treatment with luteolin (10 or 20 mg/kg) reduced metastatic colonization in the lungs by 50%. Furthermore, the treatment increased the expression of E-cadherin while reduced the expression of vimentin and β3 integrin in the tumor tissues.Conclusion:Luteolin inhibits the hypoxia-induced EMT in malignant melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of β3 integrin, suggesting that luteolin may be applied as a potential anticancer chemopreventative and chemotherapeutic agent. © 2012 CPS and SIMM.

84869151010	Review of a new tumor metastatic target HOTAIR	HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) is the first long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which was found to have regulatory functions of reverse transcription. It can simultaneously bind to polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and histone demethylase complex [LSD1 (lysine specific demethylase 1)/ CoREST (Co-repressor of RE1-silencing transcription factor)/REST] and mediates the binding of these two complexes to the specific gene sites, resulting in histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone H3 dimethyl Lys4 (H3K4me2), and ultimately leading to gene silencing. Clinical studies have shown close relationships of the expression of HOTAIR with metastasis and recurrence of many cancers such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer and liver cancer, as well as the prognosis of the patients with these cancers. The high expression level of HOTAIR can inhibit the expression of cancer-related metastasis suppressor genes and improve the malignant transformation of tumors; conversely, HOTAIR silencing can decrease the metastatic capability of cancer cells.

84870704529	Peroxisome proliferator-Activated receptor-γ as a therapeutic target for hepatic fibrosis: From bench to bedside	Hepatic fibrosis is a dynamic chronic liver disease occurring as a consequence of wound-healing responses to various hepatic injuries. This disorder is one of primary predictors for liver-Associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, no pharmacological agent has been approved for hepatic fibrosis or could be recommended for routine use in clinical context. Cellular and molecular understanding of hepatic fibrosis has revealed that peroxisome proliferator-Activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), the functioning receptor for antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, plays a pivotal role in the pathobiology of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), whose activation is the central event in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. Activation of PPARγ inhibits HSC collagen production and modulates HSC adipogenic phenotype at transcriptional and epigenetic levels. These molecular insights indicate PPARγ as a promising drug target for antifibrotic chemotherapy. Intensive animal studies have demonstrated that stimulation of PPARγ regulatory system through gene therapy approaches and PPARγ ligands has therapeutic promise for hepatic fibrosis induced by a variety of etiologies. At the same time, thiazolidinedione agents have been investigated for their clinical benefits primarily in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a common metabolic liver disorder with high potential to progress to fibrosis and liver-related death. Although some studies have shown initial promise, none has established long-term efficacy in well-controlled randomized clinical trials. This comprehensive review covers the 10-year discoveries of the molecular basis for PPARγ regulation of HSC pathophysiology and then focuses on the animal investigations and clinical trials of various therapeutic modalities targeting PPARγ for hepatic fibrosis. © 2012 Springer Basel AG.

84872142110	In vivo and in vitro antinociceptive effect of fagopyrum cymosum (Trev.) meisn extracts: A possible action by recovering intestinal barrier dysfunction	Fagopyrum cymosum (Trev.) Meisn (Fag) is a herb rhizome which has been widely used to treat diseases. To investigate the effects and mechanisms of the Fag on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), in vivo neonatal pups maternal separation (NMS) combined with intracolonic infusion of acetic acid (AA) was employed to establish IBS rat models. Fag reduced their visceral hyperalgesia and the whole gut permeability, ameliorated colonic mucosa inflammation and injury, and upregulated the expression of decreased tight junction proteins (TJs) of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 (except ZO-2) in colonic epithelium. Caco-2 monolayer cells were incubated with TNF-α and IFN-γ in vitro to establish an epithelial barrier dysfunction model whose transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) depended more on dose of Fag than that of the controls, and whose TJs levels were lower than those of the controls. Fag upregulated the NP-40 insoluble and soluble components of the four TJs markedly in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that Fag alleviated the hyperalgesia of IBS rats by reducing intestinal inflammation and enhancing mucosal epithelial function after regulating the structure and function of TJs. © 2012 Lina Liu et al.

84873722552	Acupuncture combined with curcumin disrupts platelet-derived growth factor β receptor/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling and stimulates extracellular matrix degradation in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats	Background Acupuncture treatment has been increasingly used to treat chronic liver diseases. We previously reported that acupuncture combined with curcumin, a natural antifibrotic compound, could remarkably attenuate liver fibrosis in chemically intoxicated rats, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of acupuncture combined with curcumin on plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) signalling and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation in the fibrotic liver. Methods A total of 60 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into control, model, sham, acupuncture, curcumin and combination treatment groups. During the establishment of fibrosis using carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), acupuncture at LR3, LR14, BL18 and ST36 and/or curcumin treatment by mouth were performed simultaneously. After treatment, serum PDGF levels were measured. Protein and mRNA expression of key effectors in PDGF pathway and fibrinolysis in the liver was determined. Results Acupuncture combined with curcumin potently reduced serum PDGF levels and selectively disrupted the PDGF-βR/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Combination treatment also significantly repressed expression of connective tissue growth factor and upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, promoting fibrinolysis in the fibrotic liver. Conclusions The beneficial effects of acupuncture and its combination with curcumin could be attributed to the disruption of PDGF-βR/ERK pathway and stimulated ECM degradation in the fibrotic liver. Acupuncture treatment significantly enhanced curcumin effects at the molecular level. These findings may provide molecular insights into the potential of acupuncture combined with curcumin for prevention of hepatic fibrosis.

84874307706	Compatibility of drug property in effective components of Chinese materia medica	Effective components combination of Chinese materia medica (CMM) is an important model for study on the modernization of CMM. The maximum effectiveness could be obtained through the separation and secondary combination of the effective components in traditional processed pieces. Although the effective components combination does not break away from the overall effect of the original prescriptions, the effective components normalization, i.e. research on the effective components of CMM, faces the problems that is easy to decompose the components but hard to decompose the drug natures. Therefore, it needs to well define the relationship between the separation and reunion of each component and its CMM in sample library. The material basis for the CMM macroscopic drug natures is precisely their microscopic chemical ingredient. However, there are some respective limitations to recognize the drug natures by chemoinformatics and knowledge discovery, a real and objective characterization system for the evaluation on the natures of CMM and their components should return to the biological effective models which could dynamically and sustainably present the interaction between drugs and organism. Upon that, choosing the typical CMM pairs prescribed according to the theory of nature compatibility with a few herbs but remarkable efficacy to elucidate the mechanisms of natures compatibility by effective components combination will be beneficial to the scientific significance and security of effective components compatibility of CMM.

84874330932	Holothurian Glycosaminoglycan Inhibits Metastasis and Thrombosis via Targeting of Nuclear Factor-κB/Tissue Factor/Factor Xa Pathway in Melanoma B16F10 Cells	Holothurian glycosaminoglycan (hGAG) is a high-molecular-weight form of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate and has an antithrombotic effect. Our previous studies demonstrated that hGAG efficiently inhibited tumor cell metastasis. The interplays between thrombosis and tumor progression may have a major impact on hematogenous metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated that the mouse melanoma B16F10 cells treated with hGAG displayed a significant reduction of metastasis and coagulation capacity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that hGAG treatment in B16F10 cells remarkably inhibited the formation of fibrin through attenuating the generation of activated Factor Xa (FXa), without affecting the expression of urokinase (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) that involved in fibrinolysis. Moreover, hGAG treatment downregulated the transcription and protein expression of tissue factor (TF). Promoter deletions, site mutations and functional studies identified that the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB binding region is responsible for hGAG-induced inhibition of TF expression. While the hGAG treatment of B16F10 cells was unable to inhibit NF-κB expression and phosphorylation, hGAG significantly prevented nuclear translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol, a potential mechanism underlying the transcriptional suppression of TF. Moreover, hGAG markedly suppressed the activation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, the central regulators for the expression of metastasis-related matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Consequently, hGAG exerts a dual function in the inhibition of metastasis and coagulation activity in mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. Our studies suggest hGAG to be a promising therapeutic agent for metastatic cancer treatment. © 2013 Zhao et al.

84875544700	Clearance of activated stellate cells for hepatic fibrosis regression: Molecular basis and translational potential	Hepatic fibrosis, characterized by abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), is a common pathological process of many chronic liver diseases. A growing number of studies have shown that the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. Inhibiting the activation of HSCs and accelerating the clearance of activated HSCs may be effective strategies for resolution of hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of clearance of activated HSCs and the therapeutic implications is an active subject of research. Studies have shown that apoptosis, immune clearance, phenotype reversion and senescence are involved in clearance of activated HSCs. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms of clearance of activated HSCs and their potential in resolution of hepatic fibrosis. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

84875002307	Effects of curcumin on extracellular matrix in hepatic stellate cells activated by platelet-derived growth factor	Objective: To investigate the effects of curcumin on extracellular matrix deposition in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to detect the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), main constituents in extracellular matrix I procollagen (α1I collagen), and fibronectin in PDGF-stimulated HSCs, and to observe the effects on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 protein and mRNA related to regulate the degradation balance in extracellular matrix. Results: Curcumin could obviously reduce the expression of α-SMA, α1I collagen, and fibronectin at both protein and mRNA levels and reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix. Moreover, curcumin could also regulate the degradation balance through the down-regulation of TIMP-1 expression while the up-regulation MMP-2 expression. Conclusion: Curcumin could inhibit the synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix of HSCs activated by PDGF, promote the degradation of extracellular matrix, decrease the deposition of extracellular matrix in liver, and therefore show the therapeutical effects on hepatic fibrosis.

84875027698	Quercetin improves TNF-α induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cells	To explore the role of quercetin in improving TNF-α-induced cells' models with intestinal barrier dysfunction, we established the epithelial barrier dysfunction model through Caco-2 monolayer cells incubated with 200 ng/mL TNF-α for 24 h. Then the models were treated with quercetin (5, 15, 30 μ mol/L) by which the permeability of epithelial monolayers, their expression and function of Claudin-1 and Occludin were affected. The results showed that, compared with the control group, epithelial permeability was increased and the phosphorylation components in tight junction (TJ) proteins of claudin-1 and occludin were markedly reduced in TNF-α group. After monolayers treated with quercetin, their barrier function, phosphorylation components of Claudin-1 and Occludin and the whole cell proteins of Occludin were all upregulated in a dose-dependent manner. So quercetin could improve the intestinal barrier function by regulating their structure and function of TJ proteins.

84875040944	Progress in lipopolysaccharide/toll-like receptor 4 signaling transduction in hepatic fibrosis	Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) is one of the pattern recognition receptors. It acts as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide, a cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. The innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated by lipopolysaccharide binding to TLR4 so as to effectively reduce microorganism invasion. In the liver, all parenchyma cells and nonparenchymal cells can express TLR4. In recent years, there is growing evidence that some cells in the liver, such as hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells and dendritic cells, can release many kinds of cytokines through lipopolysaccharide/ TLR4 signal transduction, causeing a series of pathological changes so as to participate in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis.

84879427704	Paeonol inhibits hepatic fibrogenesis via disrupting nuclear factor-κB pathway in activated stellate cells: In vivo and in vitro studies	Background and Aims: Hepatic fibrosis represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The present study was to evaluate the antifibrogenesis effect of paeonol and involved mechanisms. Methods: The degree of liver injury was evaluated biochemically by measuring serum and fibrotic markers and pathological examination. Cell viability was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and trypan blue staining. Cytotoxic effects were determined using lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Cell cycle was determined using single dyeing methods of propidium iodide (PI) by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was confirmed using double-staining of annexin V/PI and Hoechst. Western blot, immunofluorescence and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to explore the molecular mechanisms. Results: Treatment with paeonol significantly protected the liver from injury by reducing the activities of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, improving the histological architecture of the liver, and by inhibiting activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vivo. Interestingly, paeonol had no apparent cytotoxic effects but could markedly inhibit primary HSC proliferation and induced HSC cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint. These effects were caused by paeonol suppression of phosphorylation of cycle protein cdc2 and of CDK2. Moreover, that paeonol triggered mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and led to activation of caspase cascades in HSCs was found. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway inhibition resulted in the earlier events. Furthermore, paeonol altered the expression of some marker proteins relevant to HSCs activation. Conclusion: Paeonol could inhibit HSC proliferation and induce mitochondrial apoptosis via disrupting NF-κB pathway, which might be the mechanisms of paeonol reduction of liver fibrosis. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

We herein reported the anti-tumor effects of Xanthatin both in vitro and in vivo. MTS assay results showed that Xanthatin had a remarkable anti-proliferative effect on B16-F10 cells. Moreover, the expression of β-catenin was up-regulated both in vitro and in vivo. Animal studies further revealed that Xanthatin killed the tumor cells around the blood vessels which contributes to reduce microvascular density extremely. All these results indicate that Xanthatin inhibited murine melanoma B16-F10 cell proliferation possibly associated with activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and its activity against melanoma tumor might also be relevant to inhibition of angiogenesis. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

84883030295	Tumor blood vessel normalization and antitumor therapy	Traditional anti-angiogenesis strategies attempt to limit the blood supply to tumor and hence inhibit tumor growth. Although such therapeutic strategies have been used in clinical practice for many years, their effects are still controversial because they may lead to drug resistance. As a result of excessive production of angiogenic molecules, the tumor vessels become abnormal in structure and function. Based on these findings, some researchers have proposed a theory of normalization of tumor blood vessels. The evidence from preclinical and initial clinical trials revealed that normalization of tumor blood vessels could be considered as a complementary therapy to treat tumor. In this article, the mechanisms, benefits, and possible clinical translation of vessel normalization for tumor, which may provide some beneficial references for investigators and pharmaceutical companies involved in this research area, were discussed.

To improve the druggability of these drugs, it is urgent to put much attention on the effectiveness-cytotoxicity correlation study. Activity-based protein profiling can realize the discovery of pharmacological and cytotoxic information and drug design under the guidance of chemicals activity. In view of the promiscuity of natural chemicals, we utilize the method of comparative targets profile to calculate and seek druggable targets in biological networks for drug structure optimization. In conclusion, we take the loop mode of drug→disease→target→drug method, hoping to provide the reference for the research and development of new drug with high efficiency and low toxicity from poisonous CMM.

Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) with Rhodamine 123 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with DCFH-DA were analyzed by fluorescence spectrofluorometry. In addition, the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was assessed by Western Blot assay. Finally, the GA-induced cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry in the present of caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK and Ac-LEHD-FMK, respectively. GA significantly inhibited the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and caused obvious cell apoptosis and a loss of ΔΨm in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, the ROS production in cells was elevated, and the levels of activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 were up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, GA-induced cell apoptosis was markedly inhibited by caspase inhibitors. These results suggest that GA-induced RAW264.7 cell apoptosis may be mediated via a caspase-dependent mitochondrial signaling pathway. © 2013 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science.

84885962891	Tetramethylpyrazine reduces glucose and insulin-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells by inhibiting insulin receptor-mediated PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways	Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is the central event during liver fibrogenesis. Metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia contributes to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-associated liver fibrosis. This study was to investigate the effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) on HSC activation induced by glucose and insulin (Glu/Ins) and the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that Glu/Ins significantly stimulated proliferation, invasion, adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in HSCs. TMP inhibited HSC proliferation, invasion and adhesion, and reduced the expression of marker genes related to HSC activation in Glu/Ins-activated HSCs. Mechanistic evidence revealed that TMP reduced insulin receptor (InsR) expression and blocked the downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades, which was required for TMP attenuation of HSC activation. Moreover, TMP modulated the genes relevant to ECM homeostasis favoring ECM degradation. It could be concluded that TMP inhibited Glu/Ins-stimulated HSC activation and ECM production by inhibiting InsR-mediated PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84888876148	Arsanilic acid causes apoptosis and oxidative stress in rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK-52e cells) by the activation of the caspase-9 and -3 signaling pathway	Arsenic exists widely in rock, water and air, and arsanilic acid (also known as aminophenyl arsenic acid) is an organoarsenic compound and has been used as feed additives. Organoarsenic compounds in foodstuff cause adverse effects, including acute and chronic toxicity, in animals and humans. However, little is known about the cellular toxicity and mechanisms of organic arsenic on the kidney. In this study, we explored the toxicity and molecular mechanisms of arsanilic acid on rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK-52e cells). The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that arsanilic acid inhibited the proliferation of rat NRK-52e cells in a dose-dependent manner, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and flow cytometry revealed that arsanilic acid induced cellular apoptosis in NRK-52e cells. Fluorescence spectrophotometer displayed that arsanilic acid caused a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP) of NRK-52e cells, but enhanced reactive oxygen species level of these cells. Notably, trolox, a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E, protected NRK-52e cells against MMP loss and apoptosis caused by arsanilic acid. Western blots with caspase inhibitors further indicated that arsanilic acid increased expression of active caspase-3 and -9 in NRK-52e cells. Collectively, these results suggest that arsanilic acid causes apoptosis and oxidative stress in rat kidney epithelial cells through activation of the caspase-9 and -3 signaling pathway. This study thus provides a novel insight into molecular mechanisms by which arsanilic acid has adverse cytotoxicity on renal tubular epithelial cells. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84890489770	Molecular regulation mechanism of tumor sprouting angiogenesis	Sprouting angiogenesis is the primary way of tumor angiogenesis. The diverse pathways and molecules have been involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 has recently emerged as a key signal axis of angiogenesis. Moreover, VEGFR-3 which is highly expressed in the tumor vascular endothelial, plays a bimodal role in regulating angiogenesis by effectively controlling the number of vessel branches and endothelial sprouts. The balance of VEGF/VEGFR and D114/Notchl signaling pathways is significant in the sprouting angiogenesis. The process of sprouting has been regulated by the intersection of VEGF/VEGFR signaling with other pathways, including angiopoietin/Tie, hypoxia-inducible factor, and integrin pathways. Thus, focuse on the initial stage of sprouting will be effective strategies for tumor anti-angiogenesis.

Clinical researches indicate that BRAF (V600E) has been detected in about 50% of patients with advanced melanoma. Currently, drugs (such as ipilimumab and vemurafenib) that have been approved in clinical usage for treating BRAF-mutated melanoma show high responses and prolong the progressfree survival and overall survival significantly, as compared with chemotherapy. However, responses are often short-lived, and most patients develop drug resistance within one year. Recently, an increasing number of studies on drug resistance have been conducted. This paper reviews the research progress of mechanisms for BRAF-mutated melanoma, it also includes discussion about the clinical therapy strategies, which may provide references for follow-up research and clinical treatment.

84892553453	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ interrupts angiogenic signal transduction by transrepression of platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor in hepatic stellate cells	Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are liver-specific pericytes that are recruited to vessels and secret pro-angiogenic cytokines, and thus actively involved in pathological vascularization during liver fibrosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a switch molecule controlling HSC activation. We investigated PPARγ regulation of angiogenic signal transduction and the molecular mechanisms involved in HSCs. Primary rat HSCs and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) were isolated and used in this study. Boyden chamber and tubulogenesis assays, identified that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-RhoA signaling activated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was required for HSC motility and the associated vascularization. PDGF also stimulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and HSC-driven vascularization through signals mediated by extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that activation of PPARc interrupted FAK-RhoA, ERK and mTOR cascades and inhibited HSC-based vascularization. Molecular evidence further revealed that PPARγ attenuation of HSC angiogenic properties was dependent on inhibition of PDGF-β receptor expression. We concluded that PPARγ inhibited angiogenic signal transduction through transrepression of PDGF-β receptor leading to reduced HSC motility, reduced VEGF expression, and thereby attenuated HSC-driven angiogenesis. PPARγ could be a molecular target for preventing vascular remolding in hepatic fibrosis. © 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

Methods: Blood was collected from volunteers. Effects of the prepared water extracts of herbs on platelet aggregation were monitored on a Packs-4 aggregometer. The fluorescence intensity of water extracts of Caulis Spatholobi, Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae on the expression of P-selectin in human platelets of healthy persons was measured with flow cytometry. Results: Out of several herbs investigated, Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae potently inhibited platelet aggregation after incubation with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for 15 min. Caulis Spatholobi Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae inhibited adenosine-5′-diphosphate (ADP) or platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation in PRP in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae, Caulis Spatholobi could not inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Despite its inability to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in PRP, Caulis Spatholobi had a greater anti-aggregating activity in PRP induced by ADP or PAF. Caulis Spatholobi and Flos Carthami showed significant inhibitory effects on the expression of P-selectin. Conclusions: Caulis Spatholobi, Flos Carthami and Rhizoma Curcumae have potent anti-platelet properties, and their inhibitory actions are mediated via different mechanisms. Caulis Spatholobi inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation but not by thrombin, indicating that its mechanism of action might be independent of the thromboxane pathway. The effect of Caulis Spatholobi and Flos Carthami were associated with suppressing the expression of P-selectin. © 2013 Chinese Association of the Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84895757617	Research progress of a new tumor angiogenesis target LRG1	LRG1 is a highly conserved member of the leucinerich repeat (LRR) family of proteins. Members of this family are involved in protein-protein interaction, signal transduction, and cell adhesion and development. LRG1 protein's aberrant expression is associated with a variety of structural organization of cancer pathogenesis. The latest research shows the protein can promote the growth of blood vessels especially the "bad" one, while interestingly, diseases such as tumor are characteristic of abnormal growth of blood vessels. More importantly, LRG1 plays a relatively less role in normal blood vessels, so there may exist a unique role which promotes the growth of abnormal blood vessels, which makes LRG1 a particular attractive target as it can be used in treatment or can interfere with angiogenesis-related diseases. A review of the relations between LRG1 protein's abnormal expression and tumor occurrence has been discussed in this paper, also it includes the discussion about the mechanisms of LRG1 protein's disorder-induced tumor formation, which may provide references for the follow-up research and clinical treatment.

We found that disruption of GSK3β activity was essential for xanthatin to exert its anticancer properties in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), concurrent with preferable suppression of constitutive activation of STAT3. Interestingly, inactivation of the two signals are two mutually exclusive events in xanthatin-induced cell death. Moreover, we surprisingly found that exposure of xanthatin failed to trigger the presumable side effect of canonical Wnt/β-Catenin followed by GSK3β inactivation. We further observed that the downregulation of STAT3 was required for xanthatin to fine-tune the risk. Thus, the discovery of xanthatin, which has ability to simultaneously orchestrate two independent signaling cascades, may have important implications for screening promising drugs in cancer therapies. © 2013 Tao et al.

84899099735	Dll4-Notch signaling in regulation of tumor angiogenesis	Tumor angiogenesis is a complex process and involves the tight interplay of tumor cells, endothelial cells, phagocytes and their secreted factors, which may act as promoters or inhibitors of angiogenesis. Many signaling pathways involved in these processes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors, Wnt and mTOR signaling pathway. Though research has confirmed that VEGF can play an important role in tumor angiogenesis, and has designed a lot of drugs that target VEGF, both experimental and clinical studies showed that these pathways mentioned above including VEGF did not play key roles in tumor angiogenesis. With the deepening of the research, people find that of all the signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis, Notch signaling is the most notable one and plays crucial role in tumor angiogenesis. It was previously recognized that the Notch signaling plays a key role only in physiological angiogenesis such as development, wound healing and pregnancy. However, an increasing number of studies have proved that Notch signaling is also involved in pathological angiogenesis such as tumor angiogenesis and plays a critical role in these processes. More importantly, compared to resistance caused by anti-VEGF or other signaling pathways, experimental evidence revealed that Notch was involved in anticancer drug resistance, indicating that targeting Notch could be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment for cancer by overcoming drug resistance of cancer cells. More recently, research has demonstrated that Notch ligands Delta-like 4 (Dll4) plays a key role in tumor angiogenesis. Data show that Dll4 functions as a negative regulator of tumor angiogenesis and is upregulated in tumor vasculature. This review focus on recent insights into Dll4-Notch signaling in tumor angiogenesis and its mechanisms, which may be utilized for a potential pharmacological use as a target for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

A large number of studies have demonstrated that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial event in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated metastasis, resulting in enhanced malignancy of HCC. However, the roles of PKM2 in HCC EMT and metastasis remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to determine the effects of PKM2 in EGF-induced HCC EMT and elucidate the molecular mechanisms in vitro. Our results showed that EGF promoted EMT in HCC cell lines as evidenced by altered morphology, expression of EMT-associated markers, and enhanced invasion capacity. Furthermore, the present study also revealed that nuclear translocation of PKM2, which is regulated by the ERK pathway, regulated β-catenin-TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity and associated EMT in HCC cell lines. These discoveries provide evidence of novel roles of PKM2 in the progression of HCC and potential therapeutic target for advanced cases.

During embryonic development, it regulates the growth and proliferation of progenitor cells and tissue formation. This pathway can be activated during liver injury. Activated Hedgehog signaling pathway is involved in many aspects of liver wound-healing responses, including hepatic progenitor cell proliferation, myofibroblast transdifferentiation, apoptosis of various types of liver cells, inflammatory reactions, and vascular remodeling. This article reviews the research progress in the role of Hedgehog signaling pathway in liver injury and the underlying mechanisms. The potential drug targets are also discussed. This review is to provide novel insights into antifibrotic research and therapeutic targets.

84903266150	Chemomodulatory efficacy of lycopene on antioxidant enzymes and carcinogen-induced cutaneum carcinoma in mice	Oxidative stress has been implicated in various pathological processes, including skin tumourigenesis. Cutaneum carcinoma is commonly responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, and treatments have not progressed substantially in recent years. Alternative strategies, such as chemoprevention, are being considered. In this study, we investigated the chemomodulatory potential of lycopene against 9,10-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced oxidative stress and skin carcinogenesis in female ICR mice. Pretreatment with lycopene at various doses significantly delayed tumour formation and growth. These treatments markedly reduced the tumour incidence and tumour volume. Moreover, lycopene inhibited the formation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, prevented the loss of glutathione, and affected the activities of a battery of oxidant enzymes in the skin of mice. Furthermore, mice that were administered lycopene exhibited higher levels of translocation of nuclear-factor-erythroid-2- related factor 2 into the nucleus compared with the vehicle-treated and model mice. Collectively, these results indicated that lycopene exerts a protective effect against DMBA/TPA-induced cutaneum carcinoma through antioxidant defence.

84903637684	Tetramethylpyrazine inhibits angiotensin II-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells associated with interference of platelet-derived growth factor β receptor pathways	Liver fibrosis represents a frequent event following chronic insult to trigger wound healing responses in the liver. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a pivotal event during liver fibrogenesis. Compelling evidence indicates that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) takes part in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Angiotensin II (Ang II), the primary effector peptide of the RAS, has been demonstrated to be a potent pro-fibrogenic molecule for HSC activation. In this study we investigated the effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) on HSC activation induced by Ang II in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that Ang II significantly promoted cell growth, upregulated the expression of the fibrotic markers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and α1(I) procollagen, and enhanced the invasion capacity in HSCs. TMP inhibited proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M checkpoint associated with altering several cell cycle regulatory proteins in Ang II-treated HSCs. TMP also modulated Bcl-2 family proteins and activated the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis in Ang II-treated HSCs. Moreover, TMP reduced the expression of α-SMA and α1(I) procollagen at mRNA and protein levels, and these effects were associated with interference of the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGF-βR) mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in HSCs exposed to Ang II. Furthermore, Ang II-enhanced HSC invasion capacity was diminished by TMP, which was associated with interference of PDGF-βR/FAK signaling. These data collectively indicated that interference of PDGF-βR-mediated fibrotic pathways was involved in TMP inhibition of HSC activation caused by Ang II, providing novel mechanistic insights into TMP as a potential therapeutic remedy for hepatic fibrosis. © 2014 FEBS.

84903275877	Research progress on antitumor effect of capsaicin	Pepper is commonly used as spices and seasoning in people's daily life, and its main pungent component is capsaicin. Recent studies have suggested that capsaicin has broad pharmacological effects, including pain and itch relief, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and regulation of blood pressure. In recent years, research results showed that, capsaicin can not only inhibit the growth of malignant tumors, but also inhibit tumor angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro . This article mainly reviews the recent progress in capsaicin and its receptors as well as their associations with cancer. The clinical limitation of capsaicin and its potential harmfulness of eating capsaicin are also discussed in this article, which may provide valuable references for future studies for investigators being engaged in cancer research.

84903765064	Modulation of GSK-3β activity in cancer treatment	As the major member of serine/threonine protein kinases family, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) has well characterized roles in the development of a variety of diseases. However, it is noticed that modulation of GSK-3β in tumor progress is two-faced. Once the activity of GSK-3β as a "pro-oncogenic factor" is inhibited, opposing role as a "tumor suppressor" can also be disrupted, which will trigger the consequent side effect on activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The issue has placed a major obstacle to anti-GSK-3β in cancer treatment. In fact, functional compartmentalization of a large number of intracellular signaling events cross-talked with GSK-3β can prevent their mutual interference and determine the cell fate. Therefore, understanding the specific mechanisms of GSK-3β in regulation of diverse signaling systems or refinement of a substrate competitive inhibitor may have great significance to exploit approaches selectively target GSK-3β in tumor treatment.

84904652023	The forecast of anticancer targets of cryptotanshinone based on reverse pharmacophore-based screening technology	Anticancer targets of cryptotanshinone were evaluated and rapidly forecasted with PharmMapper, a reverse pharmacophore-based screening platform, as well as drug target databases, including PDTD, DrugBank and TTD. The pathway analyses for the collection of anticancer targets screened were carried out based on the KEGG pathway database, followed by the forecast of potential pharmacological activities and pathways of the effects of cryptotanshinone, and verification of some of the targets screened using whole cell tests. The results showed that a total of eight targets with anticancer potential were screened, including MAP2K1, RAR. α, RXR. α, PDK1, CHK1, AR, Ang-1 R, and Kif11. These targets are mainly related to four aspects of the cancer growth: the cell cycle, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and androgen receptor. The cell tests showed that cryptotanshinone can inhibit the viability of human hepatoma cells SMMC-7721, which is related to the reduction of expression of MAP2K1 mRNA. This method provides a strong clue for the study of the anticancer effects and mechanisms of action of cryptotanshinone in the future. © 2014 China Pharmaceutical University.

84904913128	Curcumin attenuates angiogenesis in liver fibrosis and inhibits angiogenic properties of hepatic stellate cells	Hepatic fibrosis is concomitant with sinusoidal pathological angiogenesis, which has been highlighted as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic liver disease. Our prior studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent antifibrotic activity, but the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The current work demonstrated that curcumin ameliorated fibrotic injury and sinusoidal angiogenesis in rat liver with fibrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride. Curcumin reduced the expression of a number of angiogenic markers in fibrotic liver. Experiments in vitro showed that the viability and vascularization of rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and rat aortic ring angiogenesis were not impaired by curcumin. These results indicated that hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that are characterized as liver-specific pericytes could be potential target cells for curcumin. Further investigations showed that curcumin inhibited VEGF expression in HSCs associated with disrupting platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor (PDGF-βR)/ERK and mTOR pathways. HSC motility and vascularization were also suppressed by curcumin associated with blocking PDGF-βR/focal adhesion kinase/RhoA cascade. Gain- or loss-of-function analyses revealed that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) was required for curcumin to inhibit angiogenic properties of HSCs. We concluded that curcumin attenuated sinusoidal angiogenesis in liver fibrosis possibly by targeting HSCs via a PPAR-γ activation-dependent mechanism. PPAR-γ could be a target molecule for reducing pathological angiogenesis during liver fibrosis. © 2014 The Authors.

84906826440	The new therapeutic strategy for inhibition of cancer metastasis: Targeting extravasation of cancer cells	Cancer metastasis is the most primary aspect of patient mortality. Recent research has showed extravasation of cancer cells is a crucial step in metastasis. During extravasation, cancer cells reach new foci after attaching vascular endothelial cells and crossing the vessel walls at metastatic sites. The process is closely associated with vascular endothelial cells, circulating platelets and leukocytes, as well as the tissue microenvironment. The results of these studies suggest that the inhibition of extravasation of cancer cells will become an effective strategy for treatment of cancer metastasis. This review focuses on the mechanism and process of extravasation of cancer metastasis, and discusses the prospects of future research, which may provide some beneficial references for therapy of cancer and investigators involved in this research area.

84906939131	Phenolcarboxylic acids from medicinal herbs exert anticancer effects through disruption of COX-2 activity	Integrated research of herbs and formulas characterized by functions of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis is one of the most active fields in traditional Chinese medicine. This paper strives to demonstrate the roles of a homologous series of phenolcarboxylic acids from these medicinal herbs in cancer treatment via targeting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a well-recognized mediator in tumorigenesis. We selected thirteen typical phenolcarboxylic acids (benzoic acid derivatives, cinnamic acid derivatives and their dehydration-condensation products), and found gallic acid, caffeic acid, danshensu, rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B showed 50% inhibitory effects on hCOX-2 activity and A549 cells proliferation. 2D-quantitative method was introduced to describe the potential structural features that contributed to certain bioactivities. We also found these compounds underwent responsible hydrogen bonding to Arg120 and Ser353 in COX-2 active site residues. We further extensively focused on danshensu [d-(+)-β-(3,4-dihydoxy-phenylalanine)] or DSS, which exerted COX-2 dependent anticancer manner. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 could enhance the ability of DSS inhibiting A549 cells growth. Additionally, COX-2/PGE

84906733006	Progress in research on the transcription factor forkhead box Q1 in relation to malignant tumors	The transcription factor forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), a member of foxhead box superfamily, widely exists in human tissues and organs, and it is involved in development process of embryonic stem cells and vertebrate. As a transcription factor, FOXQ1 protein activates the transcription by acting on promoter of target genes or interacting with other transcription factors, and it affects initiation, progression, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells in many aspects such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cellular signal transduction. According to the relationship between FOXQ1 and tumors, the expression level of FOXQ1 can be used as a prognostic index for patients with certain tumors, and FOXQ1 is expected to be a novel target for tumor therapy. This review focuses on the role of FOXQ1 in initiation and progression of certain tumors as well as its potential mechanism, aiming to provide the valuable reference for anticancer treatment and research.

84911457875	Protection of Tong-Sai-Mai decoction against apoptosis induced by H	Tong-Sai-Mai decoction (TSM) is a Chinese materia medica polyherbal formulation that has been applied in treating brain ischemia for hundreds of years. Because it could repress the oxidative stress in in vivo studies, now we focus on the in vitro studies to investigate the mechanism by targeting the oxidative stress dependent signaling. The relation between the neurogenesis and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production remains largely unexamined. PC12 cells are excitable cell types widely used as in vitro model for neuronal cells. Most marker genes that are related to neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell cycles are expressed at high levels in these cells. The aim of the present study is to explore the cytoprotection of TSM against hydrogen peroxide- (H
