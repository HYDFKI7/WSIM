9144263690	Research by private family physicians - What are the strengths and how we might overcome the weaknesses?	There are major difficulties facing academic family medicine in Hong Kong. Academic positions are limited and resources for research are restrained. However, we believe there is much that family physicians in private practice can contribute. Private family physicians can research and publish by themselves, or in collaboration with local and international researchers. The major strengths are that private family physicians are exposed to a wide spectrum of diseases, different from hospital specialists. They are exposed to diseases at their early stages and can make observations from long continuous care. They might have difficulties such as the lack of motivation and initiatives, the lack of well defined research topics, lack of skills and experience, of funds, of access to research laboratories and other support, problems with ethics approval, and lack of computerised medical records which can all be overcome by various strategies.

9644268000	The association of smoking and acne in men in Hong Kong and in India: A retrospective case-control study in primary care settings	Previous studies on the association of smoking with acne vulgaris have reported conflicting results. The objective of this study was to investigate such an association. Our setting was three primary care practices in Hong Kong and one primary care practice in India. Patient characteristics in all four practices are similar. All medical records in these practices incorporate a section in which the smoking habits of each patient is routinely documented. We searched our database and retrieved 632 records of patients with acne seen in the previous 5 years. We also retrieved 632 records of age- and sex-matched controls. Fifty-three out of 379 male patients with acne and 25 out of 379 male controls were smokers (P = 0.001; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8). Six out of 253 female patients with acne and three out of 253 female controls were smokers (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.5-9.4). We conclude that smoking is likely to bear a positive correlation with acne for men. Our numbers are too small for a definite conclusion to be drawn for females.

13944273833	Atypical presentations of pityriasis rosea: Case presentations	Atypical cases of pityriasis rosea (PR) are fairly common and less readily recognized than typical eruptions. We present four patients for whom we believe atypical PR is the most likely diagnosis. A 33-year-old man had purpuric lesions bilaterally on the legs with classical rash on the trunk. A 28-year-old woman had intensely pruritic and urticarial lesions. A 10-year-old girl had hundreds of small papular lesions 1-3 mm in size. A pregnant woman aged 26 had oral haemorrhagic ulcers with classical PR eruption on her trunk. The oral ulcers erupted and remitted at the same time as the generalized eruption. We reviewed the literature and proposed a classification based on rash morphology, rash size, rash distribution, number of lesions, site of lesions, severity of symptoms and course of the eruption. We believe that it is difficult to make a clear division to define typical and atypical PR, and that it is important not to ascribe any unusual or atypical skin eruption with PR unless other dermatoses have been excluded. © 2004 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.

1642586881	Auricular anthropometry of Hong Kong chinese babies	Objectives: To provide a database of the auricular measurements of Chinese infants born in Hong Kong. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Setting and Sample Population: A total of 2384 healthy singleton, born consecutively at the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Union Hospital from October 1998 to September 2000, were included in the study. The range of gestation was 33-42 weeks. Measurements and Results: Measurements included ear width (EW), ear length (EL) and ear position (EP). The data show generally higher values for males in the parameters measured. When compared with previously published data for Caucasian and Jordanian term babies, Chinese babies have shorter EL. The ears were within normal position in nearly all our infants. Conclusion: The human ear appears to grow in a remarkably constant fashion. This study establishes the first set of gestational age-specific standard of the ear parameters for Chinese new-borns, potentially enabling early syndromal diagnosis. There are significant inter-racial differences in these ear parameters. © 2004 Blackwell Munksgaard.

16444382123	The importance of needs assessment in planning health promoting schools initiatives: Comparison of youth risk behaviours of two districts in Hong Kong	A needs assessment is recommended to be carried out before planning resource allocation in a community as it could help to identify the needs of the people. This study illustrated the importance of needs assessment in planning health promoting school initiatives by comparing the results of youth risk behaviours surveys conducted at two districts of Hong Kong, namely Tsuen Wan and North District. The findings indicated that the two districts should prioritize their resources in respect to their urgent needs. A higher proportion of students from Tsuen Wan participated in vigorous exercise regularly in comparison to students from North District. Students from North District consumed more vegetable per week and exhibited less depressive symptoms than students from Tsuen Wan. The availability of data on youth risk behaviours of the two districts would provide information for strategic planning and direct decision-making in youth health programmes.

16444383591	The concept of health promoting schools to enhance positive youth development	The concept of Health Promoting Schools improves the school's physical and social environment, its curriculum, teaching and learning methods, and the personal and social development of students. It will enable the participating schools create a 'learning perspective', 'community perspective', and 'capacity building' environment to improve both educational and health outcomes of students. As the scheme promotes self-esteem of students, staff development, parental education, involvement of the whole school community and linkage with different stakeholders, it will also enhance positive youth development. It will help to shift the paradigm from handling crisis to prevention approaches emphasizing on youth support before problem behaviours occur, and also address the circumstances (families, schools, communities, peer groups) of youth's lives.

16444386454	Parent training: Experience of the New Territories west school health promotion project of Hong Kong	Parents' participation in school life is an important element of a health-promoting school. To maximize the potential of parents as partners in health education and take on a leading role in promoting health in the school, family and community, a parental health education programme using the empowerment model had been launched in partnership between academic and health sectors. A total of 28 parents selected from eight schools in the New Territories West region of Hong Kong participated in the programme. Evaluation of the programme revealed that the programme had matched well with the expectation of most participants. All respondents had reported an increase in health awareness and knowledge, and confidence to promote health concepts in familiar environments, such as the home and school. They also showed interest to participate in further training in health related issues. Parental health education is recommended to enhance active involvement for building a greater sense of belonging and to put through individual empowerment to community empowerment. Parental involvement in school health promotion would be an effective way to facilitate the paradigm shift.

20144389844	What are the needs of students? An experience from a district based health promoting schools project in Hong Kong	A district based needs assessment was conducted over the past year to understand the health problems and the health education needs of the students in Tai Po district, Hong Kong. 6,879 primary one to primary six students from eighteen primary schools, participating in a district based Health Promoting Schools Project in Hong Kong, were invited to complete a self-administrated questionnaire which was partly adapted from the Centre for Diseases and Control (CDC)'s Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance Survey. The results presented a holistic picture of the health and needs of primary students with respect to their general health status, mental health, body weight and dietary behaviour, exercise, preventive health care, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, school environment and school health education. It provides baseline information for the project to prioritize the problems and strategically plan health promotion programmes with reference to the concept of Health Promoting Schools by the World Health Organization.

20144389861	Significance of the hygiene charter towards different sectors in Hong Kong	The occurrence of SARS in March 2003 has resulted in an increased interest, worldwide in emerging infectious diseases. The SARS experience provided us a lesson on the importance of promoting hygienic practices among individuals and different working sectors. In Hong Kong, a voluntary organization called the UNITE proposed a Hygiene Charter which aimed at taking hygiene to new levels. This action has been supported by individuals and different sectors including the Personal and Family, Management, Buildings, Catering, Education, Finance and Commercial, Industrial, Medical and Health, Public Transportation, Social Welfare, Sports and Culture and Tourism. As promotion and maintenance of environmental health requires input from different sectors, the signing of the Hygiene Charter provides an opportunity for individuals and the public to show their pledge and commitment to good hygiene practices. As a result, with environment improvement and good infectious disease control measures, prevention of epidemics of infectious diseases is deemed to be possible.

21044452090	Evaluating health-promoting schools in Hong Kong: Development of a framework	Health-promoting schools (HPS)/healthy schools have existed internationally for about 15 years. Yet there are few comprehensive evaluation frameworks available which enable the outcomes of HPS initiatives to be assessed. This paper identifies an evaluation framework developed in Hong Kong. The framework uses a range of approaches to explore what schools actually do in their health promotion and health education initiatives. The framework, which is based on the WHO (Western Pacific Regional Office) Guidelines for HPS, is described in detail. The appropriate instruments for data collection are described and their origins identified. The evaluation plan and protocol, which underpinned the very comprehensive evaluation in Hong Kong, are explained. Finally, a case is argued for evaluation of HPS to be more in line with the educational dynamics of schools and the research literature on effective schooling, rather than focusing primarily on health-related measures. © The Author 2005.

22644439792	Exploring parents' understanding and concerns on self- management of childhood asthma	Objective: To estimate the knowledge level, understanding and attitude of parents pertaining to self management of childhood asthma. Design: A semi-structured focus group interview conducted in a community health intervention programme. Subjects: Six parents whose children suffered from asthma or "bronchial hypersensitivity" participated in a 45-minute focus group interview. Main outcome measures: (1) Knowledge level of the difference between asthma and bronchial hypersensitivity; (2) Understanding of the management of bronchial hypersensitivity and asthma; (3) Acceptance of the diagnosis of asthma made by doctors; (4) Parental concerns during asthmatic exacerbation and management strategies; (5) Views as to the adequacy of public health resources for the management of asthma and its education, and the associated underlying reasons. Results: There were misconceptions concerning asthma and bronchial hypersensitivity among parents, evident by the level of the parents' difficulty in accepting the diagnosis due possibly to stigmatization. Some parents were skeptical about the usefulness of proper exercise and the use of Western medicines, particularly locally inhaled steroids. The main concerns they had as regards managing asthmatic exacerbations were time investment, home environmental alertness and frustrations in "inheriting the disease". There have been no obvious strategies to relieve the stress and worries. They believed that more resources should be put towards health education of asthma for the parents or care-givers. Conclusions: There should be a tailor-made community educational initiative for childhood asthma to find out parental concerns and ideas in order to allow self-management programmes successful. We suggest more extensive public health education so as to improve the knowledge gaps and address the worries and concerns of childhood asthma care-givers.

23244436785	Fetal growth velocities in Hong Kong Chinese infants	Few studies have investigated the velocities of fetal growth. The aim of the present study was to determine the pattern of 'fetal' growth velocities in a Chinese population. The gestation-specific measurements of the body weight, body length and head circumference in a representative sample of 5,045 male and 4,484 female newborns delivered between 26 and 42 weeks of gestation at 12 hospitals in Hong Kong were obtained. Peak growth velocity occurred before 30 weeks of gestation for head circumference, at week 30 for length and at week 30 for weight. When compared with data obtained from a French population, a significant difference in the growth velocity for body weight was observed below 32 weeks between French and Chinese infants, suggesting an ethnic difference in fetal growth of this parameter.

0030819319	Changing family medicine/general practice morbidity patterns in Hong Kong adults	Background: As Hong Kong becomes more affluent and undergoes rapid urbanization, the family medicine (FM)/general practice (GP) morbidity pattern will shift from acute self limiting illnesses to chronic illnesses similar to other developed countries. Some overseas studies also show that chronic diseases occur at an early age. Objective : To compare the 1994 FM/GP morbidity pattern for adults (aged 12-59) with previous studies done in 1981- 82 and 1985-86, and note the changes and trends. Methods : The overall morbidity pattern by systems in the 1994 Morbidity Survey was compared with the surveys done in 1981-82 and 1985-86. The trend for some highly prevalent illnesses of 1994 survey was compared with the 1981-82 survey. Chi square and Fisher Exact tests were used for analysis. Results : A higher proportion of patients in 1994 presented with problems related to endocrine, circulatory, locomotor and nervous systems and sense organs. Higher proportion of patients in 1994 presented with diabetes mellitus, raised blood pressure, lipid disorders and back pain than in 1981-82. Lower proportion of patients in 1994 presented with peptic ulcer diseases and neurotic disorders. Conclusion : The change can be a real change in prevalence, or a change in readiness of the patients to present themselves, or increased willingness/ability of the physicians to diagnose particular problems. The workload of family physicians (FPs)/general practitioners (GPs) may change from treating predominantly acute self limiting illnesses to managing more chronic diseases.

0031723143	Use of indapamide in hospital and community clinics and its effect on plasma potassium in Chinese patients	Objectives: To investigate the usage pattern of indapamide and other antihypertensive drugs in patients attending a community-based government outpatient clinic (GOPC) or a hospital-based specialist clinic (SC). The plasma potassium concentrations of patients receiving indapamide and other diuretics were also examined. Method: Prescriptions from the SC and the GOPC were reviewed and collected during January 1998. Patients' plasma potassium concentrations and the date of initiation of each medication were retrieved from the hospital computer databases at SC. An age- and sex-matched control group of patients on non-diuretic antihypertensive drugs was identified. Results: A total of 1648 and 773 prescriptions were collected from the SC during a 1-week period and GOPC during a 1-month period, respectively. Approximately half (45%) of the patients received antihypertensive treatment. Indapamide was five times more frequently prescribed in GOPC than SC (84.7 vs. 17.7%, P < 0.001). Calcium channel blocking agents were the commonest antihypertensive drugs used in both clinics. The mean plasma potassium concentration of patients taking indapamide was lower than that of the control group (P = 0.037). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that consumption of indapamide (P = 0.002) and duration of diuretic therapy (P = 0.023) were significantly related to changes in plasma potassium concentrations [multiple regression equation for potassium level = 4.09 - 0.145 (thiazide = 1) - 0.377 (indapamide = 1) - 0.00468 (duration of diuretic therapy in months)]. Conclusion: Indapamide was used extensively in the community clinic and less in the hospital-based outpatient clinic. Patients receiving indapamide had a significantly lower plasma potassium concentration as compared to other diuretics or antihypertensive groups and this was predicted by a multiple linear regression model. Monitoring plasma electrolytes before initiation of indapamide treatment and at regular intervals thereafter is essential for detecting the hypokalaemia that may occur in Chinese patients.

0031800567	Seasonal variation of morbidity in Hong Kong	Objective: To study the seasonal variation of morbidity in Hong Kong. Design: A morbidity survey was conducted among Family Physicians (FPs)/General Practitioners (GPs) in Hong Kong in 1994. The participants were asked to record the diagnosis, age and sex of all cases in a selected week in each of the four seasons. Diseases were coded using the ICPC coding. Data were analysed by the SPSS. Subjects: Patients who consulted the participating FPs/GPs within the study weeks. Main outcome measure: FPs/GPs stated diagnoses. Results: Thirty-six FPs/GPs completed the recording of 51186 health problems. Respiratory infection, the commonest illness, had the most significant seasonal variation with higher frequency in spring. Allergic respiratory diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis were commoner in spring and autumn. Skin infections and eczema, gastrointestinal infections were commoner in summer. Attempt was made to explain the variations observed. Conclusion: This study showed that there were seasonal variation of diseases including respiratory infection and allergies, gastrointestinal infections and skin diseases. This served as stimulation for further study of the seasonal variation of specific diseases and could provide valuable data for planning of preventive measures and health resources.

0031917374	Morbidity pattern in private and public sectors of family medicine/general practice in a dual health care system	Objective: To study the differences and their implication on the morbidity pattern in family medicine (FM)/general practice (GP) in the private and public sectors of a dual health care system. Design: A survey on morbidity of patients diagnosed by family physicians (FPs)/general practitioners (GPs) in Hong Kong. A convenient sample of FPs/GPs in private practice and a random sample of doctors in government outpatient clinics were recruited for the study. Subjects: All patients seen by the recruited FPs/GPs in 4 one-week periods over the four seasons in 1994. Main outcome measures: The diagnoses or problems identified by FPs/GPs at each patient encounter. Results: The patients in the public sector were mostly from the lower social classes, of older age, more females, with more chronic illnesses, and with more problems per consultation. Public-sector FPs/GPs could afford less time for each patient, made less psycho-social diagnoses, had to tolerate more diagnostic uncertainty, and had more difficulty in thorough understanding of their patients' background. Apart from acute primary care health problems, private FPs/GPs encountered more health problems requiring thorough evaluation and explanation. Conclusion: Morbidity pattern differs in the private and public sectors. The difference may be related to the job nature and work load of the respective physicians.

23244461247	Normative data of penile length for term Chinese newborns	Careful examination and assessment of penile length in the newborn is important because micropenis is associated with hypothalamic disorders. This prospective cross-sectional study was designed to establish the norm of penile length for term Hong Kong Chinese newborns. 4,628 full-term healthy male newborns were enrolled in the study. Penile length was measured from pubic ramus to the tip of the glans penis by placing the end of a straight edge ruler against the pubic ramus. A gestation-associated graph of 3rd, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 97th centiles for the penile length was created. The penile length was significantly correlated with gestational age, birth weight and body length. When compared with published data for other populations. Hong Kong newborns have significantly shorter penile length. The norm of the penile length is useful in diagnostic and therapeutics for the ethnic Chinese male newborns. Copyright © 2005 S.

24344460377	Trunk anthropometry of Hong Kong Chinese infants	Background: Disturbed growth of the trunk may result in abnormal sternocostal relationship and a variety of pectus deformities. Aims: The purposes of this study were to establish norms of trunk anthropometry for dysmorphology identification in the newborns and to evaluate chest circumference as a predictor for low birth weight for outborn infants where weighing scales were unavailable. Study design and subjects: A total of 10,339 Chinese infants (5478 males, 4861 females) with gestation 24-42 weeks from 12 hospitals were included. The anthropometric measurements analyzed included chest circumference, inter-nipple distance, sternal length and abdominal circumference. Outcome measures: The LMS method using maximum penalized likelihood was used to perform model fitting of the anthropometric centiles for these physical parameters. Results: References tables of the four physical parameters for newborns were constructed. Chest circumference showed the highest correlation with birth weight (male: r = 0.866, female: r = 0.883). The cut-off points for chest circumference of 295 (male) and 299 mm (female) were the best predictor for low birth weight. There were also racial differences in these parameters. When compared with French infants, Chinese newborns had smaller chest circumference. Conclusion: These physical parameters provide useful references and aid dysmorphology diagnosis in newborns of ethnic Chinese origin. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

25144486257	Regression analysis on temporal case clustering in Gianotti-Crosti syndrome	Background: There have been many reports establishing that Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) is associated with various virus infections. Whether the epictemiological picture of GCS does support a multiple infectious etiology is unknown. Objective: To analyze the presence of temporal clustering in patients with GCS. Patients and methods: We retrieved all clinical records of patients with GCS in a dermatology clinic during a period of 30 months. We analyzed temporal clustering by a method based on a regression model. Similarly, we retrieved all clinical records of patients with scabies (infectious, as positive control condition) and atopic dermatitis (non-infectious, as negative control condition) diagnosed in a similar setting. Results: 47 cases of GCS, 35 cases of scabies and 564 cases of atopic dermatitis were identified. No significant temporal cluster was found for patients with GCS. For patients with scabies, statistically significant clustering of 20 cases was detected (p = 0.025). For patients with atopic dermatitis, no significant temporal cluster was found. Conclusion: The epidemiology evidence does not support GCS as having a single infectious etiology. Copyright © 2005 Miami Children's Hospital.

25444513441	Pityriasis rosea - An update	Recent controversies on the etiology, diagnosis and treatment have led to increased interest in pityriasis rosea (PR). We review these aspects of the disease. PR is universal. The incidence is around 0.68 per 100 dermatological patients, or 172.2 per 100,000 person-years. The prevalence in people aged between 10 and 29 years is 0.6%. The male to female ratio is around 1: 1.43. Evidence on seasonal variation is conflicting, but there is no evidence that the incidence is dependent on mean air temperature, mean total rainfall, or mean relative humidity. Spatial-temporal and temporal clustering of cases of PR has been reported. The association of PR with human herpesvirus-7 infection is still controversial. Owing to the extreme high sensitivities of sequence-based detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction, novel criteria should be applied to evaluate the evidence. There is no evidence that PR is associated with other viral or bacterial infections. The role of autoimmunity in PR warrants further investigations. Many patients with PR have one or more atypical features. Application of validated diagnostic criteria may be helpful for atypical cases. The efficacy of macrolides, including erythromycin, in PR is still under evaluation. There is no evidence that antiviral agents are effective. The efficacies of ultraviolet radiotherapy and systemic corticosteroids are not well established. In managing a patient with PR, we should concentrate more on how the eruption is affecting the quality of life, i.e. the illness, rather than the extent and severity of the eruption, i.e. the disease.

27144539510	Primary care physicians in Hong Kong and Canada - How did their practices differ during the SARS epidemic?	Background. Hong Kong and Canada have very different primary health care systems. We thus hypothesized family physicians between the two places would be different in how they protected themselves, their staff and families during the epidemic. Objective. The purpose of this study was to explore and contrast the impact of SARS on family physicians in Hong Kong and Toronto. Methods. A postal questionnaire was designed and sent to 183 tutors affiliated with the Chinese University of Hong Kong with 137 replies (74.8%). In Toronto, 150 questionnaires were sent to academic family physicians affiliated with the University of Toronto with 51 replies (34%). Results. All agreed SARS had changed their clinical behaviour. For public health measures in the control of SARS, Hong Kong physicians were less likely to quarantined themselves (77.1% versus 19.4%, P < 0.01) or gave quarantine leave to staff (95% versus 59.7%, P < 0.01) after exposure to probable or suspected SARS. However, they were more likely to wear a mask (52.7% versus 97.7%, P = 0) during consultation, having support staff to wear masks (68.6% versus 97.8%, P = 0) and test patient's temperature (47.1% versus 68.1%, P < 0.01). Conclusion. There were noticeable differences in how family physicians deal with SARS between the two cities. As SARS emerged as a global disease, better understanding of practice differences among physicians from different countries would facilitate globalization of public health. © The Author (2005).

29144493462	A qualitative study on the historical aspects of pityriasis rosea: Revelations on future directions of research	The exact aetiology of pityriasis rosea (PR) remains controversial despite research for nearly one and a half century. We report a small-scale qualitative study on the historical aspects of PR. We found that the exact time point for which the rash was first accurately described is not easily determined. There exists considerable overlap between typical and atypical PR. Important clinical signs of PR such as the herald patch and peripheral collarette scaling were recognised decades after the disease had been accurately described. Early investigators utilised not only laboratory data but also epidemiological data in their analyses. Investigators often focused on physician-oriented rather than patient-oriented aspects. These findings have pertinent implications on the future directions of research for PR.

29244453278	Developing high quality family medicine practice to safeguard the health of our population and towards a healthy development of our health care system	The recent discussion paper on the future service delivery model for our health care system has highlighted the importance of family physicians. It is important to highlight the unique skills of family physicians and explore how best to build up the basic competencies from undergraduate to postgraduate level. A system of certification for family physicians is needed but we must take into account the historical development of Family Medicine in Hong Kong. The certification system must be reasonable in assuring basic standards. It should also be possible for all practicing primary care physicians to achieve without great difficulty. One should use the concept of professional development for doctors already in practice to achieve the basic competencies in Family Medicine. The family physicians must be well positioned in the health care delivery system and the future system should enable them to be more directly involved in chronic disease management, preventive health services and health promotion activities. All these initiatives need to be put in action as soon as possible.

30344485120	The impact of AIDS/sex education by schools or family doctors on Hong Kong Chinese adolescents	Despite the rapid increases of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in East Asia, the sex-related knowledge among Chinese adolescents is limited and the standard of sex education is both variable and inconsistent in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to review the overall effectiveness of the school-based or doctor-based sexual health education currently provided for Hong Kong adolescents. In 1999-2000, a large survey on youth risk behaviours was carried out among 15-18-year-old students from 21 secondary schools. Of the 8,039 questionnaires, 377 students (4.7%) admitted sexual experience. Multiple logistic regression showed that students who had received school AIDS education were found to be less likely to have sexual intercourse in the past 3 months (odds ratio, OR 0.5; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.3-0.9) or use drugs or alcohol before the previous intercourse (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.9). They were twice as likely to discuss emotional (95% CI 1.4-4.0) or puberty issues (95% CI 1.1-3.0). Although not statistically significant, sex education by family doctors showed a similar pattern. This result provides the strongest available evidence that school-based sex education programmes can modify sexual behaviour, which, in turn, reduces risk among Chinese students. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

33645056165	What are the barriers faced by general practitioners in treating depression and anxiety in Hong Kong?	Barriers faced by general practitioners in Hong Kong to manage patients with depression and anxiety disorders and their association with postgraduate qualification in family medicine were studied. Postal questionnaires were sent to 179 family medicine tutors affiliated with a university in Hong Kong with a response rate of 64.2%. 'Too time consuming' was the largest barrier for these physicians in treating patients with depression and anxiety. General practitioners without higher qualifications in family medicine were significantly more likely to report 'lack of confidence', 'lack of experience' and 'lack of supporting service' as being the barriers in treating patients with depression and anxiety. Our results showed that time constraint is an important barrier for general practitioners in managing patients with depression and anxiety in Hong Kong. Having a higher qualification in family medicine may reduce the barriers of having lack of confidence and experience in these physicians. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2006.

33645558820	Strengths, weaknesses, and development of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the health system of Hong Kong: Through the eyes of future Western doctors	Five focus group discussions were conducted with 28 (fourth-year) medical students from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) to explore attitudes to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and its impact on the future of medical training. Most students perceived that TCM was a good alternative for certain health problems but lack of scientific evidence and the absence of regulation were major barriers. Students were concerned about the limitations of TCM, but identified their need to understand TCM to effectively communicate with their patients. Paralleled with the experience in the United Kingdom and other countries, if traditional and conventional doctors are to work effectively side by side, current medical education and health service arrangements need to change. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

33744454957	Can health promoting schools contribute to the better health and wellbeing of young people? The Hong Kong experience	Background: The Health Promoting School (HPS) is a WHO sponsored framework, compiled to enable education and health sectors to be more effective in school based initiatives. Aims: This study attempted to test the hypothesis that students from schools that had comprehensively embraced the HPS concept as indicated by the Healthy School Award, were better, in terms of health risk behaviour, self reported health status, and academic results, than students from schools that did not reach the standard of the award. Methods and Results: The results presented came from nine schools (four primary and five secondary) applying for accreditation of the Healthy Schools Award after adopting the HPS framework for two years. Regular consultancy support and training were available to all schools. Students had completed before and after surveys to assess their health behaviours, self reported health status, and academic standing before the two year intervention, and at its end. Data from the before and after surveys of the students attending schools that reached certain level of HPS standard as indicated by the award, were compared with students whose schools did not receive the award, and the results showed differences. Some differences were found to be more significant among the primary school students than secondary schools students. This illustrated early intervention for lifestyle changes to be more effective. Students' satisfaction with life also improved if their schools adopted the concept of HPS comprehensively. Conclusions: The results suggest that comprehensive implementation of HPS would contribute to differences in certain behaviours and self reported health and academic status.

33745267049	The detection of human herpesvirus-8 DNA in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in adult patients with pityriasis rosea by polymerase chain reaction	Background: Herpesvirus-like particles have been reported to be detectable by electron microscopy in lesional biopsy of patients with pityriasis rosea (PR). We report a study investigating the association of PR with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. Methods: Our setting is a teaching clinic affiliated to a university. We recruited eight patients aged 28-47 years (mean: 34.5 years) diagnosed with PR during a one-year period. We collected acute blood specimens at presentation and convalescent blood specimens three to four weeks later. We also collected skin scrapings from the herald patch where present and from truncal secondary lesions. Results: We detected HHV-8 DNA by a nested PCR (polymerase chain reaction) targeting, respectively, a 233-bp and a 160-bp fragment of ORF 26. PCR for HHV-8 DNA was negative in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma of acute and convalescent specimens of all patients, and negative in all skin scrapings. We detected anti-HHV-8 IgG and IgM antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescence. Four patients had IgG antibodies against HHV-8, but with no significant rise of titre. None were positive for anti-HHV-8 IgM antibody. Conclusion: We conclude that PR is not associated with HHV-8 infection. © 2006 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.

33749494375	The association of early infections and atopic dermatitis. A retrospective case-control study in Chinese children in primary care in Hong Kong	The increasing prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) in developed countries has been postulated to be related to better hygiene leading to lack of exposure of infants to infections. The objective of this study is to investigate the association of early infections with AD in Chinese children in Hong Kong. Our setting were two primary care surgeries run by a family physician with training and qualifications in pediatrics and in dermatology. Most children were under our continuous care since early infancy. We searched our database and retrieved 132 medical records of infants and children (below eight) with AD fulfilling the United Kingdom Working Party diagnostic criteria of AD seen by us in 12 months. Children with a label of AD but not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria were excluded. Children who were not continuously cared by us since they were born were also excluded. For each child with AD, we retrieved the medical record of the next age-and-sex pair-matched child who did not have skin problems as controls. The number of children with infection before the age of six months, the number of infections, the number of hospitalizations, and the number of children having prescribed antibiotics before six months were insignificantly different in the study and control subjects. We conclude that there is no significant association between early infections and the risk of AD for Chinese children in Hong Kong.

33845248052	Spatial-temporal case clustering in children with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. Systematic analysis led to the identification of a mini-epidemic	This report was aimed at investigating spatial-temporal clustering in children with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) in retrospective study carried out on patients of a private clinic in India. We retrieved clinical records of all children (below 12) diagnosed with GCS in 30 months, and documented the dates of diagnosis and residential addresses. We investigated for spatial-temporal clustering by the Kulldorff scan test. 47 clinical records of children with GCS were retrieved. Four children with residential addresses outside the normal catchment area were excluded. Of the remaining 43 children, we detected a significant cluster of three children (p = 0.05) in Niphad. We corrected for bias as we did not observe all the cases in the same district, but still arrived at the same cluster result (p = 0.044). We found that a 15-month-old male already had the GCS eruption when he attended a wedding party. An 18-month-old male developed GCS eruption five days after attending the party and a two-year-old female developed the eruption nine days also after attending the party. We subsequently found that a fourth child developed symptoms compatible with GCS eight days after attending the party and was brought to another medical practitioner. We thus identified a mini-epidemic with spatial-temporal analysis. Significant spatial-temporal clustering exists for GCS. Such might be supportive of an infectious etiology, possibly a primary viral infection. The infectivity is likely to be low. Spatial-temporal clustering is a model for which epidemics of other exanthems may be identified.

33845256657	Normative data for triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses of Chinese infants	Skinfold thickness is a validated parameter of subcutaneous fat accumulation. Data on triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were collected from 10 043 (5318 males, 4725 females) singletons at 12 hospitals with gestation 31-42 wk. The LMS method using maximum penalized likelihood was used to perform model fitting of the anthropometric centiles for these parameters. Both triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were greater in girls than in boys. Racial differences were found when comparing with other populations. The triceps subscapular skinfold thicknesses of Chinese infants were significantly lower than those of US white infants but larger than those of African-American infants, Israeli infants, Spanish infants and Indian infants. Conclusion: This study provides the first set of references for the triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses of Chinese infants by gestation and gender. These data are helpful in determining the nutritional status of infants at birth and in assessing the postnatal growth of Chinese infants. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

33846804175	How to provide an effective primary health care in fighting against severe acute respiratory syndrome: The experiences of two cities	Objectives: This study was designed to compare the response and management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the family physicians of the Hong Kong and the Toronto health systems, and to provide evidence to improve health policy and practices in a newly emerging infectious disease. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to family medicine tutors affiliated with either the Chinese University of Hong Kong or the University of Toronto in 2003. The survey questions covered training for SARS, the use of screening tools, an anxiety scale, clinical practices, and demographic data. Results: 137 (74.8%) and 51 (34%) doctors from Hong Kong and Toronto replied to the questionnaire, respectively. Most (80-84.6%) had no training in infectious disease control and were not confident in dealing with SARS (68.1-73.5%). In Hong Kong, the screening tools provided by international agencies did not meet the local needs. In Toronto, lack of a centralized hospital admission policy and fully public laboratory probably resulted in appointment cancellation and dissatisfaction. There may be a need for deployment of personnel between institutions but loss of income was not a major concern. Conclusions: Sharing the "lessons learned" in different regions during a SARS outbreak will help prepare for the next epidemic. © 2007 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

34548023674	Achieving good standards in health promoting schools: Preliminary analysis one year after the implementation of the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme	Background: Improving health literacy can be a strategy for the achievement of public health goals, and the concept of the Health Promoting School can help to build on the health literacy of students. The Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion of The Chinese University of Hong Kong launched the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award (HKHSA) in 2001. This paper reports the results for the ten secondary schools that underwent assessment in 2002. Methods: Based on the overall score for each school, cluster analysis was performed. Each cluster of schools reflected different levels of HKHSA achievement. Results: This study has shown that those schools reaching high Health Promoting School standards have adopted the concept of a whole school approach in addressing health and social issues, rather than topic-based and school-located health promotion. The schools performing less satisfactorily mainly follow a prescriptive approach. Conclusions: These results are a good source of reference for other schools in their Health Promoting Schools programmes. © 2007 The Royal Institute of Public Health.

36448939803	The status of health-promoting schools in Hong Kong and implications for further development	An evaluation framework, called the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award, has been developed to enable comprehensive collection and analysis of data reflecting the status of health-promoting schools (HPS) in Hong Kong. The key findings revealed a high prevalence of emotional problems, unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity and risk-taking behaviours, leading to both intentional and unintentional injuries among students with higher prevalence among secondary school students. The results indicated a substantial lack of health policies in schools; it also indicated health services in schools not readily accessible to students and staff, and insufficient staff training in health promotion and education. However, most schools have made initiatives in environmental protection, established safety guidelines and strategies for managing students with emotional problems. The success of HPS depends largely on teachers' understanding of its building blocks. Evidence from the comprehensive mapping of the status of HPS in Hong Kong and from student surveys does show encouraging outcomes as well as identifying priority issues to be addressed in the next 5 years. © The Author (2007).

36749013492	General practitioners with a higher qualification in Family Medicine or General Practice: Are they better in diagnosing and treating patients with depression and anxiety?	Objective: To compare the general practitioners with higher qualifications in Family Medicine or General Practice with those without in how they diagnose and treat patients presenting with depression and anxiety in primary care. Design: 179 questionnaires were sent to all Family Medicine tutors affiliated with a university in Hong Kong. Subjects: 179 Family Medicine tutors affiliated with the Chinese University of Hong Kong; they were all involved in clinical teaching for undergraduate medical students. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the odds of using various strategies of diagnosis and types of treatment for depression and anxiety among general practitioners with and without higher qualification in Family Medicine or General Practice. Results: 115 tutors replied; it gave a response rate of 64.2%. Those with higher qualifications were significantly more likely to diagnose depression and anxiety using the DSM or ICD criteria (72.3% vs. 42.0%, p<0.01 by chi-square test; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 4.96; Cl: 1.81 to 13.55, p<0.05 after adjustments were made for confounders). In terms of treatment, the general practitioners with higher qualifications were more likely to use psychological therapy (95.4% vs. 82.0%, p<0.05 by chi-square test; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3.98; Cl: 0.79 to 19.9 and p=0.09) whereas those without higher qualifications were more likely to use "no treatment" (24.5% vs. 4.6%, p<0.01 by chi-square; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.02; Cl: 0.02 to 0.69, p<0.05). Conclusion: General practitioners with higher qualifications in Family Medicine or General Practice are different in how they diagnose and treat patients with depression and anxiety when compared with those without higher qualifications.

35848949797	Improving general practitioners' interviewing skills in managing patients with depression and anxiety: A randomized controlled clinical trial	Background: Studies regarding the effectiveness of CME programmes on physicians' behaviour and communication skills showed inconsistent results. Few randomized controlled trials have been conducted in Asia. Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of a 4 2-hour education programme to improve GP interviewing behaviours, 16 general practitioners were randomized to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Physicians assigned to the intervention group received 8 hours of training emphasizing interviewing behaviours in the diagnosis and treatment of depression and generalized anxiety disorders (GDS). Those assigned to the control group did not receive any training until the completion of study. Standardized patients were used to evaluate the performance of physicians. Two consultations before and after enrolling in the education programme were videotaped. Independent evaluations of consultations were made by a trained clinical psychologist and a social worker blinded to the study status of physicians. The rating schedule for the videotapes was based on the tasks listed on the Calgary Cambridge Observation Guide. Results: The change of score between the intervention and control physicians was significantly different in 'active listening and facilitating patients' response' (p = 0.011) with the intervention physicians having improvement of score. For 'non-verbals', 'understanding patient's perspective' and 'negotiating mutual plan of action', positive change of score in the intervention physicians were seen when compared to that of the control, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06, p = 0.05, p = 0.06, respectively). However, for 'opening', 'structuring the consultation', 'explanation and planning' and 'closure', there were no statistical significant differences between control and intervention group. Conclusions: Our results showed that only certain communication skills, such as active listening and facilitating patient's response, can be taught in the management of depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in Chinese primary care physicians.

0033044024	Development of family medicine at the crossroads! Are we lost?	The development of primary health care in Hong Kong is at the crossroads. It is quite obvious from research data that the hospitals are being over-utilized by patients with problems that could be handled by primary care physicians. One cannot solely blame our primary care physicians in failing to fulfil their roles as gatekeepers. The primary care physicians ought to work in a well-integrated primary health care team interfacing with the hospital sector in order to maximise their potentials. However, this system does not exist. It is even worse if there is division amongst primary care physicians because of entry restriction for practising primary care physicians achieving specialist status. The dual health care system has worked well in Hong Kong. Therefore, the practising primary care physicians in private sector providing over 70% of primary medical care must be actively involved in developing a good primary health care system. Not all doctors are well trained in management, organisation, health care planning and health need assessment. Those areas should form an integral part of higher training in family medicine.

0032751394	Should adolescents be vaccinated against hepatitis A: The Hong Kong experience	Hong Kong is a well developed city in the center of an endemic region for hepatitis A. The age at which hepatitis A occurs has shifted from childhood and adolescence to adults like many western countries. There is a high chance of outbreaks with the introduction of infection from neighbouring countries. Reducing the susceptibility of a population by vaccination can eliminate the diseases but updated sero-epidemiological data is needed to analyse the level of natural immunity, and identify those susceptible to infection for preventive measures. This study conducted amongst secondary school children seeks to identify those who are at risk and to obtain data on the present sero-prevalence of anti-HAV. Overall prevalence of anti-HAV in this age group was 7% increasing with age. Analysed by multiple regression model, those students living in mainland China over 3 years had odds ratio of 31.6 (95% c.i. 17.4-57.3) compared with those born in Hong Kong. Students with a father in a skilled occupation and an education level of secondary school or above, and both parents with secondary education or above, had an odds ratio of 0.22 (95% c.i. 0.07-0.7) and 0.35 (95% c.i. 0.17-0.72) associated with presence of anti-HAV, respectively. Improved socio-economic state exposes higher proportion of the population at risk. Immunisation is worthwhile to be considered for the adolescents in Hong Kong. Prevaccination screening is cost effective only for those adolescents who are most likely to have natural immunity. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0032818860	Changing hepatitis A epidemiology among Hong Kong Chinese adolescents: What are the implications?	Objective: To study the sero-epidemiology of hepatitis A virus (HAV) among adolescents in Hong Kong and analyse the changing patterns of the infection rates. Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Secondary school students. Subjects: One thousand, five hundred and eighty students were randomly selected from 12 schools in four regions of Hong Kong. Main outcome measures: Anti-HAV status. Results: The overall prevalence of anti-HAV is 7%. The sero-prevalence for age group 11-20 y has fallen compared with 44.8% in 1978, 17.1% in 1987 and 11.2% in 1989. Those adolescents born in mainland China, who are frequent travellers and had a longer period of residence in mainland China were shown to have a higher prevalence of anti-HAV. Conclusion: The changing epidemiology of HAV indicates that Hong Kong will have a large proportion of susceptible young adults. Because of its geographic situation and import of most its food supplies from less developed countries: for epidemiological purposes the inhabitants can be compared to western travellers staying in a five star hotel in a less developed country. The risk of an outbreak of HAV is to be expected. Vaccination has the potential to serve as an effective prevention for adolescents living in countries whose circumstances are similar to Hong Kong.

0033255014	Measuring the inappropriate utilization of accident and emergency services?	Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments are increasingly popular venues for primary care, causing a serious threat to healthcare quality. This paper reports the development of a comprehensive research method for identifying primary care patients attending A&E. Patients were randomly selected from the four A&E departments across different time periods and different regions in Hong Kong. The definition of GP cases was based on a retrospective record review conducted by a panel of emergency physicians using the standard laid down by the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians. The patients sampled were similar in sex and age distribution to A&E attendees for the whole territory. The level of GP cases was found to be 57 per cent, with a significantly higher proportion of patients in the younger age group. The high level of use reflects the lack of a well co-ordinated development of primary care services and interfacing with secondary care. © MCB University Press.

40149092366	Can the concept of Health Promoting Schools help to improve students' health knowledge and practices to combat the challenge of communicable diseases: Case study in Hong Kong?	Background. The growing epidemics of emerging infectious diseases has raised the importance of a setting approach and include the Health Promoting School (HPS) framework to promote better health and hygiene. Built on the concept of 'the' HPS framework, the Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award scheme includes "Personal Health Skills" as one of its key aspects to improve student hygiene knowledge and practices. This study examines the differences in student perceptions, knowledge and health behaviours between those schools that have adopted the HPS framework and those that have not adopted. Methods. A cross-sectional study using multi-stage random sampling was conducted among schools with awards (HSA) and those schools not involved in the award scheme nor adopting the concept of HPS (non-HPS). For HSA group, 5 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 510 students and 789 students sampled respectively. For the 'Non-HPS' group, 8 primary schools and 7 secondary schools entered the study with 676 students and 725 students sampled respectively. A self-administered questionnaire was used as the measuring instrument. Results. Students in the HSA category were found to be better with statistical significance in personal hygiene practice, knowledge on health and hygiene, as well as access to health information. HSA schools were reported to have better school health policy, higher degrees of community participation, and better hygienic environment. Conclusion. Students in schools that had adopted the HPS framework had a more positive health behaviour profile than those in non-HPS schools. Although a causal relationship is yet to be established, the HPS appears to be a viable approach for addressing communicable diseases. © 2008 Lee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33644979327	Does pulmonary rehabilitation give additional benefit over tiotropium therapy in primary care management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Randomized controlled clinical trial in Hong Kong Chinese	Objective: To evaluate whether multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation programme (PRP) provides additional benefit over tiotropium therapy in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary care. Design: A randomized controlled trial to analyse the difference in outcomes of COPD patients receiving tiotropium plus PRP vs. tiotropium treatment alone. Setting: Two primary care teaching clinics affiliated with a university which serves a population of 600 000. Participants: Fifty primary care COPD patients. Methods: Fifty subjects underwent spirometry and their status of COPD was confirmed by using the Vitalograph Gold Standard. They were then assessed by the 6-min walking distance (6MWD), Peak Visual Analogue Scale (Peak VAS) and Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). All subjects were given tiotropium to optimize their treatment. After a 6-week period, half were randomized to the intervention group (i.e. receiving PRP), whereas the rest were randomized to control group which received only medication. Spirometry, 6MWD, Peak VAS and CRQ were performed in both groups at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 3 months. Outcomes: Spirometry, 6MWD, Peak VAS and CRQ. Results: Significant improvement (P < 0.05) was seen in 6MWD, symptoms of dyspnoea measured by Peak VAS and CRQ. The improvement was sustained at 3-month follow-up. However, no additional significant improvement was seen in the intervention group when compared with control. Conclusion: Tiotropium therapy has improved health outcomes in COPD patients in primary care settings. A 6 weekly PRP did not give any additional benefits in patients already given tiotropium. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

34249034011	Improving health and building human capital through an effective primary care system	To improve population health, one must put emphasis on reducing health inequities and enhancing health protection and disease prevention, and early diagnosis and treatment of diseases by tackling the determinants of health at the downstream, midstream, and upstream levels. There is strong theoretical and empirical evidence for the association between strong national primary care systems and improved health indicators. The setting approach to promote health such as healthy schools, healthy cities also aims to address the determinants of health and build the capacity of individuals, families, and communities to create strong human and social capitals. The notion of human and social capitals begins to offer explanations why certain communities are unable to achieve better health than other communities with similar demography. In this paper, a review of studies conducted in different countries illustrate how a well-developed primary health care system would reduce all causes of mortalities, improve health status, reduce hospitalization, and be cost saving despite a disparity in socioeconomic conditions. The intervention strategy recommended in this paper is developing a model of comprehensive primary health care system by joining up different settings integrating the efforts of different parties within and outside the health sector. Different components of primary health care team would then work more closely with individuals and families and different healthy settings. This synergistic effect would help to strengthen human and social capital development. The model can then combine the efforts of upstream, midstream, and downstream approaches to improve population health and reduce health inequity. Otherwise, health would easily be jeopardized as a result of rapid urbanization. © 2007 The New York Academy of Medicine.

0034574241	Youth health promotion and health promoting schools: What should be the aims?	The school plays a very important role in health education and promotion at the crucial stage of childhood and adolescence. It develops personal character, skills, attitude and physique, in addition to imparting knowledge. To sustain the concerted effort to address inter-wined social, educational, psychological and health needs of children, training and ongoing reinforcement must be given to teachers. A task force made up of parents, teachers, administrators, students and health professionals must be formed to develop core values, visions, goals and activities; and to provide new direction for health education and promotion. The 'Health Promoting Schools' Programme of the CUHK was launched in 1999 with the aim to promote physical, emotional and intellectual development of students through healthy and hygienic practices. The programme has also conducted researches on health of students, prioritise and evaluate relevant programmes. Recent research studies revealed that students in higher grades had more physical and psychological health problems, probably due to heavy workload and less emphasis on health education in their formal curriculum. Another research study has shown the lack of concrete school policies in health education. It is therefore important to develop polices, practices and structures, as well as regular curicular reviews to promote health of the school children. The "Health Promoting Schools' Programme has already initiated several district based health promotion programmes to pave the way for the formation of local task force on youth health pro-motion.

0034309836	Factors associated with non-urgent utilization of Accident and Emergency services: A case-control study in Hong Kong	Accident and Emergency Departments (A and E) have been a popular source of primary care, and studies have shown that up to two thirds of patients attending A and E have problems that could be managed by general practitioners (GPs). Although many studies have found that patients of lower socio-economic class with less social support have a higher utilization rate of A and E, some recent studies have revealed contrary evidence. In this study 2410 patients were randomly selected from four A and E at different times. The gold standard in differentiating true emergency cases and GP cases was based on a retrospective record review conducted independently by a panel of emergency physicians. Two emergency physicians reviewed each case independently, and if their independent ratings were in agreement, this became the gold standard. Patients classified as GP cases were given a telephone interview, and a sample was selected and matched with cases from general out patient clinics (GOPC) in the public sector by morbidity. Reasons for not attending a private GP included closure of clinic, deterioration of symptoms, GPs' inability to diagnose properly, and patients' wish to continue medical treatment in the same hospital. Reasons why non-urgent patients did not choose to attend the nearby public GOPC included affordability, closure of the GOPC, patients' wish to continue treatment at the same hospital, GOPC too far away, no improvement shown after visits to GOPC doctors, and GOPC doctors' inability to make proper diagnoses. The reasons for high level of utilization of A and E services are complex and reflect problems of delivery of GP services. There is an urgent need for GPs to set up a network system to provide out of hours services, and also for a better interfacing between primary and secondary care, and between public and private sectors, so that patients can be referred back to GPs. Interim clinical services provided to those non-urgent cases by nursing practitioners or by GPs working in A and E could also facilitate discharge of patients to primary care facilities.

77954476507	The concepts of family doctor and factors affecting choice of family doctors among Hong Kong people	Objectives To identify concepts including misconceptions among the community members regarding family doctors, and determine factors affecting decisions on which doctor to consult in different clinical scenarios. Design Household telephone survey conducted between 4 and 13 September 2006. Setting Hong Kong community. Participants Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or more were targeted. Randomly selected participants were asked to complete a questionnaire, which was designed based on a literature search and subsequent focus group discussions. Results Among the 1811 households with eligible subjects to survey, 1204 completed the questionnaire (response rate, 67%). More than 85% considered a family doctor to be the frst doctor they wanted to see even if it was inconvenient. "Clearly knowing my physical conditions", "fast-acting and effective treatment", and "doctor with friendly and sincere attitude" were the three most important factors infuencing the choice of a family doctor. When affected by fu-like symptoms, 65% would go to a private clinic, 20% to a general out-patient clinic, 6% to a designated clinic with staff approved by their respective medical insurance/medical beneft scheme, and 5% to a private hospital outpatient clinic. Among the latter two groups, 65% consulted the same doctor every time when they felt sick. More than 50% of those willing to have regular follow-up by a family doctor for hypertension and diabetes paid more than HK$300 per month. Approximately 64% might consider having regular follow-up at a general out-patient clinic by a nurse specialist. Conclusion Hong Kong inhabitants already have their own ideas regarding how to care for their own health, and what kind of family doctors they prefer. This survey should help both doctors and health care policy makers to realign their current thinking, and thus provide a platform for the development of a primary care model unique to Hong Kong.

79952705851	Comparison of overweight, weight perception, and weight-related practices among high school students in three large chinese cities and two large U.S. cities	Purpose: The study compared differences in overweight prevalence, weight perception, and weight-related practices among high school students in five large Chinese and U.S. cities, and informed interventions for childhood obesity in China and the U.S. Methods: The data used was collected in 2003 from a representative sample of high school students in Hong Kong, Macau, Taipei, New York and Los Angeles. Results: The prevalence of overweight high school students in New York City and Los Angeles was about twice as high as in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taipei; however, the proportion of Chinese students perceiving themselves to be overweight was 15% higher than their U.S. counterparts. Independent of actual weight status, perceived overweight was significantly associated with weight control practices (p < .05). U.S. students showed higher levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity, but more hours of watching television than their Chinese counterparts. Conclusion: The continuing pandemic of overweight among youth fosters weight dissatisfaction, which may increase unhealthy weight control practices. Interventions should be designed to prevent overweight without precipitating unhealthy weight control practices by emphasizing an increase in physical activity and a reduction in time watching television. © 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

84887407568	Sexual activity and adolescent health risk behaviours amongst high school students in three ethnic Chinese urban populations	Aims and objectives: To compare sexually active Chinese high school students in three major Asian cities with their non-sexually active counterparts in order to determine prevalence and associations with selected health outcomes. Background: There have been limited studies to date on the association between sexual activity and substance use in Chinese high schools. While the role of the school nurse in the development of sexual health and harm reduction education in secondary schools has been well documented in international studies, this has received little attention in Asia. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: This study was administered in 2003/2004 to 13,895 Grades 6 to 12 high school students in Hong Kong (3498), Macau (6286) and Taipei (4111). Descriptive analysis was conducted followed by univariate analysis comparing sexual behaviour with (1) substance use including alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs; (2) feeling depressed for greater than or equal to two weeks in last 12 months; contemplating suicide during the last 12 months; and (3) perception of poor health/academic performance. Results: The students (8%) reported being sexually active had marked differences in selected health outcomes when compared with the nonsexually experienced students. More than 90% of the sexually active students had tried alcohol, with more than 50% being regular drinkers, more than 30% testifying to binge drinking and nearly 50% reported depression in the past 12 months. Substance use, poorer perception of health and academic performance were also significantly higher in the sexually experienced students relative to their nonexperienced counterparts. Conclusions: Sexually experienced Chinese high school students surveyed were at higher risk of substance abuse, poorer psychological health and academic performance. Relevance to clinical practice: Community and public health nursing needs to address Asian adolescent sexual health education needs, in particular provide culturally targeted interventions for associated substance abuse and psychological health within the context of high school sex education. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

To evaluate the sustaining effects of Tai Chi Qigong (TCQ) in improving the psychosocial health in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in the sixth month. Background. COPD affects both physical and emotional aspects of life. Measures to minimize patients' suffering need to be implemented. Methods. 206 COPD patients were randomly assigned into three groups: TCQ group, exercise group, and control group. The TCQ group completed a three-month TCQ program, the exercise group practiced breathing and walking exercise, and the control group received usual care. Results. Significant group-by-time interactions in quality of life (QOL) using St. George's respiratory questionnaire (P = 0.002) and the perceived social support from friends using multidimensional scale of perceived social support (P = 0.04) were noted. Improvements were observed in the TCQ group only. Conclusions. TCQ has sustaining effects in improving psychosocial health; it is also a useful and appropriate exercise for COPD patients. © 2013 Aileen W. K. Chan et al.

84897064449	Varicella vaccine uptake and associated factors in children in Hong Kong	SUMMARY Varicella is a common and highly contagious childhood disease which impacts the public worldwide. Hong Kong children can only be vaccinated against the disease in private practice. The varicella vaccination rate of local children in preschool is uncertain. Therefore a cross-sectional kindergarten-based parent-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in Hong Kong during 2012. Twelve kindergartens were randomly selected from a complete school list from the Education Bureau of Hong Kong. In total, 1285/1538 (83.6%) parents consented to join the study and completed the questionnaires. The overall varicella infection rate was 19.5% and the uptake of varicella vaccination rate was 57.6%. Barriers against varicella vaccination were mostly due to parental uncertainties about the effectiveness of vaccine, lack of recommendations from doctors or government, and adverse side-effects of the vaccine. The government and healthcare professional bodies are strongly recommended to further enhance health education among healthcare professionals, encouraging their active promotion of varicella vaccination for their patients. Furthermore, health education through various stakeholders is crucial to enhance parental awareness of varicella, as well as the effectiveness and safety of varicella vaccine. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

84908461226	Factors influencing adolescent girls' decision in initiation for human papillomavirus vaccination: A cross-sectional study in Hong Kong	Background: Cervical cancer is one of the common cancers among women worldwide. Despite HPV vaccination being one of the effective preventive measures, it is not included in government vaccination programme in Hong Kong. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of and attitude towards cervical cancer prevention among Chinese adolescent girls in Hong Kong, and to identify factors influencing the initiation of HPV vaccination. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Hong Kong during the period of October 2010 to November 2010. A self-administered questionnaire was used, with 1,416 girls from 8 secondary schools completing the questionnaire. Knowledge scores were composited and initiation of HPV vaccination was staged based on stage of change. Analyses were conducted to identify the association of initiation of HPV vaccination with participant's personal and family factors as well as their knowledge and attitude towards cervical cancer prevention. Results: The uptake rate of HPV vaccination was low (7%) with 58% respondents in pre-contemplation and contemplation stage. The survey identified a significant gap in knowledge on cervical cancer prevention. The main channels of information were from media and very few from schools or parents. However, 70% expressed their wishes to have more information on cancer prevention, and 78% stated that they were willing to change their lifestyles if they knew the ways of prevention. Multivariate analysis identified three independent significant factors for initiation of vaccination (action and intention): perceived cancer as terrifying disease, school should provide more information on cancer prevention, and comments from relatives and friends having received the vaccine. The cost of vaccination and socio-economic background were not found to be significant. Conclusions: Public education on cervical cancer needs to be well penetrated into the community for more sharing among friends and relatives. School as setting to provide source of information would facilitate uptake rate of HPV vaccine as students have expressed their wishes that school should provide more information on prevention of cancer. School and community education on cancer prevention would help adolescents to have better understanding of the seriousness of cancer.

4344672067	Correlates of sexual behaviors with health status and health perception in Chinese adolescents: A cross-sectional survey in schools	Sexual intercourse remains taboo among adolescents in a Chinese society such as Hong Kong. It is not openly discussed and little research has been done on its impact on health, although it carries serious risks of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/HIV. In 1999, a cross-sectional, self-report survey on youth risk behaviors was carried out on 8382 students 15-18 years of age from 48 schools in Hong Kong. Three hundred seventy-seven (4.69%) reported that they had had sexual intercourse. Among them, forced sex (16.94%) was common, most often happening to boys (52.38%). They were more likely to have consulted doctors in the last month (odds ration [OR] 1.41 in boys 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.94; OR 2.46 in girls 95% CI 1.81, 3.30) and 6 months (OR 1.33 in boys 95% CI 0.98, 1.78; OR 2.66 in girls 95% CI 1.80, 3.91). They also perceived poorer and deteriorating health. The sexually active female students were 6.70 times (95% CI 4.65, 9.66) more likely to attempt suicide than the other group and were more likely to take sick leaves (OR 3.56 in girls 95% CI 2.35, 5.41). Parental education and occupation, place of birth, and type of housing did not correlate in the initiation of sexual intercourse. The sexually experienced group reported worse physical and psychological health as well as health perception. Some of the characteristics and patterns identified in our study were quite different from the findings in the West but further studies are required to determine the reason for this.

4644362828	Effects of nurse follow-up on emergency room revisits: A randomized controlled trial	The emergency room (ER) is the gatekeeper of the hospital. It receives clients seeking help from the health care system, then refers them for necessary further care or, discharges them back into the community. A 1-year randomized control trial was conducted in an acute general hospital in Hong Kong to see if post-ER nurse follow-up helped to change health outcome and health care utilization. The intervention group received two follow-up calls from an experienced ER nurse, within 1-2 days and 3-5 days after ER discharge. The calls' content and the management options decisions were protocol driven. A total of 795 patients (intervention group=395, control group=400) completed the study. Bivariate analysis shows two significantly different variables between the intervention and control groups, improvement of the condition and ER revisit within 30 days. When other factors are controlled in a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, the effect of the intervention on re-visits to ER within 30 days is reversed. Gender, times of attending general practitioner after ER visits, and not considering other doctors are risks factors related to a higher chance of re-visiting ER within 30 days. Those who have an improved health condition and higher number of times attending general outpatient after ER visits are associated with a lower 30-day ER revisit rate. Nurse telephone follow-ups might have sensitized subjects to health care needs. Some subjects tended to use the ER as a primary care setting and some were doctor-shoppers. A more structured ER transitional model that incoporates nurse telephone follow-up and better interfacing between private and public health care sector, primary and tertiary care might help to decrease inappropriate ER use. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

51349112844	Use of anthropometric indices to reveal nutritional status: Normative data from 10,226 Chinese neonates	Background: Measures of body size at birth are widely used for the evaluation of prenatal growth but limitations exist in their interpretation. Objective: To establish the percentile curves for the six common anthropometric indices (PI: ponderal index, BMI: body mass index, THR: thigh circumference/head circumference ratio, MAC/OFC: mid-arm circumference/head circumference, W/OFC: weight/head circumference, and W/L: weight/length) and determine the best anthropometric index for evaluating intrauterine nutritional status in Chinese neonates. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional anthropometric study was carried out. The anthropometric measurements were performed according to the Hall's guidelines within 48 h of birth. Results: 10,226 infants (5,422 males, 4,804 females) with gestation 28-42 weeks from 12 hospitals were included for analysis. All of the six anthropometric indices correlated well with total skinfold thickness (T-SF, the sum of triceps skinfold thickness and subscapular skinfold thickness; p < 0.0001). Among the six anthropometric indices, W/L showed the highest correlation coefficient with T-SF (r = 0.622; p < 0.0001 in whole group, r = 0.653; p < 0.0001 in preterm infants, r = 0.612; p < 0.0001 in term infants). Conclusion: The present study establishes the gender-specific reference curves for the six important anthropometric indices in Chinese infants. W/L is a readily available index at birth that reflects the intrauterine nutritional state. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

55749113485	60 years of the National Health Service: Review of primary health care in the United Kingdom and its possible relevance to China	The primary-care-led National Health Service in the United Kingdom (UK) includes the key features of general practice - continuous, comprehensive personal care delivered over an extended period. General practitioners orchestrate the activities of the many individuals and agencies involved in the care of patients with chronic disease, and contribute to a more cost effective health care system. Teaching and research in general practice also need to be established to maintain knowledge and standards of practice. The development of strong primary health care with well trained general practitioners linking the achievement of clinical standards to remuneration, provision of a wider range of services for patients through strong team work, and the provision of good accessible services will help to minimise the problem of health inequality as the hospital services move towards a market system in mainland China. This review of UK primary health care and the academic development of general practice may act as useful reference for the development of community based health services in mainland China.

54349103338	GP management of osteoarthritic pain in Hong Kong	Background: Limited information is available about general practitioners' knowledge, attitude and practice in treating osteoarthritis. This study sought to better understand GPs' management of mild to moderate osteoarthritis in Hong Kong. Methods: A cross sectional survey of GPs using a structured questionnaire mailed in three stages. Results: A total of 225 questionnaires were returned. Paracetamol was considered to be an analgesic with lower toxicity and cost, and fewer drug interactions than others; it was also seen to have poor efficacy, short duration of action, and low patient compliance. Most GPs would consider nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first line treatment, followed by paracetamol. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, physiotherapy and exercise were favoured as second line treatments. Most GPs would choose paracetamol for patients with comorbid conditions. Discussion: General practitioners in Hong Kong have positive views on using simple analgesia and nonpharmacological treatments. Use of paracetamol was particularly preferred for older people and those with comorbidities.

In order to evaluate the applicability of the diagnostic criteria to children with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) in India we retrieved all clinical records of children with a definite diagnosis of this syndrome seen over 30 months in a private dermatology practice. The controls were children for whom Gianotti-Crosti had been suspected but the final diagnosis was not this syndrome, and children in whom it was not suspected but who were diagnosed with any of the differential diagnoses of the syndrome. We documented the presence or absence of the positive and negative clinical features for all patients and controls. The clinical records of 23 children with GCS and 74 controls were retrieved. The three positive clinical features - 1) papules or papulovesicles 1-10 mm in diameter on at least three of the following four sites: cheeks, buttocks, extensor surfaces of the forearms, extensor surfaces of legs; 2) being symmetrical; 3) lasting for at least 10 days - were sensitive and positively correlated with GCS. Both negative clinical features - extensive truncal lesions and scaly lesions - are negatively correlated with this syndrome. All 23 children with GCS and none of the controls fulfilled the set of diagnostic criteria. We concluded that the Gianotti-Crosti diagnostic criteria are applicable to affected children in India.

62449242763	The impact of a newly designed resilience-enhancing programme on parent-and teacher-perceived resilience environment among Health Promoting Schools in Hong Kong	Background: The Health Promoting School (HPS) approach provides a strong foundation to improve students' overall health, including psychological well- being, which has its roots in resilience. The present study evaluates the effectiveness of a resilience-enhancing programme, building on the concept of HPS among a Chinese population. Methodology: All mainstream schools in a socially disadvantaged region of Hong Kong were eligible, and stratified random sampling was used to recruit both HPS as intervention schools and non-HPS as control schools. The participants included teachers and parents of grade 3 and 5 primary and grade 1 secondary school students (aged 8, 10 and 12 respectively). Validated surveys were used to assess resilience scores in both groups of schools before and after a series of resilience-enhancing activities in HPS, and ANOVA was used to compare the score changes between the two groups. Results: Five primary and four secondary HPS and four primary and four secondary non-HPS were recruited, involving 4918 parents and 602 teachers. Among primary and secondary parents, the HPS group did not report a higher score than the non-HPS group. Among secondary teachers, the HPS group showed significantly higher scores than the non-HPS group (p = 0.023 to < 0.001) Conclusion: The present study is the first to demonstrate the positive synergistic effect of a newly designed resilience-enhancing intervention programme, building on the concept of HPS in schools among secondary teachers in Hong Kong. It was suggested that future initiatives may involve parent networking and school-family collaboration in fostering an even more resilient school environment.

67549102093	A comparative study on resilience level between WHO health promoting schools and other schools among a Chinese population	The WHO health promoting school (HPS) approach covers key areas including school-based programmes improving students' psychological health, but there have been few studies evaluating the resilience performance of these schools. This study compared the resilience scores between schools within the healthy school award (HSA) scheme (HPS group) and those not (non-HPS group). We conducted a cross-sectional survey of grade-one students (aged 12), all teachers and parents of mainstream secondary schools recruited by stratified random sampling in one large Territory of Hong Kong using validated resilience questionnaires during November-December 2005. Four non-HPS and four HPS secondary schools were recruited, respectively, involving 1408 students, 891 parents and 91 teachers, with similar baseline characteristics. The HPS students were found to have better scores than non-HPS students (average age 12.4 year-old in both groups) in all dimensions with significantly higher scores in 'Peer Support' (p = 0.013), 'Making a Difference' (p = 0.011), 'About Me' (p = 0.027) and 'Generally Happy' (p = 0.011). There was no difference in the scores between non-HPS and HPS parents. The HPS teachers reported significantly higher scores in 'Health Policies' (p = 0.023), 'Social Environment' (p = 0.049), 'School Community Relations' (p = 0.048), 'Personal Skills Building' (p = 0.008) and 'Partnership & Health Services' (p = 0.047). The secondary HPS students and teachers reported significantly higher resilience scores than those of non-HPS. This study shows that the HSA scheme under WHO has the potential to exert positive changes in students and teachers and the concept of HPS is effective in building resilience among major school stakeholders. © The Author (2009).

67549143966	Understanding suicidality and correlates among Chinese secondary school students in Hong Kong	Suicide has become a leading cause of mortality and morbidity for adolescents in Hong Kong. This study investigated the factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt among the secondary school students in Hong Kong by studying a representative sample of 3383 students with a self-administered questionnaire and analysed by multiple logistic regressions analysis. Youth risk behaviours, such as heavy smoking, episodic heavy alcohol drinking, early sexual experience, and feeling hopeless, were found to be associated with both suicidal thoughts and attempts, with 'misuse of drugs' as discriminating factor that solely related to attempt and 'involvement in physical fight' solely related to suicidal thoughts. Addition of suicidal ideation is a significant explanatory variable of suicidal attempt over and above health risk behaviours. Stratified analysis of upper and lower secondary students would give better understanding of significance of various risk factor for different age groups. The disturbing prevalence of suicidal behaviour and its coexistence with other high-risk behaviour in secondary school students have implications for teachers, youth workers and public health practitioners to develop and evaluate programmes for suicide prevention. © The Author (2009).

67650720332	To unfold a hidden epidemic: Prevalence of child maltreatment and its health implications among high school students in Guangzhou, China	Objective: This study investigated the prevalence of child maltreatment as perpetrated by parents, its associated health outcomes, and its resilient factors among high school students in China. Methods: A multi-level stratified random school-based survey was conducted in 2005. Twenty four high schools were randomly chosen from eight districts in Guangzhou, South China (three from each district). Two classes were randomly selected from each of Form 1 to Form 3 (aged 12-16) in each selected school. Data from 6,593 students were analyzed. A number of locally validated tools were used to measure various types of maltreatment as well as physical and psychological conditions of students. Results: The half-year prevalence of psychological aggression, minor physical maltreatment, severe physical maltreatment, and very severe physical maltreatment were 78.3%, 23.2%, 15.1%, and 2.8% respectively; while the half-year prevalence of sexual abuse was .6%. Maltreated students were more likely to report physical and psychological problems, and a positive relationship was also found between the severity of maltreatment and the likelihood of negative health outcomes. Male gender or having higher levels of social support and life satisfaction were identified as resilient factors to physical health of maltreated students. Conclusions: Child maltreatment as perpetrated by parents is common among high school students in Guangzhou, China. More public education programs are needed to raise public awareness of this problem. Intervention programs that target at improving social support and life satisfaction of students are potentially beneficial. © 2009.

70349150101	Health-promoting schools: Evidence for a holistic approach to promoting health and improving health literacy	Chronic diseases are now the major causes of death and disability worldwide, and non-communicable diseases (NCD) account for the majority of the global health burden. About half of premature deaths are related to health-risking behaviours that are often established during youth and extend to adulthood. While these diseases might not be curable, they are preventable. Prevention is possible when sustained actions are directed at individuals and families, as well as at the broader social, economic and cultural determinants of NCD. A 'life-course' approach to promoting healthy behaviour should begin early in life. The aim of this article is to discuss the impact of the 'health-promoting school' (HPS) on improvements in youth health.HPS can be described as a holistic, whole-school approach in which a broad health education curriculum is supported by the environment and ethos of the school. HPS moves beyond individual behavioural change to consider organizational and policy change such as improving the physical and social environment of the school, as well as its curricula and teaching and learning methods. A positive culture for health would facilitate higher levels of health literacy by helping individuals tackle the determinants of health better as they build the personal, cognitive and social skills for maintaining good health. There is reasonable evidence to demonstrate that the whole-school approach using the HPS framework is effective in improving health, ranging from physical activities and healthy eating to emotional health. Schools adopting the HPS framework have demonstrated changes in culture and organizational practice to become more conducive to health improvement. These schools were reported to have better school health policies, higher degrees of community participation, and a more hygienic environment than non-HPS schools, and students in these schools had a more positive health behaviour profile.Health promotion and disease prevention is essential to reduce the healthcare burden of children and adolescents. HPS would help to combat the global burden of childhood obesity by promoting healthy eating behaviours and encouraging higher levels of physical activity. There are gaps in service provision for children and adolescents from both the health and education perspective; the HPS framework has the potential to develop a mechanism of closer integration with the primary healthcare system, making youth health services more school based and student centred. A new model of interconnection between HPS and different components of primary healthcare can be evolved to make services for disease prevention and health promotion more student friendly. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

0035135004	Older school children are not necessarily healthier: Analysis of medical consultation pattern of school children from a territory-wide school health surveilance	It is important to maintain the health of our school children as health is a major factor affecting learning. In developed countries, we assume that school children, especially in higher grades, are healthy because they are relatively free of diseases. However, many of the health problems encountered by school children are not reported in routine health data as they seek help in primary care or by self-medication. In this paper, the medical consultation pattern of school children in Hong Kong was analyzed. It was revealed that school children had a high rate of consultation and self-medication, and the health status of older school children is not better. They were not offered adequate preventive advice. The piecemeal approach to focus on curative medicine will only lead to a high rate of episodic consultation and self-medication without empowering the young people with the skills of self-care and self-help, and positive health behavior. The concept of a health-promoting school with emphasis on more extra-curricular health promotion activities, improved communication between health and education sectors, active involvement by pupils and parents, and changing policies and practices would help to make the co-ordinated school health program a greater success.

72849115946	The gender implications of sexual health education needs among Chinese early school leavers	Objective: The following paper examines the sexual health needs of Chinese early school leavers from a gender perspective. The objectives were to shed light on adolescent experience and their understanding of intimate relationships, identify their knowledge of sex education and explore their sexual education needs. Design: A prospective survey design using mixed methods was employed. Subjects: A total of 28 adolescents were purposively recruited on the basis of age and sex from the YMCA in Hong Kong and 4 homogenous focus groups were subsequently conducted. In addition three individual face to face interviews were conducted. Main outcome measures/Results: A total of six gender-contrasting themes were found. These included: love and sexuality; the importance of appearance and body shape; feeling more positive after sex; the need for separate sex education classes, preferred sources of health information and sexual health needs. We found that both sexes felt that having the "right person" to deliver sex education was of crucial importance. For the girls the social pressures exerted by friends, fear of pregnancy after sex, and worry about sex without love were important topics. The girls expressed their need for further information on how to deal with social pressures, moral value clarification, the stigma of being seen to be sexually active and handling their disgust over pornography. In contrast the boys had little concern about pornography but did want to learn how to communicate and negotiate with the opposite sex. Conclusion: The differences found highlight the importance of approaching sexual health education from a cultural and gender perspective, in particular developing peer educator-led programmes to create normative support for early school leavers. Particular attention needs to be paid to the rapidly shifting and influential sources of adolescent sex education information such as the Internet and social groups.

The association between diet and acne vulgaris has long been suggested but remains unproven in western medicine. In contrast, the diet-acne relationship is considered important in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Aim. To investigate the association between diet and acne, using a TCM approach. Methods. Using a cross-sectional study of 322 entrants to a university in Hong Kong, China, we examined the participants' clinical severity of acne using the Global Acne Grading System and the participants' yin and yang scores using a quantitative method. We then divided them into two groups, a yin-predominant group (yin-PG) and a yang-predominant group (yang-PG) before the diet-acne relationship was investigated. Results. In total, 82 (25.2%) participants were in the clinical acne group and 240 (74.5%) were in the reference group. There were 155 (48.1%) participants in the yin-PG and 167 (51.9%) in the yang-PG group. No association of diet and acne was found when the participants were considered as a homogenous group. In yin-PG, intake of foods from street stalls (P = 0.04) was significantly associated with a lower incidence of acne. In yang-PG, the intake of desserts (P = 0.04) and fresh fruit juices (P = 0.02) was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acne, whereas the intake of dairy and soy products (P = 0.04) was significantly associated with a lower incidence of acne. Conclusions. The application of a TCM approach led to the detection of significant associations between diet and the incidence of acne. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.

77951250746	Healthy school as an ecological model for prevention of childhood obesity	A number of risk factors including obesity, insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables, and lack of physical activities are responsible for the majority of chronic disease burden. Healthy behaviours should begin early in life with sustained actions, but in many countries there is no system addressing positive health. The opportunities offered by different settings for gaining entry into individuals and groups are of paramount importance for health promotion. Evidence has shown the effectiveness of the Healthy School model to improve healthy eating and physical activities. In this article we report key findings of studies in Hong Kong showing changes in school policies and environment in relationship to student health apart from improvement of health behaviours by adopting the Healthy School framework. A case study has illustrated how the framework created a supportive environment, policies changes, and personal health skills development to improve healthy eating.

77951764160	Maternal influences on fruit and vegetable consumption of schoolchildren: Case study in Hong Kong	This study investigated whether the consumption of fruit and vegetable by Chinese primary students in Hong Kong is associated with their mother's (1) nutrition knowledge on fruit and vegetables; (2) attitude towards healthy eating; and (3) fruit and vegetable consumption. Fourth- and fifth-grade students from 10 primary schools located in different districts, along with their mothers, were invited to each fill-in a questionnaire related to their diet intake. Accomplished questionnaires were matched and analysed. There were 1779 mother-child pairs who were successfully matched. Chi-square analysis revealed that students' fruit consumption is associated with their mother's (1) knowledge on fruit and vegetables (P = 0.006); (2) attitude towards healthy eating (P = 0.010); and (3) fruit consumption (P < 0.001). Students' vegetable consumption exhibited the same association with their mother's (1) knowledge (P < 0.001), (2) attitude towards healthy eating (P = 0.005), and (3) vegetable consumption (P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that knowledge, attitude and dietary practice of mothers were independent factors associated with the consumption of fruit and vegetables by students and are not influenced by the level of education and household income. The results highlight the important role of parents in promoting fruit and vegetable consumption to primary students. It reaffirmed the importance of parent nutrition education in the formulation of a comprehensive health promotion strategy to school-aged children. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

77953612076	The association between shift duty and abnormal eating behavior among nurses working in a major hospital: A cross-sectional study	Background: Shift work induces stress, disturbs family life and interrupts regular meal schedules. Few studies have addressed the association between shift duties and abnormal eating behavior among hospital nurses. Objectives and design: We tested the hypothesis that shift duties were independent predictors of abnormal eating. Self-administered surveys consisting of socio-demographic data, working pattern, Perceived Organizational Support (POS) questionnaire and the patterns of eating style identified by the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaires (DEBQ) were used. Settings: One major acute hospital in one Territory of Hong Kong. Participants: All 662 nurses who worked on a full-time basis in this hospital were invited to join the study and among them, 378 completed surveys were collected with a response rate of 57.1%. The average age was 37.2 years, and 91.5% were female. 67.3 were registered nurses, 17.9% enrolled nurses; and 14.5% were ranked nursing officers or above. 39.1% worked in acute settings (medical wards, intensive care units and emergency departments), and 62.1% of respondents had at least 11 years of clinical experience and 76.2% of respondents had shift duties with 81.9% having at least four shift duties per month.

77958592691	Facing the threat of influenza pandemic - Roles of and implications to general practitioners	The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza, compounded with seasonal influenza, posed a global challenge. Despite the announcement of post-pandemic period on 10 August 2010 by theWHO, H1N1 (2009) virus would continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years and national health authorities should remain vigilant due to unpredictable behaviour of the virus. Majority of the world population is living in countries with inadequate resources to purchase vaccines and stockpile antiviral drugs. Basic hygienic measures such as wearing face masks and the hygienic practice of hand washing could reduce the spread of the respiratory viruses. However, the imminent issue is translating these measures into day-to-day practice. The experience from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong has shown that general practitioners (GPs) were willing to discharge their duties despite risks of getting infected themselves. SARS event has highlighted the inadequate interface between primary and secondary care and valuable health care resources were thus inappropriately matched to community needs. There are various ways for GPs to contribute in combating the influenza pandemic. They are prompt in detecting and monitoring epidemics and mini-epidemics of viral illnesses in the community. They can empower and raise the health literacy of the community such as advocating personal hygiene and other precautious measures. GPs could also assist in the development of protocols for primary care management of patients with flu-like illnesses and conduct clinical audits on the standards of preventive and treatment measures. GPs with adequate liaison with public health agencies would facilitate early diagnosis of patients with influenza. In this article, we summarise the primary care actions for phases 4-6 of the pandemic. We shall discuss the novel roles of GPs as alternative source of health care for patients who would otherwise be cared for in the secondary care level. The health care system would thus remain sustainable during the public health crisis. © 2010 Lee and Chuh; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78751531714	Involving the hard to reach: Developing and evaluating a sexual health programme for early school leavers in Hong Kong	Early school leavers cannot access school-based sex education programmes, increasing their vulnerability to sexual health issues. This study evaluated a culturally-sensitive and target-orientated sex education programme involving this group. Early school leavers were recruited from two branches of the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association in Hong Kong. These potential peer educators (PEs) attended five three hour workshops providing comprehensive sex and sexuality education. They then provided peers with sex education, whilst receiving continuing support and attending additional training and activities. The Safer Choice Student Health Questionnaire, Math tech Student Course Evaluation and Student Assessment of Course Impact questionnaires and Behavioral Intent Questionnaire were used to assess attitudes towards the programme and changes in knowledge, attitudes, practices regarding sex and sexual health. Of 60 PEs, 97% completed the workshop course. Seven months post intervention, changes in attitude towards contraception (p =0.01) and a lower likelihood of having sex (p< 0.001) were found amongst PEs. At 14 months, PEs were less likely to have sex (p< 0.001) and were more comfortable talking about sex with friends and family (p=0.01) but no difference was observed in pre-training and post training tests among 545 targeted peers. The intervention successfully engaged the heavily involved PEs, and had some positive effects on their willingness to discuss sexual health issues, their perceived likelihood of having and their attitude towards sexual intercourse. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

79551521069	Tai chi Qigong improves lung functions and activity tolerance in COPD clients: A single blind, randomized controlled trial	Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Tai chi Qigong (TCQ) program in enhancing respiratory functions and activity tolerance in clients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Design: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Five general outpatient clinics in Hong Kong. Intervention: In total, 206 COPD clients were randomly assigned into one of the three groups, namely, TCQ, exercise, and control group. Subjects in the TCQ group received a TCQ program consisting of two 60-min sessions each week for three months. Subjects in the exercise group were taught to practice breathing techniques combined with walking as an exercise. Subjects in the control group were instructed to maintain their usual activities. Data collection was performed at baseline and at the 6-week and 3-month marks. Outcomes: Lung functions, 6-min walk test, and COPD exacerbation rate. Results: Results of repeated measures of analysis of covariance demonstrated that there were significant interaction effects between time and group in forced vital capacity (p=002, η

79953154080	Attitudes and child abuse reporting behaviours among Hong Kong GPs	Background. GPs are often the first contact for injured children and hence play a crucial role in early identification and intervention of child abuse cases in the community. Objectives. To investigate Hong Kong GPs' attitudes and behaviours towards child abuse reporting and their opinions on the introduction of a mandatory reporting system. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2006 among GPs who were attending or had attended a local postgraduate family medicine course. Results. One hundred and seventy-one GPs participated in this study, among which only 8.9% received formal child abuse training. Only 35.8% of those GPs who had encountered suspected cases reported every case. GPs who considered reporting could produce more harm than good to the family or child, who concerned about maintaining anonymity and who were reluctant to get involved with legal system were less likely to make a report [odds ratio (OR) 0.21-0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06-0.11, 0.67-0.86]. 'Concern on own anonymity' was the only significant independent predictor for reporting (OR 3.47; 95% CI 1.11-10.87). Despite the low satisfaction with the present reporting system, 67.3% would not support the introduction of a mandatory reporting system. Logistic regression showed previous training could predict supportive attitude towards mandatory reporting (OR 4.84, 95% CI 1.01-23.27). Conclusions. This study shows low reporting behaviour among Hong Kong GPs. The major barriers to report are identified and can only be addressed by education and a carefully designed support system for GPs. Further research engaging a multidisciplinary approach is required to work towards an optimally beneficial system for the children. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

79953297071	Health compromising behaviors among Chinese adolescents: Role of physical abuse, school experience, and social support	This study examined the influence of immediate social environment on health compromising behaviors (HCB) among 6564 high school students in China. Results showed that physical abuse by parents was a major risk factor that accounted for high rates of HCB. Perceived positive school experience and social support were protective factors associated with low rates of HCB. These two protective factors also buffered the adverse influence of abuse on the practice of individual HCB. In particular, parental abuse was associated with sexual experimentation, non-fatal self-harm, and suicide behaviors only at low levels of protective factors. © The Author(s) 2010.

0035513011	A YRBS survey of youth risk behaviors at alternative high schools and mainstream high schools in Hong Kong	In Hong Kong, prevocational schools serve as an alternative to mainstream schools to provide education with more emphasis on practical and technical subjects. In this paper, health-risk behaviors of prevocational school (PVS) students were identified, and comparisons of health-risk behaviors with or without adjusting the demographic factors from prevocational schools and mainstream schools were made. The PVS students were at higher risk for most categories of health-risk behaviors such as unintentional and intentional injuries, smoking, alcohol drinking, glue sniffing, inadequate physical activity, insufficient consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and early sexual activity with multiple partners. Female students of PVS reported higher prevalence of emotional problems and substance abuse. Findings suggest that the school environment is an influential factor on the lifestyle behavior of students. Comprehensive health education and intervention programs are needed for youth in Hong Kong prevocational schools.

79960009466	Global epidemics of childhood obesity is hitting a 'less industrialized' corner in Asia: A case study in Macao	Childhood obesity prevalence amongst children is rising virtually in all countries with rapid acceleration in major cities in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 2,015 primary and secondary students in Macao to investigate the nutritional status and analyzed for the relationship of overweight and other cardio-metabolic risk factors. Subjects were randomly selected in proportion to the gender and age of the population. A total of 26.4% of boys and 13.9% of girls were overweight or obese with the highest prevalence around 40% among boys aged 9-12 and girls aged 10 and 11. Some 18.1% of boys and 20.4% of girls were found to have borderline LDL levels; a further 9.3% and 10.4% were found to have high-risk, respectively. For those students with overweight and obesity, a significant higher proportion of them had cardio-metabolic risk factors. Based on this evidence, there is a concern that obesity and its associated co-morbidity could reach epidemic proportions in the 'less industrialized' cities of China. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.

80053362045	General practice and social service partnership for better clinical outcomes, patient self efficacy and lifestyle behaviours of diabetic care: Randomised control trial of a chronic care model	Background The International Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and Needs (DAWN) programmes have shown the existence of a critical gap in self management support and access to the support system. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the diabetes mellitus (DM) self management programme, with partnership between general practice and social work, on clinical outcomes, patient self efficacy and lifestyle behaviours. Methods In this is single blind randomised controlled trial, subjects were recruited from patients attending general outpatient clinics in the Hospital Authority New Territory East Cluster of Hong Kong. 157 subjects meeting the inclusion criteria completed the study and were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group underwent the six sessions of weekly DM self management course with emphasis on self efficacy and participatory approach. The outcome measurements included HbA1c concentration, DM self efficacy scale, dietary behaviours, body mass index (BMI), and waist: hip ratio. Results Baseline assessment observed no significant differences between experimental and control groups for the variables related to outcomes. For the experimental group, the proportion of subjects with normal HbA1c increased from 4.5% (3/66) at baseline to 28.6% (19/66) at week 28 (p<0.001), but there was insignificant improvement in the control group (3.9% to 11.8%, p1/40.13). Repeated measure of analysis of variance showed pronounced improvement in DM self efficacy scale and BMI among the experimental group with significant interaction. Dietary behaviours also improved significantly in the experimental group. Conclusion The DM care model with partnership between general practice and social work demonstrated better diabetic control with improvement of self efficacy and minimisation of risk behaviours.

82055207166	How would family physicians facilitate the uptake of HPV vaccination: Focus group study on parents and single women in Hong Kong	Objective: To gain a better understanding of the general public in Hong Kong regarding the prevention of cervical cancer and acceptance of HPV vaccination. Design: Six focus groups were conducted to explore issues around the understanding of cervical cancer including risk factors, causative factors and method of prevention. Subjects: Parents with and without children and single women with no history of HPV vaccination. Outcome measures: All interviews were video taped, transcribed and categorized into different themes for analysis of regularity and patterns. Results: Most participants seemed to be aware of the risk and causative factors for cervical cancer. Most expressed the necessity for early prevention by vaccination but for different reasons and they were in general concerned with its duration of protection, safety and side effects. Lack of concrete advice and conflicting views from health professionals were identified as other major barriers for low uptake rate of vaccination. Conclusion: More public education is needed on the commonality of HPV infection in Hong Kong. It may be helpful for family physicians to explore means of engaging in community health promotion programmes for the prevention of cervical cancer such that vaccination as primary prevention would be considered a "social norm" among women.

To test the usefulness of using portable overnight pulse oximeter for obstructive sleep apnea screening in primary health care. 2. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of using portable overnight pulse oximeter for obstructive sleep apnea screening in primary health care. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Subjects: 60 consecutive adult patients suspected to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a General Outpatient Clinic affiliated to a regional hospital of Hong Kong. Main Outcome measures: Overnight pulse oximetry derived oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and polysomnography (PSG) derived apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Results: 51 out of 60 patients (85%) were confirmed to have OSA by PSG study. 14.9 events/hr and 24.6 events/hr were detected by overnight pulse oximetry derived ODI and PSG derived AHI respectively. The ODI and AHI has a correlation coefficient of 0.7 (P<0.0001). The mean and 1.96 SD of the difference between ODI and AHI is 9.7 events/hr and 30.4 events/hr respectively. Using case designation criteria of 25 events/hr for ODI, the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of OSA is 92% and 88% respectively. Conclusion: In a selected adult primary care population who are at risk for OSA, overnight pulse oximetry shows good correlation with polysomnography and has good screening performance as a screening tool for the diagnosis of OSA.

0036869414	Who would become a successful dean of faculty of medicine: Academic or clinician or administrator?	It has been a long tradition that the medical school dean is an expert in a specialist field with a well-established reputation in research and clinical services. Medical education is no longer simply disease orientated; it is required to put an emphasis on prevention, the need for better management of the health care system, and the need for a better understanding of the sociopolitical aspects of medical care. The deans of medical schools must appreciate the social role of medical education, and the social contract with the community. Although doctors might have difficulties with leadership because they are trained to work as individuals and to value highly their independence and autonomy, good communication skills are an asset for clinicians in management roles. It does not matter whether the background of the dean is academic, clinical or administrative; the most important thing is to possess the managerial skills to tackle the three-way tension between management, academic leadership and professional leadership. The job should be open to people with a good knowledge of and back-ground in health and fiscal expertise, and also a high degree of management, diplomatic and interpersonal skills. Those skills should also be emphasized in the medical curriculum.

0037372647	A comprehensive "healthy schools programme" to promote school health: The Hong Kong experience in joining the efforts of health and education sectors	Both health and education are linked to economic performance. The success of education depends on good health, and vice versa. Modern education should help young people to determine values, and accept responsibility for their health and social behaviour. The success of health promotion in schools requires the joint efforts of both the health and education sectors. A comprehensive programme is needed to include teachers' training, curriculum development, community participation, changing policies and practices, and research. All these components are needed to build up a successful model of a health promoting school. The "Healthy Schools Programme" in Hong Kong gives a good example of close partnership between the health and education sectors, and moves towards a multidisciplinary approach and active learning towards health promotion.

0038282940	Craniofacial anthropometry of hong kong chinese babies: The eye	Objectives: To provide a database of the canthal measurements of Chinese infants born in Hong Kong. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Setting and Sample Population: A total of 2371 healthy singleton, born consecutively at the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Union Hospital from June 1998 to June 2000, were included in the study. The range of gestation was 33 - 42 weeks. Measurements and Results: Canthal parameters were measured and included the outer canthal distance (OCD), intercanthal distance (ICD) and palpebral fissure length (PFL). The data generally show higher values for males in the parameters measured. The measurements were also compared with data published overseas. PFL and OCD were significantly larger in Hong Kong Chinese newborn babies, whereas ICD was smaller. Conclusion: This study establishes the first set of gestational age-specific standard of such craniofacial parameters for Chinese newborn babies, potentially enabling early syndromal diagnosis. There are significant inter-racial differences in these canthal parameters. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2003.

84871321909	The Impact of Leadership Programme on Self-Esteem and Self-Efficacy in School: A Randomized Controlled Trial	Background: Leadership training programs by experiential learning among adolescents are very popular worldwide and in particular developed countries, but there exists few studies which formally assessed their impact on the psychological well-being of program participants. This study evaluated the effectiveness of leadership training programs on self-esteem and self-efficacy among adolescents. Methodology/Principal Findings: a total of 180 students of the same grade of one secondary school were randomized into an intervention (n = 50) and a control group (n = 130). The students in the intervention group participated in a 6-month program of leadership training and service learning, while the control group did not participate in any training. Their self-esteem and self-efficacy were assessed by Rosenberg Self-Esteem questionnaire and Chinese Adaptation of the General Self-Efficacy Scale, respectively, before and after the program. Both scales have been recognized internationally as valid and reliable survey instruments to measure these psychological attributes. The scores were compared by Student's tests according to gender. A total of 180 students were enrolled during the study period October, 2009 to May, 2010. Their mean age was 15.18 years (0.62) and 56.7% were male. Students allocated to the intervention and control group had statistically similar demographic characteristics except gender (male 36.0% vs. 64.6%, p = 0.001). Overall, the self-esteem scores increased by 1.28 and decreased by 0.30 (p = 0.161) while the self-efficacy scores increased by 0.26 and decreased by 0.76 (p = 0.429) in the intervention and control group, respectively. Among female students, the intervention group showed significant improvements in both self-esteem (2.38 vs. -0.24, p<0.001) and self-efficacy (1.32 vs. -0.04, p = 0.043). Conclusions/Significance: Leadership training program were not found to be effective to enhance self-esteem and self-efficacy in adolescents, except girls who showed modest increase in these outcomes. Future research should assess the reasons why these programs are effective among female. © 2012 Wong et al.

84876498703	Home blood pressure monitoring: A trial on the effect of a structured education program	Background: This study aimed to assess whether a structured home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) education program can improve blood pressure control in patients. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial in which half of 240 patients in the intervention group received an education program focused on using HBPM machines at home, while the other half had the usual care. The primary endpoints were mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Results: Systolic blood pressure dropped 1.88 mmHg (p=0.372) and diastolic blood pressure significantly dropped 3.84 mmHg (p=0.004) in intervention group at 3 months. At 6 months, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were still on a decreasing trend, but there was no significant difference in blood pressure changes between the two groups. Discussion: The structured HBPM education program has the potential to improve patient blood pressure control at short term, but such effect appears tailing off at medium terms. Additional components may be needed to maximise and sustain the benefit of HBPM.

A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted by sending letters to doctors who had joined a vaccination program for school girls. From 720 surveys sent, 444 (61.7%) completed questionnaires were returned and analyzed. For knowledge, few responded to questions accurately on the prevalence of cervical HPV (27.9%) and genital wart infection (13.1%) among sexually active young women in Hong Kong, and only 44.4% correctly answered the percentage of cervical cancers caused by HPV. For attitude, most agreed that HPV vaccination should be fully paid by the Government (68.3%) as an important public health strategy. Vaccination against HPV was perceived as more important than those for genital herpes (52.2%) and Chlamydia (50.1%) for adolescent health, and the majority selected adolescents aged 12-14 years as the ideal group for vaccination. Gardasil® (30.9%) and Cervarix® (28.0%) were almost equally preferred. For practice, the factors influencing the choice of vaccine included strength of vaccine protection (61.1%), long-lasting immunity (56.8%) and good antibody response (55.6%). The most significant barriers to prescribe HPV vaccines consisted of parental refusal due to safety concerns (48.2%), and their practice of advising vaccination was mostly affected by local Governmental recommendations (78.7%). A substantial proportion of physicians had recommended HPV vaccines for their female clients/patients aged 18-26 years for protection of cervical cancer (83.8%) or both cervical cancer and genital warts (85.5%). The knowledge on HPV infection was low among physicians in Hong Kong. Prescription of HPV vaccine was hindered by the perceived parental concerns and was mostly relied on Governmental recommendations. Educational initiatives should be targeted towards both physicians and parents, and the Government should consider full subsidy to enhance vaccine uptake rate. © 2013 Wong et al.

Design: A randomised controlled trial. Setting: Obstetric unit of a tertiary teaching hospital. Population: Women who had unexpected antenatal, intrapartum or postpartum events leading to suboptimal outcomes during pregnancy and childbirth. Intervention: Educational counselling provided by a trained research nurse in the postnatal ward after delivery. Women in the control group received routine clinical care. Main outcome measures: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the General Health Questionnaire and the Clinical Global Impression (before and after counselling, at six weeks and six months post-delivery) and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life scale (WHO-QOL) (at six weeks and six months post-delivery). Results: There was no significant difference in psychological morbidity, quality of life or client satisfaction between the counselling group and the control group. Participants who underwent elective caesarean section and who had the educational counselling had significantly lower depression scores [mean 2.6 (SD 2.6)] compared with those receiving routine care [mean 3.9 (SD 3.2)]. On the other hand, educational counselling may have deleterious effect to women's quality of life in those who had instrumental delivery. Participants allocated to the counselling group had a lower mean score 68 (SD 13) in the physical domain of WHO-QOL than those in the intervention group 74 (SD 13). Conclusion: Educational counselling, given on top of routine clinical care, does not give additional beneficial effects on the psychological wellbeing and quality of life of women who encountered suboptimal outcomes during pregnancy.

0042008031	Severe acute respiratory syndrome: A challenge for public health practice in Hong Kong	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global challenge affecting more than 8000 patients in different continents. The dictum of public health practice especially for infectious disease is "prevention better than cure". It is especially true for SARS as the treatment strategies remain diverse and experimental. Maintaining a healthy and hygienic environment can be one of the effective public health measures to combat infectious disease. The major challenge is that some of the most important public health measures are to be taken outside the health sector. The community also needs to be strengthened and equipped with the health skills to promote better health and hygiene. There is also the need to create a supportive environment conducive to health for long term sustainability. The WHO approach of promoting health through setting approach would be one possible solution to face the challenge. This paper will describe some of the public health initiatives in Hong Kong through "setting approach" and "community development model" in helping the society fight against SARS. With the emergence of SARS, this might be the time to globalise public health medicine as an important component of medical practice.

0142248837	Facial anthropometry of Hong Kong Chinese babies	Objectives: To provide a database of the craniofacial measurements of Chinese infants born in Hong Kong. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Setting and Sample Population: A total of 2371 healthy singleton, born consecutively at the Prince of Wales Hospital and the Union Hospital from June 1998 to June 2000, were included in the study. The range of gestation was 33-42 weeks. Measurements and Results: Measurements included facial width (FW), facial height (FH), nasal length (NL), nasal width (NW), and length of the philtrum (PhilL). The facial, nasal, nasofacial and nasozygomatic indices were derived. The data show generally higher values for males in the parameters measured. The various indices remained remarkably constant and did not vary significantly between the two genders or with gestation. When compared with previously published data for white people term babies, Chinese babies have similar NW but shorter philtrum length. Conclusion: The human face appears to grow in a remarkably constant fashion as defined by the various indices of facial proportions. This study establishes the first set of gestational age-specific standard of such craniofacial parameters for Chinese new-borns, potentially enabling early syndromal diagnosis. There are significant inter-racial differences in these craniofacial parameters. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2003.

0142258096	How to minimize inappropriate utilization of Accident and Emergency Departments: Improve the validity of classifying the general practice cases amongst the A&E attendees	Studies have found that one-third to two-thirds of all patients attending Accident and Emergency (A&E) Departments could be managed appropriately by general practitioners (GPs). There is also evidence that referral to GPs can be acceptable to patients. The question of primary concern is screening non-urgent cases with high degrees of sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), and positive predictive value (PPV). This paper reports the findings of the validity (S, SP and PPV) of nurses and patients in triaging A&E visitors. A cross sectional study was conducted over a 1 year period and subjects were randomly selected from four A&E Departments located across the four principle geographic regions of Hong Kong by stratified, two-stage sampling. S, SP and PPVs were computed for both non-weighted and weighted conditions. The gold standard for defining the true urgency status of each selected patient was based on a review of the patient's record 3-21 days (or longer if necessary) following the A&E visit. The record review in each A&E was blinded and done independently by a panel of two (and if disagreement existed, three) senior emergency physicians who did not practice in the same hospital. The greatest weights would be for incorrect decisions with greatest impact on patients' well being. The most accurate unweighted nurses' triage classification had an average sensitivity of 87.8%, specificity of 83.9%, and a PPV of 70.1%. When weighted, the average sensitivity reduced to 75%, specificity to 65.7%, and PPV to 54%. The most accurate unweighted patients' self-triage classification yielded a sensitivity of 62.5%, specificity of 69.2%, and a PPV of 58.1%, and correspondingly reduced to 43.3, 49.2 and 38.6% if weights were applied. Validity of the derived patients' self-classifications was too inaccurate for practical use. Hong Kong's current use of a five-point urgency scale by nurses would be further refined for identifying non-urgent visitors. If a mechanism was put in place for additional screening on visitors with a borderline semi-urgent or non-urgent status, the nurses could safely reassign non-urgent patients to GP care. If implemented, a significant impact on hospital costs could be realized. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

0242636147	The Need for Integrated Primary Health Care to Enhance the Effectiveness of Health Services	With the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses and health compromising behaviours, health care expenditure is escalating with the expansion of hospital services. Integrated primary health care would enhance the cost effectiveness of health care delivery. Recent studies on primary care health services research in Hong Kong indicated that there is a high level of inappropriate utilisation of hospital emergency services, a high prevalence of youth health risk behaviours particularly mental health which would lead to a heavy burden on health services in the future. The community based rehabilitation provided a better quality of life for chronic illness patients, better drug compliance for chronic illness patients in family practice, and a disproportionate amount of budget is spent on law reinforcement and treatment for drug abuse rather than on prevention and education. The findings strongly indicate the need to have a strong primary health care team with well trained family physicians and trained health professionals as primary care practitioners to provide services on health promotion; curative; rehabilitation and supporting services; supporting self help activities of individuals, families and groups. This would minimize compartmentalisation in health care delivery, and is also a cost effective way of providing high quality holistic and comprehensive care that meets the needs of the majority of the population.

Design: A randomized controlled trial. Subjects were in three randomly assigned groups: Tai chi Qigong group, exercise group, and control group. Setting: The 206 subjects were recruited from five general outpatient clinics. Interventions: Tai chi Qigong group completed a 3-month Tai chi Qigong program. Exercise group practiced breathing and walking as an exercise. Control group received usual care. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes included six-minute walking distance and lung functions. Secondary outcomes were dyspnea and fatigue levels, number of exacerbations and hospital admissions. Results: Tai chi Qigong group showed a steady improvement in exercise capacity (P<.001) from baseline to the sixth month. The mean walking distance increased from 298 to 349 meters (+17%). No significant changes were noted in the other two groups. Tai chi Qigong group also showed improvement in lung functions (P<.001). Mean forced expiratory volume in 1. s increased from 89 to .99. l (+11%). No significant change was noted in the exercise group. Deterioration was found in the control group, with mean volume decreased from .89 to .84. l (-5.67%). Significant decreased in the number of exacerbations was observed in the Tai chi Qigong group. No changes in dyspnea and fatigue levels were noted among the three groups. Conclusions: Tai chi Qigong has sustaining effects in improving the physiological health and is a useful and appropriate exercise for COPD patients. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84892245096	Hong Kong health-promoting schools	During the early colonial period, from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, education policy was for the Colonial Government to provide assistance to enlighten the upper classes of Chinese rather than to force new ideas on the mass population. It was believed that civilized ideas among the leaders of thought were the best and perhaps the only means at that time for permeating the general population (Sweeting, 1990). During the postwar period, Hong Kong experienced a massive increase in population and emerged as one of the world's largest financial centers. As the economy grew, the schools focused more on the forms of high-status knowledge (particularly English, Chinese, mathematics, science, and information technology) that were most directly linked to certification and admission to higher education institutions; that is, priority shifted to academic subjects. © 2009 Springer New York.

Results: 53.4% of the respondents would actively recommend pneumococcal vaccination to elderly patients but only 18.8% would recommend for middle-aged patients. Consultation not related to pneumococcal vaccine was the main reason for not recommending pneumococcal vaccine (43.6%). Rarity of pneumonia in their daily practice was another reason with 68.4% of respondents attending five or less patients with pneumonia each year.

84895216508	Health literacy and health outcomes	In this chapter, we examine the impact of low health literacy on health outcomes. We review the body of research that has been published internationally, noting that the majority of these studies are describing simply the various associations between adult literacy skills and health outcomes rather than causation. Specifically, lack of reading fluency and low levels of health vocabulary (i.e., low literacy as applied to health) have been linked to problems with the use of preventive services, delayed diagnoses, understanding of one's medical condition, adherence to medical instructions, self-management skills, physical and mental health, and increased mortality risk. We consider what this evidence may say about possible causal pathways between health literacy and health outcomes and, very briefly, discuss the potential for interventions. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

84900454381	Framework for evaluating efficacy in Health Promoting Schools	Purpose: Successful implementation of Health Promoting Schools (HPS) depends on putting the model in the schools' context for both health improvement and school improvement. HPS can only be effective if the change can be sustained over an extended duration. The purpose of this paper is to discuss development of the HPS process by University Research Centre in Hong Kong, resulting in an award scheme, where no additional resources were initially provided by the authorities. Design/methodology/approach: The team adopted a step-by-step approach starting with capacity building of key stakeholders and comprehensive needs assessment, leading to development of a system of evaluation and monitoring and establishment of a "Healthy School Award" system. The system was built on data derived from several different sources and made use of qualitative and quantitative information and were intended to be used to guide practice and actions for improvement. Findings: Schools measured their own performance against established school and student health profiles. The validated system of evaluation and monitoring led to a Healthy School Award scheme for participating schools with "accredited" and "award" designations. The award system evaluated six key HPS areas and identified exemplars of HPS as resource schools to form a strong network. Research limitations/implications: HPS can be regarded as new paradigm of schooling rather than an add-on programme. Practical implications: HPS can be regarded as new paradigm of schooling rather than an add-on programme. The advantage of an academic institution masterminding the development process lies with their strength in education and research, building on the professionalism of school educators in health promotion and developing evidence-based HPS practice. Originality/value: This paper discusses an approach for addressing the key factors associated with initiation of innovation and management of change in an education setting. The involvement of both higher education and an award scheme can act strong catalysts to drive change, resulting in a strong evidence base with and results demonstrating effectiveness, which then led to government support. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

84901844367	Effectiveness of incorporating Tai Chi in a pulmonary rehabilitation program for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in primary care-A pilot randomized controlled trial	Introduction: Studies have shown that pulmonary rehabilitation and Tai Chi are beneficial to patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which is a major public health problem. The aim of this single-blind randomized controlled study was to compare the self-efficacy and quality of life parameters of COPD patients who underwent pulmonary rehabilitation with or without Tai Chi elements incorporated in the exercise component. Methodology: 192 COPD patients, recruited from four primary care clinics, satisfied the eligibility criteria and consented to randomization to either pulmonary rehabilitation program group (PRP) or the group with Tai Chi elements added to PRP (TC). Both groups received rehabilitation consisting of 2 sessions per week for 6 weeks with totally identical content except that Tai Chi exercises were added to TC group. Data collection was performed at baseline, 2 and 6-month post-intervention. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis was performed for 192 subjects. Both groups did not differ in demographics and baseline variables except for COPD staging, mean FEV

10744225886	How would schools step up public health measures to control spread of SARS?	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive, and sometime fatal disease with more than 1800 patients in over a dozen countries in Asia, Europe, and North America (including the United States and Canada) within two months. On 12 March 2003, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a global alert about SARS so it became a global challenge. Strengthening the public health measures at schools would protect children as well as providing the students an opportunity to learn about infectious disease control through life event approach. The public health measures at schools include two important components: basic understanding of the disease so schools would put on high alert on caution cases, and the measures to improve environmental hygiene at schools and preventive measures to stop infectious disease transmission. This will help to empower the whole community the readiness to deal with other outbreaks in the future.

0742285287	Youth risk behaviour in a Chinese population: A territory-wide youth risk behavioural surveillance in Hong Kong	This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence rates of different categories of youth risk behaviour by age, sex and parental education. The study population consisted of 26,111 Hong Kong students, aged 10-19 years, recruited from 48 primary (primary grades 4-6) and secondary schools (secondary grades 1-7). Less than one-third of subjects participated in vigorous exercise regularly, about one-third consumed an unhealthy diet frequently, 18% had tried smoking, and 14.5% had seriously considered attempting suicide. Although only 3.4% of students reported experience of sexual intercourse, less than half used a contraceptive device. Older students had higher prevalence rates of health-compromising behaviours than younger students. Female students were more likely to report suicide-related behaviour, attempting weight loss, and non-participation in vigorous physical activities. Students with parents of a lower educational background were more likely to report rarely or never wearing seat belts and bicycle helmets, suicide-related behaviour, smoking, sexual intercourse before 13 years of age, and attempting weight loss. The availability of data on youth health risk behaviours would enable health educators, public health practitioners and clinicians to plan appropriate screening and counselling for risk behaviours in early adolescents. © 2003 The Royal Institute of Public Health.

1342280389	How did general practitioners protect themselves, their family, and staff during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong?	Context: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease and how trie frontline community doctors respond to it is not known. Objectives: To explore the impact of SARS on general practitioners (GPs) in Hong Kong. Design: A cross sectional survey. Setting: Community based primary care clinics. Participants: 183 family medicine tutors affiliated with a local university. Postal survey sent to all tutors with a 74.8% response rate. Main outcome measures: Change of clinical behaviour and practices during the epidemic; anxiety level of primary care doctors. Results: All agreed SARS had changed their clinical practices. Significant anxiety was found in family doctors. Three quarters of respondents recalled requesting more investigations while a quarter believed they had over-prescribed antibiotics. GPs who were exposed to SARS or who had worked in high infection districts were less likely to quarantine themselves (10.8% versus 33.3%; p<0.01; 6.5% versus 27.5%; p<0.01 respectively). Exposure to SARS, the infection rates in their working district, and anxiety levels had significant impact on the level of protection or prescribing behaviour. Conclusion: The clinical practice of GPs changed significantly as a result of SARS. Yet, those did not quarantine themselves suggesting other factors may have some part to play. As failure to apply isolation precautions to suspected cases of SARS was one major reason for its spread, a contingency plan from the government to support family doctors is of utmost importance. Interface between private and public sectors are needed in Hong Kong to prepare for any future epidemics.
