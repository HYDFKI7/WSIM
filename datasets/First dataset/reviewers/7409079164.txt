18844369052	Reverse signaling by TM-TNF-α augments the activation of U937 induced by sTNF-α	Objective: To investigate the effect of reverse signaling by transmembrane TNF-α (TM-TNF-α) on the activation of U937 induced by sTNF. Methods: U937 cells were pre- incubated with sTNFR I for 30 min and then stimulated with sTNF-α for different time. The biological activities of U937 cells, including the production of active oxygen, the transcription of-intracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 mRNA, and expression of cytoplasmic IκB-α were measured. Results: sTNFR I alone did not influence the biological activities of U937 cells. Reverse signaling through TM-TNF induced by sTNFR I promoted sTNF-stimulated U937 produce more active oxygen, which is dose-dependant of sTNFR I and sTNF-α. Reverse signaling also enhanced mRNA transcription of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18 and accelerated the degradation of IκB-α. Conclusion: Reverse signaling by TM-TNF-α induced by sTNFR I augment with activation of U937 stimulated with sTNF, suggesting that reverse signaling may be involved in the regulation of early inflammation.

22844438874	The anti-tumor effects of TM-TNF-α mimic peptide displayed on phages in vivo	Objective: To study the anti-tumor effects of TM-TNF-α mimic peptide displayed on phages in vivo. Methods: Peptides-presenting phages were prepared and their and-tumor effects were compared. Then, the peptide with the best effect and the suitable concentration was subcutaneously injected on day 3 after H22 tumor cell challenge. The tumor growth was observed. Results: TM-TNF-α mimic peptide displayed on phages can dramatically inhibit the growth of tumor (P < 0.01) in a dose dependent manner. HE staining showed infiltration of lymphocytes in the tumor tissues, while there was infiltration of neutrophils and plasma cells but not lymphocytes in the tumor tissues treated by s-TNF. Conclusion: Direct injection of TM-TNF-α mimic peptide displayed on phages could effectively suppress the tumor growth. The mechanism involved in the tumoricidal activity induced by peptides was different from that of sTNF-α.

0006934480	Characteristics of the colchicine effect on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene expression	Microtubule polymerization disrupting agent colchicine(Col) was shown to inhibit LPS-in- duced TNF-α gene expression in murine macrophage cell line PU5-1. 8. In our previous study we discribed that Col was capable of reducing TNF-α mRNA transcription. The present study further demonstrated that this inhibitory effect of Col was characterized by its delayed appearance, i. e. requiring 3 h to exert its full-blown depressive effect. In addition, this suppressive effect of Col was completely blocked by CHX known to inhibit the newly protein synthesis. Col alone showed no obvious effect on the LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA stability. However, in the presence of CHX, Col did prolong the half life time of LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA. These observations suggest that the effect of Col on TNF-α gene expression may be the result of the dual action on the TNF-α gene at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

27644447283	Leptin regulated insulin secretion via stimulating IRS2-associated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in the isolated rat pancreatic islets	To investigate the molecular mechanism of leptin regulating insulin secretion through determining the regulation of insulin secretion and the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2-associated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity by leptin in the isolated rat pancreatic islets, pancreatic islets were isolated from male SD rats by the collagenase method. The purified islets were incubated with leptin 2 nmol/L for I h in the presence of 5. 6 mmol/L or 11.1 mmol/L glucose. Insulin release was measured using radioimmunoassay. IRS-2-associated activity of PI3K was determined by immunoprecipitate assay and Western blot. The results showed that in the presence of 5. 6 mmol/L glucose, leptin had no significant effect on both insulin secretion and IRS-2-associated PI3K activity, but in the presence of 11.1 mmol/L glucose, insulin release was significantly inhibited after the islets were exposed to leptin for 1 h (P<0. 01). PI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked the inhibitory regulation of leptin on insulin release (P<0. 05). Western Blot assay revealed that 2 nmol/L leptin could significantly increase the IRS-2-associated activity of PI3K by 51. 5 % (P<0. 05) in the presence of 11.1 mmol/L glucose. It was concluded that Leptin could significantly inhibit insulin secretion in the presence of 11. 1 mmol/L glucose by stimulating IRS-2-associated activity of PI3K, which might be the molecular mechanism of leptin regulating insulin secretion.

3142626820	Construction of antisense RNA expression plasmid for u-PAR and its transfection to highly invasive PC-3M cell subclones	To evaluate the specific inhibition of antisense u-PAR on the u-PAR expressions in highly invasive cell subclones and to determine its blocking function in the invasion by those cells, a cD-NA fragment of u-PAR obtained by RT-PCR was inserted into a plasmid vector named pcDNAS in antisense orientation. Then the antisense u-PAR recombinant was transfected into highly invasive cell subclones. The u-PAR expression in neo-resistant cells was examined by RT-PCR and immuno-histochemical assay. Compared to the control cells, the content of mRNA and protein of u-PAR in transfected cells decreased sharply, and the rate of inhibition was 53 % and 73 %, respectively, indicating that an antisense u-PAR might have played a specific inhibitory role in its expression in the cells, which may provide a good cell model for making further investigation of the inhibitory effects of the antisense u-PAR on invasion in highly invasive cell subclones of human prostate carcinoma.

3142638652	The inhibitory effects of an antisense u-PAR vector on invasion of highly invasive human prostate carcinoma PC-3M cell subclones	To observe the inhibitory effects of an antisense u-PAR vector on invasion of highly invasive PC-3M cell subclones, the effects of the antisense u-PAR on activity of MMP-9 in those highly invasive cell subclones were detected by a quantitative RT-PCR and zymography. The monolayer invasion assay and colony formation assay in soft agar were used. And tumorigenesis rate and invasions by the cell subclones with or without the antisense u-PAR were observed in nude mice. It was found that in vitro growth of highly invasive PC-3M cell subclones, transfected with the antisense u-PAR was declined, and the ability of anchorage-independent growth of those cell subclones was found decreased sharply, with the inhibiting rate becoming 79 % and 60 %, respectively. Although the antisense u-PAR didn't change MMP-9 gene transcription, they could inhibit the activation of MMP-9 of highly invasive PC-3M cell subclones. Moreover, the tumorigenesis rate of the cell subclones with the antisense u-PAR decreased and the growth of a neoplasm also slowed down. The t tests showed the difference between experimental and control groups was statistically significant (P<0.01). The antisense u-PAR vector could not only inhibit the invasion ability of highly invasive PC-3M cell subclones in vitro but also restrain the growth of those cell subclones in vivo.

3142638681	Antitumor effects of the fibroblasts transfected TNF-α gene and its mutants	To compare the anti-tumor effects of transmembrane TNF-α (TM-TNF) and secreted TNF-α (S-TNF) in vivo, mouse fibroblasts NIH3T3 were transfected separately with three types of retrovirus containing wild type TNF-α (Wt-TNF), TM-TNF mutant (TM-TNFm), S-TNF mutant (S-TNFm). Southern blot, RT-PCR, FACS and bioassay were used to investigate TNF-α gene integration, expression and its biological activity. It was found that both fixed cells and supernatant of NIH3T3/Wt-TNF, the fixed cells of NIH3T3/TM-TNFm and the supernatant of NIH3T3/S-TNFm could express high level of TNF-α or its mutants and effectively kill H22 in vitro. The transfected NIH3T3 were separately injected into the mice at the sites of H22 tumor cell inoculation according to a ratio of 5:1 or 1:1 (effector/target cells, E/T) after the third day of H22 challenge, respectively. At the E/T =5:1, the NIH3T3/TM-TNFm induced the highest tumor regression, while NIH3T3/S-TNFm exerted the strongest tumor depressing effect at the E/T=1:1 in vivo. No obvious side effects were noted throughout the course of treatment. The results suggest that both TM-TNF and S-TNF could cause tumor regression. The anti-tumor effect of TM-TNF would be more powerful and safe than that of S-TNF at the proper E/T ratio.

33745057774	Inhibition of nuclear factor-κB activation is essential for membrane-associated TNF-α-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells	The killing of tumour cells that are resistant to soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α) by the membrane-bound form of TNF-α (mTNF-α) suggests that different intracellular signalling pathways are involved. We found that mTNF-α induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells and failed to cause degradation of inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκB-α) and translocation and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), whereas sTNF-α failed to induce apoptosis, but lowered cytoplasmic inhibitor of kappa B alpha, induced translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and experimentally increased activity of the regulated luciferase. Furthermore, mTNF-α upregulated the expression of TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) 1 and failed to induce TRAF1 and TRAF2 membrane translocation, but led to cytoplasmic colocalization. In contrast, sTNF-α stimulated the expression of TRAF1 and TRAF2, recruiting both molecules onto the cell membrane poststimulation. These results suggest that the increased susceptibility of HL-60 cells to mTNF-α may be due to the failure of TRAF2 membrane translocation caused by the upregulation of TRAF1 expression and formation of a TRAF1/TRAF2 complex in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation and inducing apoptosis. © 2006 Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.

33748346257	Mechanism of action differences in the antitumor effects of transmembrane and secretory tumor necrosis factor-alpha in vitro and in vivo	The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) exists naturally in two forms, a 26 kDa transmembrane form (TM-TNFα), and a 17 kDa secretory form (S-TNFα). The biological roles for each of these forms of TNFα in tumor killing have not been completely elucidated. Therefore, in this study, three different recombinant retroviral vectors, wild-type TNFα, solely secretable TNFα mutant, and uncleavable transmembrane TNFα mutant, were constructed by molecular techniques and stably transfected into a murine hepatic carcinoma cell line (H22). TNFα, either secreted in cell culture supernatants by secretable TNFα mutant- or wild-type TNFα-producing tumor cells, or as a treansmembrane form expressed on the cell surface of uncleavable TNFα mutant- or wild-type TNFα-synthesizing tumor cells, was demonstrated to be cytotoxic against the TNF sensitive L929 cell line. The H22 cells transfected with the three different forms of TNFα were shown to kill parental H22 cells in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay [effect/target (E/T) ratio-dependent manner], and their maximal killing rates were ~38-43% at E/T ratio of 5:1.

The H1 promotor and double Bbs: restrict endoenzyme site were cloned from plasmid psiRNA-hH1neo and reconstructed them into plasmid pEGFP-C1 in the Mlu: restrict endoenzymic site, forming plasmid pEGFP-H1/siRNA, which contained Bbs site and reporter EGFP gene. Then an oligonuclear hairpin sequence targeting TLR4 gene was designed by internet tool and inserted into the plasmid pEGFP-H1/siRNA forming plasmid pEGFP-H1/TLR4-siRNA. After transfection of pEGFP-H1/TLR4-siRNA into RAW264.7 cells, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) release by the cells after stimulation by LPS was detected. The results showed that the constructed pEGFP-H1/TLR4-siRNA carrying hairpin RNA for TLR4 gene and reporter EGFP gene were proven to be right by restriction endonuclease analysis. The expression of EGFP gene was (50.37±8.23) % and after transfection of the plasmid pEGFP-H1/ TLR4-siRNA the level of TNF-α released by RAW264.7 cell was down regulated. It was concluded that shRNA targeting TLR4 gene could inhibit the TNF-α release by RAW264.7 cells evoked by LPS. © 2006 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

39049179933	Dual regulation of soluble tumor necrosis factor-α induced activation of human monocytic cells via modulating transmembrane TNF-α-mediated 'reverse signaling'	Transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-α (mTNF-α) is known to be the precursor of soluble TNF-α; (sTNF-α). mTNF-α can act as a ligand on the TNF receptor- (TNFR)-bearing cell through 'forward signaling' or as a receptor on the TNF producing cell through 'reverse signaling'. In the current study, we investigated the role of mTNF-α-mediated reverse signaling in regulating sTNF-α-induced activation of human monocytic U937 cells. We demonstrated that pretreatment with sTNFRI, for inducing reverse signaling through mTNF-α, sensitized U937 cells to sTNF-α stimulation, as evidenced by an increase in reactive oxygen production and mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8) in these cells. Further experiments revealed that IκB-α degradation was increased in the monocytic cells primed with sTNFRI, implying that reverse signaling of mTNF-α sensitizes U937 cells via an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. On the other hand, binding of sTNFRI to mTNF-α after sTNF-α-induced activation of U937 cells reduced mRNA stability (half-life) of IL-1β and IL-8. The involvement of reverse signaling in the process was verified by using a mutated form of mTNF-α lacking the majority of the cytoplasmic domain. Our results clearly showed that enhanced mRNA degradation of the cytokines occurred only in U937 cells transfected with a wild-type mTNF-α, but not in those cells transfected with the mutant mTNF-α. Taken together, these data suggest that reverse signaling through mTNF-α may exert a double role in modulating sTNF-α bioactivity. It is positive when reverse signaling occurs prior to sTNF-α stimulation, while it is negative when reverse signaling occurs after the sTNF-α signal. Thus, our findings strengthen a role of mTNF-α-mediated reverse signaling in the regulation of immune-inflammatory response and control of inflammatory reaction.

TNF antagonists are effectively used to treat these patients, although the efficiency of different antagonists varies. In the present study we combined TNF-α binding cyclic peptide (TBCP) and TNFR1 binding cyclic peptide (TRBCP) to treat TNBS-induced colitis in rats for one week. The symptoms of colitis including bloody diarrhea, rectal prolapse, and a profound and sustained weight loss were significantly ameliorated and the colon inflammatory damage, both macroscopic and histological scores, MPO activity, and NO production were markedly decreased in rats by neutralization of TNF-α and blocking TNFR1, as compared with those in rats treated with irrelevant peptide or normal saline (P < 0.05). The transcripts of IL-1β and IL-8, and the protein expression of TNF-α in rats treated with both TBCP and TRBCP were also down-regulated (P < 0.05), while these proinflammatory cytokines remained unchanged in rats treated with irrelevant peptide or normal saline. These findings suggest that the combination of TNF-α- and TNFR1-binding peptide effectively improves the symptoms of TNBS-induced colitis and alleviates colonic pathological damages in rats. This combination may be a potent candidate for clinical treatment of the inflammatory bowel disease. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84861822752	Enzootic angiostrongyliasis in Guangzhou, China, 2008-2010	This study was conducted to gain an understanding of the Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection status of rodent definitive host, snail intermediate host, and local residents in Guangzhou, China. A total of 430 rats were captured and 23 rats, from two species, were infected, with an average infection rate of 5.35%. A total of 795 Achatina fulica snails and 734 Pomacea canaliculata snails were collected. The average infection rates of these two species were 13.96% (111 of 795) and 1.50% (11 of 734), respectively. As for the seroprevalence of different occupations, the rate among the "general group" was significantly lower than the "occupational group." From this survey, Guangzhou is implicated to be the natural focus of Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Rattus norvegicus and Achatina fulica play important roles in spreading this nematode in Guangzhou. Residents who live in Guangzhou, especially those working in certain industries such as agriculture, food-making, and aquaculture, face a higher risk of infection.

Methods The model of rat adjuvant arthritis was induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant. The TNF receptor blocking peptide was injected locally in the ankle. The ankle swelling, the pathologic changes in the ankle joint and the expression of IL-1β mRNA and TNF-α mRNA by peritoneal macrophages (RT-PCR) were observed. Results The model of rat adjuvant arthritis induced by injection of complete Freund s adjuvant was similar to human rheumatoid arthritis. The treatment with TNF receptor blocking peptide for 10 days resulted in complete inhibition of joint swelling, a decrease in infiltration of inflammatory cell into joint tissue, an obvious alleviation of inflammatory pathological damages and an apparent decline of TNF-α mRNA and IL-1β mRNA of peritoneal macrophages of rats. Conclusion The TNF receptor blocking peptide can protect the joint from inflammatory damage induced by adjuvant arthritis by suppression of TNF-α and IL-1 production, thereby alleviating the pathological injury of joint and controlling effectively the clinic course of arthritis.

44249103964	Blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type 1-mediated TNF-α signaling protected Wistar rats from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance	TNF-α plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance in which the effect of TNF-α signaling via TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1) largely remains controversial. To delineate the role of TNFR1-mediated TNF-α signaling in the pathogenesis of this disorder, a TNFR1 blocking peptide-Fc fusion protein (TNFR1BP-Fc) was used for the present study. Wistar rats were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet for 16 wk until obesity and insulin resistance developed. In comparison with increased body weight and fat weight, enlarged adipocytes, and hypertriglyceridemia in the obese state, the subsequent 4-wk treatment with TNFR1BP-Fc resulted in significant weight loss characterized by decreased fat pad weight and adipocyte size and reduced plasma triglycerides. Furthermore, obesity-induced insulin resistance, including hyperinsulinemia, elevated C-peptide, higher degree of hyperglycemia after glucose challenge, and less hypoglycemic response to insulin, was markedly improved, and the compensatory hyperplasia and hypertrophy of pancreatic islets were reduced. Interestingly, treatment with TNFR1BP-Fc markedly suppressed systemic TNF-α release and its local expression in pancreatic islets and muscle and adipose tissues. In addition, blockage of TNFR1-mediated TNF-α signaling in obese rats significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in the muscle and fat tissues. Our results strongly suggest a pivotal role for TNFR1-mediated TNF-α signaling in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance. Thus, TNFR1BP-Fc may be a good candidate for the treatment of this disease. Copyright © 2008 by The Endocrine Society.

50849093241	Transmembrane TNF-α mediates "forward" and "reverse" signaling, inducing cell death or survival via the NF-κB pathway in Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells	Interestingly, some lymphoma cells, expressing high levels of transmembrane (tm)TNF-α, are resistant to secretory (s)TNF-α-induced necrosis but sensitive to tmTNF-α-mediated apoptosis. As tmTNF-α mediates "forward" as well as "reverse" signaling, we hypothesize that a balanced signaling between forward and reverse directions may play a critical role in determining the fate of cells bearing tmTNF-α. Using Raji cells as a model, we first added exogenous tmTNF-α on fixed, transfected NIH3T3 cells onto Raji cells to examine tmTNF-α forward signaling and its effects, showing that constitutive NF-κB activity and cellular inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein 1 transcription were down-regulated, paralleled with Raji cell death. As Raji cells express tmTNF-α, an inhibition of their tmTNF-α expression by antisense oligonucleotide caused down-regulation of NF-κB activity. Conversely, increasing tmTNF-α expression by suppressing expression of TNF-α-converting enzyme that cleaves tmTNF-α led to an enhanced activation of NF-κB, indicating that tmTNF-α, but not sTNF-α, contributes to constitutive NF-κB activation. We next transfected Raji cells with a mutant tmTNF-α lacking the intracellular domain to competitively suppress reverse signaling via tmTNF-α; as expected, constitutive NF-κB activity was decreased. In contrast, treating Raji cells with sTNFR2 to stimulate reverse signaling via tmTNF-α ehanced NF-κB activation. We conclude that tmTNF-α, when highly expressed on tumor cells and acting as a receptor, promotes NF-κB activation through reverse signaling, which is helpful to maintain tumor cell survival. On the contrary, tmTNF-α, when acting as a ligand, inhibits NF-κB activity through forward signaling, which is inclined to induce tumor cell death. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.

58349103882	Influence of reverse signaling via membrane TNF-α on cytotoxicity of NK92 cells	Membrane tumor necrosis factor-α (mTNF-α) serves as a receptor transducing signals into mTNF-α-bearing cells. Among human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, natural killer (NK) cells have been reported to be the only cell type constitutively expressing mTNF-α, which is involved in the cytotoxicity of resting NK cells. Using an IL-2-dependent human NK cell line, NK92, which constitutively expresses mTNF-α, we examined the effect of reverse signaling via mTNF-α on cellular activities. When the cells were prestimulated with soluble TNFR1 (sTNFR1) which activated mTNF-α-mediated reverse signaling, the cytotoxicity of NK92 cells was significantly increased. Further investigation demonstrated that prestimulation with sTNFR1 augmented exocytosis and mRNA transcription of two cytotoxic molecules, perforin and granzyme B, which could serve as underlying molecular mechanisms by which mTNF-α-mediated reverse signaling promoted cytotoxicity of NK cells toward K562 cells. On the other hand, pretreatment of NK92 with sTNFR1 boosted the expression of FasL and TNF-α, including both the secretory and membrane forms. These molecules also contribute to the NK-mediated cytotoxicity, although K562 cells are Fas-negative and sTNF-α-resistant. Interestingly, the mTNF-α reverse signaling was found to act synergistically with IL-2 on NK-mediated cytotoxicity. This synergy markedly promoted the production of secretory as well as membrane cytotoxic molecules which may be responsible for the enhanced NK92-mediated cytotoxicity. Our observations suggest that, via reverse signaling, constitutively expressed mTNF-α may sensitize NK cells to activating stimuli, such as IL-2, resulting in increased NK-mediated cytotoxicity through promoting the production of multiple cytotoxic effector molecules. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

62149099862	Hyaluronic acid fragments evoke Kupffer cells via TLR4 signaling pathway	Kupffer cells, expressing toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), play a central role in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fragments, degradative products of high-molecular-weight HA (HMW-HA), acquire the ability to activate immune cells under inflammatory conditions. Here we investigated whether HA fragments could activate Kupffer cells and analyzed the underlying mechanism. Kupffer cells were isolated from wild-type mice (WT, C3H/HeN) and TLR4 mutant mice (C3H/HeJ) and HA fragments were produced by the methods of enzyme digestion and chromatography. Then Kupffer cells were stimulated by HA fragments or other control stimuli. The activation of Kupffer cells was estimated as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activation of p38 MAPK pathway of Kupffer cells was checked and blocking experiments were done as well. The results indicated that HA fragments acquired the ability to activate Kupffer cells in vitro, which was TLR4 dependent and not due to contamination of lipopolysaccharide. Experiments of p38 MAPK kinase inhibition by SB-203580 verified p38 MAPK was required in HA fragments induced Kupffer cells activation. This suggests that HA fragments, degradative products of one of the major glycosaminoglycans of the extracellular matrix, play critical roles in Kupffer cell activation mediated by TLR4 signaling pathway, which is, at least partially, dependent on p38 MAPK activation. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

67649418389	Expression of TNF-α leader sequence renders MCF-7 tumor cells resistant to the cytotoxicity of soluble TNF-α	Transmembrane TNF-α (tmTNF-α) contains a leader sequence (LS) that can be phosphorylated and cleaved at its cytoplasmic portion, inducing IL-12 production. We observed that the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 expressing transmembrane TNF-α (tmTNF-α) at high level was resistant to soluble TNF-α (sTNF-α)-induced cytotoxicity, accompanied by constitutive NF-κB activation. In contrast, MCF-7 cells expressing tmTNF-α at very low level were sensitive to sTNF-α-induced cell death and had no detectable NF-κB activation. Consistently, siRNA-mediated tmTNF-α knockdown blocked NF-κB activation and rendered MDA-MB-231 sensitive. To test our hypothesis that TNF-LS may play an important role in determining the sensitivity of tumor cells to sTNF-α, we stably transfected MCF-7 cells with TNF-LS. We found that transfection of TNF-LS or wild-type TNF-α containing LS constitutively activated NF-κB and conferred the cytotoxic resistance of MCF-7 cells, while transfection of a mutant tmTNF-α lacking the cytoplasmic segment of LS neither activated NF-κB nor affected the sensitivity. However, NF-κB inhibitor PDTC suppressed NF-κB activation and reconstituted sensitivity of TNF-LS/MCF-7 cells. To check whether TNF-LS is required to be cleaved or internalized for NF-κB activation to occur, we used signal peptide peptidase inhibitor (Z-LL)

The killing rates against HL-60 of △-73 to -47, △-21 to -1, △-32 to -1, △-73 to -34 TM-TNF and W-TNF are 40.9% , 55.58% , 54.47%, 18.25%, 41.5% respectively. Conclusion: It is the deletion of linking domains of TM-TNF -47 to -34 that decreases cytotoxic activity of TM-TNF against HL-60.

77951908020	Influence of polyethyleneglycol modification on phagocytic uptake of polymeric nanoparticles mediated by immunoglobulin g and complement activation	The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) modification on in vitro phagocytic uptake of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement activation. A series of PEG-modified poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PEG-PLGA-NPs) were incubated in pure serum protein or whole serum, and their capacity for adsorbing albumin and the serum total proteins was measured by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. The adsorption of serum total IgG and complement activation was investigated by enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (EL1SA). To measure in vitro uptake, various fluorescently labeled (Nile red) PEG-PLGA-NPs were opsonized by different pre-treated sera and subsequently incubated with phagocytes. The uptake of NPs by macrophages was then measured by fluorescence spectrometry. Longer chain length and appropriate content PEG reduced the adsorption of serum proteins and complement activation by NPs via both the classical and the alternative pathways. The phagocytosis of PEG-PLGA-NPs by murine peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) involved both serum-independent and serum-dependent phagocytosis. PEG modification was shown only to reduce serum-dependent phagocytosis, mainly by inhibiting IgG adsorption and complement activation on NP surfaces, and the effect of complement activation was greater than that of IgG. The results of this study provided new information that may assist in the design of more efficient nano drug carriers for medical applications. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers.

77955238875	Translation of TRAF1 is regulated by IRES-dependent mechanism and stimulated by vincristine	TRAF1 is a member of the TRAF family, which plays important roles in signal transduction that mediate cell life and death in the immune response, inflammatory and malignant diseases. It is known that TRAF1 transcription is inducible by various cytokines, but little is known about the regulation of its mRNA translation. In the present study, we demonstrated that the human TRAF1 mRNA has an unusually long 5′-UTR that contains internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) regulating its translation. By performing gene transfection and reporter assays, we revealed that this IRES sequence is located within the 572 nt upstream from the AUG start codon. An element between nt -392 and -322 was essential for the IRES activity. Interestingly, we found that the TRAF1 expression is induced in cancer cells by chemotherapeutic drug vincristine that regulates cytoplasmic localization of polypyrimidine tract binding protein, which may contribute to the IRES-dependent translation of TRAF1 during vincristine treatment. These results indicate that TRAF1 translation is initiated via the IRES and regulated by vincristine, and suggest that regulation of the IRES-dependent translation of TRAF1 may be involved in effecting the cancer cell response to vincristine treatment. © The Author(s) 2010.

77955776278	Cloning and functional expression of Rh50-like glycoprotein, a putative ammonia channel, in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes	Evidence has shown that female mosquitoes can deaminate more than 80% of the ingested bloodmeal protein amino acids, and thus lead to a massive amount of ammonia production. Ammonia transport is a critical step for detoxifying ammonia in organisms. Here we characterized a putative ammonia channel gene, Rhesus (Rh) 50 glycoprotein, from Aedes albopictus (AalRh50) and determined the difference of its expression profile in different tissues at both message and protein levels as well as its response to a blood meal. We showed that AalRh50 shares a low identity with E. coli ammonia transporter (EcoAmtB), but higher identities with human RhBG and Drosophila Rh50 genes. The analysis of ammonia-conductance sites indicates that AalRh50 has residue substitutions of S237L (equivalent to S219 in AmtB) in the external vestibule, F127I (equivalent to F107 in AmtB) in the pore entrance, and S281N (equivalent to S263 in AmtB) in the internal vestibule, which could alter or reduce ammonia-conductance activity. The results from quantitative real-time-PCR and immunohistochemistry revealed that AalRh50 is expressed at significantly higher levels in the head, Malpighian tubules, and thorax of the non-blood-fed females, suggesting that AalRh50 might play roles in maintaining normal neurotransmitter metabolism, acid-base balance, and flight energy production in different tissues of mosquitoes at the non-blood-fed condition. A blood meal significantly increases AalRh50 expression in midgut, fat body, and Malpighian tubules from 3 or 6 to 24. h post feeding, indicating that AalRh50 plays an important role in detoxification of excess systemic ammonia of female adults during the gonotrophic cycle. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77957095697	Quantitative analysis of replication and tropisms of dengue virus type 2 in Aedes albopictus	Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) RNA replication profiles and tropisms were studied by using quantitative RT-PCR (q-RTPCR) in intrathoracically infected Aedes albopictus. The virus RNA replication profiles were diverse in mosquito organs. In fat body, brain, salivary gland, and malpighian tubes, it peaked at 8, 23, 23, and 27 days post-infection, respectively, and then, all declined. In midgut, it increased all the time and had no trend of decline. In ovary, it had no apparent increase. Subsequent Western blotting of DENV-2 E protein had similar results. Using ribosomal protein 7 (rpS7) as an internal control, we found that, in salivary gland, brain, fat body, and midgut, the average DENV-2 RNA levels (DENV-2 RNA/rpS7 mRNA) were 1,028, 464, 5.6, and 6.2, respectively; in malpighian tubes, it was 1, and in ovary, it was far less than 1. These results suggest that infection profiles and tropism of DENV-2 RNA in Ae. albopictus organs are significantly different.

79957837396	The involvement of β-actin in the signaling of transmembrane TNF-α-mediated cytotoxicity	Actin cytoskeleton has been shown to play a regulating role in several signaling pathways, and disruption of actin filament has been reported to increase sTNF-α-in-duced cell death. However, whether actin is involved in tm TNF-α-mediated cytotoxicity remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that pretreatment of HL-60 with CytD or LatA to depolymerize actin significantly suppressed tm TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, tmTNF-α increased the actin immunoprecipitated by anti-TNFR2 but not anti-TNFR1 antibody, and disruption of the actin filament totally blocked this effect. In addition, TNFR1 knockdown by siRNA did not affect tm TNF-α-mediated cytotoxicity and the inhibitory effect of CytD, suggesting that the involvement of actin in the tm TNF-α-induced apoptosis is linked to the TNFR2 pathway. Our results revealed further that tm TNF-α signaled the inhibition of I«B degradation and NF-kB activity by recruiting RIP1 to and uncoupling TRAF2 from the TNFR2 complex. Nevertheless, CytD totally reversed the tm TNF-α signaling and activated NF-kB by recruiting TRAF2 to and dissociating RIP1 from the TNFR2 complex. Furthermore, tm TNF-α led to activation of caspase-8 by dissociation of cFLIP from TNFR2 and inhibition of the cFLIP expression. Activated caspase-8 cleft RIP1 to suppress NF-kB activity and also mediated tm TNF-α-induced apoptosis. However, CytD blocked the tm TNF-α-induced uncoupling of cFLIP from TNFR2 and prevented caspase-8 activation and the resulting cleavage of RIP1, converting the signaling for tm TNF-α-mediated apoptosis into one for activating NF-kB to survive. These results suggest that the actin cytoskeleton functions in transmitting signals via TNFR2 to mediate tm TNF-α-induced apoptosis. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.

84863447641	Cloning and characterization of a novel cathepsin B-like cysteine proteinase from Angiostrongylus cantonensis	Cysteine protease plays a key role in host-parasite interactions. In this study, we identified a novel gene encoding a cathepsin B-like cysteine protease (AcCBL1) from the cDNA library of Angiostrongysus cantonensis fourth-stage larvae (L4) and characterized its biological role in the parasite. Sequence and phylogeny analysis showed that AcCBL1 is related to other cathepsin B family members with the conserved catalytic triad (Cys, His, Asn) and diagnostic occluding loop. In addition, the sequence contains a specific "hemoglobinase motif and might have a hemoglobinase (Hb)-degrading function. The recombinant AcCBL1 (rAcCBL1) exhibited the protease activity by gelation SDS/PAGE assay; rAcCBL1 can cleave the fluorogenic substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC, and the optimum pH was 5.5. The enzyme can hydrolyse several host proteins including Hb and human IgG in acidic pH, but low levels of hydrolysis were observed in neutral pH. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that AcCBL1 expression was detected throughout various developmental stages, L3, L4, adult male and female worms. Western blotting analysis indicated that AcCBL1 was an excretory/secretory product of L4 in mature form of protease. Immunolocalization demonstrated that AcCBL1 was mainly localized in the intestine of L4. These results suggest that rAcCBL1 may play an important role in the parasite nutrition uptake. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84863469550	Molecular characterization and immunolocalization of a protein disulfide isomerase from Angiostrongylus cantonensis	Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), belonging to the thioredoxin superfamily, are oxidoreductases that catalyze the formation, reduction, and isomerization of disulfide bonds among cysteine residues of proteins. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a protein disulfide isomerase (AcPDI) from a cDNA library of fourth-stage larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis. The deduced amino acid sequence contains two thioredoxin domains and exhibits high identity to the homologues from other species. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed at the third-stage larvae, fourth-stage larvae, and adult stage of A. cantonensis, and the results revealed that the AcPDI mRNA, while expressed at all three stages, is expressed at a significantly higher level in female adult worms. Results of immunohistochemical studies indicated that the AcPDI expression was specifically localized in the tegument and uterus wall of female adult worms. Biochemical analysis showed that recombinant AcPDI was biologically active in vitro and exhibited the typical biochemical functions of PDIs: oxidase/isomerase and reductase activities. Collectively, these results implied that AcPDI may be a female-enriched protein and associated with the reproductive development of A. cantonensis. In addition, considering its biochemical properties, AcPDI may be involved in the formation of the cuticle of A. cantonensis. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84863559729	Sublytic complement protects prostate cancer cells from tumour necrosis factor-α-induced cell death	Inflammation is a critical component of tumour progression. Although complement and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α potentially exert significant anti-tumour effects, both mediators may also promote tumour progression. It has been demonstrated that sublytic complement confers resistance on tumour cells not only against lytic complement, but also other danger molecules such as perforin. In low concentrations, TNF promotes survival of malignant cells rather than exerting cytotoxic activity. In this study, we tested if sublytic complement is able to interfere with TNF-mediated tumour cell killing. Our results demonstrate that either subcytotoxic concentrations of TNF or sublytic complement rescue prostate carcinoma cells (DU145) from TNF-α-mediated cell death. Upon pretreatment with low-dose TNF-α, but not upon pre-exposure to sublytic complement, TNF resistance was associated with the down-regulation of TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) expression. Complement-induced protection against TNF-mediated apoptosis accompanied the induction of anti-apoptotic proteins [B cell leukaemia/lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-xL] at an early stage followed by inhibition of the TNF-induced decrease in the amount of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Cell protection also accompanied the inhibition of caspase-8 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 cleavage and the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Our data extend our current view on the induction of tumour cell resistance against cytotoxic mediators supporting the role of the tumour microenvironment in mediating protection against the anti-cancer immune response. © 2012 The Authors.

0038235597	Regulation of leptin on insulin secretion and sulfonulurea receptor 1 transcription level in isolated rats pancreatic islets	Objective. To investigate the regulation of leptin on insulin secretion and expression of ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunit sulfonulurea receptor 1 (SUR1) mRNA, and to determine whether the effects of leptin are mediated through known intracellular signaling transduction. Methods. Pancreatic islets were isolated by the collagenase method from male SD rats. The purified islets were incubated with different concentrations of leptin for 2 h in the presence of different concentrations of glucose. Insulin release was measured using radioimmunoassay. Expression of SUR1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Results. In the presence of leptin 2 nmol/L, insulin release was significantly inhibited at either 11.1 or 16.7 mmol/L glucose concentration (both P < 0.05), but insulin release was not altered at glucose of 5.6 mmol/L physiological concentration. The dose-response experiment showed that the maximal effect of leptin on insulin secretion achieved at 2 nmol/L. Exposure of islets to 2 nmol/L leptin induced a significant increase of SUR1 transcription levels by 71% (P < 0.01) at 11.1 mmol/L glucose and by 56% (P < 0.05) at 16.7 mmol/L glucose concentration. Selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin significantly prevented the leptin effect on insulin secretion and SUR1 mRNA expression. Conclusions. Regulatory effects of leptin on insulin secretion could be biphasic at different concentrations of glucose and leptin. The stimulatory regulation of SUR1 transcription levels may be mediated through activation of PI 3-kinase pathway, which may be a possible mechanism of leptin in regulating insulin secretion.

0037693962	Rosiglitazone reverses insulin secretion altered by chronic exposure to free fatty acid via IRS-2-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway	AIM: To study the effect of rosiglitazone (RSG) on insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets under chronic exposure to free fatty acid (FFA) and to investigate the potential signaling mechanism of RSG action. METHODS: Rat pancreatic islets were cultured with or without FFA (2 mmol/L, oleate: palmitate, 2:1) in the presence or absence of RSG (0.05-10 μmol/L). The insulin release was measured by radio immuoassay, the expression level of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) protein and the association of IRS-2 with p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) were determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot. RESULTS: The islets exposed to high FFA concentration showed an increased basal and a decreased glucose-induced insulin release as compared with control islets (P<0.01). IRS-2 protein level was decreased by 65 % (P<0.01) and the association of IRS-2 with p85 subunit of PI 3-kinaseand was decreased by 73 % (P<0.01). When islets were cultured with FFA in the presence of RSG 5 μmol/L, both basal and glucose-induced insulin secretion were reversed to a pattern of control islets (P<0.01, P<0.05). The addition of RSG in the cultured medium increased significantly the expression of IRS-2 protein by 2.6 fold (P<0.01) and the association of IRS-2 with p85 by 2.7-fold (P<0.01) as compared with islets incubated with FFA alone. The effects of RSG on insulin secretion were blocked by a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. CONCLUSION: The effects of RSG on insulin secretion could be mediated through an IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase signaling pathway.

84870878563	Genotyping of Pneumocystis jirovecii isolates from Chinese HIV-infected patients based on nucleotide sequence variations in the internal transcribed spacer regions of rRNA genes	Genetic diversity of Pneumocystis jirovecii isolates based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the nuclear rRNA locus has previously been reported. The information about ITS genotype and epidemiology of this organism in Chinese human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients has not been available. In this study, 12 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens obtained from HIV-infected patients were analyzed by PCR followed by cloning, sequencing and typing. Three ITS1 genotypes (E, B and 'H') and four ITS2 genotypes (b, g, i and r) as previously reported were identified, the most common of which were E, b and i. Five ITS haplotypes (Eg, Eb, Bi, Er and 'H'r) and 19 new combination types were also identified with the most common types being Eg (four of 12 patients, 10 of 60 clones), Eb (three of 12 patients, 11 of 60 clones) and Bi (three of 12 patients, 10 of 60 clones). Nine patients were found to be co-infected with more than one ITS genotype of P. jirovecii. The prevalence of ITS genotypes in HIV patients from one Chinese hospital did not seem to be significantly different when compared to reports from other countries. © 2013 ISHAM.

84876290387	Laccase2 is required for sclerotization and pigmentation of Aedes albopictus eggshell	Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) is a member of multicopper oxidases that have been found in higher plants, fungus, bacterium, and insects. Two types of laccase genes have been detected in many species of insects: laccase1 and laccase2. It has been identified that laccase2 enzyme may play a key role in sclerotization and pigmentation of insect cuticle. But few attentions were given to the biological role of laccase2 in the synthesizing of similar structures, such as oothecae, eggshell, or silk cocoons. We cloned laccase2 gene from Aedes albopictus, one main mosquito vector of dengue virus in China. An upregulation of laccase2 gene was observed after a blood meal in female adult mosquitoes, suggesting that laccase2 gene may have an involvement in the development of ovary. RNA interference experiment was performed by using adult female mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes were injected with 20 ng of double-strain RNA into the thorax. Pigmentation of mosquito eggshell was blocked that these eggs never became dark. And the incomplete sclerotization of eggshell weakened the stability and flexibility of the eggs. These eggs without enough protection were deformed and died in water. These results demonstrate that laccase2 plays a critical role in the development of eggs of A. albopictus. Laccase2 may provide a novel target for mosquito control and management. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878346357	Molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of a putative activation-associated secreted protein from Angiostrongylus cantonensis	Activation-associated secreted protein (ASP) had been found in many helminthes, which was associated with pathogenesis and stage transition. A complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence encoding a putative two-domain ASP was obtained from an Angiostrongylus cantonensis fourth-stage larvae cDNA library, which we designated as AgASP. The cDNA of AgASP contains an open reading frame encoding 424 amino acids, the first 19 residues being a putative secretion signal. The expression pattern of this protein was investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. We found that this protein expressed most highly in the brain-stage larvae (Lbr) of this parasite and existed in the excretory/secretory products of this stage. Immunofluorescence showed it existed in the lumen of the Lbr. The recombinant protein can be recognized by the infection sera from mice (nonpermissive host), while it cannot be recognized by infection sera from rats (permissive host). The infiltration of neutrophils in infected nonpermissive host can be lessened by immunizing this host with this protein (immunized vs control group, 13.7 ± 10.2 vs 65.5 ± 19.2). These findings suggest that this protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of human angiostrongyliasis and is worthy of further study. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84880049469	Targeting transmembrane TNF-α suppresses breast cancer growth	TNF antagonists may offer therapeutic potential in solid tumors, but patients who have high serum levels of TNF-α fail to respond to infliximab, suggesting consumption of the circulating antibody and loss of transmembrane TNF-α (tmTNF-α) on tumors by ectodomain shedding. Addressing this possibility, we developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds both full-length tmTNF-α and its N-terminal truncated fragment on the membrane after tmTNF-α processing but does not cross-react with soluble TNF-α. We documented high levels of tmTNF-α expression in primary breast cancers, lower levels in atypical hyperplasia or hyperplasia, but undetectable levels in normal breast tissue, consistent with the notion that tmTNF-α is a potential therapeutic target. Evaluations in vitro and in vivo further supported this assertion. tmTNF-α mAb triggered antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tmTNF-α-expressing cells but not to tmTNF-α-negative cells. In tumor-bearing mice, tmTNF-α mAb delayed tumor growth, eliciting complete tumor regressions in some mice. Moreover, tmTNF-αmAbinhibited metastasis and expression of CD44v6, a prometastatic molecule. However, the antibody did not activate tmTNF-α-mediated reverse signaling, which facilitates tumor survival and resistance to apoptosis, but instead inhibited NF-κB activation and Bcl-2 expression by decreasing tmTNF-α-positive cells. Overall, our results established that tmTNF-α mAb exerts effective antitumor activities and offers a promising candidate to treat tmTNF-α-positive tumors, particularly in patients that are nonresponders to TNF antagonists. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

84882916825	Differential proteomics of Aedes albopictus salivary gland, midgut and C6/36 cell induced by dengue virus infection	The interaction between dengue virus (DENV) and vector mosquitoes are still poorly understood at present. In this study, 2-D DIGE combined with MS was used to analyze the differential proteomes of Aedes albopictus salivary gland, midgut and C6/36 cells induced by DENV-2. Our results indicated that the virus infection regulated several functional classes of proteins. Among them, 26 were successfully analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. The mRNA levels of 15 were the highest in salivary gland, 2 in midgut and none in C6/36 cells, however, 18 were the least in fat body compared to other organs. Interestingly, the changes of differential proteins mRNA were the most obvious in fat body post-infection. Chaperone, cytoskeleton and energy metabolism enzyme were the most down- or up- regulated proteins after DENV-2 infection. The abundant expression of these proteins in salivary gland may relate to its high susceptibility. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

0042235810	The roles of mTNF-α and sTNF-α in endotoxin shock	Objective To observe the dynamic expression of mTNF-α and sTNF-α in the development of endotoxin shock and to explore the mechanism of mTNF-α in endotoxin shock. Methods Endotoxin shock was induced in rats by intravenous injection of dead gram negative bacteria E. coli; the kinetics of mTNF-α in peritoneal macrophages and sTNF-α in serum of these rats were examined. The pretreatment with TAGE antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide(TACE A-ODN) (5mg/kg weight) or with polyclonal antibody against TNF-α (5mg/kg weight) 30 minutes before injection of dead bacteria inhibited the enzymatic cleavage of mTNF-α into sTNF-α or neutralizated sTNF-α. Six hours after bacteria injection, mTNF-α and sTNF-α also respectively detected. Pathological injury in lung and kidney in endotoxin shock rats was examined and arteria pressure was measured incessantly. Results The kinetics of mTNF-α expression in the development of endotoxin shock was different from that of sTNF-α in serum. The expression of mTNF-α began to enhance on the surface of peritoneal macrophages in 30 min after the challenge of bacteria and reached the peak within a period of 4.5 hours followed by a gradual decrease to a certain level which was maintained at least 24 hours. TAGE A-ODN pretreated rats showed a markable increase in mTNF-α expression by peritoneal macrophages ( P < 0.001) and their arterial blood pressure were maintained in the normal rang and no detectable pathological injury was found in lung and kidney. Pretreat with polyclonal antibody against TNF-α led to the similar results with that of the former. Conclusion mTNF-α is a potential endogenous regulator involved in antiinflammatory responses to maintain the normal arterial pressure and protect tissue from pathological injury in the process of endotoxin shock. We demonstrated the kinetics of mTNF-α expression and its potential effects in endotoxin shock were also reported.

0040483347	Effect of secreting-type and transmembrane-type of tumor necrosis factor-α on the biological functions of neutrophils	Objective To compare the effect of transmembrane-type tumor necrosis factor-a (TM-TNF-α) and secreting-type TNF-α (S-TNF-α) on the biological functions of neutrophils so as to explore the role of the both type of TNF-α in inflammation. Methods Effect of the two type of TNF-α on the functions of neutrophils was examined by phagocytosis, respiratory burst and in situ hybridization assay. Results S-TNF-α was found to be able to promote neutrophil phagocytosis markedly ( P < 0.001 ), induce a striking respiratory burst ( P < 0 .005) and enhance the expression of IL-1β mRNA in neutrophils, while TM-TNF-α showed little influence on them. TM-TNF-α caused a two-fold increase in NO production by neutrophils (P < 0.001) while S-TNF-α in a wide dosage range(10-1 000U) failed to exert any effect on NO production. Conclusions These results suggested that the mechanisms of two type of TNF-α may be explained as that S-TNF-α promotes the inflammation in early phase, while TM-TNF-α plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation.

0040887645	The differences between mechanisms of TNF-α synthesis and secretion and typical secretory protein	Objective Activated monocytes/macrophages may express two different molecular forms of TNF-α, a secretory 17kD form S-TNF-α and a tansmembrane 26kD form TM-TNF-α. It is however still a matter in dispute whether 26kD TNF is present as an integrated protein on the cell membrane. The present study is to explore the mechanisms underlying the production of S-TNF-α and the interrelation between these two forms of TNF-α. Methods Full length cDNA fragment of S-TNF(without genes encoding TNF signal peptide) , 26kD TM-TNF(with gene encoding signal peptide) and S-TNF mutant (S-TNFm, in which TNF signal peptide sequence had been displaced by that of IL-2) were subcloned respectively into the vector pGEM-3Zf containing a T7 promoter, respectively. S-TNF, TM-TNF and S-TNFm were then in vitro translated and synthesized in the presence or absence of microsomes. Results As shown in Western blot analysis, the presence of microsomes did not alter the molecular weight of TM-TNF , but it did result in the cleavage of the IL-2 signal peptide from S-TNFm, suggesting that the leader sequence of TNF might differ from the signal peptide of typical secretory protein in that it seemed not to have undergone cleavage during translation in the rough-faced endoplasmic reticulum. Further enzymatic analysis revealed that TM-TNF was converted into S-TNF through the effect of certain metalloproteinase. Conclusions These results suggest that the mechanisms of TNF-α production may be as follows: Activation of TNF-α producing cells by LPS leads to augmented transcription/translation of TNF-α gene, resulting firstly in the formation of 26kD TNF-α , which is then anchored to the cell membrane as a protein with the aid of the hydrophobic amino acids of its signal peptide. This transmembrane TNF-α serves to mediate biological activities through direct cell-to-cell contact. Under the action of certain proteinase, signal peptide of TNF may be cleaved from the TM-TNF, resulting in the formation of 17kD secretory TNF-α, which is released into the body fluids, exerting its effect locally or systemically.

0042538179	Mutational analysis of region-cytotoxicity relationship in human transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-alpha	Objective To determine the region of human transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TM-TNFa), essential for cytotoxic activity against hmnan breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Methods Single amino-acid-substituted TM-TNFa mutant proteins (muteins) were produced by in vitro transeription linked translation techniques. The cDNA of TM-TNFc was site-directed mutagenized by recombinant PCR. Results 13 single amino-acid substituted TM-TNFa mnteins were generated and assayed for cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic activities of TM-TNFa muteins, eg, TM-TNFc -71/Lys, -28/Phe and 117/Leu were significantly decreased ( P < 0.01 ) compared to that of parentTM-TNFa, 143/Tyr decreased 4-folds, and-17/Thr, -39/Ser, ll9/His, 35/Gly, 95/Cys and 147/Phe decreased 1.5-2.5-folds, respectively. However, the cytotoxic activities of TM-TNFc-8/Arg, 31/Gly and 87/Phe showed no significant change. Conclusion These restdts indicate that the regions associated with cytotoxic-activity of TM-TNFa are different with that of secretory TNFalpha (S-TNFa). The inner cell region and transmembrane region of TM-TNFc are related to the cytotoxic activity of TM-TNFa.

0041563830	The co-action of actin-like protein with cytotoxicity of TM-TNF-α mediated by TNF receptor II	Objective: The co-action of actin-like protein with the cytotoxicity of TM-TNF-α was studied to discover the characteristic functions of TM-TNF-α and to illustrate the molecular mechanisms to explain the differences of biological effects between the two types of TNF-α. Methods: Immunoprecipitation, peptide spectrum analysis, Western blot and cytotoxicity bioassay were used to substantiate and define the co-action molecules to explain biological function of TM-TNF-α. Results: A 43kD protein was found in the immunoprecipitate of target cell stimulated by TM-TNF-α. It was identified as a protein of actin family by peptide spectrum analysis and Western blot. The preincubation of effect cells and/or target cells with anti-actin antibody resulted in significant inhibition of the cytotoxicity of TM-TNF-α on HL-60 cell line expressing TNFR II, but had no effect on the cytotoxicity of TM-TNF-α on MCF-7 cell line which expressing mainly TNFR I. Conclusion: The results suggested that the 43kD actin-like protein may costimulate TNFR II and enhance the cytotoxicity of TM-TNF-α.

Methods The soluble TNFR I was used to screen the TNF-α related peptides from phage 12-mer peptide library. The positive phage clones were selected as their cytotoxicity against different target cell lines, then the sequences of single strand DNA were determined. Results TM-TNF-α or S-TNF-α-like peptides were obtained. The most effective peptide mimicking TM-TNF-α was synthesized and able to effectively kill the HL-60 cell line in vitro, that was resistant to S-TNF-α, and induced apoptosis of target cells. In addition, this peptide failed to induce the transposition (from cytoplasma to nuclear) of NF-κB. Conclusion The short peptides mimicking TM-TNF-α, provided a potential therapeutic agent for cancer patients.

84891868830	A field survey for Wolbchia and phage WO infections of Aedes albopictus in Guangzhou City, China	Wolbachia are maternal endosymbiotic bacterium, which infect a diverse range of arthropods, ranging from 20 to 76 % in nature. They are capable of inducing a wide range of reproductive abnormalities to their hosts, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which has been proposed to be used as a tool to modify mosquitoes that are resistant to the development of pathogen, as an alternative vector control strategy. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of Wolbachia and phage WO infections in the field population of Aedes albopictus in Guangzhou City via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using the Wolbachia specific Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) and phage WO orf7 gene primers. Based on the results of PCR and phylogeny analysis, we found that A. albopictus in Guangzhou City were infected with two Wolbachia strains, wAlbA and wAlbB. Phage WO, the virus-infected Wolbachia, was also detected in A. albopictus. One hundred and ten female individuals were screened via PCR, with 109 super-infected with Wolbachia and one sample single-infected with wAlbB strain. And 104 of 113 male individuals were both infected with wAlbA and wAlbB, and nine male samples were found to be infected with wAlbA strain only. The infection rates of phage WO in female and male individuals were 82.73 and 46.02 %, respectively. These results showed that the natural Wolbachia and phage WO infections in A. albopictus population in Guangzhou were at a higher frequency at present, indicating that Wolbachia appear to be a better candidate nature resource for biological control insect vectors to reduce vector-borne diseases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84893381289	Transmembrane TNF-A Promotes Suppressive Activities of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells via TNFR2	It has been reported that TNFR2 is involved in regulatory T cell induction and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation, two kinds of immunosuppressive cells contributing to tumor immune evasion. Because transmembrane TNF-A (tmTNF-A) is the primary ligand for TNFR2, we hypothesized that tmTNF-A is mainly responsible for the activation of MDSCs. Indeed, we found that tmTNF-A, rather than secretory TNF-A (sTNF-A), activated MDSCs with enhanced suppressive activities, including upregulating arginase-1 and inducible NO synthase transcription, promoting secretion of NO, reactive oxygen species, IL-10, and TGF-b, and enhancing inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. This effect of tmTNF-A was mediated by TNFR2, as TNFR2 deficiency significantly impaired tmTNF-A-induced release of IL-10 and NO and inhibition of T cell proliferation by MDSC supernatant. Furthermore, tmTNF-A caused p38 phosphorylation and NF-kB activation, whereas inhibition of NF-kB or p38 with an inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or SB203580 abrogated tmTNF-A-mediated increased suppression of lymphocyte proliferation by MDSCs. Consistently, our in vivo study showed that ectopic expression of uncleavable tmTNF-A mutant by 4T1 cells significantly promoted tumor progression and angiogenesis, accompanied with more accumulation of MDSCs and regulatory T cells in the tumor site, increased production of NO, IL-10, and TGF-b, as well as poor lymphocyte infiltration. In contrast, enforced expression of sTNF-A mutant by 4T1 cells that only released sTNF-A without expression of surface tmTNF-A markedly reduced MDSC accumulation and induced more lymphocyte infiltration instead, showing obvious tumor regression. Our data suggest that tmTNF-A acts as a potent activator of MDSCs via TNFR2 and reveals another novel immunosuppressive effect of this membrane molecule that promotes tumor immune escape.

0346964820	Comparison of the cytocidal effect induced by transmembrane and secreted TNF-alpha	Objective: There are two forms of TNF-alpha, mainly secreted TNF-(s-TNF) and transmembrane TNF-alpha (TM-TNF). It has been shown that TM-TNF has a broader cytotoxic spectrum than s-TNF. So this study is decided to find the mechanism responsible for this difference. Methods: The cytotoxic effect of these two forms of TNF-alphas were compared by bioassay. The expression of TNFR mRNA is detected by RT-PCR. Differentiation of cell death modes is-by DNA ladder, TUNEL and FACS. Results: The s-TNF-alpha has been shown to kill only two of the cell lines while TM-TNF-alpha has been found to efficiently exert its cytotoxic activity on all of the tested cell lines. 3 of 6 cell lines expressed TNFR I mRNA alone (L929, MCF-7 and HepG2), 2 of 6 cell lines expressed both of TNFR I / I (HL-60 and K562), the remaining one expressed TNFR I alone (Raji). s-TNF-sensitive cell lines expressed TNFR I, while TM-TNF can kill target cell lines disregarding which type of surface TNFR was expressed. It was revealed that TNF-α could induce both apoptic and necrotic forms of cell death. TM-TNF-α did result in mainly apoptosis, but sTNF-α mostly necrosis. Conclusion: There are differnces between these the cytotoxic effects induced by the two forms of TNF-alpha. Since TM-TNF has a broader cytocidal spectrum, induced apoptosis chiefly and shown effect locally, it may be used better and broaderly than s-TNF in the field of tumor therapy.

10244255105	Schistosoma japonicum: Construction of phage display antibody library and its application in the immunodiagnosis of infection	Background. A monoclonal antibody would be an effective tool for the detection of circulating antigens in the serum of patients with schistosomiasis, but the traditional way of producing monoclonal antibodies is not cost-effective. The objective of this study was to find a new method for the large-scale production of monoclonal antibodies against Schistosoma japonicum (Sj). Methods. A phage display antibody library for Sj was constructed. To obtain a single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) against Sj, the library was screened with metabolic antigens from adult Sj worms (Sj-MAg) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The soluble scFvs selected were used to detect Sj antigens in the serum of acute and chronic schistosomiasis patients. Results. Six positive clones with good reactivity to Sj-MAg were obtained from the phage display antibody library of about 1. 07 × 10

10344255612	Function of 87th position amino acid residue in target cell apoptosis induced by TM-TNF-α	Objective: The structure-function of TM-TNF-α was studied to illustrate the molecular mechanism of target cell apoptosis induction. Methods: Site-directed mutant -87/Phe TM-TNF-α was reconstructed into eukocyte expression vector pcDNA3.0 and transiently transfected into Cos-7 cells. The mutein on transfected cells surface was tested for its cytotoxicity, the effect on the induction of target cell death manner and NF-κB translocation using MTT method, annexin V and Western blot. Results: The substitution at position of 87 had no effect on the cytotoxicity of TM-TNF, but the mutein could induce the change of target cell death manner, from apoptosis to necrosis, and promote NF-κB translocation from the cytoplasm into nucleus. Conclusion: The results suggested that the amino acid at position 87 may be one of the key residues to mediate apoptosis. The domain containing this residue may be the function region inducing apoptosis.
