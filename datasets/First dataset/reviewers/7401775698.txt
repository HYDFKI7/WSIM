84930479924	Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells support nontumorigenic expansion of human embryonic stem cells	The expansion of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) requires a culture on feeder layers of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The culture model often causes immunogenic contaminations such as xenocarbohydrate, and inevitably forms teratoma in vivo. This study tested human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs) as the feeder for hESCs. Wharton's jelly-derived HUCMSCs showed characteristics of MSCs and were easily maintained in a culture for over 20 passages. Under the mitomycininhibited HUCMSC feeder, hESCs maintained the features of embryonic stem cells (pluripotency and maintenance of normal karyotypes) after a prolonged culture of more than 20 passages. Notably, in extensive trials, no teratoma was formed in xenograft in NOD/SCID mice, but subsequent resumption of teratoma formation was noted upon transient coculturing with MEFs. Interestingly, among the four pluripotencyconferring genes, MYC and OCT4 were found to be downregulated in hESCs cocultured with HUCMSCs. Results of this study supported a nontumorigenic sustained culture of hESCs and did not form teratoma in vivo. © 2012 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

84939875270	High seroprevalence of human herpesvirus type 8 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma	Cirrhosis patients have immunologic insufficiency and a high seroprevalence of human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8). Nearly all hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are cirrhotic and have immunoabnormalities. This study aimed to assess the HHV-8 seroprevalence and hemograms in HCC patients. Blood samples from 95 HCC patients, 95 age-, sex-, and Child–Pugh class-matched cirrhotics, and 95 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed for anti-HHV-8 antibodies, HHV-8 DNA, and lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts. HCC patients had lower lymphocyte and platelet counts and a higher monocyte count than the healthy controls (each p < 0.0001). HCC patients, and particularly those with a severe Child–Pugh class, had higher platelet counts than the corresponding cirrhosis patients (p = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively). HHV-8 seropositivity and antibody titers in HCC patients were comparable with values in cirrhosis patients and were much higher than in controls (both p < 0.0001). HCC patients, but not cirrhosis patients, had a higher prevalence of high anti-HHV-8 antibody titers (≥1:160) than healthy controls (p = 0.003). HCC patients with lymphopenia or thrombocytopenia had lower HHV-8 seropositivity than those without lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia (p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). One each of HCC and cirrhosis patients were positive for HHV-8 DNA. HCC patients seemed to suffer from less severe or shorter duration of portal hypertension compared with Child–Pugh class-matched cirrhosis patients. HCC patients had a high HHV-8 seroprevalence, which seemed to be inversely associated with lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia.

9944264961	Multiple epithelial and nonepithelial tumors in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer: Characterization of germline and somatic mutations of the MSH2 gene and heterogeneity of replication error phenotypes	Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal inherited cancer syndrome characterized by germline plus somatic mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes and familial clustering of cancers of colorectum and other visceral organs. So far, to our knowledge, there has been no proof of nonepithelial tumors in association with HNPCC. Here we report on a MSH2 frameshift HNPCC family with a carrier found to have multiple primary tumors, including endometrial hyperplasia, ovarian adenocarcinoma, skin cavernous hemangioma, and skin dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). We studied the replication error (RER) phenotype in noncoding (Bat-26, Bat-25, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250) and coding (MSH3, MSH6, BAX, and TGFBR2 genes) DNA sequences, and characterized the germline and somatic mutations of the MSH2 gene in the tumors described above and in endometrial carcinomas from two of her affected siblings. RER was observed in an order of hyperplasic endometrium (6/10 markers), ovarian carcinoma (5/10 markers), endometrial carcinomas (4/9 and 3/10), DFSP (2/9 markers), and cavernous hemangioma (2/10 markers). All the tumors showed the same germline mutation of G5→G6 frameshift at 183-187 and polymorphism of C1168T in a heterozygous pattern. In an endometrial carcinoma, deletion of the second allele of MSH2 was evident. Heterogeneous RER patterns were noted in multiple primary tumors of the same individual and in premalignant and malignant endometrial tumors from different individuals. The study demonstrated the two hits of the hMSH

14944380160	The MTHFR C677T polymorphism, estrogen exposure and breast cancer risk: A nested case-control study in Taiwan	Background: We evaluated the effects of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and its interaction with estrogen exposure on breast cancer risk in a nested case-control study conducted in Taiwan. Materials and Methods: A total of 88 histologically confirmed breast cancer cases and 344 cancer-free controls were recruited between July 1992 and December 2000. The MTHFR C677T genotype was determined by a PCR-RFLP-based assay. All subjects completed in-person interviews. Results: There was a significant trend of breast cancer in relation to prolonged exposure to estrogens prior to the first full-term pregnancy (FFTP)(p for trend=0.0015). In contrast, there was no statistically significant association between the risk of breast cancer and the MTHFR C677T genotype. However, a significantly elevated risk of breast cancer predisposed by the MTHFR 677T variant genotype (CT and TT) was observed in women with prolonged exposure to estrogens prior to FFTP (adjusted OR=4.98, 95% CI=2.00-12.43). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the MTHFR 677T variant genotype per se may have no overall association with breast cancer risk, but a sizable association could be observed in the presence of relevant environmental exposure.

0029971551	Overexpression of the proto-oncogene c-jun in association with low-risk type specific human papillomavirus infection in condyloma acuminata	Infection with different types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with neoplasia at different anatomic sites. The 'low-risk' HPVs (LR-HPV) are responsible for benign genital lesions such as condyloma acuminata. In order to clarify the tumorigenic mechanism of LR-HPV, the HPV infection status was investigated and the expression of the c-jun proto-oncogene in different HPV-related skin and genital lesions analyzed. Of the 17 condyloma specimens analyzed by Western blotting, 13 cases (76.5%) exhibited overexpression of the c-jun gene. All 13 cases harbored high copy numbers of the LR-HPV genome with an average of 926 copies per cell, whereas the other four cases had an average of 12 copies of LR-HPV per cell (P < 0.001). Further typing of HPV by Southern blotting revealed that HPV-6 and HPV-11 infections predominated in c-jun positive cases. The c-jun protein was detected much less frequently in cervical cancers (three of 29, or 10.3%) and skin warts (one of 10), and was not detected in five genital polyps or in five normal cervical tissues. These findings suggest a type 6/11-specific induction of c-jun gene expression in HPV-related neoplastic lesions.

0032538423	Identification of free deaminated sialic acid (2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero- D-galacto-nononic acid) in human red blood cells and its elevated expression in fetal cord red blood cells and ovarian cancer cells	Chemical studies have shown the occurrence of the deaminated sialic acid 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) in paired samples of blood obtained from mothers and newborns of healthy human individuals. Most of the KDN was found in red blood cells, although low levels were detected in mononuclear cells. No N-glycolylneuraminic acid was detected. Unexpectedly, nearly all of the KDN in fetal cord and matched maternal red blood cells was present as the free sugar and comparatively little occurred conjugated or as cytidine 5'-KDN phosphate. The amount of free KDN in fetal newborn red blood cells was 2.4-fold higher than in red blood cells from the mothers or from healthy nonpregnant women. Free KDN was also identified in normal human ovaries, in ovarian tumors, and in ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients. Importantly, as in fetal cord red blood cells, a distinguishing feature of KDN expression in ovarian tumor cells was an elevated level of free KDN compared with normal controls. A positive correlation was found between an increase in the ratio of free KDN/N-acetylneuraminic acid in ovarian adenocarcinomas and the stage of malignancy. This was particularly evident in tumor cells isolated from the ascites fluid. The central importance of these new findings is 2-fold. First, they show that free KDN is a minor but ubiquitous sialic acid in human red blood cells and that its elevated expression in red blood cells from fetal cord blood compared with maternal red blood cells may be developmentally related to blood cell formation during embryogenesis. Second, the enhanced expression of KDN in ovarian cancer cells suggests that this sialic acid, like the α2,8-linked polysialic acid glycotope, may be an oncofetal antigen in these tumors and thus could be an 'early warning' signal for onset of disease and/or a marker for detection of recurrence of disease. These new findings highlight the importance of elucidating the role that KDN and KDN-containing glycoconjugates may play in normal development and malignancy.

0032545760	HPV-associated cervical cancers show frequent allelic loss at 3p14 but no apparent aberration of FHIT mRNA	The genetic aberration involved in the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p14 has recently been attributed to the disruption of the FHIT gene in many cancers. This study analyzed HPV DNA and allelic status of 5 microsatellite markers spaning 3p13-3p25 in 57 cases of cervical cancer. With no homozygous deletion found in any case, a 39% overall frequency of LOH was noted. The presence of tumorigenic HPV DNA (91%) did not correlate with the allelic loss at any marker, including THRB (3p22-24) and D3S1228 (3p14) which were found with high LOH rates of 43% (12/28) and 37% (11/30), respectively. Further analysis of FHIT mRNA in 29 cancers by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed a full-length transcript in all cases. However, additional minor transcripts were occasionally observed in cancer tissues (9/29) as well as in normal tissues (12/31) by nested PCR of the products. Sequence analysis of these transcripts showed exclusive internal exon deletions, suggesting a source of minor splicing variants. No apparent mutation of the mRNA sequences was found in 8 transcripts examined, except for a silent polymorphism and a site of alternative splicing. The results suggest that, although frequently reported to be abrogated in several cancers, the mRNA of FHIT remains intact in cervical cancer. Other genes closely linked to FHIT may be responsible for frequent LOH at 3p14 observed in cervical cancer.

24644491219	Epidemiologic correlates of cervical human papillomavirus prevalence in women with abnormal pap smear tests: A Taiwan Cooperative Oncology Group (TCOG) study	To explore factors affecting human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence in all grades of cervical neoplasia among Chinese women, 1,264 women with abnormal cervical cytology attending the gynaecologic clinics of 11 major medical centres in Taiwan. Patients were interviewed and underwent complete gynaecologic examination including colposcopy. Cervical scrapings were collected for HPV DNA detection by both Hybrid Capture-2 (high-risk probe) and L1 consensus PCR-reverse line blot. The prevalences of HPV in the four different diagnosis groups: (i) suspicious (n = 316), (ii) low-grade intraepithelial lesion (n = 474), (iii) high-grade intraepithelial lesion (n = 450), and (iv) cancer (n = 16), were 36.1%, 74.7%, 83.6%, and 100%, respectively. In the latter two groups, Patients less than 30 or 40 years old, respectively, tended to be infected more frequently with HPV than the older patients were. The main correlates of HPV prevalence were lifetime number of sex partners (odds ratio (OR) for two or more partners: 2.44; 95% CI, 1.44-4.15), vaginal douching after intercourse (OR for douching frequently: 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.04), vitamin supplementation (OR for regular vitamin supplement: 0.71, 95% CI, 0.55-0.92), and performance of Pap smear tests (OR for never having a Pap smear performed: 2.22; 95% CI, 1.19-4.17). The risk for vaginal douching was augmented by the promiscuity of sex partners (OR of 3.19 (1.91-5.34)) and smoking (OR of 1.90 (1.15-3.13)), whereas vitamin supplementation reduced the odds ratio to 1.35 (0.85-2.15). The results of this study provide further evidence of the role of HPV in cervical carcinogenesis. The data also indicate the main areas of risk for the prevalence of HPV in cervical neoplasia in Chinese women living in Taiwan. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

25144462470	Genetic polymorphisms of FAS and FASL (CD95/CD95L) genes in cervical carcinogenesis: An analysis of haplotype and gene-gene interaction	Objective. Whereas human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary but not sufficient for cervical carcinogenesis, host genetic variations may confer individual susceptibility. Resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer in which FAS/FAS ligand signaling plays an important role. The present study examines the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in FAS and FAS ligand genes, alone or in combination, are associated with cervical carcinogenesis. Methods. The genotypes of FAS -670A/G, FAS -1377G/A, and FASL -844C/T were assessed in 143 patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 175 patients with invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and in age-matched controls by real-time PCR with allele-specific TaqMan probes. The status of cervical high-risk HPV infection was determined and adjusted to test the independence of genotype in the risk assessment. Results. The A-allele and AA-genotype frequencies of FASA -670G were significantly higher in HSIL/SCC than in controls (60% vs. 54%, P = 0.04, OR 1.26 [95% CI 1.01-1.57]; 38.0% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.02, OR 1.70 [95% CI 1.07-2.70]). No association between FAS -1377 or FASL -844 polymorphisms and HSIL/SCC could be identified. The FAS -1377A/-670A haplotype conferred a higher risk for HSIL/SCC (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.28-7.30) than FAS -670A alone (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.28-7.30). The interaction between FAS -670AA and FASL -844CC genotypes was associated with a risk of HSIL/SCC (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.06-4.29) higher than that of the FAS -670AA genotype alone (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.07-2.70). Conclusions. The FAS -1377A/-670A haplotype in combination with FASL -844C is associated with cervical carcinogenesis. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

27144450871	Worldwide genomic diversity of the high-risk human papillomavirus types 31, 35, 52, and 58, four close relatives of human papillomavirus type 16	Among the more than one hundred formally described human papillomavirus (HPV) types, 18 are referred to as high-risk HPV types due to their association with anogenital cancer. Despite pathogenic similarities, these types form three remotely related taxonomic groups. One of these groups is called HPV species 9 and is formed by HPV-16, the most common and best-studied type, together with HPV-31, -33, -35, -52, -58, and -67. Previous worldwide comparisons of HPV-16 samples showed about 2% nucleotide diversity between isolates, which were subsequently termed variants. The distribution of divergent variants has been found to correlate frequently with the geographic origin and the ethnicity of the infected patients and led to the concept of unique African, European, Asian, and Native American HPV-16 variants. In the current study, we address the question of whether geography and ethnicity also correlate with sequence variations found for IIPV-31, -35, -52, and -58. This was done by sequencing the long control region in samples derived from Europe, Asia, and Africa, and from immigrant populations in North and South America. We observed maximal divergence between any two variants within each of these four HPV types ranging from 1.8 to 3.6% based on nucleotide exchanges and, occasionally, on insertions and deletions. Similar to the case with HPV-16, these mutations are not random but indicate a relationship between the variants in form of phylogenetic trees. An interesting example is presented by a 16-bp insert in select variants of HPV-35, which appears to have given rise to additional variants by nucleotide exchanges within the insert. All trees showed distinct phylogenetic topologies, ranging from dichotomic branching in the case of HPV-31 to star phytogenies of the other three types. No clear similarities between these types or between these types and HPV-16 exist. While variant branches in some types were specific for Europe, Africa, or East Asia, none of the four trees reflected human evolution and spread to the extent illustrated by HPV-16. One possible explanation is that the rare HPV types that we studied spread and thereby diversified more slowly than the more abundant HPV-16 and may have established much of today's variant diversity already before the worldwide spread of humans 100,000 years ago. Most variants had prototypic amino acid sequences within the E6 oncoprotein and a segment of the L1 capsid protein. Some had one, two, or three amino acid substitutions in these regions, which might indicate biological and pathogenic diversity between the variants of each HPV type.

26044432212	Polymorphic catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, duration of estrogen exposure, and breast cancer risk: A nested case-control study in Taiwan	Background: Polymorphic catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the O-methylation of catechol estrogens, which are hypothesized to participate in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis. Methods: We examined 87 cases and 341 population controls in Taiwan to determine the association between the functional genetic Val158Met polymorphism in membrane-bound form of COMT gene and female breast cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Results: There was no overall association between COMT genotype and individual susceptibility to breast cancer. However, COMT-L variant genotypes appear to pose increased risk of breast cancer in women with greater duration from menarche to first full-term pregnancy (>8 years) (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.00-7.36). Conclusions: This study based on limited sample sizes suggests that there may be no overall association of COMT genotype with breast cancer, but the COMT-L allele could pose enhanced risk of breast cancer in the presence of relevant environmental exposures, as most low penetrance gene are expected to act through gene-environment interactions. © 2005 International Society for Preventive Oncology.

33646031219	Differential viral loads of human papillomavirus 16 and 58 infections in the spectrum of cervical carcinogenesis	Human papillomavirus (HPV) load was reported to be related to the severity of cervical neoplasia but with controversy. The viral load-disease severity relationship was showed in HPV 16, but no study was made in HPV 58, the second most prevalent HPV in cervical cancer in East Asia. We studied cervical HPV loads in HPV 16- and HPV 58-infected cases of normal, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and invasive cervical cancer (CC) by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) with type-specific primers in defined cell number. With the exception of HPV 16 infection in normal, viral loads varied greatly in each disease regardless of genotypes. The load of HPV 16 differed significantly among disease severities, with a dramatic increase from normal (1.14 ± 2.25 copies/cell) to LSIL, HSIL, and CC (1599 ± 2301, 7489 ± 24,087 and 1878 ± 2979 copies/cell, respectively) (P < 0.01). No significant difference was noted among different HPV 58 infections, with loads in normal, LSIL, HSIL, and CC of 503 ± 641, 7951 ± 27,557, 353 ± 744, and 1139 ± 2895 copies/cell, respectively. In comparison with HPV 16, HPV 58 subclinical infection confers a significant higher load (P < 0.01). Different HPV types behave differentially in the spectrum of cervical carcinogenesis. Unlike HPV 16, the infection load of HPV 58 does not correlate to the clinical severity. The wide variation of HPV loads among different HPV types and among squamous intraepithelial lesions and CC makes the viral load test unrealistic in differentiating different severities of cervical neoplasia. © 2006, IGCS.

33645375391	Plasma proteomic pattern as biomarkers for ovarian cancer	Early detection of ovarian cancer remains a challenge. Pathologic changes within an organ might be reflected in proteomic patterns in serum or plasma. The objective of this study was to identify new plasma biomarkers in ovarian cancer patients using mass spectrometry (MS) protein profiling and artificial intelligence. The study included 35 women with ovarian cancer and 30 age-matched disease-free controls. For plasma protein signature analysis, the protein chip array surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) analysis was performed. The strong anion exchange (SAX) and weak cation exchange (WCX) chips were used for analysis. After a training analysis by SAX and WCX protein chips, learning algorithm and clustering analysis was performed to reach a discriminate pattern of protein signature. SELDI mass spectroscopy was highly reproducible in detecting ovarian tumor-specific protein profiles. Four specific protein peaks were identified in plasma of women with ovarian cancer, but not in controls, with relative molecular masses of 6190.48, 5147.06, 11522.6, and 11537.7 d. Two peaks, with M

33745086206	Plasma proteomic profiling for detecting and differentiating in situ and invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix	The objective of this study was to identify multiple plasma protein markers that might be characteristic of in situ and invasive cervical cancers. Plasma samples obtained from patients with in situ cervical cancer (carcinoma in situ [CIS], n = 32), from patients with early invasive cervical cancer without lymph node metastasis (squamous cell carcinoma [SCC], n = 60), and from age-matched disease-free controls (n = 37) were analyzed by cation-exchange protein chips and surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A classification tree defined by six protein peaks could discriminate 84 of the 92 cancers (CIS and SCC) and 36 of the 37 controls, with 91% sensitivity and 97% specificity. In comparing the CIS and SCC samples, two protein peaks with Mr values of 6586.41 and 3805.68 were able to classify 55 of the 60 SCC and 31 of the 32 CIS samples, with 92% sensitivity and 97% specificity. This study demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of differentiating in situ and invasive cervical cancers through plasma protein profiling. Identification of the proteins different in invasive and in situ cancer may be of great value in the understanding of cervical cancer invasion and in the development of novel therapeutic intervention. © 2006, Copyright the Authors.

33746296615	Promoter methylation of the secreted frizzled-related protein 1 gene SFRP1 is frequent in hepatocellular carcinoma	BACKGROUND. The secreted frizzled-related protein 1 gene (SFRP1) encodes a Wnt/β-catenin signaling antagonist and frequently is inactivated by promoter methylation in many tumors. However, the role of SFRP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clear. Therefore, the authors investigated whether methylation of the SFRP1 promoter is common in HCC and whether it may influence SFRP1 expression. METHODS. Four HCC cell lines, 54 HCCs, 42 cirrhotic livers, 21 livers with chronic hepatitis, and 15 normal control tissues were analyzed for 1) SFRP1 promoter methylation by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis and bisulfite sequencing, 2) SFRP1 messenger RNA expression by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and 3) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by using microsatellite markers flanking the SFRP1 locus. HCC cells were treated with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine to determine whether it could restore SFRP1 expression. RESULTS. SFRP1 promoter methylation was observed in 75%, 48.2%, 21.4%, 14.3% and 0% in HCC cell lines, primary HCCs, cirrhotic livers, livers with chronic hepatitis, and normal control tissues, respectively. Methylation of the SFRP1 promoter region in HCCs increased significantly compared with control tissues. All samples with SFRP1 methylation showed down-regulation of SFRP1 expression. Demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in HCC cells restored SFRP1 expression. Moreover, LOH of markers D8S505 and D8S1722 was found in 25% and 27.6% of the informative samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The current results suggested that promoter hypermethylation of SFRP1 is a common event in HCC and plays an important role in the regulation of SFRP1 expression. In addition to methylation-mediated down-regulation of SFRP1, LOH also may play a role. © 2006 American Cancer Society.

33748435205	Genetic polymorphisms of phase I and phase II xenobiotic enzymes in human papillomavirus related lesion and cancer of the uterine cervix	Objective: Other than a major role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, exposure to cigarette smoke, estrogen and possibly other carcinogens may be related to the development of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of CYP1A1, CYP2E1, mEH, and GSTM1 contributes to the risk of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and the low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) of the uterine cervix. Materials and Methods: In this study, genetic polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1, CYP2E1, mEH, and GSTM1, as well as the status of HPV infection were determined in 113 cases with invasive cervical cancer (ICC), 80 cases of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL, the early lesion of HPV infection), as well as in 1:1 age-matched control subjects. Results: As expected, subjects with results positive for HPV had significant risks for LSIL and ICC, with OR (95% CI) of 19.6 (6.9-55.3) and 61.1 (25.3-147.9), respectively. In comparison with the A/A genotype, A/ G or GIG genotype of the CYP1A1 gene showed a protection for ICC, but not for LSIL, with an OR of 0.3 (95% CI of 0.1 -0.9) after adjustment with HPV status. Subjects carrying GSTM1 null genotype were at risk for LSEL (OR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.0-6.3) and ICC (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.0-6.0) after HPV adjustment. The combination of CYP1A1 A/A and GSTM1 null genotype showed a higher risk for ICC (OR of 4.2, 95% CI of 1.4-12.3; p <0.01). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest there is a significant role for the polymorphism of GSTM1 in early stage and that of CYP1A1 in the invasive stage of cervical carcinogenesis in a Taiwanese population.

33749139735	The distribution and differential risks of human papillomavirus genotypes in cervical preinvasive lesions: A Taiwan Cooperative Oncologic Group Study	To clarify the distribution and relative risk of different human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in cervical preinvasive lesions, 1246 women with abnormal Papanicolaou smear including atypical squamous cell of unknown significance (ASCUS), atypical glandular cell of unknown significance (AGUS), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were enrolled in a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Colposcopy and HPV tests with hybrid capture 2 and polymerase chain reaction-reverse line blot were performed. The prevalences of HPV in ASCUS/AGUS-negative histology, ASCUS/AGUS, LSIL, HSIL, and invasive cancer were 33.8%, 38.3%, 74.9%, 84.3% and 100%, respectively, with an overall positive rate of 68.8%. The most common HPV types were HPV 16 (18.5%), 52 (16.5%), 58 (13.2%), 33, 51, 53, 18, 39, 59, 66, MM8, and 31. In comparing the relative risk of HPV infection in different disease status, LSIL and HSIL/carcinoma had a 4.64 (95% CI: 2.98-7.24) and 10.53 (95% CI: 6.69-16.58) folds of risk of high-risk HPV infection than the negative group. The same was true in mixed HPV infection, but not in low-risk type infection. Looking into each high-risk HPV type, the relative infection risks for LSIL and HSIL/carcinoma, in comparison with the negative group, were 1.67 (0.63-4.43) and 8.67 (3.46-21.70), 2017 (1.01-4.68) and 3.04 (1.42-6.47), and 1.40 (0.52-3.77) and 5.22 (2.07-13.19) for HPV type 16, 52 and 58, respectively. The study confirmed the high prevalence and risky nature of HPV 52 and 58 in Taiwanese population and conveyed the need to include these HPV types in vaccine development. © 2006, Copyright the Authors.

33750259789	Occurrence of a new sialic acid, KDN, in mammals including human	The first example of the natural occurrence of a unique deaminated form of sialic acid, 3-deoxy-D-£/ycero-D-#a/flcf0-nonulosonic acid (or 2-keto-3àeoxy-D-g[ycero-D-galacto-nononic acid; KDN) was found a decade ago [Nadano, D. et al. (1986) J. Biol. Client. 261, 11550-11557J and we added it as an extended family of sialic acids. Subsequently, KDN residues were found to be present in glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids in a wide variety of lower vertebrate species. Most recently, we have firmly established the occurrence of the KDN residues in mammalian tissues and human lung carcinoma cells [Inoue, S., et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24341-24344]. Thus, it can now be said that the KDN glycotope occurs in glycoproteins from living organisms ranging from bacteria to human. We have further studied expression of KDN residues in different organs and tissues of mammals including human and also examined if expression of KDN is dependent on developmental stages and represents malignancy and metastatic stages of certain types of human cancers. In this Symposium, we'll focus mainly on the present status on: our recent finding of a newly defined tumorigenic and developmental stageassociated antigenic building block, KDN, in human as a minor but important molecular form of sialic acids.

33750522456	Emergency peripartum hysterectomy in a teaching hospital in Eastern Taiwan	This study aims to review the incidence, indications, risk factors and complications associated with emergency peripartum hysterectomy in a teaching hospital. We reviewed records of patients undertaking emergency peripartum hysterectomy performed at our institution from 1998 to 2004. Emergency peripartum hysterectomy was defined as one performed for haemorrhage unresponsive to other treatments < 24 h after delivery. Eight cases of emergency peripartum hysterectomy were performed. The rate of peripartum hysterectomy was 0.25%. The main indications for hysterectomy were uterine atony and abnormal placentation. No maternal death occurred. Use of peripartum hysterectomy may become necessary in managing obstetrical haemorrhage refractory to other measures. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.

33751028953	Human papillomaviral load changes in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix	To better predict risk of progression of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) of the uterine cervix in women with human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, 294 baseline cervical specimens from women with LSILs were evaluated. Specimens were tested for HPV DNA using hybrid capture 2 (HC2) and PCR-reverse line blotting. 65 LSILs with HPV DNA types 16, 18, 52, or 58 were examined for physical status, E2/E6 ratio and viral load at two time points, along with patient age. Women with LSILs whose viral loads increased between baseline and 6 month follow-up had a 45% risk of developing HSIL (OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.9-29.4, P <0.01), as evaluated by real-time PCR and a 44% risk (OR = 6.1, 95% CI = 1.6-22.7, P <0.01), as evaluated by HC2. The two viral load measures correlated well (Person's coefficient, r = 0.687, P <0.001). Such evaluations of viral load changes (increased or not increased) through repeat HPV DNA testing could predict progression of disease in LSIL cases of HPV types 16, 18, 52, and 58, which correlates to clinical implications. © 2006 Cancer Research UK.

33947132661	Detection and typing of minimal human papillomavirus DNA in plasma	Objective: For clinical study of minute human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA such as those in plasma, a sensitive method that can detect a broad spectrum of HPV type is needed. Method: A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method which utilized a consensus primer set nested to the widely utilized MY09/MY11 primer set was developed. The HPV genotype was determined by restriction digestion of the PCR product followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA purified from cancer tissue, plasma and WBC of 17 patients of stage 1 or 2 squamous carcinoma of uterine cervix were examined. Results: This method readily detects a broad spectrum of at least ten genital types of HPV with a sensitivity of one viral copy. HPV DNA was detectable in all cervical cancer tissues and in 11 (65%) of the corresponding plasma, from which the genotype was successfully determined in 9 cases, all identical to that of primary cancer tissue. Conclusion: The high sensitivity and accuracy of this method has allowed detection of HPV in specimens of minimal viral load, such as in plasma in peripheral circulation of cervical cancer patients. © 2006 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

33846902364	Hypermethylation of two consecutive tumor suppressor genes, BLU and RASSF1A, located at 3p21.3 in cervical neoplasias	Objectives: Although initiated by human papillomavirus (HPV), cervical carcinogenesis demands other cofactors to shape its natural course. Epigenetic effects such as DNA methylation, are considered to contribute to carcinogenesis process. Methods: The methylation status of BLU and RASSF1A, as well as the HPV infection status, were assessed in a full spectrum of cervical neoplasia, including 45 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 63 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 107 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 23 adenocarcinomas (AC), and 44 normal control tissues. Results: The BLU was methylated in 76.9% of SCC, 57.4% of HSIL, 20.0% of LSIL and 12.5% of normal tissues (P < 0.001). The RASSF1A was methylated in 15% of SCC, 17.5% of HSIL, but not in LSIL or normal tissues (P < 0.001). In AC, 43.5% of patients showed BLU methylation and 26.1% RASSF1A methylation, significantly higher than the corresponding control frequencies of 12.5% (P = 0.005) and 0% (P = 0.001), respectively. There was an insignificant trend toward loss of BLU methylation with advancing clinical stages of SCC (84.8%, 67.7%, and 63.6% in stages I, II, and III/IV, respectively; P = 0.08). Patients with LSIL infected with high-risk HPV showed a higher rate of BLU methylation than those without HPV (38.8% vs 9.1%, respectively; P = 0.057). The methylation of RASSF1A was inversely related to HPV infection in patients with HSIL/SCC (P = 0.003). Conclusions: These results suggest that the methylation of BLU and RASSF1A genes is associated with cervical carcinogenesis, which could be clinically important in the future molecular screening of cervical neoplasia. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

34547890684	Otocephaly	Otocephaly is a rare lethal syndrome of microstomia, aglossia, agnathia, and synotia. This male infant was born to a 19-year-old, gravida 1, para 0, woman who received routine prenatal check-up. Polyhydramnios, low-lying ears, and proboscis were noted by sonography at 29 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis showed a normal karyotype of 46,XY. Premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor were noted at 32 weeks of gestation. A male infant was delivered preterm and died shortly after birth. The infant showed midline proboscis and absence of mandible. The simple, soft ears were extremely low-set and were near the midline of the neck. Otocephaly is regarded as the most severe form of first arch anomalies. Prenatal diagnosis should be dependent on ultrasound analysis. In the face of polyhydramnios, otocephaly is one of the possible fetal anomalies. © 2007 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

0032763165	Favorable clinical outcome of cervical cancers infected with human papilloma virus type 58 and related types	To determine whether the status of human-papillomavirus (HPV) infection affects the clinical outcome of cervical carcinoma (CC), HPV genotype was prospectively determined in 94 consecutive CC cases subsequently followed for a median duration of 37.5 months. With a consensus PCR-RFLP method of HPV genotyping, 81 (86.2%) cancers were positive for HPV DNA. They were classified, according to the phylogenic similarities, into HPV-16-related (type 16, n = 45; type 31, n = 2), HPV-58-related (type 58, n = 17; type 33, n = 3; type 52, n = 2) and HPV-18-related (type 18, n = 8; type 68, n = 1) groups, and analyzed in relation to clinical outcome. The following results were observed: (i) Type-58-related HPVs were more prevalent in the old age (older than the median age of 52) group than in the young age group (41% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.045); (ii) 63% (5/8) of patients with advanced stages (III and IV) were HPV-negative, a figure much higher than that (9.3%, 8/84) of patients with early stages (stage I and II) (p = 0.002); (iii) the occurrence of adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma was higher in the HPV-18-related group (50%) than in the HPV-16-related (33.3%) or the HPV-58-related (16.7%) groups (p = 0.024); (iv) the status of lymph-node metastasis and tumor grade did not correlate with HPV status; (v) 5-year survival rates were 90.2%, 80% and 74% for HPV-58-, HPV-16- and HPV-18-related groups, respectively (p = 0.03, after adjustment for tumor stage); (vi) in comparison with the HPV-16- related group, the relative risk of death in the HPV-58- and the HPV-18- related groups were 0.32 [95% CI, 0.07-1.49] and 1.87 [0.36-14.9] respectively. HPV genotype appears to affect the clinical behavior and outcome of cervical cancer. HPV-58-related types are prevalent in the older population, and appear to confer a favorable prognosis.

0033521859	Frequent aberration of the transforming growth factor-β receptor II gene in cell lines but no apparent mutation in pre-invasive and invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix	The type II transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor (RII) gene located at 3p22 plays an important role in regulating growth and differentiation of epithelium, including that of the uterine cervix. Loss- of-function mutations of RII have frequently been found in gastrointestinal cancers, with a replication-error (RER) phenotype characterized by the presence of microsatellite instability (MI). In this study, genomic PCR, SSCP and DNA sequencing were conducted to investigate the coding sequences of the RII gene in cell lines (n = 5) and tissues (n = 15) of squamous carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Intragenic deletions were noted in 2 of 5 cervical- cancer cell lines (ME180 and HeLa cells). However, no mutation, other than DNA polymorphisms, was found in 15 cervical cancers with either alleleic loss at 3p22 (n = 11) or MI (n = 4).

0032927128	Monoclonality and surface lesion-specific microsatellite alterations in premalignant and malignant neoplasia of uterine cervix: A local field effect of genomic instability and clonal evolution	Invasive squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix (CC) arises from sequential progression of low-grade (L) and high-grade (H) squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). In clinical observations, these lesions are frequently found as synchronous multiple foci. The nature and evolutionary mechanism of these lesions are largely unknown. We have performed allelotyping of three 3p markers (at 3p14, 3p22-24, and 3p25) on 22 LSILs and 15 HSILs microdissected from patients with multiple (n = 21) or uniform (n = 6) cervical lesions. The results were analyzed together with our previous allelotyping of 57 deeply invasive CCs. Loss of heterozygosity at one of the three markers was observed in 23%, 27%, and 31% of LSILs, HSILs, and CCs, respectively. Frequent and early allelic loss was noted (in 30% of LSILs and 50% of HSILs) at 3p14, which may harbor tumor suppressor genes involved in early stages of cervical carcinogenesis. A high frequency of microsatellite alteration (MA) was found in LSIL (41%) and HSIL (67%) but not in CC (5.3%). In particular, MA was more frequently found in low-grade lesions in association with invasive cancers (75%, 6/8) than in those associated with SILs (29%, 4/14) (P < 0.05). Together with the finding of a monoclonal origin of premalignant and malignant cervical lesions, the present results allow us to propose a model of local field effect of genomic instability that progressively affects the clonal evolution of SIL of uterine cervix.

0032980657	Intracervical misoprostol as an effective method of labor induction at term	Objects: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intracervical misoprostol for the induction of labor at term. Methods: Eighty-nine term pregnancies requiring induction of labor were treated intracervically with 50 μg of misoprostol. The dose was repeated every 4 h until adequate uterine contraction and cervical dilatation were achieved. Status of cervical ripening, uterine contraction, cervical dilatation, labor course and side effects were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among the 89 patients, 58 had an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score ≤ 4) and 31 had a favorable cervix (Bishop score > 4). Labor was successfully induced in all cases, most (93.3%) of which required a single dose of misoprostol. Seventy-two patients (81%) proceeded to spontaneous vaginal delivery, and 61 (85%) deliveries were achieved within 12 h. The other 17 cases received cesarean delivery with indications of fetopelvic disproportion (six cases), failure of induction (seven cases) and acute fetal distress (four cases). The mean duration from induction to regular uterine contraction and to delivery was 483 ± 537 min and 79.2 ± 38.2 min, respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups with differing status of cervical ripening. Complications of uterine contraction, including tachysystole (15 cases), hypertonus (one case) and hyperstimulation (10 cases) were more common in the group of unfavorable cervix (45%) than that of favorable cervix (23%) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In addition to the oral and intravaginal routes of administration, intracervical misoprostol at a single dose of 50 μg appears to be an effective method for induction of labor at term, but caution should be taken with cases with unfavorable cervix.

40349116252	Long-term outcomes of high-risk human papillomavirus infection support a long interval of cervical cancer screening	Knowing that infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) causes virtually all cervical cancer (CC), the long-term outcomes of HPV infection, especially the absolute risk and time lapse of developing CC, are beyond the scope of ordinary follow-up study owing to ethical concerns. The present study followed the natural history and long-term outcomes of HPV infection in a cohort of women by national health insurance care and data linkage without additional disturbance. The status of cervical HPV infection was determined in 1708 healthy women, aged 20-90 (median 43), enrolled from 10 hospitals in seven cities around the island country of Taiwan. Records of consecutive Pap smear results and cancer reports of 108 cytology-negative, HPV-positive and 1202 cytology- and HPV-negative women with no prior record of CC or abnormal cervical cytology were retrospectively analysed for a duration of up to 75 months (median 61 months). The cumulative incidences of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and in situ/invasive cancer in HPV-positive women were 5.6 and 3.7%, respectively, and those in HPV-negative women were 0.3 and 0%. After adjusting for other risk factors, HPV-positive subjects had 24.9 (95% CI: 7.0-108.3; P<0.0001) folds of risk of developing HSIL or above cervical neoplasia as compared to HPV-negative subjects, whereas risk for low-grade intraepithelial lesion and atypical squamous cytology was not increased. The study showed that women with a prevalent infection of high-risk HPV had a 4% cumulative risk for CC in 6 years, whereas those tested negative had little risk. The result supports an HPV test-orientated CC screening programme with intervals of at least 5 years. © 2008 Cancer Research UK.

33645744573	SELDI-TOF MS profiling of plasma proteins in ovarian cancer	Objective: Proteomic profiling of plasma or serum is a technique to identify new biomarkers in disease. The objective of this study was to identify new plasma biomarkers in ovarian cancer patients using mass spectrometry protein profiling and artificial intelligence. Methods: A total of 65 plasma samples obtained from women with ovarian cancer (n = 35) and age-matched disease-free controls (n = 30) were applied to anion exchange protein chips for protein profiling by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). Results: SELDI-TOF MS was highly reproducible in detecting ovarian tumor-specific protein profiles. One protein peak (relative molecular mass, Mr, 11,537 Da) was identified in plasma from women with ovarian cancer but not in controls. Two peaks, Mr 5,147 and 8,780 Da, were present in the plasma of controls but not of women with ovarian cancer. After a training analysis, classification analysis generated by univariant or linear combination split was performed to reach a discriminant protein signature pattern. After cross validation, a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 89% for all studied cases and controls was reached. Conclusion: This study clearly demonstrates that the combined technology of SELDI-TOF MS and artificial intelligence is effective in distinguishing protein expression between normal and ovarian cancer plasma. The identified protein peaks may be candidate proteins for early detection of ovarian cancer or evaluation of therapeutic response.

58149376815	Laparoscopic management of tubal ectopic pregnancy	Objectives: To study the surgical morbidity associated with laparoscopic management of tubal ectopic pregnancy compared with that of open laparotomy. Methods: A retrospective study in an academic tertiary obstetrics and gynecology referral center was conducted from 2005 through 2007. Forty-nine patients who had pathology-confirmed tubal ectopic pregnancies were divided into 2 groups, laparoscopy (n-38) and laparotomy (n-11). The main outcome measures included operative time, blood loss, and complications. Results: No significant differences existed in gestational age, beta-hCG level, history of previous surgeries, pelvic inflammatory disease, or endometriosis. The laparotomy group included more patients with a history of previous ectopic pregnancy. The length of hospital stay following laparoscopic management was significantly less than that in the laparotomy group. Conclusion: Laparoscopic management of ectopic pregnancy can be the most beneficial procedure with maximum safety and efficacy. © 2008 by JSLS, Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons.

79951577440	Post-coital vaginal douching is risky for non-regression of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix	Background: Vaginal douching is a common practice worldwide. Its effect on the natural history of the early lesion of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), is unknown. Methods: In a prospective nation-wide cohort (n = 1332), epidemiological variables including habit of vaginal douching after intercourse and outcomes of LSIL were studied. Colposcopy-confirmed LSIL women (n = 295) were followed every 3 months. Parameters of HPV infection, sexual behavior, personal hygiene and environmental exposures were compared with the follow-up outcomes. Results: There was a 15% chance of HSIL co-existing with the LSIL cytology result. Eight percent of colposcopy-confirmed LSIL were found with HSIL in 1 year. With a follow-up of up to 36 months, 83% LSIL regressed, 11% progressed and 6% persisted. The mean time (95% CIs) to regression and progression were 5.2 (4.7-5.8) and 8.0 (5.8-10.3) months, respectively. Risk factors of the non-regression of LSIL included HPV prevalence on enrollment, habit of vaginal douching after intercourse with a hygiene product and non-regular Pap screening, with odd ratio of 4.4 (1.9-10.3), 3.14 (1.04-9.49) and 2.12 (1.24-3.62), respectively. HPV prevalence and vaginal douching also conferred a slower regression of LSIL (8.0 vs. 4.1 months, P < .001 and 8.0 vs. 5.6 months, P = 0.02, respectively). Conclusion: The study disclosed a transient but warning nature of cytological LSIL. Practicing of vaginal douching after intercourse, especially with hygiene products, is associated with non-regression of LSIL. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84867138822	Trend changes in the proportion of minimal invasive hysterectomies over a five-year period: A single-center experience	Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the trend changes in the proportion of laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) at a single center over a 5-year period and to compare the surgical morbidity associated with LAVH and total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted covering all hysterectomies performed in 2002 and in 2006. Results: A total of 101 patients in 2002 and 99 patients in 2006 had benign gynecological indications for hysterectomy. Out of these patients, 67 patients in 2002 and 53 in 2006 received TAH, while 34 patients in 2002 and 46 patients in 2006 received LAVH. Thus in 2002, 66.3% of patients underwent TAH, while in 2006 53.5% of patients underwent TAH. The percentage of patients with a previous surgical history was higher in the TAH group (57.4 % vs. 20.5% in 2006) but the blood loss was less in the LAVH group compared to the TAH group [median 200. mL (range 20-700. mL) in LAVH group vs. median 300. mL (50-1500) in TAH group; p<. 0.001]. The average operative time and hospital stay were shorter for the LAVH group than the TAH group [120 minutes (60-400) vs. 121 minutes (60-240); p= 0.03 and 5 days (2-18) vs. 6 days (3-78); p<. 0.001, respectively]. Conclusions: The use of LAVH increased from 33.7% to 46.5% over a 5-year period, perhaps due to improved techniques, the lower blood loss associated with LAVH, and LAVH's shorter operation time. Nevertheless, there remains a need to further increase the proportion of patients undergoing LAVH and to further improve the minimal invasive surgery techniques used for hysterectomy. © 2012.

43549123821	Valproic acid resensitizes cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells	Although certain inhibitors of histone deacetylases have been shown to induce cytotoxicity alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells, the molecular mechanism is not clear. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the antiseizure drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; VPA), which is also able to inhibit histone deacetylase, exhibits synergistic cytotoxicity with cisplatin, and the possible pathways for this. Our results clearly show that VPA not only exhibits synergistic cytotoxicity with cisplatin in all of the ovarian carcinoma cells tested, but also can resensitize the cells that have acquired resistance to cisplatin. Consistent with the increased cytotoxicity, cotreatment with VPA was shown to upregulate the cisplatin-mediated DNA damage revealed by phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutation and histone H2AX. Reactive oxygen species accumulation and tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) overexpression, which could contribute to the enhanced cytotoxicity, were also observed to be upregulated by VPA. Because PTEN knockdown by small interference RNA or antioxidant treatment can reduce cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity, it is suggested that upregulation of PTEN and reactive oxygen species by VPA contributes to the enhancement of cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity. These results with resensitization of cisplatin-resistant cells particularly may provide benefits in the treatment of ovarian cancer patients. © 2008 Japanese Cancer Association.

43949142803	Identification of novel DNA methylation markers in cervical cancer	Testing for DNA methylation has potential in cancer screening. Most previous studies of DNA methylation in cervical cancer used a candidate gene approach. The aim our study was to identify novel genes that are methylated in cervical cancers and to test their potential in clinical applications. We did a differential methylation hybridization using a CpG island (CGI) microarray containing 8640 CGI tags to uncover methylated genes in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the uterine cervix. Pooled DNA from cancer tissues and normal cervical swabs were used for comparison. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, bisulfite sequencing and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to confirm the methylation status in cell lines, normal cervices (n = 45), low-grade lesions (n = 45), high-grade lesions (HSIL; n = 58) and invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; n = 22 from swabs and n = 109 from tissues). Human papillomavirus (HPV) was detected using reverse line blots. We reported 6 genes (SOX1, PAX1, LMX1A, NKX6-1, WT1 and ONECUT1) more frequently methylated in SCC tissues (81.5, 94.4, 89.9, 80.4, 77.8 and 20.4%, respectively) than in their normal controls (2.2, 0, 6.7, 11.9, 11.1 and 0%, respectively; p < 0.0001). Parallel testing of HPV and PAXl methylation in cervical swabs confers an improved sensitivity than HPV testing alone (80% vs. 66%) without compromising specificity (63% vs. 64%) for HSIL/SCC. Testing PAXl methylation marker alone, the specificity for HSIL/SCC is 99%. The analysis of these novel DNA methylations may be a promising approach for the screening of cervical cancers. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

44849126663	Quality improvement of antimicrobial prophylaxis for abdominal hysterectomy in a medical center in eastern Taiwan	Objective: To prevent surgical site infections, we conducted the Breakthrough Quality Improvement Project to optimize antimicrobial prophylaxis for abdominal hysterectomy. The specific aims were to increase the proportion of patients who receive prophylactic antimicrobial therapy within 1 hour prior to incision and increase the proportion of patients whose prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is discontinued within 24 hours after the end time of surgery. Materials and Methods: The Breakthrough model was introduced by the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation. It consisted of experts' meetings, learning sections and action periods with Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The control group included 43 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and 29 patients were enrolled as the experimental group. Timing and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis, incidence of surgical site infection, and hospital and antibiotic costs were recorded. Results: The patients who followed the recommendations had no surgical site infections within 30 days after the end of surgery. Prophylaxis administration within 1 hour prior to incision was significantly increased from 69.3% to 92.4%. Prophylaxis duration of less than 24 hours was significantly increased from 25% to 100%. The length of hospital stay, hospital costs and antibiotic costs were all reduced. Conclusion: We successfully introduced the Breakthrough Project to improve the quality of medical care through antimicrobial prophylaxis. By applying this important management model, we were able to optimize the timing and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. Our experience demonstrates that this is one of the choices for effectively dealing with quality of medical care issues. © 2008 Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation.

44849127839	Type-specific distribution of HPV along the full spectrum of cervical carcinogenesis in Taiwan: An indication of viral oncogenic potential	Objective: The distributional trend of different types of human papillomavirus (HPV) along the spectrum of cervical diseases from non-neoplastic HPV infection (Normal), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3) to invasive cancer (CC) reflects the transformation potential of each HPV type. Study design: Type-specific distribution of HPV in four hospital- and population-based HPV surveys in Taiwan was analyzed. Results: Among the 1605 (out of 6356) women positive for HPV, the prevalence of HPV infection in Normal, CIN1, CIN2/3, and CC was 10%, 60%, 70%, and 86%, respectively. The order of type-specific prevalence was HPV 52 (20.9%), HPV 16 (16.9%), HPV 58 (9.0%), and HPV 18 (8.5%) in Normal; HPV 52 (16.5%), HPV 16 (10.2%), HPV 51 (8.4%), and HPV 58 (6.5%) in CIN1; HPV 16 (29.8%), HPV 52 (17.1%), HPV 58 (16.4%), and HPV 33 (10.3%) in CIN2/3; and HPV 16 (50.7%), HPV 18 (11.9%), HPV 58 (10.1%), and HPV 33 (8.4%) in CC. We compared the step-wise distributional changes of five major HPV types along the spectrum of cervical neoplasia. The CIN1 vs. Normal distributional ratio of each HPV type varied from 0.41 to 0.97, indicating a relatively similar chance of giving rise to CIN1. In the CIN2/3 vs. CIN1 and CC vs. CIN2/3 comparisons, the distributional changes varied dramatically among different HPV types. Upon progression to CIN2/3, the distributional proportions of HPV 16, 33, and 58 became 2.1- to 5.4-fold higher, and that of HPV 18 became 0.3- to 0.5-fold lower than their CIN1 and normal counterparts. In the CC vs. CIN2/3 comparison, the change in distributional proportion was highest in HPV 18 (5.7-fold), followed by HPV 16 (1.7-fold), HPV 33 (0.8-fold), HPV 58 (0.6-fold), and HPV 52 (0.18-fold). Conclusion: The distribution-defined progression from subclinical infection to CC was highest for HPV 16, followed by HPV 33, 18, 58, and 52. The differential disease progression potential of different HPV types reflects their transformational capability at different steps of cervical carcinogenesis and warrants the clinical attention of HPV infection type specifically. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

44849136818	Risk factors and genetic markers of human papillomavirus-induced cervical carcinogenesis: A focus on chinese populations in Southeast Asia and southern China	Cervical cancer is a disease that is caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The fate of this sexually transmitted infection is determined by long-term host-viral and host-environmental interactions. Given that the majority population of Han Chinese have a similarity in genetic makeup, and cultural and social systems, it is not surprising to see a common spectrum of type- or variant-specific HPV prevalence and risk for cervical cancer in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. These populations also share similar behavioral and environmental exposure risks, as well as genetic susceptibility to cervical cancer. In this post-genomic era, when the code, control and function of the human genome are being quickly unveiled, new genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for cervical cancer are emerging systemically and in an overwhelming way.

50849096413	Epidemiology of Human Papillomavirus Infection and Cervical Cancer and Future Perspectives in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan	Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan are three island states that are newly emerged affluent economic areas in Asia. The majority of the populations are ethnically Chinese with a total population of 6.98, 4.5 and 23 million, respectively. Cervical cancer has been declining over the last thirty years in all three states and is largely attributable to widespread opportunistic cervical cancer screening. The age-standardized incidence rates of cervical cancer are 9.6 per 100,000 women in Hong Kong in 2004, 10.6 per 100,000 women in Singapore in 2002 and 18.6 per 100,000 women in Taiwan in 2003. High prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) was observed in all three states. In cervical cancer, HPV 16 and 18 are the two most prevalent HPV types, but HPV 58 and 52 are also highly prevalent in these three states. Important epidemiological risk factors for invasive cervical cancer include smoking and age at sexual debut for women, although this is changing towards an earlier age. Of the three states, Taiwan was the first to have a comprehensive national screening programme in 1995 followed by Hong Kong in 2002 and Singapore in 2004. Women in these three states are well aware of cervical cancer and the preventative means by Pap smear screening, although their awareness and understanding of the role of HPV in cervical carcinogenesis is low. Prophylactic HPV vaccines have been licensed in the three states. Routine comprehensive public vaccination programme for adolescent girls has yet to be adopted by the governmental agency, despite an affirmative recommendation by medical professional bodies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

58249107838	Promoter methylation of SFRPs gene family in cervical cancer	Objectives: Oncogenic activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is common in human cancers, including cervical cancer. The secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) function as negative regulators of Wnt signaling and play an important role in carcinogenesis. Frequent promoter hypermethylation of SFRPs has been identified in human cancers; however, the precise role of SFRPs in cervical cancer is not clear. Methods: The methylation status of SFRPs gene family was analyzed in two cervical cancer cell lines and a full spectrum of cervical neoplasia, including 45 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 49 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 109 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and 45 normal controls. Results: The SFRP1 promoter was hypermethylated in 33.9% of SCC, 8.2% of HSIL, 2.2% of LSIL, but not in normal tissues. The SFRP2 promoter was hypermethylated in 80.7% of SCC, 16.3% of HSIL, 15.6% LSIL and 4.4% normal tissues. The SFRP4 promoter was hypermethylated in 67.9% of SCC, 36.7% of HSIL, 4.4% of LSIL, but not in normal tissues. The SFRP5 promoter was hypermethylated in 10.1% of SCC, 4.1% of HSIL, 13.3% of LSIL and 4.4% normal tissues. The frequency of SFRP1, SFRP2 and SFRP4 promoter methylation in tumors was significantly higher than in normal, LSIL, and HSIL samples (P < 0.0001). SFRP5 methylation was significantly different in patients with or without lymph-node metastases (0% vs 15.2%, respectively, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our data suggest that promoter hypermethylation of SFRP1, SFRP2 and SFRP4 is associated with cervical carcinogenesis, which could be used for molecular screening of cervical neoplasias in future. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

70349120416	Characterization of LMX-1A as a metastasis suppressor in cervical cancer	DNA methylation is important in cancer development and is a promising biomarker for cancer detection. An epigenomic approach used in our previous work showed that LMX-1A is methylation-silenced in cervical cancer. LMX-1A, a LIM-homeobox gene, is known to participate in developmental events; however, there are at present no data on the role of LMX-1A in cancers. In this study, we characterized the function of this transcription factor by examining cell lines, animal models and human cervical neoplastic tissues, and found that over-expression of LMX-1A does not affect cell proliferation or the cell cycle of cervical cancer cell lines but significantly inhibits colony formation and invasion in vitro. Analysis of changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as CDH1, CDH2, VIMENTIN, SNAIL, SLUG and TWIST, revealed involvement of the EMT in LMX-1A-mediated cancer invasion; this result was validated in a stable transfectant overexpressing LMX-1A with RNA interference. Xenograft studies using immunocompromised mice confirmed the suppressor effects of LMX-1A on tumour formation and distant metastasis in cervical cancer cell lines. LMX-1A immunohistochemical staining of tissue arrays containing the full spectrum of cervical neoplasms, including normal cervix, low-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), high-grade CIN, locally invasive and distant metastatic cancers, demonstrated the critical role of LMX-1A in invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we found by analysing TGFβ-BMP signalling that BMP4 and BMP6 are down-regulated by LMX-1A. The results of this study suggest that LMX-1A suppresses cancer invasion and metastasis in cervical cancer through an incomplete EMT.

71049140477	Field methylation silencing of the protocadherin 10 gene in cervical carcinogenesis as a potential specific diagnostic test from cervical scrapings	PCDH10 is a member of the protocadherin cell adhesion molecule family, which are frequently downregulated in cancers. This study aimed to characterize the methylation silencing of the PCDH10 gene in the full spectrum of cervical carcinogenesis and to clarify if a field effect of methylation might be a target for a diagnostic test from cervical scrapings. Methylation silencing of PCDH10 was found in four of five cervical cancers and one of two cervical precancerous cell lines, which could be reversed by demethylation treatment. The same methylation was detected in 85.7% (24/28) of invasive cancer tissues, 36.4% (4/11) of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 20% (1/5) of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and none (0/17) of the normal cervical tissues from non-cancer subjects. In addition, methylation was also frequently found in histologically 'normal' cervical tissues adjacent to cancer lesions (7/13, 53.8%) and, less frequently, in vaginal and endometrial tissues (1/8, 12.5%). Further investigation of cervical scrapings revealed cancer-specific methylation of PCDH10 with a methylation rate of 71% (22/31) in invasive cancer, 27.9% (12/43) in carcinoma in situ, and none in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions excluding carcinoma in situ (n = 12), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (n = 27), and normal controls (n = 66) (P < 10

0035020167	Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer with gynecologic malignancies: Report of two families in Taiwan	Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, is characterized by germline and somatic mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes with dominant inheritance of site-specific colorectal cancer or colorectal cancer plus cancers of extracolonic sites. We describe two Taiwanese HNPCC families with members who had predominantly gynecologic malignancies. In one family, the 53-year-old proband was found to have five synchronous and metachronous tumors of the genitourinary system, which included endometrial adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, ureteral and bladder transitional cell carcinoma, and ovarian teratoma. Fourteen of her first- and second-degree relatives were victims of genitourinary and gastrointestinal malignancies. The other family was characterized by four sisters who developed endometrial adenocarcinomas at young ages (36-42 yr). Their father died of both stomach cancer and colon cancer at age 47. The diagnosis of HNPCC was confirmed in this family by genetic analysis. A heterozygous germline mutation (G5 to G6 frame-shift at 183-187) of the hMSH2 (human MutS homolog 2) gene was identified in white blood cells of all the affected family members. The frequent presentation of genitourinary cancers in HNPCC highlights the importance of family-history taking in patients with gynecologic cancers and a genetic diagnosis of HNPCC.

0034796235	The significance of human papillomavirus viral load in prediction of histologic severity and size of squamous intraepithelial lesions of uterine cervix	Objectives. Persistence of high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical scrapes is responsible for the development, maintenance, and progression of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). Previous studies of viral load and histologic severity have ended with controversial results. This study evaluated the relationships of HPV viral load with size and histologic severity of cervical lesions, which has not been reported previously. Methods. By using Hybrid Capture II, DNA level of high-risk HPVs was determined in cervical scrapes and correlated with lesion size and histologic confirmation for 73 women referred for colposcopy. The lesion size was classified as nonvisible (n=12), small (≤2/5 of the 12× colposcopic visual filed, n=36), and large (>2/5 of the 12× field, n=25) lesions. The final disease status was categorized as high-grade SIL (HSIL)/squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (designated HSIL+) (n=32), low-grade SIL (LSIL) (n=19), and no detectable SIL (n=22). Results. A distinct upward trend of high-risk HPV DNA levels paralleled increasing size and histologic severity of cervical lesions (P=0.003 and 0.001, respectively). With respect to relative risk, women who had high viral load of HPV were at significantly greater risk for large lesion size (odds ratio [OR]=5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1-24.9) and HSIL+ (OR=35.0, 95% CI=4.2-294.5). Of particular note, the risk of developing large lesion size and HSIL+ significantly increased with increasing viral load of HPV (P values for trend test were 0.008 and 0.0004, respectively). In contrast, there were no significant associations of trend in viral load with risk in small lesion size and LSIL. Conclusions. The present study revealed that the effect of HPV infection on SIL development is highly influenced by high viral load and highlighted a potential application of viral load testing in predicting the size and severity of lesions of the uterine cervix. © 2001 Academic Press.

71849101810	Methylation of the long control region of HPV16 is related to the severity of cervical neoplasia	Objective: Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of cervical cancer. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands located at the long control region (LCR) of the HPV genome may regulate the expression of the major oncogenes E6 and E7, and may relate to cancer progression. The goal of the present study was to investigate the methylation patterns of CpG dinucleotides contained within the LCR of the HPV16 genome in a collection of clinical specimens comprising the full spectrum of cervical carcinogenesis. Study design: The status of LCR methylation was investigated in HPV16-infected cervical precancer and cancer cell lines, and in HPV16-infected low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of cervix (LSIL, n = 17), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL, n = 21) and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, n = 15) by bisulfite sequencing. Results: Among the three CpG islands of HPV16 LCR, methylation was found in three in the CaSki cell, in two upstream ones in SiHa cell, and none in the precancerous Z172 cell. Reactivation of E6 gene expression upon demethylation by 5-aza-dC and TSA treatments was noted in CaSki cells. In HPV-infected cervical specimens, progressive methylation of HPV16 LCR was noted, with rates of 5.9%, 33.3% and 53.3% in LSIL, HSIL and SCC, respectively (P < 0.01). A trend toward increasing density of CpG methylation was also noted. Topologically, more methylated sites were found at the E6/E7 promoter region in SCC, compared with LSIL and HSIL. Conclusion: The study disclosed downregulation of E6 gene transcription by LCR methylation in cervical cancer cells. Methylation of HPV 16 LCR is highly associated with severity of cervical neoplasm. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

77952277597	Quantitative analysis of methylation status of the PAX1 gene for detection of cervical cancer	Objective: Although aided by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test, early detection of cervical cancer is still a challenge. Hypermethylation of the paired boxed gene 1 (PAX1) was recently reported as a characteristic of cervical cancer. This study designed a quantitative measure of PAX1 methylation and compared its efficacy to the currently available Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV test in detection of cervical cancer. Methods: Using real-time quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, we measured the percentage of PAX1 methylation in cervical scrapings obtained from a hospital-based cohort of women with cervical neoplasia of different severities and compared the efficacy of diagnosis of cervical cancer to that of the HC2 HPV test. Results: From 73 cervical scrapings, with diagnoses of normal (n = 17), cervical intra-epithelial neoplasm 1 (CIN1; n = 10), CIN2 (n = 18), CIN3 (n = 14), and invasive cancer (n = 14), the percentage of PAX1 methylation was determined. The percent of methylated reference of invasive cancer (mean [SE], 56.7 [7.1]) was significantly higher than CIN3 (6.5 [2.3]) and the other milder lesions (1.0 [0.3]; P < 0.0001). At a cutoff percent of methylated reference value of 4.5, PAX1 methylation was found in 100% of invasive cancer tissue as compared with 0% of normal tissue, 10% of CIN1, 11% of CIN2, and 43% of CIN3 (P < 0.0001). As a comparison, the HC2 HPV test result was positive in 5.9% of normal tissue, 70% of CIN1, 55.6% of CIN2, 71.4% of CIN3, and 100% of invasive cancer. In addition to cancer tissue, methylation of PAX1 was also found in normal tissue adjacent to the cancer lesion (9/11, 82%) but much less in the remote normal tissues (2/5, 40%), indicating a field methylation. Conclusions: In this hospital-based study, quantitative measurement of PAX1 hyper-methylation in cervical scrapings is highly sensitive and is more specific than HC2 in detection of cervical cancer.

78649996806	Cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus DNA testing and Pap smear for cervical cancer screening in a publicly financed health-care system	Objective: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of different strategies for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing combined with Pap smear for cervical cancer screening in Taiwan. Methods: This study adopts a perspective of Department of Health in cost-effectiveness analysis to compare a no-screening strategy with nine different screening strategies. These strategies comprise three screening tools (Pap smear alone, HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage, and HPV DNA testing combined with Pap smear), and three screening intervals (annually, every 3 years, and every 5 years). Outcomes are life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. Results: When three times gross domestic product per capita is used as the decision threshold, all nine screening strategies were cost-effective compared with the no-screening strategy. Compared with the current screening strategy (an annual Pap smear), HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage every 5 years and every 3 years were cost-effective. Results of PSA also indicated that a HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage every 5 or every 3 years achieved the highest expected net benefits. Conclusions: Possible economic advantages are associated with extending the cervical cancer screening interval from one Pap smear annually to HPV DNA testing followed by Pap smear triage every 5 years with an ICER 1 247 000 per QALY gained, especially in a country with a publicly financed health-care system. © 2010 Cancer Research UK.

78650691991	Testing for methylated PCDH10 or WT1 is superior to the HPV test in detecting severe neoplasms (CIN3 or greater) in the triage of ASC-US smear results	OBJECTIVE: Management of equivocal Papanicolaou smear result remains to be challenging even with the aid of human papillomavirus test. Recently, 3 novel methylation-silenced genes, PAX1, WT1, and PCDH10, have been found to be specifically associated with cervical cancer. We compared the performances of methylation test of these genes with human papillomavirus tests in triage of equivocal Papanicolaou smear result. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred twenty-two women with Papanicolaou smear results of atypical cells of undetermined significance nested to a multicenter, nation-wide cohort (the T1899 cohort) were studied. Status of cervical neoplasm was diagnosed with colposcopic biopsy. Status of gene methylation was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. High-risk human papillomavirus DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction-reverse line blot hybridization and Hybrid Capture 2. RESULTS: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasm 1, cervical intraepithelial neoplasm 2, cervical intraepithelial neoplasm 3, carcinoma in situ, carcinoma, and normal cervix were diagnosed in 58, 17, 14, 10, 1, and 120 women, respectively. Methylation of PCDH10, WT1, and PAX1 was highly associated with the severity of cervical neoplasm (P < 10

79251566138	Parathyroid adenoma with hypertensive crisis and intracerebral hemorrhage mimicking hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome	Background: Hyperparathyroidism is seldom encountered during pregnancy. Moreover, when the disease does occur, it is typically masked until late pregnancy or after delivery. Case: A previously healthy multiparous woman presented with sudden-onset severe preeclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome at 37 weeks of gestation. Acute intracerebral hemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulapathy developed 24 hours after cesarean delivery and persisted after craniotomy. Hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism were noted, and imaging studies revealed parathyroid tumor. The patient recovered from severe preeclampsia after resection of a hemorrhagic parathyroid adenoma and was fully rehabilitated after 3 months. Conclusion: This patient exhibited a concealed hyperparathyroidism with acute hypertensive crisis, probably attributable to hemorrhagic parathyroid adenoma. The presentation mimics acute late-onset preeclampsia and requires vigilant diagnosis followed by surgery. © 2011 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

79952814434	Long-term persistence of human papillomavirus in environments	Objective: The possibility of its indirect transmission of human papillomavirus (HPV) via formites has been widely raised but with no biological proof. This study explored the durability of HPV16 pseudoviruses and native viruses in different environmental contamination scenarios. Methods: Pseudoviruses were mixed with PBS, cervico-vaginal secretion (CVS), or serum to simulate contamination by genital warts, vaginal discharge or menstruation, respectively, and subjected to in-vitro cell infection assay. The integrity of native HPV16 from CVS of infected women was detected by conformation-specific antibody. Results: In viruses exposed to PBS, a persistent infectivity of 30% was noted for at least 7 days. A similar persistence but lower (18%) infectivity was noted in those exposed to CVS. In serum-containing medium, the infection ratio rose initially, remained stable for three more days then rapidly decreased thereafter. Upon desiccation, infectivity was persistently low (10%). Finally, intact native HPV was detectable after 5 days of environmental exposure. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the high environmental survivability of HPV. However, survivability was lower in viruses exposed to CVS or desiccation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

79952625064	Enhanced differentiation and clonogenicity of human endometrial polyp stem cells	Endometrial polyps arise from endometrial overgrowth and may cause intermenstrual bleeding, irregular bleeding, and menorrhagia. In this study, endometrial polyps were harvested from hysterectomized specimens from 6 female patients not on hormone therapy. Endometrial polyp mesenchymal stem cells (EPMSCs) were isolated and characterized. Selected cells were spindle-shaped, and expressed surface markers CD90 and CD146. The EPMSCs proliferated actively in vitro. A colony-forming study demonstrates that EPMSCs had a colony-generating capacity. When cultured in a defined medium, EPMSCs can differentiate to osteoblast-, adipocyte-, and neuron-like cells. No telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression was noted. Experimental results demonstrate that EPMSCs are a population of mesenchymal progenitor cells existing in human endometrial polyps that are capable of proliferation, differentiation, and colonogenicity exceeding that of bone marrow stem cells and endometrial stromal cells. These EPMSCs may be an alternative resource of adult stem cells for future regenerative therapy. © 2010 International Society of Differentiation.

79956191768	Identification of human papillomavirus type 58 lineages and the distribution worldwide	Background. Human papillomavirus type 58 (HPV-58) accounts for a much higher proportion of cervical cancers in East Asia than other types. A classification system of HPV-58, which is essential for molecular epidemiological study, is lacking. Methods and results. This study analyzed the sequences of 401 isolates collected from 15 countries and cities. The 268 unique concatenated E6-E7-E2-E5-L1-LCR sequences that comprised 57% of the whole HPV-58 genome showed 4 distinct clusters. L1 and LCR produced tree topologies that best resembled the concatenated sequences and thus are the most appropriate surrogate regions for lineage classification. Moreover, short fragments from L1 (nucleotides 6014-6539) and LCR (nucleotides 7257-7429 and 7540-52) were found to contain sequence signatures informative for lineage identification. Lineage A was the most prevalent lineage across all regions. Lineage C was more frequent in Africa than elsewhere, whereas lineage D was more prevalent in Africa than in Asia. Among lineage A variants, sublineage A2 dominated in Africa, the Americas, and Europe, but not in Asia. Sublineage A1, which represents the prototype that originated from a patient with cancer, was rare worldwide except in Asia. Conclusions. HPV-58 can be classified into 4 lineages that show some degree of ethnogeographic predilection in distribution. The evolutionary, epidemiological, and pathological characteristics of these lineages warrant further study. © The Author 2011.

0036152772	Viral load of high-risk human papillomavirus in cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions	Objectives: This case-control study was conducted to investigate the role of viral load of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in the development of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and invasive cancers. Methods: A total of 30 female cases who had histological evidence of low-grade SIL (n = 10) or high-grade SIL and above (n = 20) were identified as the case group at the Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei between September 1998 and March 1999. In addition, 80 female controls who had normal cervical cytology were enrolled and individually matched on age (±5 years) and date of recruitment to each case. Cervical swabs collected from study subjects were tested for the positivity and viral load of high-risk HPVs by Hybrid Capture II assay. Additionally, subjects completed a risk factor questionnaire. Results: Among sex behavioral factors studied, younger age at first intercourse was associated with a significantly elevated risk of cervical SIL and invasive cancers. With respect to HPV infection, high-risk HPV DNA was present in 70% (21/30) of case and 21% (17/80) of control subjects, resulting in an odds ratio (OR) of 6.6 [95% confidence interval (C.I.) = 2.6-17.0]. Moreover, women who had a high viral load were at significantly greater risk for cervical SIL and invasive cancers than those who were infected with a low viral load (OR = 18.0, 95% C.I. = 3.0-108.5). Conclusions: Among the variables tested, infection with a high viral load of high-risk HPVs is the strongest determinant for cervical SIL and cervical cancers in Taiwan. © 2002 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

0036244746	A research-based tumor tissue bank of gynecologic oncology: Characteristics of nucleic acids extracted from normal and tumor tissues from different sites	This article describes a gynecology and pathology-oriented tumor tissue bank that is approaching the research requirements of modern molecular oncology and compared characteristics of nucleic acids extracted from preserved tissues. Through August 2000, 8869 specimens, including fresh neoplastic tissues and normal counterparts, body fluids (ascites, tumor content, and blood), and cervical scrapings, were procured from 1853 patients. DNA and RNA were extracted from a random sampling of normal (n = 50) and tumor (n = 53) tissues from the uterine cervix (n = 47), endometrium (n = 24), and ovary (n = 32). As expected, tumor tissues conferred a higher yield of DNA (1.56 ± 1.24 versus 0.94 ± 0.72 μg/mg tissue, P = 0.001) and RNA (5.04 ± 6.21 versus 2.12 ± 1.76 μg/ml, P < 0.001) than normal tissues. However, the RNA message abundance, as measured by RNA yield/DNA yield, was not different between tumor and normal tissues. With a similar content of DNA in the endometrium, uterine cervix, and ovary, RNA yield was higher in the endometrium than the others (P = 0.013). In tumors from these three sites, similar yields of DNA and RNA were noted. Overall the yield of DNA remained unchanged from specimens preserved for as long as 7 years, although at this length of storage, RNA yield became lower and variable. This study provides the basic characteristics of nucleic acids derived from normal and tumor tissues and ensures future research utility of these frozen specimens.

79959254950	Asia oceania guidelines for the implementation of programs for cervical cancer prevention and control	This paper aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for health professionals, to develop a comprehensive cervical cancer program for a clinic, a community, or a country. Ensuring access to healthcare is the responsibility of all societies, and the Asia Oceania Research Organisation in Genital Infections and Neoplasia (AOGIN) is committed to working collaboratively with governments and health professionals to facilitate prevention programs, to protect girls and women from cervical cancer, a disease that globally affects 500,000 and kills nearly 300,000 women annually, just over half of whom are in the Asia Oceania region. We share the vision that a comprehensive program of vaccination, screening, and treatment should be made accessible to all girls and women in the world. The primary purpose of these guidelines is to provide information on scientific evidence on the different modalities and approaches of cervical cancer prevention programs, for high resource and low resource settings. The secondary purpose is to provide an overview of the current situation of cervical cancer control and prevention in various Asian Oceania countries: their views of an ideal program, identified obstacles, and suggestions to overcome them are discussed.

80051996846	Internal Pudendal Artery Injury during Prolapse Surgery Using Nonanchored Mesh	Herein is presented the case of a patient with stage 2 uterine prolapse treated surgically using nonanchored mesh. Complications were internal pudendal artery injury and a massive presacral hematoma that formed after surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed immediately, and the bleeding stopped. The patient subsequently experienced difficulty micturating and defecating because of presacral hematoma compression. Self-micturation and defecation capabilities were regained gradually at approximately 1 week after surgery. The hematoma resolved completely by 71 days postoperatively. Comprehensive knowledge of pelvic anatomy is important when performing surgery to treat prolapse using mesh kits. Removing the mesh and prophylactic antibiotic therapy is a means of conservatively managing a pelvic hematoma caused by prolapse surgery. © 2011 AAGL.

84864008379	Methylomic analysis identifies frequent DNA methylation of Zinc Finger protein 582 (ZNF582) in cervical neoplasms	Background: Despite of the trend that the application of DNA methylation as a biomarker for cancer detection is promising, clinically applicable genes are few. Therefore, we looked for novel hypermethylated genes for cervical cancer screening. Methods and Findings: At the discovery phase, we analyzed the methylation profiles of human cervical carcinomas and normal cervixes by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled to promoter tiling arrays (MeDIP-on-chip). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP), quantitative MSP and bisulfite sequencing were used to verify the methylation status in cancer tissues and cervical scrapings from patients with different severities. Immunohistochemical staining of a cervical tissue microarray was used to confirm protein expression. We narrowed to three candidate genes: DBC1, PDE8B, and ZNF582; their methylation frequencies in tumors were 93%, 29%, and 100%, respectively. At the pre-validation phase, the methylation frequency of DBC1 and ZNF582 in cervical scraping correlated significantly with disease severity in an independent cohort (n = 330, both P<0.001). For the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) and worse, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ZNF582 was 0.82 (95% confidence interval = 0.76-0.87). Conclusions: Our study shows ZNF582 is frequently methylated in CIN3 and worse lesions, and it is demonstrated as a potential biomarker for the molecular screening of cervical cancer. © 2012 Huang et al.

0037427836	Single nucleotide polymorphism at Fas promoter is associated with cervical carcinogenesis	The causal role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis is beyond reasonable questioning. The progression from HPV infection, squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) to squamous cell carcinomata (SCC), however, is very uncommon and inefficient. Host genetic factors that may confer the susceptibility of disease progression are largely unknown. Apoptosis is an important fail-safe check for tumor development, in which Fas/FasL interaction contributes substantially. The purpose of our study is to test the hypothesis that an A/G polymorphism at -670 of Fas promoter with different transcriptional activity is associated with the risk for cervical neoplasia. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted, in which 104 patients of low grade SIL (LSIL), 131 high grade SIL (HSIL) and 176 SCC as well as age-matched, 1:1 controls were tested for Fas polymorphism by PCR-RFLP. HPV genotypes were determined in case groups by MY PCR-reverse line blot. The frequency of A allele was significantly (p = 0.006) higher in SCC than in control, conferring an odd ratio of 1.5 (95% Cl = 1.1-2.0). The distribution of Fas (-670) genotypes also differed significantly between HSIL, SCC and each of their control (p = 0.017 and 0.03, respectively), with the A/A genotype conferring an OR of 1.3 (95% Cl = 1.1-1.6) and 1.6 (95% Cl = 1.0-2.5), respectively. Remarkably, the frequency of A allele and A/A genotype increased gradually in accordance with the multi-step carcinogenesis from LSIL, HSIL to SCC (P

84871735844	Achieving oocyte survival and stable spindles after vitrification using closed pulled straws regardless of zona status	Embryo cryopreservation is a well-established technique at in vitro fertilization centers but the best protocol for vitrification of oocytes and zona manipulation remains inconclusive. This study aimed to determine if the closed pulled straws (CPS) method and zona drilling for vitrification provide a higher survival rate for thawed oocytes. Materials and Methods: Female MF1 mice were superovulated by injection of gonadotropins. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were derived from excised fallopian tubes and the oocytes were divided into the following three groups: (1) one-hole zona drilling by laser, (n = 40); (2) intact zona (n = 48); and (3) zona digestion by pronase (n = 43). The control group consisted of 40 nonvitrified oocytes. After thawing, surviving oocytes were stained for spindles and chromosomes after 1-hour and 3-hour incubations, and compared to controls. Results: There were no significant differences in the survival rates among Groups 1 (34/40, 85%), 2 (34/48, 71%), and 3 (30/43, 70%), but there were significant differences compared with the control oocytes (100%). After 1-hour and 3-hour incubations, vitrified oocytes in the three groups did not have significantly fewer normal spindles than the controls (1 hour: Group 1, 70.5%; Group 2, 64.7%; and Group 3, 66.6% vs. control 90%). There was also no significant difference in the percentage of oocytes with a normal spindle shape between the 1-hour and 3-hour recovery times (3 hours: Group 1, 88.2%; Group 2, 88.2%; and Group 3, 80%; control, 95%). Conclusions: The zona pellucidum with CPS method has no effect on spindle injury and oocyte survival. Sufficient culture time for the recovery of the meiotic spindle is imperative for fertilization of vitrified oocytes. A CPS vitrified oocyte has the advantages of high survival and preserved good spindles. © 2012 .

84871978571	Epigenetic silencing of PTPRR activates MAPK signaling, promotes metastasis and serves as a biomarker of invasive cervical cancer	Epigenetic modifications are a driving force in carcinogenesis. However, their role in cancer metastasis remains poorly understood. The present study investigated the role of DNA methylation in the cervical cancer metastasis. Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference. Using methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis, we found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) was silenced through DNMT3B-mediated methylation in the cervical cancer. PTPRR inhibited p44/42 MAPK signaling, the expression of the transcription factor AP1, human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6/E7 and DNMTs. The methylation status of PTPRR increased in cervical scrapings (n=358) in accordance with disease severity, especially in invasive cancer. Methylation of the PTPRR promoter has an important role in the metastasis and may be a biomarker of invasive cervical cancer. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84875598264	Geographical distribution and oncogenic risk association of human papillomavirus type 58 E6 and E7 sequence variations	Human papillomavirus (HPV) 58 accounts for a notable proportion of cervical cancers in East Asia and parts of Latin America, but it is uncommon elsewhere. The reason for such ethnogeographical predilection is unknown. In our study, nucleotide sequences of E6 and E7 genes of 401 HPV58 isolates collected from 15 countries/cities across four continents were examined. Phylogenetic relationship, geographical distribution and risk association of nucleotide sequence variations were analyzed. We found that the E6 genes of HPV58 variants were more conserved than E7. Thus, E6 is a more appropriate target for type-specific detection, whereas E7 is more appropriate for strain differentiation. The frequency of sequence variation varied geographically. Africa had significantly more isolates with E6-367A (D86E) but significantly less isolates with E6-203G, -245G, -367C (prototype-like) than other regions (p ≤ 0.003). E7-632T, -760A (T20I, G63S) was more frequently found in Asia, and E7-793G (T74A) was more frequent in Africa (p < 0.001). Variants with T20I and G63S substitutions at E7 conferred a significantly higher risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III and invasive cervical cancer compared to other HPV58 variants (odds ratio = 4.44, p = 0.007). In conclusion, T20I and/or G63S substitution(s) at E7 of HPV58 is/are associated with a higher risk for cervical neoplasia. These substitutions are more commonly found in Asia and the Americas, which may account for the higher disease attribution of HPV58 in these areas. Copyright © 2012 UICC.

84881023988	Cervicovaginal secretions protect from human papillomavirus infection: Effects of vaginal douching	Objective: Cervicovaginal secretions (CVSs) are reported to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Although vaginal douching is known to clear both viral inoculants and CVSs, its effect on CVSs in women with HPV infection is unknown. Materials and Methods: The invitro HPV pseudovirus infection system was used to test the protective activity of CVSs against HPV infection in samples collected before and after vaginal douching. To simulate different time points of vaginal douching in relation to viral exposure, the cell CVS reconstitute was washed after different viral exposure durations. Results: In the CVSs of premenopausal and postmenopausal women who did not perform douching, the CVSs inhibited HPV infection by 56.7±1.8% and 53.6±2.5%, respectively; in women who had performed douching, the CVSs inhibited HPV infection by only 31.2±7.1%, which was significantly lower (p < 0.01). Cell washing effectively cleared 60-90% of the infectious load with the greatest activity occurring within 30 minutes after inoculation. In the presence of CVSs, a sustained inhibition of HPV infection existed for up to 8 hours after HPV exposure, and cell washing increased the clearance to up to 82-93% of the infectious load. Conclusion: This study confirms the protective activity of CVSs against HPV infection regardless of age. In this invitro study, the net effect of douching was found to be beneficial. © 2013, Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

84881552840	High seroprevalence of human herpesvirus type 8 in patients with end-stage renal disease in Taiwan	Background: Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) is the aetiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The incidence of KS in renal transplant patients is much higher than in healthy controls. The risk is even higher among recipients seropositive for HHV-8 before transplantation. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are immunocompromised and are candidates for renal transplantation, but HHV-8 seroprevalence in ESRD patients has not been well documented. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate HHV-8 seroprevalence in ESRD patients in a cohort in Taiwan. Study design: Blood samples collected from 149 ESRD patients and 149 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analysed for HHV-8 antibody with immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for HHV-8 DNA with polymerase chain reaction. Results: Seropositivity and titres for HHV-8 antibodies with IFA as well as seropositivity with ELISA were significantly greater in ESRD patients than in healthy controls ( P= 0.006, 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Patients with a history of taking herbal medicine had significantly greater ELISA positivity than those without such a history ( P= 0.004). ELISA positives, particularly patients, had much higher IFA antibody titres than ELISA negatives ( P<. 0.0001). Seropositivity in ESRD patients was not related to lymphopaenia, monocytosis, dialysis duration or a history of transfusion. Two diabetic ESRD patients were positive for HHV-8 DNA. Conclusions: ESRD patients had significantly greater HHV-8 seropositivity than healthy controls in Taiwan. This association seems to be related to the geographic location of the cohort and invites further studies for the early association of HHV-8 infection in ESRD patients and risk for KS. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84883678393	Human adipose-derived stem cells cultured in keratinocyte serum free medium: Donor's age does not affect the proliferation and differentiation capacities	Background: Although donor age-related effects of characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), such as a decrease in the proliferation and differentiation capacity and an increase of senescence and apoptosis, are evident, such effects are generally less prominent in adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). Using a hormone and growth factor rich medium (KFSM), this study cultured ASC from abdominal subcutaneous fat of 27 adult females in three age groups: 30-39 y, 40-49 y and 50-60 y, and investigated the growth and differentiation characteristics. Results: The derived ASC had an immunophenotype similar to that of bone marrow derived MSC (BMSC). They could be stably expanded with an average population doubling time of 21.5 ± 2.3 h. Other than a higher pre-adipogenic commitment and a lower adipogenic differentiation capability in ASC derived from the old age group, other characteristics including proliferation rate, doubling time, telomere length, as well as the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation capacity were the same regardless of the donor's age. Conclusions: The study demonstrates a promising proliferation and differentiation capabilities of ASC regardless of the donor's age. The compromised adipogenic potential in the older donors could be a benefit for their application in regeneration therapy. © 2013 Ding et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84884588997	High success rate and considerable adverse events of pelvic prolapse surgery with Prolift: A single center experience	Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze short-term outcomes of pelvic prolapse surgery using Prolift transvaginal mesh in a teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four patients who received prolapse surgery with Prolift were followed up for 7-26 months. Assessment included pre- and postoperative Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) stage, and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI)-6, and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ)-7 scores. Surgical characteristics and adverse events during follow-up were also recorded. Results: Objective and subjective data were available for 29 patients. The overall anatomical success rate was 96.5 % (28/29) after a mean of 18±6.3 months follow-up. The POP-Q, UDI, and IIQ all improved significantly after surgery. Uterine sparing prolapsed surgery with Prolift unexpectedly yielded a cure rate of 100%. Ten adverse events occurred during and after prolapse surgery with dyspareunia (3/34) as the most common, followed by bladder injury (2/34). Conclusions: Prolapse surgery with Prolift yielded a good anatomical outcome and satisfactory symptom improvement at different periods of follow-up, especially in uterus-sparing prolapse surgery. However, adverse events were not uncommon, and patients should be fully informed of all possible adverse events prior to surgery. © 2013.

84889087598	The fallopian tube is the culprit and an accomplice in type II ovarian cancer: A review	Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the world. The origin or the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer is poorly understood, which often leads to failure of early detection. Development of a new approach to reduce mortality is urgent. The fallopian tubes were once seen as an extremely rare site for cancer, but increasing evidence now suggests that they could be involved in initiation of the most aggressive ovarian carcinoma. As a result of evolution to prevent ectopic pregnancy, not only is the fallopian tube "poor soil" for carcinogenesis, but angiogenesis is also inhibited there. However, every cycle of ovulation results in changes in which tubal epithelial cells are dislodged and implanted on the denuded surface of the ovary, resulting in the formation of an inclusion cyst. This is the very beginning of serous ovarian carcinogenesis. To prevent ovarian cancer, a salpingectomy might be recommended during hysterectomy because this procedure can effectively reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer. Application of these new concepts will allow for a more rational approach to screening, treatment, and prevention, which could potentially have a significant impact in reducing mortality from this devastating disease. © 2013.

84899423384	Methylomics analysis identifies epigenetically silenced genes and implies an activation of β-catenin signaling in cervical cancer	Using DNA methylation biomarkers in cancer detection is a potential direction in clinical testing. Some methylated genes have been proposed for cervical cancer detection; however, more reliable methylation markers are needed. To identify new hypermethylated genes in the discovery phase, we compared the methylome between a pool of DNA from normal cervical epithelium (n = 19) and a pool of DNA from cervical cancer tissues (n = 38) using a methylation bead array. We integrated the differentially methylated genes with public gene expression databases, which resulted in 91 candidate genes. Based on gene expression after demethylation treatment in cell lines, we confirmed 61 genes for further validation. In the validation phase, quantitative MSP and bisulfite pyrosequencing were used to examine their methylation level in an independent set of clinical samples. Fourteen genes, including ADRA1D, AJAP1, COL6A2, EDN3, EPO, HS3ST2, MAGI2, POU4F3, PTGDR, SOX8, SOX17, ST6GAL2, SYT9, and ZNF614, were significantly hypermethylated in CIN3+ lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of POU4F3 for detecting CIN3+ lesions were 0.88, 0.82, and 0.85, respectively. A bioinformatics function analysis revealed that AJAP1, EDN3, EPO, MAGI2, and SOX17 were potentially implicated in β-catenin signaling, suggesting the epigenetic dysregulation of this signaling pathway during cervical cancer development. The concurrent methylation of multiple genes in cancers and in subsets of precancerous lesions suggests the presence of a driver of methylation phenotype in cervical carcinogenesis. Further validation of these new genes as biomarkers for cervical cancer screening in a larger population-based study is warranted. What's New? The identification of novel genes that are hypermethylated in cancer and precancerous lesions is needed in order to achieve a better sensitivity and specificity in cervical cancer screening. Using a genome-wide approach, here the authors identified 14 genes that were frequently hypermethylated in CIN3+ and might thus become useful biomarkers in future molecular cervical cancer screening. A bioinformatics function analysis revealed that five of these genes were potentially implicated in β-catenin signaling, suggesting the epigenetic dysregulation of Wnt signaling during cervical cancer development. The concurrent hypermethylation of multiple genes also suggests the involvement of a CpG island methylator phenotype. © 2013 UICC.

84901008745	Crosstalk with cancer-associated fibroblasts increases the growth and radiation survival of cervical cancer cells	Crosstalk between cancer cells and the surrounding cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) plays an illusive role in cancer radiotherapy. This study investigated the effect of cancer cell-cancer associated fibroblasts crosstalk on the proliferation and survival of irradiated cervical cancer cells. A pretreatment with conditioned medium from a mixed culture of CAF and HeLa cells (mixCAF) had a stronger effect on enhancing the proliferation and survival of irradiated HeLa cells compared to pretreatment with CAF conditioned medium alone. In addition, pretreatment with a mixed culture of CAF and HeLa cells conditioned medium reduced the levels of two major radiation-induced genes, GADD45 and BTG2, and phosphorylation of p38. Profiling of the growth and survival factors in the conditioned medium revealed PDGF and VEGF, and IGF2, EGF, FGF-4, IGFBPs and GM-CSF to be specifically secreted from HeLa cells and CAFs, respectively. This study demonstrated radiation protective effects of CAF-cancer cell crosstalk, and identified multiple growth factors and radiation response genes that might be involved in these effects. © 2014 by Radiation Research Society.

84904263339	Repression of miR-126 and upregulation of adrenomedullin in the stromal endothelium by cancer-stromal cross talks confers angiogenesis of cervical cancer	miR-126 is an endothelial-specific microRNA essential for maintaining vessel integrity during development. Its role of tumor angiogenesis in cancer stroma is unclear. This study investigated the temporal and spatial expression and the role of miR-126 in the course of cervical carcinogenesis. miR-126 was found to be mainly expressed in the stromal endothelium of the uterine cervix. This downregulation was recapitulated in a cell coculture model, wherein cross talk of cervical cancer cells and fibroblasts induced a downregulation of miR-126 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, with consequent increase of tube formation. Coinjection of cancer-associated fibroblasts of human cervix enhanced tumorigenesis of cervical cancer cells, with an increase of microvessel density and dye retention in the tumor vasculature. In association with angiogenesis, host-originated miR-126 in these xenograft tumors was progressively downregulated, whereas supplement of the miR-126 precursor in the coinjection suppressed angiogenesis and tumor growth. A proangiogenic gene adrenomedullin (ADM), which was found to be upregulated in the stroma of cervical cancer and which localized mainly in the blood and lymphatic vessels, was identified as a target of inhibition by miR-126 at the carcinoma in situ-to-invasion stage. The study suggests a cancer stroma cross talk induced repression of miR-126 and upregulation of ADM, and probably other proangiogenic factors, to facilitate angiogenesis and invasion growth of cervical cancer. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84904107608	PAX1/SOX1 DNA methylation and cervical neoplasia detection: A Taiwanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (TGOG) study	We aimed to determine whether PAX1/SOX1 methylation could be translated to clinical practice for cervical neoplasia detection when used alone and in combination with current cytology-based Pap screening. We conducted a multicenter case-control study in 11 medical centers in Taiwan from December 2009 to November 2010. Six hundred seventy-six patients were included in the analysis, including 330 in the training set and 346 in the testing set. Multiplex quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with a TaqMan probe system using a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche). The level of human papilloma virus (HPV) was analyzed using a Hybrid Capture 2 system (Digene). Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to obtain the best cutoff values from the training data set. The sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies were validated in the testing set. The sensitivities for methylated (<sup>m</sup>) PAX1<sup>m</sup> and SOX1<sup>m</sup> and HPV testing for detecting CIN3<sup>+</sup> lesions were 0.64, 0.71, and 0.89, and the specificities were 0.91, 0.77, and 0.68, respectively. Combined parallel testing of PAX1<sup>m</sup>/SOX1<sup>m</sup> tests with Pap smearing showed superior specificity (0.84/0.71 vs. 0.66, respectively) and similar sensitivity (0.93/0.96 vs. 0.97) to the combination of Pap smear results and HPV testing. Thus, combined parallel testing using Pap smears and PAX1 or SOX1 methylation tests may provide better performance than a combination of Pap smears with HPV testing in detection for cervical neoplasia. © 2014 The Authors.

84907191169	Geographical Distribution and Risk Association of Human Papillomavirus Genotype 52-Variant Lineages	Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype 52 is commonly found in Asian cases of cervical cancer but is rare elsewhere. Analysis of 611 isolates collected worldwide revealed a remarkable geographical distribution, with lineage B predominating in Asia (89.0% vs 0%-5.5%; P<inf>corrected</inf> <. 001), whereas lineage A predominated in Africa, the Americas, and Europe. We propose that the name "Asian lineage" be used to denote lineage B, to signify this feature. Preliminary analysis suggested a higher disease risk for lineage B, although ethnogeographical confounders could not be excluded. Further studies are warranted to verify whether the reported high attribution of disease to HPV52 in Asia is due to the high prevalence of lineage B.

0442295159	The Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase 677C→T Polymorphism and Lung Cancer Risk in a Chinese Population	Background: We examined the relationship of the MTHFR C677T genotype with the risk of lung cancer in a nested case-control study conducted in a cancer screening follow-up study in Taiwan. Materials and Methods: A total of 59 histologically confirmed lung cancer cases and 232 cancer-free controls were recruited between July 1990 and December 2000. The MTHFR C677T genotype was determined by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Results: The MTHFR 677T variant genotype, including 677CT and 677TT, was observed in 39% of cases and 47% of controls. The resultant adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.39-1.30). The inverse association of the MTHFR 677T variant genotype with lung cancer risk was apparent in both smokers and nonsmokers. Conclusion: These results suggest that the MTHFR 677T variant genotype reduces the risk of lung cancer. Larger studies incorporating dietary folate intake and the variant genotypes are needed to clarify our results.

11944249678	Genetic polymorphism of the interferon-γ gene in cervical carcinogenesis	Beyond human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, host genetic factors may contribute to cervical carcinogenesis. This study aims to test the hypothesis that CA-dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the first intron of the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) gene is associated with HPV-initiated cervical carcinogenesis. A hospital-based case-control study including patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs; n = 93), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs; n = 123) and invasive carcinomas (n = 153) of the uterine cervix, as well as 1:1 age-matched controls, was conducted. The IFN-γ genotype was determined by PCR and capillary electrophoresis with internal standards. HPV genotype was determined by consensus PCR and reverse line blot hybridization. Genotypes containing the 12 or 14 allele (12 or 14 CA repeats) were significantly more common in patients with HSILs than in controls (46% vs. 22%; OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.7-5.2; p < 0.0001). In contrast, genotypes containing 13 and 18 were significantly more common in controls than in patients with HSILs (76% vs. 53%; OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.2-0.6; p = 0.0001) or squamous cell carcinomas (74% vs. 63%; OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4-1.0; p = 0.037).

12344277471	Matrix metalloproteinase 1 gene polymorphism as a prognostic predictor of invasive cervical cancer	Whereas human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major determinant of cervical carcinogenesis, host genetic factors may confer individual susceptibility and prognosis. Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) is an important modulator of carcinogenesis. A guanine insertion (2G) polymorphism at nucleotide -1607 of the MMP-1 gene promoter creates an Ets-1-binding site, which increases transcription activity. The present study investigates the association between MMP-1 polymorphism and cervical neoplasia, and their prognostic significance. In this study, the MMP-1 polymorphism was assessed in 135 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and 197 invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and in age-matched controls, by capillary electrophoresis. The association of clinicopathological factors and HPV status with MMP-1 genotypes was tested. Frequencies of the 2G allele in HSIL and SCC were 64% and 65%, respectively, which did not differ significantly from control values (66% and 64%, respectively). The 2G allele was associated with advanced stages of disease (P = 0.03), whereas the G allele was more common in patients with regional lymph node metastases (P = 0.02). The survival time in patients with the heterozygous genotype G/2G (median, 55.3 months) was significantly longer than those with either the G/G (50.3 months) or 2G/2G genotype (43.9 months) (P = 0.02). No significant correlation between HPV status and MMP-1 genotype was identified. The genetic polymorphisms of MMP-1 are not associated with the risk of HSIL and SCC, but with the invasiveness and prognosis of SCC. The heterozygous genotype of MMP-1 can be used as a prognostic marker in patients with invasive cervical cancer. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
