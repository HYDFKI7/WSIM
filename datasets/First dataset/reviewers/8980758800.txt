26844577674	Cooperative co-evolutionary differential evolution for function optimization	The differential evolution (DE) is a stochastic, population-based, and relatively unknown evolutionary algorithm for global optimization that has recently been successfully applied to many optimization problems. This paper presents a new variation on the DE algorithm, called the cooperative coevolutionary differential evolution (CCDE). CCDE adopts the cooperative coevolutionary architecture, which was proposed by Potter and had been successfully applied to genetic algorithm, to improve significantly the performance of the DE. Such improvement is achieved by partitioning a high-dimensional search space by splitting the solution vectors of DE into smaller vectors, then using multiple cooperating subpopulations (or smaller vectors) to co-evolve subcomponents of a solution. Applying the new DE algorithm to on 11 benchmark functions, we show that CCDE has a marked improvement in performance over the traditional DE and cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33746536673	An approach to constructing isomorphic or non-isomorphic layout pattern	Difficulty in solving Packing problem lies in combinatorial explosion of the given scale. How to relax combinatorial explosion has been much concerned in academic and engineering fields. Numerical experiments show that initial layout points (layout pattern) considerably affect solution quality and computational efficiency, when layout problems are solved using deterministic-search algorithms (e.g. Mathematical Programming).

34548804857	A new approach to ocular operation planning based on improved mixture of experts neural networks	The important application of neuro-ensembles is the decomposition of problems. Most problems are too complicated for a single individual to solve. Divide-and-Conquer has proved to be efficient in many of these complex situations. How to divide the problem into simpler tasks, to assign individuals to solve these subtasks and how to synthesize the whole system back together is the key. The ensemble method called Mixture of Experts (ME), based on the Divide-and-Conquer principle was proposed. In their method, instead of assigning a set of combinational weights to the experts, an extra gating component is used to compute these weights dynamically from the inputs. An improved ME model provides a modular approach wherein component neural networks are made specialists on subparts of a problem. This paper studied the application of improved ME variants to multivariate nonlinear systems of clinical decision problems, which are known to be difficult to be dealt with.

This algorithm model consists of a PSO-based main population space and a knowledge space, which respectively has its own population to evolve independently and parallel. The lower level main population space (PSO population) contributes elite individuals to the upper level space (knowledge population) periodically, and the upper level space continually evolves these elite individuals and then contributes elite individuals to the lower level space. The mechanism of dual evolution and dual promotion improves the population diversity, and avoids premature.

The scatter search framework is flexible and allows the development of alternative implementations for different problems. We empirically study the coordinate transformation-based diversification method and the reference set update method on the basis of two dissimilarities. We present two approaches using a scatter search framework. One only uses the gradient descent algorithm as the improvement method, so-called basic scatter search. The other, socalled hybrid scatter search, adopts gradient descent and Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm to improve the trial solution generated at two different stages. We attempt to determine the efficiency and efficacy of two variants of scatter search. Case studies show that the experimental results are either superior or comparable to the best known published results.

In this study, we focus on the problem of chunk retrieval and packing with given style, topic and content of practical writing. We proposed the concept of chunk, and discussed the method of chunk retrieval in context. Then we studied the approach of chunk packing. Differ from general packing problem, chunk packing is affected by several special factors: stylistic features, writing model, literal semantic and etc. These require the intelligence of human. Thus our chunk packing approach is based on manmachine cooperation genetic algorithm.

51649098808	Visualization enhancement of arthrosis tissues structure in ultrasound image based on improved diffusion	Structure visualization and identification for ultrasound (US) arthral structure images is essential in US-guided arthrosis operation and diagnosis for arthrosis disorder. US imaging can image arthrosis tissues and cartilaginous, but it often depicts the structure poorly, because of speckle, reverberation, shadowing feature and other artifacts. The enhancement of arthrosis structure visualization remains great challenge in US images. This paper proposes an improved diffusion to remove reverberation noise, smoothing speckles and improve the visualization of arthrosis structure in US images. The structure tensor from automatic detection is applied to keep edges structure. The potential of the method is demonstrated with the results compared to nonlinear diffusion. The preliminary results show that improved diffusion is a robust method to enhance surfaces visualization of US arthrosis structure. The method shows promise in a clinical application of arthrosis operation planning and arthrosis diagnosis. © 2008 IEEE.

The ACOSS algorithm combines a local search strategy, ant colony optimization (ACO), and a scatter search (SS) in an iterative process. In this process, ACO first searches the solution space and generates activity lists to provide the initial population for the SS algorithm. Then, the SS algorithm builds a reference set from the pheromone trails of the ACO, and improves these to obtain better solutions. Thereafter, the ACO uses the improved solutions to update the pheromone set. Finally in this iteration, the ACO searches the solution set using the new pheromone trails after the SS has terminated. In ACOSS, ACO and the SS share the solution space for efficient exchange of the solution set. The ACOSS algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms using a set of standard problems available in the literature.

72749091123	Feature extracting of weak signal in real-time sleeping EEG with approximate entropy and bispectrum analysis	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most important neuroelectrical signals and is often used to detect brain's neuroelectrical dysfunction. However, the analysis of the EEG signal and extraction of features from it has been a challenging task due to the complexity and variability. It is diffcult to recognize different stages of the real-time sleeping EEG signal from single EEG signal automatically. In our study, the features were extracted from single sleeping EEG signal of rats using approximate entropy (ApEn) combined with bispectrum analysis. The results show that ApEn and the maximal amplitude of bispectrum can extract various features in different sleeping EEG stages. The bispectrum can detect the phase coupling among different stages in sleeping EEG signal. The ApEn with change of bispectrum's frequency and maximal amplitude of bispectrum can be effectively applied to automatically compartmentalize real-time sleeping EEG signal into different stages, which is significant to automatic EEG analyze and intelligent diagnose of brain diseases. The results also provide a new way of features extraction for other non-stationary signals in real time. ©2009 IEEE.

74549169911	Cooperative co-evolutionary scatter search for satellite module layout design	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to tackle a satellite module layout design problem (SMLDP). As a complex engineering layout and combinatorial optimization problem, SMLDP cannot be solved effectively by traditional exact methods. Although evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown some promise of tackling SMLDP in previous work, the solution quality and computational efficiency still pose a challenge. This paper aims to address these two issues. Design/methodology/approach - Scatter search (SS) and a cooperative co-evolutionary architecture are integrated to form a new approach called a cooperative co-evolutionary scatter search (CCSS). The cooperative co-evolutionary architecture is characterized by the decomposition and cooperation for dealing with complex engineering problems. SS is a flexible meta-heuristic method that can effectively solve the combinatorial optimization problems. Designing the elements of SS is context-dependent. Considering the characteristics of SMLDP, our work focuses on two folds: the diversification method, and the reference set update method. The diversification method is built on the method of coordinate transformation and the controlled randomness. The reference set is updated by the static method on the basis of two dissimilarities. Two test problems for circles packing illustrated the capacity of SS. However, when solving SMLDP, SS shows some limitations in the computational time and quality. This study adopts divide-conquer-coordination strategy to decompose SMLDP into several layout sub-problems. Then CCSS is applied to cooperatively solve these sub-problems. The experimental results illustrate the capability of the proposed approach in tackling the complex problem with less computational effort. Findings - Applying CCSS to SMLDP can obtain satisfying solutions in terms of quality and computational efficiency. This contrasts with the limiting experimental results of SMLDP with some approaches (including modified SS). Originality/value - A new CCSS is proposed to provide an effective and efficient way of solving SMLDP. Some elements of SS are improved to address the layout problem. SMLDP is decomposed into several sub-problems that can be solved cooperatively by CCSS after its characteristics are taken into consideration. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The mechanism of cutterhead cutting rock is complex and the cutterhead needs to be adaptable and designed for specific rock characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to make full use of successful experiences and data accumulated in TBM cutterhead design. A case-based reasoning approach is proposed for TBM cutterhead principal parameter design. The representation of cutterhead design case is given. According to the characteristics of local attributes in each case, the calculation method of local similarities are provided correspondingly. For the local attribute whose value is at interval, an interval similarity calculation method is presented on the basis of attribute value probability distribution in the interval range.

77953081561	A Dual-system variable-grain cooperative coevolutionary algorithm: Satellite-module layout design	The layout design of complex engineering systems (such as satellite-module layout design) is very difficult to solve in polynomial time. This is not only a complex coupled system design problem but also a special combinatorial problem. The fitness function for this problem is characterized as multimodal because of interference constraints among layout components (objects), etc. This characteristic can easily result in premature convergence when solving this problem using evolutionary algorithms. To deal with the above two problems simultaneously, we propose a dual-system framework based on the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (CCEA, e.g., cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm) like multidisciplinary design optimization. The proposed algorithm has the characteristic of solving the complex coupled system problem, increasing the diversity of population, and decreasing the premature convergence. The basis for the proposed algorithm is as follows. The original coupled system P is decomposed into several subsystems according to its physical structure. The system P is duplicated as systems A and B, respectively. The A system is solved on a global level (all-in-one), whereas the solving of B system is realized through the computation of its subsystems in parallel. The individual migration between A and B is implemented through the individual migration between their corresponding subsystems. To reduce the computational complexity produced additionally by the dual-systems A and B, we employ a variable-grain model of design variables. During the process of optimization, the two systems A and B gradually approximate to the original system P, respectively. The above-proposed algorithm is called the dual-system variable-grain cooperative coevolution algorithm (DVGCCEA) or Oboe-CCEA. The numerical experimental results of a simplified satellite-module layout design case show that the proposed algorithm can obtain better robustness and trade-off between computational precision and computational efficiency. © 2006 IEEE.

Generally, the design history-based parametric modeling approach is often adopted to exchange models; however, the size of each translator that exchanges the feature and parametric information tends to be large. Meanwhile, it is necessary to generate an internal explicit model for geometric modeling kernel when the translators use procedural model as neutral files. To overcome above-mentioned problems, this study presents a so-called MidCAD platform for CAD data sharing integration. The proposed platform separates the translator from the neutral files such that translators of different commercial CAD systems interact only with MidCAD. This study adopts Microsoft developed Automation APIs to implement the communication between MidCAD and commercial CAD systems. The source CAD model is translated to XML macro files by the translator using Automation APIs of MidCAD, or the XML macro files are translated into the target CAD system model.

84555170325	Satellite payloads configuration and layout design using coevolutionary algorithm	Satellite payloads configuration and layout design (SPCLD) is an important part of satellite overall design based on common satellite platform. Satellite payloads configuration and layout are two coupled and iterative design processes. SPCLD affects heavily on the reduction of the design cycle and cost, and the improvement of satellite performance. This study focuses on the SPCLD solution methods. Firstly, a generic modeling method of comprehensive model for SPCLD is given from considering the configuration and layout factors. Secondly, an optimization model of integrated design is described on the basis of co-evolutionary design model. Coevolution-based model of integrated design is used to optimize design schemes simultaneously in configuration and layout through a population-based algorithm. Finally, an example of payloads configuration and layout in MSG-1 is constructed to illustrate the design process of the proposed integrated design approach for satellite payloads configuration and layout. The purpose is to explore some effective strategies or approaches for dealing with engineering combinatorial optimization problems.

84855318215	Spectroscopic studies on the interaction between an anticancer drug ampelopsin and bovine serum albumin	The interaction between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the anticancer drug molecule ampelopsin (AMP) was investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectra, and time-resolved spectra under simulated physiological conditions. Fluorescence data showed that the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA was strongly quenched by AMP in terms of a dynamic quenching process. Binding constants and binding sites were calculated. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the hydrogen bonding and weak van der Waals force played a major role in the interaction. The site marker competitive experiments suggested that the binding site of AMP and BSA was probably located on site III. Based on the Förster's theory, the average binding distance between AMP and BSA was obtained (r = 5.47 nm). The binding of AMP and BSA leaded to conformational changes of BSA according to synchronous fluorescence spectra, CD data and mean fluorescence lifetime values. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84863029640	Dual-system cooperative co-evolutionary differential evolution with human-computer cooperation for satellite module layout optimization	Satellite module layout optimization problem is not only a complex coupled system design problem but also a special combinatorial optimization problem. This kind of complex engineering layout optimization problem is difficult to solve in polynomial time and obtain higher success rate. This article proposed a new dual-system cooperative co-evolutionary differential evolution with human-computer cooperation algorithm (HDCCDE) for a satellite module layout optimization problem. HDCCDE was based on the dual-system cooperative co-evolutionary framework and human-computer cooperation strategy. Dual-system cooperative co-evolutionary differential evolution (DCCDE) was employed as the system optimizer to search for a better performance. A new adding strategy of artificial individual was proposed. This strategy could add artificial individuals to algorithm population and influence algorithm performance. The numerical experiment of satellite module layout optimization case showed that the proposed algorithm obtains better solution and higher computational success rate.

84863115632	Simultaneous reduction and surface functionalization of graphene oxide for hydroxyapatite mineralization	In this study, we present the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide/hydroxyapatite (RGO/HA) hybrid materials by an environmental-friendly route. Graphene oxide (GO) was first simultaneously reduced and surface functionalized by one-step oxidative polymerization of dopamine (PDA). The bioinspired surface was further used for biomimetic mineralization of hydroxyapatite. When incubated in a simulated body fluid (SBF), the PDA layer enabled efficient interaction between the RGO surface and the mineral ions to improve the bioactivity, promoted the formation of the HA nanoparticles. A detailed structural and morphological characterization of the mineralized composite was performed. The HA-based hybrid materials exhibited no cytotoxic effect on L929 fibroblast cells, showing potential capacity of being a scaffold material for bone tissue regeneration and implantation. This facile strategy also can be a useful platform for other RGO-based nanocomposites. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84863441094	A modified artificial bee colony algorithm for vehicle routing problems with time windows	Vehicle routing problems with time windows (VRPTW for short) is an NP-hard problem and an extension of vehicle routing problems. This study presented a heuristic algorithm (ABC-T) to deal with vehicle routing problems with time windows. The ABC-T algorithm employed the artificial bee colony algorithm (known as ABC) and improved the global search capacity with tournament selection strategy. In this algorithm, the employed bees generated the new solutions by the neighborhood search; then, based on the tournament selection strategy, the food source selection probability was settled. Finally, the new solution was generated by the onlooker bees. The tournament selection strategy was used here to enhance the global search capacity of the ABC. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms available in the literature, the effectiveness of this approach was showed on the Solomon's Rl 02 problem. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

84872925706	A dual-system method with differential evolution and genetic algorithm for loop-based station sequencing problem	The facility layout problem is one of the most complex problems in many industries and the Loop-based Station Sequencing Problem (LSSP) is a classical sub-problem. In this study, a dual-system method based on Differential Evolution (DE) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) (DDEGA) was presented to solve the LSSP. The DDEGA duplicates the system P, which represents the original problem, as systems A and B. The systems A and B are solved by DE and GA, respectively. Since the elite migration between two systems can contribute to increasing the diversity and decreasing the premature convergence, the DDEGA can obtain better solutions and robustness. Numerical studies on four different scales showed that the proposed method can obtain a challenging solution. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

84884141590	Solving multi-objective Flexible Job Shop Scheduling with transportation constraints using a micro artificial bee colony algorithm	We deal with multi-objective Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) with transportation resources constraints herein, where the cost time of loaded and empty Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) cannot be neglected. This problem is a NP-hard problem, whose optimization objectives are to minimize the makespan and total workload of machines. We proposed a multi-objective micro artificial bee colony algorithm (MMABC) to tackle this problem. In MMABC, each solution corresponds to a food source, which is encoded to reflect the assignment of AGV tasks, machine operations, and operation sequence; the smaller bee population is divided in two parts: a replaceable bee part and non-replaceable bee part. We also employed the crossover operator to the employed bee for exchanging the good scheduling. Experimental results on larger examples and comparisons with multi-objective micro genetic algorithm showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

84901416026	Modelling design and blade profile optimization for a mixed-flow pump impeller	Pumps are a type of energy conversion equipments. They can change the mechanical energy into the potential energy of the working fluid. The good design of hydraulic model determines the good hydraulic performances of pumps. We herein studied on modelling design and blade profile optimization of a mixed-flow pump impeller to meet hydraulic design requirements. Our goals were to satisfy the requirements of water dynamics strength and hydraulic performance. In order to meet the number of rotor and static blade matching up principle and to improve the safety of the operation, we selected the appropriate number of impeller blades and redesigned a mixed-flow pump impeller based on modelling design method. And we utilized a genetic algorithm to optimize the blade, which tried to modify the inlet and outlet angle and blade profile to achieve good hydraulic performance. The numerical simulations showed that the optimal impeller performed well in the hydraulic, cavitations, water dynamics strength, and meet the design requirements of main pump. © Sila Science.

84901442695	Study on methods of numerical simulation of transient flow in the semi-open impeller stage of a centrifugal compressor	Centrifugal compressors are vital energy conversion equipment and widely used in Petrochemical industries. The flow complex and unsteady features in compressor stage have an impact on the safety of compressor operating. The transient flow characteristics were numerically simulated in the semi-open impeller stage of one large compressor. By using the phase lagged method and the domain scaling method, two different interface approaches, and solving the three dimensional density-based Reynoldsaveraged N-S equation, the static pressure fluctuation on the impeller blades surface was obtained. The flow in the impeller was analyzed according to the dynamic load characteristics of the impeller blades surface, and then the difference between the domain scaling method and the phase lagged method was discussed and summarized. Theoretical studies show that the dynamic load is the incentive of fatigue failure of compressor impellers. The numerical results indicate that the dynamic load on the studied impeller blades surface is much lower than that inducing fatigue failure. The conclusions of this study provide the numerical basis for the choice of suitable method for numerical simulation of transient flow in the centrifugal compressor stage, and as well as the guidance for the reason investigation of impeller blades fracture under off-operating conditions. © Sila Science.

The predicting process include confining design variables, sampling, building finite element model with business software ANSYS, constructing surrogate model to replace the original model and finally predicting data with the new model. In such process, we build a back-propagation neural network, and train it with sampling data from ANSYS results. We tested our methods with a mechanical structure design of hydraulic forging press.

84902240807	Usage intensity-based optimal replace-repair strategy for warranty items	We herein propose a repair-replace strategy to minimize the expected warranty servicing costs for manufacturers when the items sold with a free repair-replacement warranty policy. Manufacturers usually rectify a failure either by repairing the failed item or by replacing it with a new one when a repairable product fails under warranty. In addition, the rectification action influences the repair and warranty servicing cost. Except for the time or age, the usage intensity is often another essential factor that accounts for the failure of the product, which varies the population of users. Our strategy classified the usage population into several groups and provided different repair actions for various groups. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84920666058	Hybridizing invasive weed optimization and simulated annealing algorithm for high-dimensional function optimization	We herein propose an efficient algorithm (called IWOSA herein after) hybridizing invasive weed optimization (IWO for short) with the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The IWO is a new algorithm proposed to solve actual practical problems, which imitates the invasive behavior of weeds in nature. In the further research IWO algorithm did not show its efficiency in highdimensional problems, and lacked directivity in the process of IWOSA iterations. To deal with this problem, we employed IWO to provide diversity to explore solution and Metropolis criterion of SA to provide more precise guidance, and tried to improve accuracy and convergence speed by these steps. To test the proposed algorithm, we compared IWOSA with original IWO through high-dimensional optimization benchmark functions. The computational results showed the efficiency of our algorithm.
