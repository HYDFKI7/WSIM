Thus, it plays an important part in dielectric recovery characteristic during the breaking process. In this paper, taking the actual current flow path in the contacts into consideration, the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field distribution between the axial magnetic contacts of the revolving arc type vacuum circuit breaker has been calculated. The magnetic induction strength distributions on the different space profile including the contacts surface have been obtained and their graphics processing are figured out. The simulation results show that this axial magnetic field distribution is beneficial to the vacuum arc quenching. © 2004 IEEE.

79952379381	A formal modeling method for grid workflow based on concurrent transaction logic	Grid workflow is an important means to implement the cooperation of resources in the grid and becomes a key alternative to develop truly distributed applications for the grid platform. Grid workflow modeling is the basis of the establishment and execution of workflows. However, it is a challenging task for grid workflow modeling, due to the high degree of autonomy and heterogeneity of the cooperative organizations under distributed environments. Recently, Concurrent TRansaction logic (CTR) has become one of the most exciting methods for grid process modeling. In this paper, we present our current work for the modeling and controlling execution of grid workflow by CTR technique. We describe in detail the syntax of modeling method and summarize special communication primitives from which any process can be defined and understood by their interactive behaviors. The proposed method can provide some new functions like implementing comprehensive coordination and cooperation behaviors of different business processes to improve the stability of grid workflow system. Experimental results show that the proposed method works well for characterizing the behaviors and interactions of the workflow processes under heterogeneous environments in terms of the semantics of CTR.

84887788358	Model test research on the red layer anchors' mechanical properties of pullout resistance	Slopes with red beds are often reinforced by anchors. But the disintegration characteristics of the red sandstone have direct influence on the mechanical properties of the anchors. Thus, it is required to study the laws between the disintegrating resistance characteristics of the red sandstone and the mechanical properties of the anchors. In this paper, anchor pullout tests in red sandstone layers and disintegrating resistance tests of red sandstone were carried out. Firstly, the evolution rules of the load-displacement curves and the loading elastic-plastic displacement curves of the anchors in red beds under cycling loads were obtained through anchor pullout tests. Secondly, the disintegrating resistance index was acquired under the disintegrating resistance tests. At last, the laws between the disintegrating resistance characteristics of the red sandstone and the mechanical properties of the anchors were combined. The analysis shows that, with the reduction of disintegrating resistance index, the mechanical properties of the resistance of pullout become poor.

42149190128	Characteristics of traffic crashes on freeways in China: Case study of Jingjintang expressway	As China feverishly builds one of the largest freeway systems in the world to meet its ever-increasing demand for highway transportation-stimulated by the unprecedented economic boom-traffic safety has become a serious concern. The problem of more than 100,000 annual traffic fatalities is threatening the country's sustainable economic development. The significant differences in road user behavior, level of motorization, traffic enforcement practice, roadside design criteria, and economic development stage make the characteristics of traffic crashes in China somewhat different from those in developed countries. To reduce traffic crashes it is important to investigate what, when, how, and why those crashes occurred. This paper introduces a highway safety project conducted on Jingjintang Expressway, one of the first freeways built in China. Results of the study show that, among other factors, the speed differential between cars and large vehicles is a main cause of high crash fatalities, particularly for rear-end collisions. The lack of real-time enforcement, problematic driver behavior, and substandard roadside design, as well as overloaded trucks all contribute heavily to traffic crashes on China's freeways.

70350638949	Semi-supervised discriminant analysis based on dependence estimation	Dimension reduction is very important for applications in data mining and machine learning. Dependence maximization based supervised feature extraction (SDMFE) is an effective dimension reduction method proposed recently. A shortcoming of SDMFE is that it can only use labeled data, and does not work well when labeled data are limited. However, in many applications, it is a common case. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction method, called Semi-Supervised Dependence Maximization Feature Extraction (SSDMFE), which can utilize simultaneously both labeled and unlabeled data to perform feature extraction. The labeled data are used to maximize the dependence and the unlabeled data are used as regulations with respect to the intrinsic geometric structure of the data. Experiments on several datasets are presented and the results demonstrate that SSDMFE achieves much higher classification accuracy than SDMFE when the amount of labeled data are limited. © 2009 Springer.

77957002666	Dimension reduction with semi-supervised pairwise covariance-preserving projection	Dimension reduction is critical in many areas of pattern classification and machine learning and many algorithms have been proposed. Pairwise Covariance-preserving Projection Method (PCPM) was an effective dimension reduction which maximizes the class discrimination and also preserves approximately the pairwise class covariances. A shortcoming of PCPM is that it can only be applied when all labels are given, thus a typical supervised method. Semi-supervised has attracted much attention in recent years since they can utilize both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we extend PCPM to semi-supervised setting. The labeled data points are used to maximize the separability between different classes and the unlabeled data points are used to estimate the intrinsic geometric structure of the data. Specifically, we aim to learn a discriminant function which is as smooth as possible on the data manifold. The target optimization problem involved can be solved efficiently by eigenvalue decomposition. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

This paper provides a method of hovering behavior recognition and tracking, which can reduce workload and prevent something happen in advance. In order to realize the purpose, we utilize a video analysis technique including many automatic tracking algorithms, but these algorithms can not analyze the behavior of objects and have some defects. Therefore, we put forward the argument of hovering behavior recognition, and combine background subtraction with Camshift to realize tracing. The background subtraction detects object and approaches object contour with a rectangle which is also an object's tracking box. Furthermore, Camshift algorithm is used to make up the shortage of the background subtraction method. The result of experiment shows that this method can meet the basic requirements of hovering tracking. © 2010 IEEE.

78049505152	Sound as a countermeasure against driving fatigue based on ECG	Driving fatigue is one of the main causes for fatal accidents. Environmental stimulus as the countermeasure against driving fatigue has been widely researched. For this paper a driving simulator experiment was carried out in order to validate the effect of sound as the environmental stimulus countermeasure. Firstly, the paper analyzed the change law of ECG (Electrocardiograph) with driving time, then validated that it was reasonable to consider ECG as an evaluation indicator of driving fatigue. Various indices of ECG recorded from alert to fatigue throughout the experiment were used to measure degree of fatigue using principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, being a countermeasure against driving fatigue, the validity of sound stimulus was verified and the optimal combination of sound was presented by orthogonal experiments. The results show that the alerting reaction exists in the sound signal stimulation during driving fatigue state, and there is a significant difference among different types of sound stimulus. Stimulating interval and sonic intensity are the most significant factors to fight driving fatigue, the impact of frequency and stimulating interval are weaker. The experimental method will lay a foundation for further study on light and vibration stimulus as countermeasures against driving fatigue. © 2010 ASCE.

Various types of the simulating sound source were synthesized by different intensities, frequencies, and durations of sound. The monotonow scene at midday was chosen to do experiment because of initiating easily the fatigue symplom. The eye movement and the other facial features were used as the criteria for fatigue judgment. The sound stimuli were given as the fatigue symptom appeared, and the variations of the driver physiological signals including the electroencephalogram, the electwcardiogram, and the eye movement and his driving performance were analyzed before and during the sound stimulation. The results showed the alerting reaction exists for the monotonous sound stimulation when the driver is in the fatigue state, but the alert only lasts for a few minutes. The type of the stimulating sound affects significantly on the result of stimulation. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the effects of various factors of the sound against the driving fatigue and establish a lasting, alerting sound combination as an effective driving fatigul countermeasure.

Finally, it takes the order degree and the vehicle delay as the indexes of evaluation for the optimization, uses the simulation method. A real signalized intersection is illustrated to get the optimal strategy, and it gets an optimal result after an optimal process. The result indicates that the optimal strategy evaluated by the order degree of mixed traffic and the vehicle delay is better than the former strategy evaluated by the vehicle only, and it fits to describe the mixed traffic phenomenon of China.

As a result, many local false peaks may be generated in contrast measurements, making it difficult for the camera's passive auto-focus system to perform its function of locating the focused peak. In this paper, a new passive auto-focus algorithm is proposed to address this problem. First, a noise reduction preprocessing is introduced to make our algorithm robust to both additive noise and multiplicative noise. Then, a new contrast measure is presented to bring in local false peaks, ensuring the presence of a well defined focused peak. In order to gauge the performance of our algorithm, a modified peak search algorithm is used in the experiments.

84155182079	Mechanism of arc discharge in vacuum interrupter based on PIC-MCC method	With the raise of voltage level in electric power grid, the phenomena of high voltage gas insulation has received extensive attention from all over the world. The research on the breakdown mechanism of vacuum which is the main insulation gas in high voltage level is one of the most important issues. It is also important to the study of vacuum arc in vacuum switch. But for the limitations of available method used in analyzing the breakdown mechanism of vacuum, the main research on vacuum breakdown is macroscopic experiment. The experiments are greatly influenced by environmental factors and high vacuum degree is difficult to be ensured. So the data from the experiments are dispersive and the complex physical change in vacuum breakdown can not be revealed. The purpose of this work is to analyze the mechanism of vacuum breakdown quantitatively by microscopic numerical simulation. The particle in cell and Monte Carlo methods are used here to solve microscopic dynamic equation of gas. Based on the field emission theory in vacuum, electrons produced by the cathode and ions produced by the collision between electron and metal vapor molecule are the objects of this study. The motions of microscopic particles which are at the functions of the applied and self-consistent electric filed are traced in time and two space dimensions. Mont Carlo method is used here to cope with the collisions between electrons and metal vapor molecules. The cross sections of the collision which is related with the energy are all from the experiments. The secondary electron emission, exciting, elastic and ionizing collisions between electrons and metal vapor molecules have been considered in this paper. By the simulation, the number densities of electron and ion are acquired and the microscopic dynamic electric field produced by space charge is also calculated. The effect of vacuum degree on discharge voltage is also discussed here. According to the simulation data, we draw the conclusion that the main reason for vacuum arc formation is metal vapor ionization and large amount of metal gas is from high energy electrons' collision with the anode.

84255194542	A robust detail preserving anisotropic diffusion for speckle reduction in ultrasound images	Background: Speckles in ultrasound imaging affect image quality and can make the post-processing difficult. Speckle reduction technologies have been employed for removing speckles for some time. One of the effective speckle reduction technologies is anisotropic diffusion. Anisotropic diffusion technology can remove the speckles effectively while preserving the edges of the image and thus has drawn great attention from image processing scientists. However, the proposed methods in the past have different disadvantages, such as being sensitive to the number of iterations or low capability of preserving the details of the ultrasound images. Thus a detail preserved anisotropic diffusion speckle reduction with less sensitive to the number of iterations is needed. This paper aims to develop this kind of technologies.Results: In this paper, we propose a robust detail preserving anisotropic diffusion filter (RDPAD) for speckle reduction. In order to get robust diffusion, the proposed method integrates Tukey error norm function into the detail preserving anisotropic diffusion filter (DPAD) developed recently. The proposed method could prohibit over-diffusion and thus is less sensitive to the number of iterations. Conclusions: The proposed anisotropic diffusion can preserve the important structure information of the original image while reducing speckles. It is also less sensitive to the number of iterations. Experimental results on real ultrasound images show the effectiveness of the proposed anisotropic diffusion filter. © 2011 Lui et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84859347882	A combined method based on visual and communication for simulative agent localization	The Agent localization is very important in RoboCup. To solve the localization problem is a key issue in making truly autonomous agent. It can be difficult to try to make it own mind to what to do next. The existence of uncertainty in both the driving and the sensing of the agent is the key aspect to determine the location of agent as accurately as possible. The uncertain information should be combined in an optimal way. In this paper, we propose out a novel method to get the localization of agent. In our new method, we use the combination of visual and communication methods to achieve the target. Communications mainly use coding approach, visual mainly through geometry and rotation matrix approach. The results of applying new method to competition of the Robot Cup Opening show that the positioning of the agents using our methods in aspects of speed and accuracy can satisfy the requirement.

84863066164	Development of on-line monitoring system of switchgear	For improving reliable operation of switchgear in power system, an approach for on-line monitoring the insulation characteristic and bus-bar temperature rising of the switchgear is proposed in this paper. Through comparing several existing temperature measurement methods for monitoring temperature rising elevation at bus-bas, a new design of temperature monitoring method is proposed. It adopts quick-magnetic saturated current transformer, temperature sensor and infrared transmission to solve the problem of high voltage isolation. For switchgear insulation characteristic monitoring, using the micro-controller unit (MCU) and hardware design, an on-line dielectric loss angle and leakage current measuring method with low cost and high accuracy is implemented.

The frequency voltage signal is extracted by connecting voltage-dividing capacitor on capacitive device terminal and absolute method of measurement and zero-crossing comparison measurement is adapted to measure dielectric loss angle whose principle and calculation approach are presented in this paper. The leakage current and dielectric loss angle can be regarded as criterion to assess switchgear insulation characteristic. Because the monitoring system works in several electromagnetic interference environments, some hardware and software electromagnetic immunity measures are discussed. At last, the system runs in real system and the result shows the on-line monitoring system is stable and reliable which can be provide reference for on-line monitoring system design of switchgear. © 2011 IEEE.

Based on the gap acceptance model, this paper proposes a new approach to calculating the capacity of right-turn lane at signalized intersections with channelized islands. This model takes into account the interference of non-motorized traffic enter channelized islands. The non-motorized traffic is treated as the traffic on the major road-a crosswalk, which has great impacts on right-turn vehicles on the minor road-an exclusive right-turn lane. The basic model is modified by introducing the red light effect adjustment coefficient. The new model is calibrated and tested using the field data collected at 6 signalized intersections with channelized islands in 4 cities. The average relative error between the calculated value and the observed is 9.28%, which means the proposed method in this paper can better estimate the capacity of an exclusive free right-turn lane under the interference of non-motorized traffic.

By discussing the criterion factor affected ship position computation together with this model's universality for any kind of ship, the model used ship course and speed as well as difference of longitude and latitude as inputs and outputs, respectively. At time n, using the lasted N training samples under the same time step train the network to capture the ship motion law, then predicted ship position at n+1.

Because multimedia data of different modalities are heterogeneous in feature space and there exists the well-know semantic gap, one of the most challenging issues for cross-media learning is to mine underlying semantics and estimate cross-media correlation. In this paper we propose a cross-media semantics mining approach based on Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis and relevance feedback. First, we analyze sparse canonical correlation between low-level feature matrices of different modalities in training stage, and construct a Multimodal Sparse Subspace where both canonical correlation and most meaningful features are preserved; then based on geometric distance in the subspace we estimate cross-media correlation and enable cross-media retrieval; also we provide long-term relevance feedback strategy for performance optimization.

The existing researches of the trust evaluation could be divided into the objective means and the subjective means. The subjective evaluations could be used to dynamically measure the user's trust degree according to the reputation based on its past actions. But it cannot work when the interaction experience with the user is absence. Compared with other subjective evaluation models using the probability theory, the fuzzy based model could exactly depict the unsure and fuzzy phenomena in process. But the existing fuzzy method based on the fuzzy synthetic evaluation needs to do complex calculations between trust vectors. And the chosen operators are not enough accurate. In this paper we promote a comprehensive trust evaluation framework was a fusion of objective and subjective means. An initial trust view for user is provided based on the certified trust and a reputation is derived by the fuzzy synthetic evaluation method based on user's past actions. The proposed fuzzy method can avoid complex calculations between trust vectors, and adopts a more accurate operator to avert the information wastage. © 2012 IEEE.

More and more researchers are attracted to software security testing study. Most of them put their works on software access control model based testing, which takes into account information mainly on multidimensions, like roles, permissions and contexts. But the key disadvantage of access control model based testing is its model are hard to be built in many circumstance, for example, to describe requirement "picture A is only allowed to be copied twice outside terminal B", researcher has to extend the original model with hierarchy status and priority sub models. To overcome this disadvantage, this paper present a framework of data oriented access control testing method, which focus mainly on data and its actions instead of role, permission and contexts. Though experiments, this paper also proves that the method is much more instructive than access control model in test cases automatic generating. © 2012 IEEE.

84874713507	Self-adaptive voxel traversing algorithm based on multi-point iteration for ray tracing	Ray tracing algorithm is a major technique for enhancing the realistic sense of graphs. In order to improve the speed of ray tracing algorithm, a fast uniform voxel traversing algorithm along 3D line was proposed. The basic idea for scanning conversion of raster line stroke was referenced in the proposed algorithm. The decision parameter was defined according to line slope, and the decision parameter obtained with iteration calculation was used to control the ray movement direction at each step. Different from the single-point iteration algorithm, a line was adaptively divided into serveral m-traversings composed of multiple points according to the slope. The decision parameter could be calculated only aiming at m-traversings and even periods composed of multiple m-traversings. And thus, the calculation amount gets effectively decreased. The theoretical and experimental results show that the running speed of the proposed algorithm increases nearly by 56% compared with the existing fastest single-point algorithm and the efficiency of ray tracing gets greatly enhanced, which can be realized only with simple integer calculation.

However, it does not take full consideration of the complex network topology characteristics. In this paper, with the community module degree as evaluation indexes, traffic signal control sub-areas of urban traffic signal network are divided using the community discovery algorithm. Then the PC-SCOOT system and VISSIM simulation platform are used as test-bed based on Wangjing District in Beijing, China. Traditional method and the proposed method are both used to compare traffic indexes of some main urban road and the whole region. Simulation results show that the proposed method could improve average stop delay, average stops, average delay and the average speed per vehicle.

84874853537	A pilot study verifying how the curve information impacts on the driver performance with cognition model	Drivers' misjudgment is a significant issue for the curve safety. It is considered as a more influential factor than other traffic environmental conditions for inducing risk. The research suggested that the cognition theory could explain the process of drivers' behavior at curves. In this simulator experiment, a principle cognition model was built to examine the rationality of this explanation. The core of this pilot study was using one of the driving decision strategies for braking at curves to verify the accuracy of the cognition model fundamentally. Therefore, the experiment designed three treatments of information providing modes. The result of the experiment presented that the warning information about curves in advance can move the position of first braking away from curves. This phenomenon is consistent with the model's inference. Thus, the conclusion of this study indicates that the process of the drivers' behavior at curves can be explained by the cognition theory and represented by cognition model. In addition, the model's characteristics and working parameters can be acquired by doing other research. Then based on the model it can afford the advice for giving the appropriate warning information that may avoid the driver's mistake. © 2013 Xiaohua Zhao et al.

84876025632	Crosswalk capacity under mixed traffic conditions at signalized intersection with channellized islands	In order to re-estimate the crosswalk capacity under mixed traffic condition, a new approach to calculating the crosswalk capacity at signalized intersections with channelized islands is demonstrated. Channelized intersections designate the intended vehicle paths using pavement markings or raised islands. Channelization is widely used for crosswalks, particularly when there is a non-motorized traffic (e.g., pedestrians and bicycles) waiting zone. The capacity of crosswalk is changed due to the two distinctive stages when non-motorized traffic goes through signalized intersections during the green time. The capacity calculation model is based on the dynamics area conversion of pedestrians, bicycles, electric bicycles and conversion of reach area. The model is then calibrated using the field data collected at several signalized intersections in the city of Fuzhou.

84878026063	Design for spring actuator of vacuum circuit breaker based on robust optimization	For the spring actuator of 12 kV, 12.5 kA vacuum circuit breaker, a mathematical model calculating the breaking and closing velocity based on mechanism analysis was given. The design for spring actuator of vacuum circuit breaker based on robust optimization was presented. The lengths of the connecting rods and the stiffness coefficient of breaking and closing spring of the spring actuator were chosen as the optimization variables. The effect of the factors, as processing errors, assembly error, ageing and fatigue, was considered as the tolerance of design variables. The functions, which were used to minimize the error of the breaking and closing velocity of vacuum circuit breaker and to minimize the maximal variation of these velocity when the design variables varied within the acceptable tolerances, were chosen as the objective function. So a robust optimization mathematical model with multi-target and two-level optimization for the spring actuator was given. A series of optimization strategy were presented, and the algorithm was tested by using a classical standard test function. The performance of 12 kV, 12.5 kA vacuum circuit breaker is improved by robust optimization. The numerical example shows the effectiveness of the method.

84878941335	Study on chaos model of expected headway in urban expressway	Modeling vehicle headways, as a probability distribution function or time series, has been the focus of a big number of research projects, most of which was dealing with the statistical approach. This paper presents chaos theory alternative to the classical techniques. A quantitative analysis is conducted on the chaos phenomenon in the car-following fleet based on the headway kept by the two consecutive vehicles and the following vehicle's speed. By studying the microscopic characteristics of the vehicles fleet in the process of stimuli and reaction it is proved that there exists a chaos occurrence in the car-following fleet. In order to reasonably model the expected headway in traffic stream four expected headway models have been mathematically proposed in this paper. Then, the Rossler chaos attractor are introduced in these four models in order to choose the models that can best describe the actual traffic characteristics. The calibration and validation procedures are conducted using high accurate RTK GPS equipped vehicles to collect data from expressways. Based on the results it can be seen that modified headway models can best reflect the car-following characteristics of the real traffic flow.

This before-arc process is the foundation of studying arc process. The mechanism of the metal vapor arc is different from other gas medium and contains complex electrode process. The proximal cathode region is the important area for vacuum arc forming and it is affected by many factors. The influences of the different electrode separations, different secondary emission coefficient on electronic density, electronic temperature and electric potential, were analysed in this paper. The simulation results show that the change of electrode separations barely impacts the thickness of sheath and the decrease of electrode separations will lead to the decrease of electronic energy near the cathode sheath. The increase of secondary electron emission will increase charged particles energy, which is the important condition of forming cathode sheath. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Aiming at the physical consumption of walking up and down the stairs, this paper obtains pedestrian oxygen consumption with the oxygen consumption model. It converts physical consumption into walking distance equivalently according to the equivalent relationship between the oxygen consumption. The equivalent walking distance and pedestrian flow rate threshold corresponded to each pedestrian feeling level is confirmed by two-step-cluster method combined with actual survey.

By the theoretical study and numerical simulation, exploring the formation of plasma sheath near the cathode, charged particles' energy distribution and influence elements in before-arc process are the fundamentals of this paper. Before-arc process is the fundermental of arc energy and the proximal cathode region is the important area for vacuum arc forming, so before-arc process of metal vapor arc was simulated here.

The copper cross section adopted here was related to the particle energy. The tracks of electrons were traced until they reached to the anode surface. Based on this method, the formation of proximal cathode region and some microscopic parameters were simulated here.

After analyzing the crushing ability of hydraulic breaking hammer and sheep-foot roller on red beds soft rock, the mechanical crushing technology to aim at eliminating the slacking properties of red beds soft rock was proposed. The core of this technology is "milling and compressing" action, which is based on the unique iteration character in the process of creating a fractal figure. On-site experiments on the technology were conducted subsequently on Liu-Li Expressway. Calculation results of the fractal dimension value on the particle size distribution data of soft rock material show that 2 times of "milling and compaction" action can crush the red beds soft rock to the extent that its fractal dimension value can reach the interval of 2.6~2.7. The results verified the mechanical crushing technology developed based on the fractal iteration character, which could eliminate the slacking properties of red beds soft rock. The crushing technology has been applied in the expressway construction process and can extend the application of red beds soft rock material from the lower embankment to the upper embankment.

As a means for coastal nations' Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) to get information on vessels operating near the coast, the traditional radar and the new AIS become the two sources of getting the vessels information. Therefore, the tracks fusion of AIS and radar is the key technology to be resolved in VTS. The tracks correlation is the premise and basis of tracks fusion. This paper proposed an improved method of fuzzy correlation algorithm based on the maximum membership to fuse redundant observations due to multi-sensor (such as radar and AIS) coverage in VTS. We made generous correlation decision by time and distance and obtain the targets in a fixed range, and then we made precise correlation utilizing the membership function of Cauchy-type. The simulation experiment shows the proposed fuzzy correlation algorithm is correct and stable. The result of this effort is a computational efficient and cost effective software solution to a significant system deficiency that impacts greatly on overall waterway safety.

Combined with the stope distribution characteristics surrounding No.92 orebody, disaster cavities within four exploration lines, i. e., 205-2, 203-2, 201-2 and 202-2, were taken as research objects. On the basis of analyzing the information of the spatial characteristics, numerical calculation model of disaster cavities within four exploration lines was built with international mining software Surpac and rock failure process analysis software RFPA software respectively. Initial field stress and blasting dynamic disturbances effect surrounding the cavities were comprehensively considered. Dynamical destabilization of disaster cavities was simulated by using RFPA.

The model adopts both the active power generation increment and the load switch as control variables and takes the relative importance of the loads to be restored into account, resulting in fewer rescheduled generators and less adjustment of active power generation. The condition for transmission loop paralleling operation can be reached from two ways of reducing generator adjustment time and optimally restoring load.

84894187991	Mass classification in mammogram with semi-supervised relief based feature selection	Mammogram is currently the best way for early detection of breast cancer. Mass is a typical sign of breast cancer, and the classification of masses as malignant or benign may assist radiologists in reducing the biopsy rate without increasing false negatives. Typically, different geometry and texture features are extracted and utilized to train a classifier to classify a mass. However, not each feature is equally important for a classifier, and some features may indeed decrease the performance of a classifier. In this paper, we investigated the usage of semi-supervised feature selection method for classification. After a mass is extracted from a ROI (region of interest) with level set method. Morphological and texture features are extracted from the segmented regions and surrounding regions. SSLFE (Semi- Supervised Local Feature Extraction, proposed in our previous work) is utilized to select important features for KNN classifier. Mammography images from DDSM were used for experiment. The experimental result shows that by incorporating information embedded in unlabeled data, SSLFE can improve the performance compared to the method without feature selection and traditional Relief method. © 2014 Copyright SPIE.

84894193905	Padé approximation based method for computation of eigenvalues for time delay power system	Transcendental terms appear in the characteristic equation of a power system and results in an infinite number of eigenvalues, when time delays in the feedback signals of power system wide-area damping controllers are considered. This makes it very difficult to obtain system eigenvalues via direct solution of the equation. In this paper, a method for computing a reduced set of eigenvalues of a time delay power system is proposed by using Padé rational polynomials to approximate the delays. The Padé polynomials are firstly transformed into their equivalent state space representations. By interconnecting the models of the open-loop power system, wide-area damping controllers and the state space representations of time delays, the linearized model for the closed-loop power system is then established and a reduced set of eignevalues of the system can be computed. The method has been tested on the New England 10-machine 39-bus test systems and compared with the eigenvalue computation method in the software package DDE-BIFTOOL. It shows that the proposed Padé approximation-based method can accurately obtain nearly all of the eigenvalues relating to system dynamic devices. The number of eigenvalues relating to time delays that can be correctly computed and their accuracy strongly relates to the orders of the Padé rational polynomials. © 2013 IEEE.

84894613017	A comparison of contrast measurements in passive autofocus systems for low contrast images	A number of contrast measurements have been investigated and compared in the literature. Each of them exhibits an ideal curve with a well defined peak standing for the best focused image. However, a focused image obtained in low light conditions possesses a small contrast value, which may be easily influenced by noise. In this case, contrast measurements may generate fluctuant curves with many local peaks. This paper presents a comparison among six contrast measurements in passive autofocus systems towards a non-previously researched object of low contrast images. The criterium to evaluate the performance of each measurement is unimodality. And we assess the similarity of the resulting curves with an ideal focus curve which exhibits a single peak and an absence of plateau. Experimental results from six typical image sequences indicate that Tenengrad and CMAN approaches yield the best performance, but it is still necessary to derive a more elaborated method because both methods fail to generate a single sharp peak in some circumstances. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84894322100	Regional traffic state consensus optimization based on computational experiments	In urban traffic network, the traffic flow within several adjacent intersections is strongly relevant and traffic congestion happened on one road section will probably result in cascade of regional congestion. In this paper, we try to optimize each traffic section state to a desired consensus state in traditional subarea. Because of the difficulty to execute real experiment, we apply ACP computational experiments method to realize the process. Firstly, we establish a regional road network traffic model and set up traffic state equation with traffic density as traffic state and leaving proportions of traffic flow on sections during effective green per cycle as control input. Secondly, we design a state feedback control strategy to regulate the leaving proportions of each section which indirectly reflects the effective green time, according to the difference between real-time traffic states and desired traffic consistency state. Thirdly, we apply computational experiments method to find the right value of leaving proportions indexes which will make section traffic state converge towards the desired consensus states and balance the distribution of traffic in overall regional traffic network.

84896130901	Urban traffic signal system control structural optimization based on network analysis	Advanced urban traffic signal control systems such as SCOOT and SCATS normally coordinate traffic network using multilevel hierarchical control mechanism. In this mechanism, several key intersections will be selected from traffic signal network and the network will be divided into different control subareas. Traditionally, key intersection selection and control subareas division are executed according to dynamic traffic counts and link length between intersections, which largely rely on traffic engineers' experience. However, it omits important inherent characteristics of traffic network topology. In this paper, we will apply network analysis approach into these two aspects for traffic system control structure optimization. Firstly, the modified C-means clustering algorithm will be proposed to assess the importance of intersections in traffic network and furthermore determine the key intersections based on three indexes instead of merely on traffic counts in traditional methods. Secondly, the improved network community discovery method will be used to give more reasonable evidence in traffic control subarea division. Finally, to test the effectiveness of network analysis approach, a hardware-in-loop simulation environment composed of regional traffic control system, microsimulation software and signal controller hardware, will be built. Both traditional method and proposed approach will be implemented on simulation test bed to evaluate traffic operation performance indexes, for example, travel time, stop times, delay and average vehicle speed. Simulation results show that the proposed network analysis approach can improve the traffic control system operation performance effectively. © 2013 Li Wang et al.

84896140289	Estimation trajectory of the low-frequency floating car considering the traffic control	Floating car equipped with GPS to detect traffic flow has been widely used in ITS research and applications. The trajectory estimation is the most critical and complex part in the floating vehicle information processing system. However, the trajectory estimation would be more difficult when using the low-frequency data sampling because of the high communication cost and the numerous data. Specifically, the ordinary algorithm cannot determine the specific vehicle paths with two anchor points across multiple intersections. Considering the accuracy in map matching, this paper used a delay matching algorithm and studied the trajectory estimation algorithm focusing on the issue of existence of a small road network between two anchor points. A method considering the three multiobjective factors of signal control and driving distance and number of intersections was developed. Firstly, an optimal solution set was acquired according to multiobjective decision theory and Pareto optimal principles in game theory. Then, the optimal solution set was evaluated synthetically based on the fuzzy set theory. Finally, the candidate trajectory which is the core evaluation factor was identified as the best possible travel path. The algorithm was validated by using the real traffic data in Wangjing area of Beijing. The results showed that the algorithm can get a better trajectory estimation and provide more traffic information to traffic management department. © 2013 Zhijian Wang et al.

84907600379	Mass classification in mammograms using selected geometry and texture features, and a new SVM-based feature selection method	Masses are the primary indications of breast cancer in mammograms, and it is important to classify them as benign or malignant. Benign and malignant masses differ in geometry and texture characteristics. However, not every geometry and texture feature that is extracted contributes to the improvement of classification accuracy; thus, to select the best features from a set is important. In this paper, we examine the feature selection methods for mass classification. We integrate a support vector machine (SVM)-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) procedure with a normalized mutual information feature selection (NMIFS) to avoid their singular disadvantages (the redundancy in the selected features of the SVM-RFE and the unoptimized classifier for the NMIFS) while retaining their advantages, and we propose a new feature selection method, which is called the SVM-RFE with an NMIFS filter (SRN). In addition to feature selection, we also study the initialization of mass segmentation. Different initialization methods are investigated, and we propose a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, with spatial constraints as the initialization step. In the experiments, 826 regions of interest (ROIs) from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography were used. All 826 were used in the classification experiments, and 413 ROIs were used in the feature selection experiments. Different feature selection methods, including F-score, Relief, SVM-RFE, SVM-RFE with a minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (mRMR) filter [SVM-RFE (mRMR)], and SRN, were used to select features and to compare mass classification results using the selected features. In the classification experiments, the linear discriminant analysis and the SVM classifiers were investigated. The accuracy that is obtained with the SVM classifier using the selected features obtained by the F-score, Relief, SVM-RFE, SVM-RFE (mRMR), and SRN methods are 88 %, 88 %, 90 %, 91 %, and 93 %, respectively, with a tenfold cross-validation procedure, and 91 %, 89 %, 92 %, 92 %, and 94 %, respectively, with a leave-one-out (LOO) scheme. We also compared the performance of the different feature selection methods using the receiver operating characteristic analysis and the areas under the curve (AUCs). The AUCs for the F-score, Relief, SVM-RFE, SVM-RFE (mRMR), and SRN methods are 0.9014, 0.8916, 0.9121, 0.9236, and 0.9439, respectively, with a tenfold cross-validation procedure, and are 0.9312, 0.9178, 0.9324, 0.9413, and 0.9615, respectively, with a LOO scheme. Both the accuracy and AUC values show that the proposed SRN feature selection method has the best performance. In addition to the accuracy and the AUC, we also measured the significance between the two best feature selection methods, i.e., the SVM-RFE (mRMR) and the proposed SRN method. Experimental results show that the proposed SRN method is significantly more accurate than the SVM-RFE (mRMR) (p = 0.011). © 2014 IEEE.

Secondly, the basic probability assignment for capacitor state was determined according to fuzzy membership functions to avoid the subjectivity of membership assigned with expert experiences, and the membership function parameters were established by a minimum fuzzy optimization model. Finally, the different evidences were integrated by D-S combination rule, and according to BPA decision rule, the condition of the energy storage capacitor in practical operation can be assessed. By using the method proposed and the operation data, the current state of the energy-storage capacitors were obtained, and the evaluation study results demonstrate its effectiveness.
