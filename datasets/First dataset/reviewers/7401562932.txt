84938558299	Search for heavy vector-like quarks coupling to light quarks in proton-proton collisions at √s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	This Letter presents a search for singly produced vector-like quarks, Q, coupling to light quarks, q. The search is sensitive to both charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) processes, pp→Qq→Wqq<sup>'</sup> and pp→Qq→Zqq<sup>'</sup> with a leptonic decay of the vector gauge boson. In 1.04fb<sup>-1</sup> of data taken in 2011 by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy √s=7 TeV, no evidence of such heavy vector-like quarks is observed above the expected Standard Model background.

84938558480	Measurement of the t-channel single top-quark production cross section in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	We report a measurement of the cross section of single top-quark production in the t-channel using 1.04 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp collision data at s=7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Selected events feature one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets, exactly one of them identified as originating from a b quark.

A BUU model is applied to simulate the flow in both symmetric(Ni + Ni, Pb + Pb) and asymmetric(Pb + Ni) systems. It is shown that at above several hundreds MeV / u, the flow signals are very obvious and depend clearly on the centrality of the collisions.

0033705911	Modeling of damage creation in metallic materials under swift heavy ion irradiations	A variety of recent experiments in metallic targets unambiguously prove that a dense electron excitation induces atomic displacements leading to bulk damage. However, till now there is no convincing theoretical model that explains these. In the present work, a model based on the thermal spike mechanism has been proposed to account for the experimental evidence and a microscopic energy transfer mechanism between excited electrons and target atoms. This model follows four stages in the time scale of events: (1) ejection of target electrons and atoms, (2) slowing down of ejected electrons and thermalization of target valence electrons, (3) conversion of energy from thermalized electrons to target atoms, and (4) structural modification of the target. The characteristics of energy transfers are indirect and coherent in space and time. Based on mathematical developments of this model, electronic energy loss-induced thermal spike process and accompanying defect evolution are numerically simulated. In a collective process involving many neighboring target atoms, this thermal spike process is sufficient to result in micro structure modification in the bulk of metallic materials. Therefore, in the framework of this model, experimental results available in metallic materials can be explained. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

40749083883	Dynamical analysis on heavy-ion fusion reactions near Coulomb barrier	The shell correction is proposed in the improved isospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics (ImIQMD) model, which plays an important role in heavy-ion fusion reactions near Coulomb barrier. By using the ImIQMD model, the static and dynamical fusion barriers, dynamical barrier distribution in the fusion reactions are analyzed systematically. The fusion and capture excitation functions for a series of reaction systems are calculated and compared with experimental data. It is found that the fusion cross sections for neutron-rich systems increase obviously, and the strong shell effects of two colliding nuclei result in a decrease of the fusion cross sections at the sub-barrier energies. The lowering of the dynamical fusion barriers favors the enhancement of the sub-barrier fusion cross sections, which is related to the nucleon transfer and the neck formation in the fusion reactions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.

Collisions in the region of suprasaturation densities of the dense baryonic matter formed in heavy-ion collisions dominate the yields of strangeness production. Total multiplicities as functions of incident energies and collision centralities are calculated with the Skyrme parameter SLy6. The excitation function of strangeness production is analyzed and also compared with the KaoS data for K⊃+ production in the reactions C12+C12 and Au197+Au197. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

In particular, the drift time of the ionization electrons is measured and used to assess the intrinsic uniformity of the calorimeter gaps and estimate its impact on the constant term of the energy resolution. The drift times of electrons in the cells of the second layer of the calorimeter are uniform at the level of 1.3% in the barrel and 2.8% in the endcaps.

79851511364	Readiness of the ATLAS liquid argon calorimeter for LHC collisions	The ATLAS liquid argon calorimeter has been operating continuously since August 2006. At this time, only part of the calorimeter was readout, but since the beginning of 2008, all calorimeter cells have been connected to the ATLAS readout system in preparation for LHC collisions. This paper gives an overview of the liquid argon calorimeter performance measured in situ with random triggers, calibration data, cosmic muons, and LHC beam splash events. Results on the detector operation, timing performance, electronics noise, and gain stability are presented. High energy deposits from radiative cosmic muons and beam splash events allow to check the intrinsic constant term of the energy resolution. The uniformity of the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter response along η (averaged over Φ) is measured at the percent level using minimum ionizing cosmic muons. Finally, studies of electromagnetic showers from radiative muons have been used to cross-check the Monte Carlo simulation. The performance results obtained using the ATLAS readout, data acquisition, and reconstruction software indicate that the liquid argon calorimeter is well-prepared for collisions at the dawn of the LHC era. © 2010 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration.

This channel is particularly sensitive to supersymmetric particle cascade decays producing flavour correlated lepton pairs.

79960782937	Measurement of underlying event characteristics using charged particles in pp collisions at √s=900GeV and 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	Measurements of charged particle distributions, sensitive to the underlying event, have been performed with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements are based on data collected using a minimum-bias trigger to select proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 900 GeV and 7 TeV. The "underlying event" is defined as those aspects of a hadronic interaction attributed not to the hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest of the proton. Three regions are defined in azimuthal angle with respect to the highest transverse momentum charged particle in the event, such that the region transverse to the dominant momentum-flow is most sensitive to the underlying event.

Events were collected using a single-arm minimumbias trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are measured. Measurements in different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections. The results are compared to each other and to various Monte Carlo (MC) models, including a new AMBT1 pythia6 tune. In all the kinematic regions considered, the particle multiplicities are higher than predicted by the MC models. The central charged-particle multiplicity per event and unit of pseudorapidity, for tracks with pT < 100 MeV, is measured to be 3.483±0.009 (stat)±0.106 (syst) at s = 0.9 TeV and 5.630±0.003 (stat)±0.169 (syst) at s = 7 TeV. © 2011 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration, published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd for the Institute of Physics and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

Cross sections are measured differentially in terms of Δη<sup>F</sup>, the larger of the pseudorapidity regions extending to the limits of the ATLAS sensitivity, at η = ±4.9, in which no final state particles are produced above a transverse momentum threshold p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf>. The measurements span the region 0 < Δη<sup>F</sup> < 8 for 200 MeV < p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf> < 800 MeV. At small Δη<sup>F</sup>, the data test the reliability of hadronisation models in describing rapidity and transverse momentum fluctuations in final state particle production. The measurements at larger gap sizes are dominated by contributions from the single diffractive dissociation process (pp →Xp), enhanced by double dissociation (pp → XY) where the invariant mass of the lighter of the two dissociation systems satisfies M<inf>Y</inf> < 7 GeV. The resulting cross section is dσ/dΔη<sup>F</sup> ≈1 mb for Δη<sup>F</sup> > 3. The large rapidity gap data are used to constrain the value of the Pomeron intercept appropriate to triple Regge models of soft diffraction. The cross section integrated over all gap sizes is compared with other LHC inelastic cross section measurements.

Data collected in 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC, with a minimum bias trigger, are used for comparisons with simulated events. The reconstructed secondary vertices have spatial resolutions ranging from ∼ 200μm to 1 mm.

Events are selected with a single lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum and at least four jets of which at least one jet is identified as coming from a b-quark. A kinematic fit is used to reconstruct the tt event topology. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The measured value of AC is AC =−0.019±0.028 (stat.)±0.024 (syst.), consistent with the prediction from the MC@NLO Monte Carlo generator of AC = 0.006±0.002.

The tt events are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two identified b-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central rapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto is presented as a function of this threshold for four different central rapidity interval definitions. An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each rapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are corrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models implemented in MC@NLO, POWHEG, ALPGEN and SHERPA. The experimental uncertainties are often smaller than the spread of theoretical predictions, allowing deviations between data and theory to be observed in some regions of phase space.

84876441033	Jet energy measurement with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at √s =7 TeV	The jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb<sup>−1</sup>. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R = 0.4 or R = 0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta pT ≥ 20 GeV and pseudorapidities |η| < 4.5. The jet energy systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations. The jet energy uncertainty is less than 2.5 % in the central calorimeter region (|η| < 0.8) for jets with 60 ≤ pT < 800 GeV, and is maximally 14 % for pT < 30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2 ≤ |η| < 4.5. The jet energy is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon pT, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-pT jets recoiling against a high-pT jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, aiming for an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The systematic uncertainty of the jet energy determined from a combination of in situ techniques is consistent with the one derived from single hadron response measurements over a wide kinematic range. The nominal corrections and uncertainties are derived for isolated jets in an inclusive sample of high-pT jets. Special cases such as event topologies with close-by jets, or selections of samples with an enhanced content of jets originating from light quarks, heavy quarks or gluons are also discussed and the corresponding uncertainties are determined.

The luminosity is independently determined using several detectors and multiple algorithms, each having different acceptances, systematic uncertainties and sensitivity to background. The ratios of the luminosities obtained from these methods are monitored as a function of time and of μ, the average number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. Residual time- and μ-dependence between the methods is less than 2% for 0 < μ < 2.5. Absolute luminosity calibrations, performed using beam separation scans, have a common systematic uncertainty of ±11%, dominated by the measurement of the LHC beam currents. After calibration, the luminosities obtained from the different methods differ by at most ±2%.

0039927224	Isospin effects on radial expansion flow	Within the framework of an isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model which includes isospin-dependent symmetry energy, Coulomb energy, nucleon-nucleon cross sections, Pauli blocking, and initialization, we have shown that there is a strong isospin dependence of the radial expansion flow from the symmetric central collisions at incident energies of a few hundred MeV per nucleon. It is found that the more neutron-rich system exhibits smaller radial expansion flow, which is shown to result from the isospin dependence of nucleon-nucleon cross sections and to be independent of the nuclear symmetry energy. It suggests that the experimental measurement of the radial expansion flow for reaction systems with different ratios of neutron to proton provide a novel method for determining the isospin dependent in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections.

Therefore NaI crystal is not a suitable medium of composite detectors for high energy γ ray duo to low efficiency, Doppler broadening and distortion to γ spectrum in comparison with BGO crystal. The composite BGO detectors have many advantages such as large photopeak efficiency, small Doppler effect and regular γ spectrum.

The experiment was conducted at Jefferson Lab in Hall A using a 5.9-GeV electron beam. Three types of hadrons (π±, K±, and proton) were detected in the transverse hadron momentum range 0.54 <pT< 0.74 GeV/c. The range of xF for pions was -0.29 <xF< -0.23 and for kaons was -0.25 <xF< -0.18. The observed asymmetry strongly depends on the type of hadron. A positive asymmetry is observed for π+ and K+. A negative asymmetry is observed for π-. The magnitudes of the asymmetries follow |Aπ-|<|Aπ+|<|AK+|. The K- and proton asymmetries are consistent with zero within the experimental uncertainties.

84903530478	Time-dependent isospin composition of particles emitted in fission events following Ar 40 + Au 197 at 35 MeV/u	Fission fragments resulting from the fission of target-like nuclei produced in the Ar40+Au197 reaction at 35 MeV/u are measured in coincidence with the emitted light charged particles (LCPs). Comparison of the N/Z composition of the LCPs at middle and large angles in the laboratory frame shows that particles emitted at smaller angles, which contain a larger contribution from dynamical emission, are more neutron rich. A moving-source model is used to fit the energy spectra of the hydrogen isotopes. A hierarchy from proton to deuteron and triton is observed in the multiplicity ratio between the intermediate velocity source and the compound nucleus source. This ratio is sensitive to the dynamical emission at early stages of the reaction and to statistical emission lasting up to the scission point. Calculations with the improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD) transport-model qualitatively support the picture that more free and bound neutrons are emitted during the early stage, showing a clear dependence of N/Z on the parametrization of the symmetry energy. The time-dependent isospin composition of the emitted particles thus may be used to probe the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The knocked-out proton was detected in coincidence with a proton or neutron recoiling almost back to back to the missing momentum, leaving the residual A=2 system at low excitation energy. These data were used to identify two-nucleon short-range correlated pairs and to deduce their isospin structure as a function of missing momentum, in a region where the nucleon-nucleon (NN) force is expected to change from predominantly tensor to repulsive. The abundance of neutron-proton pairs is reduced as the nucleon momentum increases beyond ∼500MeV/c. The extracted fraction of proton-proton pairs is small and almost independent of the missing momentum. Our data are compared with calculations of two-nucleon momentum distributions in He4 and discussed in the context of probing the elusive repulsive component of the NN force. © 2014 American Physical Society.

Assuming time-reversal invariance, this asymmetry is strictly zero in the Born approximation but can be nonzero if two-photon-exchange contributions are included. The experiment, conducted at Jefferson Lab using a 5.89 GeV electron beam, covers a range of 1.7<W<2.9GeV, 1.0<Q2<4.0GeV2 and 0.16<x<0.65.

Experiment test indicates that the position resolution of the chambers is about 0.5mm and the position determination efficiency is larger than 90 % for the low Z particles at intermediate energies. This kind of chamber can then be used to detect the direction of the incident particle and to record the absolute number of the particles which really hit the target, or to detect the emitting angle of the outgoing particles.

10044254489	Low pressure two dimensional position sensitive multiwire proportional chamber for the radioactive ion beam experiment	Low pressure two dimensional position sensitive multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC) was developed to be used to study the nuclear reaction induced by radioactive ion beam. Each detector has a 50 mm × 50 mm sensitive area and consists of three grids (x-position, cathode, y-position). The position was determined through delay line readout mode. The detectors have good beam transparency and are also adequate to be used in vacuum. The MWPC was tested at a pressure of 800 Pa of n-heptane and a bias voltage of 720 V. The test results indicate that two track position resolution of the chamber is Δx = Δy = l mm and position determination efficiency is larger than 80% for the low Z particle at intermediate energies. This kind of chamber can be used to determine the direction of the incident particle and to detect the emitting angle of the reaction products.
