79952322190	Simple calibration of a phase-based 3D imaging system based on uneven fringe projection	Phase-based fringe projection metrology systems have been widely used to obtain the shape of 3D objects. One vital step is calibration, which defines the relationship between the phase and depth data. Existing calibration methods are complicated because of the dependence of the relationship on the pixel position. In this Letter, a simple calibration procedure is introduced based on an uneven fringe projection technique, in which the relationship between phase and depth becomes independent of the pixel position and can be represented by a single polynomial function for all pixels. Therefore, given a set of discrete points with a known phase and depth in the measuring volume, the coefficient set of the polynomial function can be determined. A white plate having discrete markers with known separation is used to calibrate the 3D imaging system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed calibration method is simple to apply and can build up an accurate relationship between phase and depth data. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

Vibration-powered energy harvesting system is considered as a good source for generating micropower. A general layout of a vibration energy harvesting system based on a sandwiched (PZT-Si-PZT) rectangle cantilever with a nickel proof mass was proposed. For the optimization of the system, formula of the voltage and power output based upon an equivalent circuit of piezoelectric layer and ac-dc converter was deduced. For the vibration harvesting structure, lower resonance frequencies are usually preferred. In order to find the relationship of the cantilever length and proof mass on the resonance frequencies of the energy harvesting structure, computations using Microsoft Excel software were conducted. The results show that it would be advisable not to increase the cantilever length only in order to get lower resonance frequency. However, the resonance frequency of the structure can be reduced dramatically by the accession of a proof mass with reasonable weight, so that the whole structure can be optimized to fit its application in natural environment. This study provides some basic considerations for the design of piezoelectric-based vibration energy harvesting system for converting ambient vibrational energy into electricity. © 2009 American Vacuum Society.

73849118835	Thick film geometric parameters measurement by white light interferometry	White light interferometry has been widely used in 3D profile mapping during the past two decades. However, it has a shortcoming when the measured structure is coated with transparent film. A new algorithm based on the combination of white light interferometry and image segmentation technology for measuring the thick transparent film is presented in this paper. The new algorithm can derive the surface topography of the upper and the lower surfaces as well as the thickness of the thick film simultaneously. The system equips Mirau objectives controlled by a high precision piezoelectric transducer to perform the vertical scanning. When the film is thick enough, the extracted interferogram will have two separate sets of waveform or two independent zero-order-OPDs (optical path difference). Then a dynamic threshold setting process is achieved by the Otsu's method which is originally used in image segmentation. A comparison of a variety of coherent peak detecting algorithms is firstly given in this paper, followed by a brief introduction of Otsu's method. After the computer simulation testing, a film thickness standard is measured to illustrate the capabilities of the new algorithm. © 2009 SPIE.

78649910643	Fast and flexible calibration of a phase-based 3-D imaging system by uneven fringe projection	Phase-based 3-D fringe projection imaging systems have been widely studied because of the advantages of fullfield, high accuracy, fast acquisition and automatic processing. The calibration of phase-based 3-D systems is an important procedure, which builds up the relationship between the obtained absolute phase map and the depth information. In this paper, a fast and flexible calibration method for phase-based 3-D imaging systems is presented based on an uneven fringe projection method. The relationship between the measured phase and the object's depth is linear and independent of pixel position, so it is possible to calibrate the 3-D imaging system by using discrete markers (with known separation) on a white plate. Projecting uneven fringe pattern sets onto the plate can calculate the absolute phase of each marker. At the same time, the depth of the markers can be obtained by general camera calibration methods. Therefore, the linear relationship between the measured phase and the depth can be determined. The proposed method was applied to calibrate an existing phase-based 3-D imaging system which utilizes the uneven fringe projection technique. The entire calibration procedure does not require accurate movement of a reference plane within the measurement volume. The calibrated system was evaluated by measuring an accurately positioned white plate. Experimental results show that the proposed calibration method can easily build up an accurate relationship between the absolute phase and the depth information. © 2010 SPIE.

78650877878	Calibration of a phase-based 3D imaging system based on uneven fringe projection technique	We present a simple calibration method of the phase-based 3D imaging systems based on an uneven fringe projection method. The relationship between absolute phase and depth is linear and independent of pixel position, which can be represented by a polynomial function. By designing a plate having discrete markers with known separate distance in between on the plate surface and projecting uneven fringe pattern onto it, one can calculate the absolute phase of the centre on each marker. The 3D coordinates of all the markers can be obtained by a general CCD camera calibration method.

Three fringe patterns having the optimum fringe numbers are coded into the red, green and blue channels of a composite color image. The generated composite RGB image is projected onto a measured object surface from a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector and the deformed fringe patterns captured by a color CCD camera from a different viewpoint. The wrapped phase information will be calculated by the WFT algorithm. The WFT algorithm limits the processed image to a small area, so it can give much better phase near edges or discontinuities than FT algorithm. Applying the WFT algorithm to the three fringe patterns obtains three wrapped phase maps. An absolute phase map is calculated pixel by pixel from one composite RGB fringe pattern image after applying the optimum threefrequency selection method to the three obtained wrapped phase maps. Therefore, the proposed method can measure absolute phase of objects having discontinuous surfaces from one snapshot image. Experimental results on moving discontinuous objects show that the proposed method reliably obtains the absolute phase information. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Based on the experiments, it was proved that SPM VRR had correlations with the spring constant, the air damping constant, the effective mass of the cantilever, the contact spring constant, the contact damping constant between tip and sample, etc. Being different from the traditional theoretical analysis, other than the resonant frequency, a "leading coefficient" was proposed to describe the VRR. A conclusion was drawn after an experimental analysis that SPM's vibration rejecting ability can be improved by longer cantilever probe, softer sample surface, greater tip preload, and close-loop control for tip-sample interaction. More attention should be paid to a proper combination of the above parameters. © 2009 American Vacuum Society.

A vital step is calibration, which builds up the relationship between phase map and range image. The existing calibration methods are complicated because of using a precise translating stage or a 3D gauge block. Recently, we presented a simple method to convert phase into depth data by using a polynomial function and a plate having discrete markers on the surface with known distance in between. However, the initial position of all the markers needs to be determined manually and the X, Y coordinates are not calibrated. This paper presents a complete calibration method of phase calculation-based 3D imaging systems by using a plate having discrete markers on the surface with known distance in between. The absolute phase of each pixel can be calculated by projecting fringe pattern onto the plate. Each marker position can be determined by an automatic extraction algorithm, so the relative depth of each pixel to a chosen reference plane can be obtained. Therefore, coefficient set of the polynomial function for each pixel are determined by using the obtained absolute phase and depth data. In the meanwhile, pixel positions and the X, Y coordinates can be established by the parameters of the CCD camera. Experimental results and performance evaluation show that the proposed calibration method can easily build up the relationship between absolute phase map and range image in a simple way. © 2011 SPIE CCC code.

With the advent of DLP (Digital Light Processing) projectors, digital fringe pattern projection techniques have been widely studied in academia and applied to industries. The experimental data from living profile of fringe patterns show that the obtained intensity has some fluctuation, which cause the calculated phase data inaccuracy. This paper presents one software method to eliminate the fluctuation between fringe patterns. Four-step phase-shifting algorithm is used to calculate the wrapped phase data, so four fringe pattern images having pi/2 shift in between need to be captured. Because of the fluctuation of intensity, the captured fringe patterns have an up or down shift among the four images. By considering the histogram of each fringe pattern, we present one compensation method to eliminate the fluctuation between fringe patterns. Simulated data are first tested by generating fringe patterns with fluctuation. Then experimental data from a 3D imaging system demonstrate the validity for calculating the phase and shape information with high accuracy. The results show that the proposed method eliminates the fluctuation between fringe pattern images to give accurate shape data information. © 2011 SPIE CCC code.

However, when measuring the large step structure, the white light scanning interferometry has the problems of long time consumption and low signal utilization. In this paper, a kind of adaptive scanning technique is proposed to measure the large step structure to improve its efficiency. This technique can be realized in two ways-the pre-configuration mode and the auto-focusing mode. During the scanning process, the image collection is limited within the coherence area, and in other positions, the motion is speeded up. The adaptive scanning is driven by the nano-measuring machine (NMM) which reaches nanometer accuracy and is controlled by the measurement software. The testing result of 100μm step height shows that the adaptive scanning can improve the measuring efficiency dramatically compared with conventional fixed-step scanning and it keeps the same high accuracy. © 2013 SPIE.

84911396640	MEMS surface characterization based on white light phase shifting interferometry	This paper describes a new peak detecting algorithm combined carré phase shifting interferometry and white light interferometry. The new method can carry the fast, accurate and non-contact measurements. The testing system employs a Mirau objective on a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) based on a Zeiss microscope. Several numerical simulations are firstly carried to analyze its phase calculation errors due to the visibility variation in the white light interferogram. Afterwards, the centre of gravity method is adopted to concentrate the phase extraction on the zero-order fringe, which not only decreases the phase error, but also frees the data processing from the phase unwrapping procedure. The capabilities of the system and the proposed algorithm are evaluated through the measurements of a micro resonator and a 10μm standard step height.

84919645022	Analysis of decimation techniques to improve computational efficiency of a frequency-domain evaluation approach for real-time hybrid simulation	Accurate actuator tracking is critical to achieve reliable real-time hybrid simulation results for earthquake engineering research. The frequency-domain evaluation approach provides an innovative way for more quantitative post-simulation evaluation of actuator tracking errors compared with existing time domain based techniques. Utilizing the Fast Fourier Transform the approach analyzes the actuator error in terms of amplitude and phrase errors. Existing application of the approach requires using the complete length of the experimental data. To improve the computational efficiency, two techniques including data decimation and frequency decimation are analyzed to reduce the amount of data involved in the frequency-domain evaluation. The presented study aims to enhance the computational efficiency of the approach in order to utilize it for future on-line actuator tracking evaluation. Both computational simulation and laboratory experimental results are analyzed and recommendations on the two decimation factors are provided based on the findings from this study.
