84930631224	The clinical and bacteriological factors for optimal levofloxacin- containing triple therapy in second-line Helicobacter pylori eradication	Quinolone has the disadvantage of easily acquired drug resistance. It is important to prescribe it wisely for a high eradication rate. The current study aimed to determine the clinical and bacteriological factors for optimal levofloxacin-containing triple therapies in second-line H. pylori eradication. We enrolled a total of 158 H. pylori-infected patients who failed H. pylori eradication using the 7-day standard triple therapy (proton-pump inhibitor [PPI] twice daily, 500 mg clarithromycin twice daily, and 1 g amoxicillin twice daily). They were prescribed with either a 10-day (group A) or 14-day (group B) levofloxacin-containing triple therapy group (levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, and esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily for 10 days) by their clinicians. Follow-up studies to assess treatment responses were carried out 8 weeks later. The eradication rates attained by groups A and B were 73.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63.9-85.3%) and 90.5% (95% CI = 84.5-98.1%), respectively in the per protocol analysis (P = 0.008 in the per protocol analysis) and 67.1% (95% CI = 56.6-78.5%) and 84.8% (95% CI = 76.8-93.4%), respectively, in the intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.009). The subgroup analysis revealed that H. pylori eradication rates for group A patients with levofloxacin-susceptible strains were 92.9% (13/14) but it dropped to 12.5% (1/8) when levofloxacin-resistant strains existed. H. pylori was eradicated among all the group B patients with levofloxacin-susceptible strains, but only half of patients with levofloxacin-resistant strains were successfully eradicated. In conclusion, this study confirms the effectiveness of 14-day treatment. Importantly, the results imply that 10-day treatment duration should be optimal if a culture can be performed to confirm the existence of susceptible strains. The duration of H. pylori eradication and levofloxacin resistance were the influencing factors for successful treatment. This study suggests that tailored levofloxacin-containing therapy should be administered only for patients with susceptible strains because it can achieve >90% success rates. © 2014 Tai et al.

84929939615	Predicting the progress of caustic injury to complicated gastric outlet obstruction and esophageal stricture, using modified endoscopic mucosal injury grading scale	Severe caustic injury to the gastrointestinal tract carries a high risk of luminal strictures. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify predicting factors for progress of caustic injury to gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) and esophageal strictures (ES), using modified endoscopic mucosal injury grading scale. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with caustic injuries to the gastrointestinal tract in our hospital in the past 7 years. We enrolled 108 patients (49 male, 59 female, mean age 50.1 years, range 18-86) after applying strict exclusion criteria. All patients received early upper gastrointestinal endoscopy within 24 hours of ingestion. Grade III stomach injuries were found in 58 patients (53.7%); 43 (39.8%) esophageal, and 13 (12%) duodenal. Of the 108 patients, 10 (9.3%) died during the acute stage. Age over 60 years (OR 4.725, P = 0.029) was an independent risk factor of mortality for patients after corrosive injury. Among the 98 survivors, 36 developed luminal strictures (37.1%): ES in 18 patients (18.6%), GOO in 7 (7.2%), and both ES and GOO in 11 (11.3%). Grade III esophageal (OR 3.079, P = 0.039) or stomach (OR 18.972, P = 0.007) injuries were independent risk factors for obstructions. Age ≥60 years was the independent risk factor for mortality after corrosive injury of GI tract. Grade III injury of esophagus was the independent risk factor for development of ES. Grade III injury of stomach was the independent risk factor for development of GOO.

84935842747	Decreased Gastric Motility in Type II Diabetic Patients	Background. To differentiate gastric motility and sensation between type II diabetic patients and controls and explore different expressions of gastric motility peptides. Methods. Eleven type II diabetic patients and health volunteers of similar age and body mass index were invited. All underwent transabdominal ultrasound for gastric motility and visual analogue scales. Blood samples were taken for glucose and plasma peptides (ghrelin, motilin, and glucacon-like peptides-1) by ELISA method. Results. Gastric emptying was significantly slower in diabetic patients than controls (T50: 46.3 (28.0-52.3) min versus 20.8 (9.6-22.8) min, P ≤ 0.05) and less antral contractions in type II diabetic patients were observed (P = 0. 02). Fundus dimensions did not differ. There were a trend for less changes in gastrointestinal sensations in type II diabetic patients especially abdomen fullness, hunger, and abdominal discomfort. Although the serum peptides between the two groups were similar a trend for less serum GLP-1in type II diabetic patients was observed (P = 0. 098). Conclusion. Type II diabetic patients have delayed gastric emptying and less antral contractions than controls. The observation that there were lower serum GLP-1 in type II diabetic patients could offer a clue to suggest that delayed gastric emptying in diabetic patients is not mainly influenced by GLP-1.

17444412304	Mucin-producing cholangiocarcinoma: Clinical experience of 24 cases in 16 years	Objective. Mucin-producing cholangiocarcinoma (MPCC) is an uncommon biliary tract malignancy. This retrospective study was designed to investigate the clinical presentations, associated diseases, the value of tumor markers, and treatment and prognosis of MPCC. Material and methods. The study included 24 MPCC cases (7 M, 17 F) from 132 histopathology-proven cholangiocarcinoma patients seen between 1988 and 2003. MPCC and non-mucin-producing cholangiocarcinoma (non-MPCC) were compared. Results. Common clinical symptoms and signs included epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, fever and chills, jaundice, and anemia. Seventeen patients had mucobilia in surgical, cholangiographic, or CT findings. Biliary stones were found in 71% of MPCC patients. In detecting MPCC, a serum CA-19-9 level >120 U/ml had 73% sensitivity, 41% specificity, 25% positive predictive value, 85% negative predictive value, and 48% accuracy in the 132 cholangiocarcinoma patients. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates were 44.3%, 33.8%, 28.1%, 21.1%, and 21.1%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that tumor type (MPCC) was the only significant factor predicting survival when compared with non-MPCC patients in 5-year cumulative survival rates (21.1% versus 5.4%). MPCC patients receiving surgical resection had a prolonged median survival time (13 months versus 6 months) than those without resection. Conclusions. MPCC clinical presentations were similar to non-MPCC in Taiwan except for more jaundice, fever and chills. The major factor predisposing to MPCC was biliary stones. Using serum CA19-9 levels greater than 120 U/ml was a diagnostic aid to detecting MPCC patients. MPCC patients had a better prognosis than non-MPCC patients. The recommended treatment for MPCC is surgical resection. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

24644469119	Endoscopic findings and management of dengue patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding	There are 100 million cases of dengue infection, 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 25,000 deaths annually due to dengue worldwide. Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common type of severe hemorrhage in dengue fever. However, there are no reports about the clinical applications of endoscopic therapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGI) in dengue patients. From June 17, 2002 to January 30, 2003, 1,156 patients with confirmed dengue virus infection were treated at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. We analyzed those patients who had received endoscopic therapy for UGI. The characteristic endoscopic findings, therapeutic courses, and amount of blood component transfused were collected from their charts for statistical analysis. Among the 1,156 dengue patients, 97 (8.4%) had complications of UGI bleeding during hospitalization. The endoscopic findings included hemorrhagic (and/or erosive) gastritis in 67% of the patients, gastric ulcer in 57.7%, duodenal ulcer in 26.8%, and esophageal ulcer in 3.1%. Of the 73 patients with peptic ulcer, 42 (57.5%) met the endoscopic criteria (recent hemorrhage) for endoscopic hemostasis therapy. Peptic ulcer patients with recent hemorrhage required more transfusions with packed red blood cells (P = 0.002) and fresh frozen plasma (P = 0.05) than those without recent hemorrhage. Among these 42 patients with recent hemorrhage, endoscopic injection therapy was conducted in 15 patients (group A). The other 27 patients (group B) did not receive endoscopic therapy. After endoscopy, patients in group A required more transfusions with packed red blood cells (P = 0.03) and fresh frozen plasma (P = 0.014) than did patients in group B. There were no significant differences between groups A and B in duration of hospital stay and amounts of transfused platelet concentrate after endoscopy. Medical treatment with blood transfusion is the mainstay of management of UGI bleeding in dengue patients. Patients having peptic ulcer with recent hemorrhage require more transfusions with packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma for management of UGI bleeding than those without recent hemorrhage. However, when peptic ulcer with recent hemorrhage is encountered during the endoscopic procedure, endoscopic injection therapy is not an effective adjuvant treatment of hemostasis in dengue patients with UGI bleeding.

24644486917	Gastrointestinal tract cytomegalovirus disease in southwestern Taiwan: A clinical study of 1950 endoscopic biopsies	Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease occurs in adult patients with immune suppression. This study reviews and discusses the clinical settings, endoscopic features, and locations of GI CMV lesions. Methods: In total, 1950 endoscopic biopsy reports for all GI tract lesions in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung were retrospectively reviewed for CMV disease from 1999 to 2002. Only those patients found to be positive for viral inclusion bodies in tissue specimens, with further confirmation by special immunohistochemical staining, were enrolled in this study. Results: Our series showed that all 5 patients were immunosuppressed when attacked by the virus. The esophagus (n = 2) and colon (n = 2) were infected in 4 patients, while stomach was involved in one patient. Those patients with lesions of the esophagus and stomach followed a more-benign clinical course. Endoscopic examination showed 1 or more prominent ulcers in the distal esophagus and at the antrum of the stomach. Rare endoscopic findings of diffuse esophageal CMV disease and severe and extensive colitis were presented. The overall mortality rate was 20%, and all but 1 patient responded well to ganciclovir treatment. Conclusions: We emphasize that GI CMV disease is still rare in Taiwan. A high degree of suspicion for CMV disease is important when diagnosing immunosuppressed patients suffering from GI symptoms.

26844575946	Short report: Abnormal liver function in scrub typhus	Scrub typhus is one kind of rickettsial disease and may cause fever, cough, and skin rashes in infected humans. Regarding liver involvement, it was uncommon to be reported in previous medical literature from Western countries. This study observes the relationship between scrub typhus and liver function. From January 1998 to August 2003 in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan, we observed 30 patients with scrub typhus, and 29 of them had liver function abnormality. In these patients, we found 89.3% with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, 91.7% with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, 84.2% with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, and 38.5% with elevated total bilirubin levels. In our study, there is a close relationship between scrub typhus and impaired liver function tests. Therefore, if patients are found with fever of unknown origin and abnormal liver function, we should take scrub typhus into consideration.

31144459052	Upper gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors incidentally found by endoscopic examinations	Aim: This study shares Asian clinical experiences of carcinoid tumors that originated in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Methods: From May 1987 to June 2002, we had found only 13 cases of histologically confirmed carcinoid tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract by endoscopic examinations. There were eight males and five females. The mean age was 53.16±20.51 years that ranged from 26 to 82 years. Each of their clinical presentations, locations, tumor morphology, and size and the treatment outcome were analyzed and discussed. Results: One patient had a polypoid lesion at the lower esophagus, nine were stomach lesions and three located at the duodenum. All patients with polypoid and submucosal tumor types were of small size (<1.7 cm) and all patients survived after simple excision or polypectomy. Four of the five patients in tumor mass forms died and the tumors were more than 2.0 cm in size. Conclusion: Carcinoid tumors rarely originated from the upper gastrointestinal tract and are usually found accidentally after endoscopic study. Bigger size (more than 2 cm) tumor masses may indicate a more severe disease and poor prognosis. ©2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

3242799044	Factors influencing clinical applications of endoscopic balloon dilation for benign esophageal strictures	Background and Study Aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and clinical effectiveness of a controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon catheter in dilating benign esophageal strictures, and to assess factors influencing the effectiveness of this procedure. Patients and Methods: From February 2000 to June 2002, 25 patients with documented benign esophageal strictures at our hospital were enrolled and treated with CRE balloon dilation. There were 17 men and eight women, with ages ranging from 30 to 82 years. The average age of the enrolled patients was 56.1 years. All of the strictures were dilated using CRE dilators under direct visualization, without fluoroscopic monitoring. The dilation diameters were planned in series up to 15 mm using a "rule of three". If dysphagia and esophageal strictures recurred during the clinical follow-up after completion of a series of dilations, additional dilation was carried out until symptomatic relief was achieved. Effective treatment was defined as the ability of patients with or without repeated dilations to maintain a solid or semisolid diet for more than 12 months. Depending on the effectiveness and duration of treatment, the patients were divided into three groups: group A, the successful group in which the initial series of dilations was effective without the need for any additional dilation for recurrent strictures or dysphagia; group B, the relapse group, in which the initial series of dilations was effective, but additional dilations were needed due to recurrent strictures or dysphagia; and group C, the group in which the initial series of dilations failed or consecutive dilations could not be carried out due to intolerance. Results: The 25 patients received a total of 95 sessions of dilation (3.8 ± 1.2 sessions per patient). There were 11 patients in group A, 11 patients in group B, and three patients in group C. The median follow-up period was 16.5 months (range 12-32 months). The number of initial dilations required to achieve symptomatic relief showed a negative correlation with the pre-dilation diameter of the strictures (r = -0.92, P < 0.01). Thinner strictures required more dilations before symptomatic relief was achieved. In addition, the stricture length in group B (5.4 ± 3.4 cm) was significantly longer than that in group A (2.6 ± 1.1 cm) (P= 0.009). The overall success rate was 88% (22 of 25), including 100% in the 21 patients with a stricture length of less than 8 cm and 25% in the four patients with a stricture length more than 8 cm (P = 0.02). Conclusions: CRE balloon dilation without fluoroscopy is an effective treatment for esophageal strictures less than 8 cm in length. Pre-dilation diameter and stricture length are factors that influence the numbers of dilations required and the need for additional dilations. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

33748294467	Pseudoachalasia in a patient after truncal vagotomy surgery successfully treated by subsequent pneumatic dilations	Pseudoachalasia is a difficult condition for the clinician to differentiate from idiopathic achalasia even by manometry, radiological studies or endoscopy. Its etiology is usually associated with tumors. In most cases, the diagnosis is made after surgical explorations. The proposed pathogenesis of the disease is considered as mechanical obstruction of the distal esophagus or infiltration of the malignancy that affects the inhibitory neurons of the meyenteric plexus in the majority of cases. Surgery has been reported as a cause of pseudoachalasia. We report a 70-year-old man who suffered from deglutination disorder caused by pseudo-achalasia after truncal vagotomy. The patient was symptom-free after a nine-year follow-up and complete recovery of esophageal motility status from pseudoachalasia after pneumatic dilations. We also reviewed the literature of pseudoachalasia. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

34948855361	Esophageal motility differences among aged patients with achalasia: A Taiwan report	Background and Aim: There are limited reports on esophageal motility pressures in aged patients with achalasia and these are inconclusive. The aim of the present retrospective study was to understand the changes of esophageal motility in aged achalasia patients among the Taiwan population. Methods: Manometric studies of 49 patients with achalasia had been performed through January 1998 to June 2005. The findings of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) basal and residual pressures and esophageal body contraction amplitudes were calculated and compared between the older and younger patient groups at different age cut-offs. Results: Higher basal LES pressure increased significantly from the cut-off age of 65 years (i.e. patients over 65 had significantly higher basal LES pressure than younger patients: 37.0 ± 4.19 mmHg vs 30.0 ± 1.32 mmHg, P = 0.045). With patients ≥70 years old, it was more obvious (46.0 ± 3.7 mmHg vs 29.6 ± 1.2 mmHg, P = 0.001). Beginning at the cut-off age of 55, the LES residual pressure was significantly higher in older patients than those who were younger (14.0 ± 11.06 mmHg vs 11.1 ± 0.6 mmHg, P = 0.017). LES residual pressure is more significant in the older groups. A linear correlation between age and residual LES pressures (r = 0.383) was found. No differences were found in esophageal contraction pressure. Conclusions: Older achalasia patients in Taiwan have higher basal LES pressures, with a linear correlation between age and residual LES pressures. Age has no influence on esophageal contraction pressure. © 2006 The Authors.

39749118736	Endoscope-guided pneumatic dilatation of esophageal achalasia without fluoroscopy is another safe and effective treatment option: A report of Taiwan	This study reports the usefulness and safety of endoscope-guided pneumatic dilatation (PD) technique without using fluoroscopy. From January 1998 to June 2004, a total of 33 patients with achalasia, including 20 males and 13 females, received PD in our unit. The mean age was 48.5±17.5 years (range, 18 to 93 y). All patients underwent endoscopic-guided PD by using a centimeters diameter "Regiflex" balloon dilator (Microvasive, Watertown, MA). The results of PD were recorded and evaluated by symptom scores based on the frequency of attack of 3 major symptoms: dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain, both before, and then 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year after PD was performed. Thirty-three patients were treated, excellent results in 27, good results in 3, and failure in 3 (1 requiring surgical treatment later). Overall, we demonstrated that the technique is effective and safe option for achalasia treatment. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

60549107540	The role of barium esophagogram measurements in assessing achalasia patients after endoscope-guided pneumatic dilation	Only a few studies have been performed comparing subjective symptom improvements with objective improvement in esophageal emptying after pneumatic dilation (PD), and discrepancy existed. We evaluated whether esophagogram measurements adds to the traditional subjective symptoms scores in assessing achalasia patients after PD. We enrolled 32 new patients with achalasia who received endoscope-guided PD treatment between January 1998 and June 2004. Postdilation investigations were performed by using esophageal emptying on esophagogram prospectively in a blinded manner, along with symptom scores before and after PD at the initial investigation, 6 weeks later, and every 1 year thereafter. Our results showed that seven patients who noted complete relief showed less than 50% improvement in barium column height and esophageal diameter. There was no linear correlation between the degree of patient symptom improvement and esophageal emptying measured by esophagogram (r = 0.181, P = 0.322). A trend of association existed in the relationship between clinical remissions and initial post-PD esophageal emptying improvement (P = 0.067). In summary, the association between the post-PD symptom score improvement and degrees of esophageal emptying may be hampered by the small sample size in the current study. An additional objective parameter like esophagogram to the subjective symptom scores may be more optimal in assessing clinical remissions. © 2009 International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.

80052259224	Randomized comparison of two nonbismuth-containing rescue therapies for Helicobacter pylori	A triple therapy consisting of proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and metronidazole or tetracycline has been recommended as the second-line regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication if bismuth is not available. This study compared the efficacy of esomeprazole/amoxicillin/levofloxacin (EAL) and esomeprazole/amoxicillin/metronidazole (EAM) as second-line therapy for H pylori eradication. Methods: From April 2008 to September 2009, 90 patients who failed H pylori eradication using the standard triple therapy were randomized to receive either EAL (40 mg esomeprazole twice daily, 1 g amoxicillin twice daily and 500 mg levofloxacin once daily for 7 days) or EAM (40 mg esomeprazole twice daily, 1 g amoxicillin twice daily and 250 mg metronidazole 4 times daily for 14 days). The primary outcome variables were the rates of eradication, adverse events and compliance. Results: Our results demonstrated no differences in the eradication rates of the EAL and EAM groups in intention-to-treat analysis (68.9% versus 84.4%, respectively, P = 0.134) and per-protocol analysis (75.6% versus 88.4%, respectively, P = 0.160). Both groups exhibited similar drug compliance (EAL 95.6% versus EAM 100%, P = 0.494) and adverse events (EAL 13.3% versus EAM 8.9%, P = 0.739). Conclusions: The 14-day EAM regimen was not inferior to the 7-day EAL regimen for second-line anti-H Pylori therapy in Taiwan. It may be an option in hospitals where bismuth salts are not available. However, regional metronidazole resistance rate and extended length of levofloxacin-base therapy should be considered. Copyright © by the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

84887498456	Ten-day versus 14-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy for second-line anti- Helicobacter pylori eradication in Taiwan	Second-line Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication with fluoroquinolone-containing triple therapy is one of the recommended treatment options, but neither 7-day nor 10-day regimens provide >90% success rates. The current retrospective study aimed to clarify the effects of 10-day and 14-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapies for second-line H. pylori eradication in a Taiwanese cohort and to evaluate the potential clinical factors influencing eradication. A total of 200 patients who failed H. pylori eradication using the standard triple therapy were prescribed with either a 10-day (EAL-10) or a 14-day (EAL-14) levofloxacin-containing triple therapy group (levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, and esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily). Follow-up studies to assess treatment response were carried out 8 weeks later. Eradication rates attained by EAL-10 and EAL-14 were 75.6%; 95% CI = 63.9 -85.3% and 92.5%; 95% CI = 84.5 -98.1%, P = 0.002 in the per protocol analysis and 68%; 95% CI = 56.6 -78.5% and 86%; 95% CI = 76.8 -93.4%, P = 0.002 in the intention-to-treat analysis. The duration of H. pylori therapy is the independent risk factor of H. pylori eradication (P = 0.003). In conclusion, 14-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy can provide a >90% H. pylori eradication rate, but 10-day treatment duration may be suboptimal. The longer duration of H. pylori therapy (14 days) is the independent risk factor. © 2013 Wei-Chen Tai et al.

84897655382	Effect of liquid meals with different volumes on gastroesophageal reflux disease	Background and Aim: Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are often advised to avoid large meals, based on their complaints of increased symptoms after eating too much, and epidemiological evidence of a link between high volume intake and the presence of GERD. However, the precise effects of meal volume on gastroesophageal reflux have not been well studied. We aimed to clarify the effect of meal volume on acid regurgitation and symptoms in patients with GERD. Methods: Fifteen patients (10 female, 5 male; mean 54±10 years old) with GERD were studied twice each in random order, during 24h ambulatory pH monitoring. On one day, they consumed a 600mL liquid test meal three times (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), and on the other, they consumed a 300mL test meal six times (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and snack). Gastric fundus and antral areas and antral contractions were measured by transabdominal ultrasound. Symptoms were recorded using questionnaires. Results: During the 600mL regimen, there were more reflux episodes (17±4 vs 10±2, P=0.03) and a greater total acid reflux time (12.5±5.9% vs 5.5±3.6%; P=0.045) than the 300mL regimen. Both the cross-sectional area of the gastric fundus (P=0.024) and the number of antral contractions (P=0.014) were greater for the 600mL regimen. Conclusions: Larger meals are associated with distension of the gastric fundus and an increase in gastroesophageal reflux when compared with smaller, more frequent meals. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

42149108064	Effects of ginger on gastric emptying and motility in healthy humans	OBJECTIVE: Ginger has been reported to improve upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Little information about the effects of ginger on gastric motor function, exists, however. Our aim was to investigate the effects of ginger on gastric emptying, antral motility, proximal gastric dimensions, and postprandial symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers were studied twice in a randomized double-blind manner. After an 8 h fast, the volunteers ingested three ginger capsules (total 1200 mg) or placebo, followed after 1 h by 500 ml low-nutrient soup. Antral area, fundus area and diameter, and the frequency of antral contractions were measured using ultrasound at frequent intervals over 90 min, and the gastric half-emptying time was calculated from the change in antral area. Gastrointestinal sensations and appetite were scored using visual analog questionnaires. Data are expressed in terms of mean±standard error. RESULTS: Antral area decreased more rapidly (P<0.001) and the gastric half-emptying time was less after ginger than placebo ingestion (13.1±1.1 vs. 26.7±3.1 min, P<0.01), whereas the frequency of antral contractions was greater (P<0.005). Fundus dimensions did not differ, and there was no significant difference in any gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: Ginger accelerates gastric emptying and stimulates antral contractions in healthy volunteers. These effects could potentially be beneficial in symptomatic patient groups. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

4243159777	Sequential changes of serum aminotransferase levels in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome	Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerging infectious disease. To describe the hepatic injury caused by this disease, we report the sequential changes of serum transaminase in probable SARS patients during a hospital outbreak in southern Taiwan. From April to June, 2003, 52 probable SARS patients were hospitalized. Serial serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were retrospectively analyzed and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was also evaluated to correlate with the progression of this disease. Fifty-three percent of the patients had abnormal liver function during hospitalization. More than 70% of abnormal transaminase levels were mildly elevated. Most elevated levels were noted during the second week after onset of fever. Neither transaminase elevation nor HBsAg was related to the prognosis of SARS, and only advanced age was an independent predictor of poor outcome. Our study suggested that coronavirus causing SARS might induce liver damage.

47149116302	Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for predicting late esophageal varices rebleeding in cirrhotic patients	Background/Aims: Esophageal varices bleeding is a fatal complication of portal hypertension. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been used as a tool to predict mortality risk in cirrhotic patients. It is currently unknown if MELD score can be applied to predicting late esophageal varices rebleeding. The predictive ability of the MELD score for short-term esophageal varices rebleeding was studied. Methodology: Ninety-five cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices bleeding were enrolled with a follow up period of at least 3 months. All patients had undergone a successful hemostasis at admission. Initial admission MELD score and 3-months MELD were obtained to observe their correlation with the late esophageal varices rebleeding. Results: MELD score of 13 and 16 are the mean MELD score of the admission and 3-months respectively in the rebleeding group. The correlation between initial admission MELD score and late stage data showed a positive linear regression in the rebleeding patients (p=0.001, r=0.773) but not in the non-rebleeding group. Conclusions: The MELD score is a good predictor of short term esophageal varices rebleeding rate. At least 2 MELD score data is needed to evaluate the possibilities of rebleeding © H.G.E.

4644270058	Early abdominal sonographic findings in patients with dengue fever	Purpose. This study was conducted to evaluate the early sonographic findings in dengue hemorrhagic fever. Methods. From July 2002 to September 2002, 86 patients were referred to our center with suspected dengue fever during an outbreak of the disease in Taiwan. All the patients underwent immediate abdominal sonography when they arrived at our emergency room. The diagnosis of dengue fever was subsequently confirmed by serology in 65 patients. Results. All our patients had type 2 dengue fever, as confirmed by serologic tests. The sonographic features included a thickened gallbladder wall in 38 patients (59%), ascites in 24 patients (37%), splenomegaly in 22 patients (34%), and pleural effusion in 21 patients (32%); pleural effusion was either right-sided or bilateral. Conclusions. Abdominal sonography can be used as a first-line imaging modality in patients with suspected dengue fever to detect early signs suggestive of the disease prior to obtaining serologic confirmation test results, especially in a dengue fever epidemic area. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

64749106546	Clinical remission in endoscope-guided pneumatic dilation for the treatment of esophageal achalasia: 7-year follow-up results of a prospective investigation	Background and Aims: Prospective, long-term reports and predictors of outcome of endoscope-guided pneumatic dilation are lacking in the literature. The aim of this prospective 7-year follow-up study is to report the efficacy of endoscope-guided pneumatic dilation and determine the possible confounding factors related to remission. Methods: Between January 1998 and June 2004, 32 patients were enrolled. Each patient was treated with endoscope-guided pneumatic dilation and followed-up at regular intervals for a median of 4.5 years. Remission was determined with the use of a structured interview and a previously described symptom score. Cumulative remission rate was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method with assessment of symptom scores between grades before and after PD at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and then every year after. Possible confounding factors related to the remissions were analyzed by Cox's proportional hazard model. Results: Complete follow-up until August 2007 was obtained in 100% of all patients. Cumulative remissions were 1 year (86.7%), 2 years (86.7%), 3 years (80.0%), 4 years (76.5%), 5 years (72.9%), 6 years (61.7%), and 7 years (61.7%), respectively. Age is a relevant confounding factor to the remissions showing a worse outcome for those under 45 (p∈=∈0.046). One esophageal perforation occurred (3.3%). Conclusions: Endoscope-guided PD itself is safe and modestly effective for up to 7 years investigations in current study. Older patients (>45 years) have favorable overall clinical remissions. © 2009 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

64949137804	Sonographic findings in esophageal achalasia	Background: There are only three reports using conventional sonography to detect the gastroesophageal junction through the left lobe liver window in patients with achalasia, and the results were inconsistent. This study further characterizes the sonographic features of achalasia and compares them to characteristics of subjects with gastroesophageal malignancies. Methods: Conventional sonography was performed in 21 patients with achalasia (mean age 49.0 years, 11 male and 10 female, group A); 15 patients with malignancies at the gastroesophageal junction (n = 10) and cardiac of the stomach (n = 5) (mean age 55.3 years, 11 male and 4 female, group B); and 30 subjects with functional dyspepsia (mean age: 38.3 years, 15 male and 15 female, control group C). Results: The median esophageal wall thicknesses were 5.1 ± 2.3 mm (group A), 19.5 ± 7.8 mm (group B), and 3.3 ± 1.2 mm (group C). However, there was overlap in the esophageal wall thickness in groups A and C. Sonographic features in group A were regular hypoechoic thickening of the wall at the gastroesophageal junction; in group B, we found irregular hypoechoic thickening of the wall. Control subjects had a regular hypoechoic gastroesophageal wall. Dilated lumens of the distal esophagus were seen in all achalasia patients. Conclusion: Although conventional sonography is not a diagnostic tool for achalasia, it provides interesting sonographic information. It cannot reveal each layer of the wall of the lumen as endoscopic ultrasound does, but it may tentatively differentiate achalasia from malignancies and assists clinicians when endoscopic ultrasound is not available.

6944244845	Diarrhea in medical care workers with severe acute respiratory syndrome	Background and goal: Several known coronavirus species cause a variety of diseases, including respiratory or enteric diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interesting enteric symptoms of the medical care workers who were evidently infected with SARS by means of respiratory transmission. Study: Between May 1 and June 16, 2003, we enrolled 16 medical care workers who fulfilled the definition of probable SARS. Samples used for the detection of coronavirus RNA by RT-PCR were collected from throat and rectal swabs during acute phase. Serum anti-SARS IgG was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at the convalescent phase. Results: The incidence of watery diarrhea was 18.8% (3 of 16). The RT-PCR of coronavirus was positive in three (18.8%) of 16 throat swabs and in none (0%) of seven rectal swabs. Serum anti-coronavirus IgG was positive in 13 of the 15 patients (86.7%). The mortality rate was 6.25% (1 of 16). The diarrhea rate in our hospital was significantly lower in comparison with the 73% (55 of 75) of the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong (P = 0.000073), and similar to the 19.6% (27 of 138) of the hospital-acquired outbreak in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong (P = 0.798). In contrast to the high positive rate of feces RT-PCR (97%) in Amoy Gardens, our positive rate in rectal swab RT-PCT (0%) was significantly lower (P = 0.00000002). Conclusions: Hospital-acquired SARS cases infected mainly by respiratory route less commonly presented with diarrhea. Lower intestinal viral load, when the virus spread by respiratory route, may be contributive to lower diarrhea rate and lower positive rate in rectal swab RT-PCR.

76149092814	Endoscope-guided pneumatic dilation for treatment of esophageal achalasia	Pneumatic dilation (PD) is considered to be the first line nonsurgical therapy for achalasia. The principle of the procedure is to weaken the lower esophageal sphincter by tearing its muscle fibers by generating radial force. The endoscope-guided procedure is done without fluoroscopic control. Clinicians usually use a low-compliance balloon such as Rigiflex dilator to perform endoscope-guided PD for the treatment of esophageal achalasia. It has the advantage of determining mucosal injury during the dilation process, so that a repeat endoscopy is not needed to assess the mucosal tearing. Previous studies have shown that endoscope-guided PD is an efficient and safe nonsurgical therapy with results that compare well with other treatment modalities. Although the results may be promising, long-term follow-up is required in the near future. © 2010 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

76149130689	Gastric metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via a possible existing retrograde hematogenous pathway	Background and Aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tends to metastasize to extrahepatic organs. Stomach involvement has been seldom reported and has always been considered as direct invasion. This study aims to propose a possible existing pathway for the hematogenous metastasis of HCC to the stomach. Methods: Only seven cases with stomach involvement were found from 8267 HCC patients registered at our hospital between 2000 and 2007. Their laboratory data, the findings of computed tomography and upper endoscopy, therapeutic procedures, such as esophageal variceal banding ligation (EVL), and transhepatic arterial embolization (TAE) were further studied. Results: All seven patients were male. Liver cirrhosis was found in six patients (6/7 = 85.7%), HCC with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in six patients (6/7 = 85.7%), splenomegaly in five patients (5/7 = 71.4%) and esophageal varices in five patients (5/7 = 71.4%). Six patients underwent TAE and one patient underwent EVL before the development of HCC in the stomach. Four patients had HCC at the cardia, one patient at the anterior wall of the high body and two patients at the greater curvature of the high body, far away from the original HCC. Six patients eventually developed distant metastasis. HCC with gastric metastasis developed 53-126 days after TAE in five patients and 74 days after EVL in one patient. Conclusions: When cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension have HCC with PVT, a hematogenous pathway can exist for gastric metastasis of tumor thrombi involving hepatofugal flow to the stomach after TAE or EVL apart from the major pathway of direct invasion. © 2009 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

77955498404	Surveillance culture of endoscope to monitor the quality of high-level disinfection of gastrointestinal reprocessing	Background/Aims: Inadequate reprocessing of endoscopes or endoscopic accessories may result in iatrogenic infection and present a risk to public health. The aim of this study is to utilize microbiological cultures of endoscopes to assess the adequacy of standard reprocessing procedures. Methodology: A prospective study to randomly cultures of endoscopes and colonoscopies immediately after the completion of the decontamination cycle monthly. The samples were obtained by flushing 50 ml sterile distilled water to the internal channel and collected into a sterile container. These samples were incubated at 37°C and examined for bacterial growth. Results: A total of 49 cultures were obtained from June to December in year 2005. Three out of 7 were culture positive in the first month initially, but after prolonged the soaking duration to 25 minutes, the subsequent cultures were reduced to 1 positive sample only. The positive culture rate was 18.4% (9/49), and 44.4% (4/9) in Monoflora culture and 55.6% (5/9) in Multi-flora. Upper endoscopes decontaminated by automated endoscopic washing machine labeled as number 5 was found persistently culture positive with varied organisms despite vigorous manual cleaning and prolonged disinfectant soaking duration. At repair, the relief valve in the automated endoscopes washing machine was damaged and disconnected. After repair, subsequent cultures were negative. Conclusions: Endoscopy culturing is a useful method to assess the effectiveness of standard reprocessing procedures. Servicing of automated endoscope washer regularly is mandatory to minimize cross infection and quality assurance. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

78649698033	Predictors of rebleeding after initial hemostasis with epinephrine injection in high-risk ulcers	AIM: To identify the predictors of rebleeding after initial hemostasis with epinephrine injection (EI) in patients with high-risk ulcers. METHODS: Recent studies have revealed that endoscopic thermocoagulation, or clips alone or combined with EI are superior to EI alone to arrest ulcer bleeding. However, the reality is that EI monotherapy is still common in clinical practice. From October 2006 to April 2008, high-risk ulcer patients in whom hemorrhage was stopped after EI monotherapy were studied using clinical, laboratory and endoscopic variables. The patients were divided into 2 groups: sustained hemostasis and rebleeding. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients (144, sustained hemostasis; 31, rebleeding) were enrolled. Univariate analysis revealed that older age (≥ 60 years), advanced American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) status (category III, IV and V), shock, severe anemia (hemoglobin < 80 g/L), EI dose ≥ 12 mL and severe bleeding signs (SBS) including hematemesis or hematochezia were the factors which predicted rebleeding. However, only older age, severe anemia, high EI dose and SBS were independent predictors. Among 31 rebleeding patients, 10 (32.2%) underwent surgical hemostasis, 15 (48.4%) suffered from delayed hemostasis causing major complications and 13 (41.9%) died of these complications. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic EI monotherapy in patients with high-risk ulcers should be avoided. Initial hemostasis with thermocoagulation, clips or additional hemostasis after EI is mandatory for such patients to ensure better hemostatic status and to prevent subsequent rebleeding, surgery, morbidity and mortality.©2010 Baishideng.

78651470118	Impact of low-residue diet on bowel preparation for colonoscopy	BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on the effect of dietary residue on preparation for colonoscopy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a low-residue diet on the quality of bowel preparation. SETTING: Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical Center, Taiwan. PATIENTS: Eight hundred four consecutive patients (50.4 ± 11.6 y (range, 18-88 y), 43.6% female) undergoing colonoscopy between May 2008 and June 2009. INTERVENTION: Subjects were advised to consume a lowresidue diet for 2 days before the procedure, and they recorded food intake by use of diet diaries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The quality of bowel cleansing was evaluated using the Ottawa bowel preparation scale. Patient variables and details of each procedure were recorded, and factors that determined the quality of colon cleansing were determined. LIMITATIONS: Categories of foods consumed were recorded, but not the amount eaten, and diet diaries were completed retrospectively. RESULTS: Data from 789 patients were analyzed. Only 44.2% of patients adhered to a low-residue diet, and 39.3% of patients were inadequately prepared. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (P =.007), body mass index (P =.01), abdominal girth (P =.041), bowel habit tending to constipation (P =.015), and high-residue diet (P <.0001) were independent predictors of inadequate bowel preparation. There was a linear relationship between dietary residue score and bowel cleanliness score (r = -0.475; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: A low-residue diet for 2 days of before colonoscopy improves bowel cleansing, but compliance with this advice is poor. The importance of a low-residue diet should be emphasized to patients undergoing preparation for colonoscopy. © The ASCRS 2010.

78651483616	Effect of ginger on gastric motility and symptoms of functional dyspepsia	AIM: To evaluate the effects of ginger on gastric motility and emptying, abdominal symptoms, and hormones that influence motility in dyspepsia. METHODS: Eleven patients with functional dyspepsia were studied twice in a randomized double-blind manner. After an 8-h fast, the patients ingested three capsules that contained ginger (total 1.2 g) or placebo, followed after 1 h by 500 mL low-nutrient soup. Antral area, fundus area and diameter, and the frequency of antral contractions were measured using ultrasound at frequent intervals, and the gastric half-emptying time was calculated from the change in antral area. Gastrointestinal sensations and appetite were scored using visual analog questionnaires, and blood was taken for measurement of plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), motilin and ghrelin concentrations, at intervals throughout the study. RESULTS: Gastric emptying was more rapid after ginger than placebo [median (range) half-emptying time 12.3 (8.5-17.0) min after ginger, 16.1 (8.3-22.6) min after placebo, P ≤ 0.05]. There was a trend for more antral contractions (P = 0.06), but fundus dimensions and gastrointestinal symptoms did not differ, nor did serum concentrations of GLP-1, motilin and ghrelin. CONCLUSION: Ginger stimulated gastric emptying and antral contractions in patients with functional dyspepsia, but had no impact on gastrointestinal symptoms or gut peptides. © 2011 Baishideng.

0036094503	Endoscopic diagnosis of hookworm disease of the duodenum: A case report	Hookworm is one of the most common parasites in the world and usually high suspected from eosinophilia on blood examination or diagnosed from characteristic egg shape appearance on microscopic examination of faeces. A 78-year-old man complained of epigastric pain and intermittent black stool passage for 4 months. Laboratory data showed iron-deficiency anemia with microcytic hypochromic erythrocytes. Stool routine examination showed positive occult blood but there was no parasitic egg detected microscopically. Under the impression of peptic ulcer disease with chronic blood loss, upper endoscopy was performed. Many worms were found in the second portion of the duodenum incidentally by endoscopy. Necator americanus was diagnosed and eradicated successfully by mebendazole. It is always crucial to observe the distal duodenum carefully in upper endoscopy although parasite infestation is not suspected clinically, especially when a normal study for esophagus, stomach, and duodenal bulb.

80055088000	The effects of cefazolin on cirrhotic patients with acute variceal hemorrhage after endoscopic interventions	Background The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be instituted in any patient with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and that oral norfloxacin, intravenous ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are preferable. However, the antimicrobial spectrum of the first generation of cephalosporins (cefazolin) covers a wide range of bacteria species, including community-acquired strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but their efficacy as prophylactic antibiotics in cirrhotic patients with acute hemorrhage was seldom warranted in the literature. This study aimed to explore the effects of cefazolin on the outcome of cirrhotic patients with acute variceal hemorrhage after endoscopic interventions. Methods A cross-sectional, retrospective chart review study was conducted on cirrhotic patients with acute variceal hemorrhage who underwent endoscopic procedures in a medical center. Cirrhotic patients who did not receive antibiotics were classified as group A (n = 63) while patients who received intravenous cefazolin 1 g q8 h for 2-7 days were classified as group B (n = 50). The end points were the prevention of infection, length of hospital stay, time of rebleeding, and death. Results A total of 113 patients were studied (male/female: 82/31; age: 56.8 ± 13.5 years). The incidence of infection (including proven infections) and bacteremia were significantly lower in group B patients (38.1% vs. 16.0%, P = 0.010; 17.5% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.026; 9.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.033, respectively). The no prophylactic antibiotics treatment was the independent risk factor. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the source of bleeding, type of endoscopic intervention, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Actuarial probability of remaining free of early rebleeding (<7 days) was P = 0.105 by log-rank test for all cirrhosis patients and P = 0.085 for Child-Pugh class A patients. Conclusions The use of cefazolin in cirrhotic patients after endoscopic interventions for acute variceal hemorrhage reduced infections. A trend of actuarial probability of remaining free of early rebleeding (<7 days) was observed, especially in Child-Pugh class A patients. This study may be hampered by the small sample size and more large-scale studies are mandatory. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

80055097636	Is a biopsy necessary for colon polyps suitable for polypectomy when performing a colonoscopy?	Background: The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing in Taiwan. Adenomatous polyps are known to be precancerous lesions and need to be removed. New techniques like chromendoscopy, magnifying endoscopy, narrow band imaging and magnifying endoscopy with flexible spectral imaging color enhancement may improve the accuracy of identifying precancerous polyps but are not widely available in the real world. This study analyzed the conventional biopsy method in diagnosing early colon cancer and the necessity for subsequent surgery after polypectomy. Methods: From January 2002 to December 2007, 1027 adenomatous polypoid specimens taken from 720 patients who received polypectomy by conventional white light colonoscopy were studied. The pathologic reports of 26 specimens of early cancer or high grade dysplasia from 25 patients were analyzed. Protruding polyps were classified as pedunculated (o-Ip), subpedunculated (o-Isp) and sessile (o-Is). Results: Fourteen of the 26 specimens were type o-Ip, 10 were type o-Isp, and 2 were type o-Is. The pathologic reports were high grade dysplasia (n = 5), mucosal adenocarcinoma (n = 18) and submucosal adenocarcinoma (n = 3). Among these, 7 lesions from 7 patients received a randomized biopsy instead of immediate polypectomy. Adenoma was reported in 6 of them with only one malignancy detected (false negative rate: 86%). Eight patients received surgery. The mean follow-up period for these patients was 17 months, and none of them had recurrences. Conclusions: The randomized biopsy method for adenomatous polyps has a high false negative rate for early colon cancer and high grade dysplasia and is therefore not necessary in cases of protruding type polyps which can be removed by polypectomy. An adequate direct polypectomy may completely remove the protruding type of early colon cancer.

84858288229	Surveillance culture monitoring of double-balloon enteroscopy reprocessing with high-level disinfection	Background Inadequate reprocessing of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) or of endoscopic accessories may result in iatrogenic infections and present a risk to public health. Aim To use microbiological surveillance culture monitoring (SCM) to assess the adequacy of high-level disinfection (HLD) with standard reprocessing procedures of DBE. Materials and methods We performed a prospective study on cultures collected from DBEs that had been treated by HLD by an automated endoscope washing machine (AEWM) decontamination cycle. This study included 42 cases with 57 cultures, which were collected consecutively between October 2009 and December 2010. In 31 cases, 31 cultures were collected from oral route DBE (mean patient age, 68·9years), and in 23 cases, 26 cultures were collected from anal route DBE (mean patient age, 67·9years). The results obtained were compared with those of our previous study of SCM on gastroscopy (GS) and colonoscopy (CS). The samples were collected by flushing 50mL sterile distilled water into the suction channel and collecting the flow-through in a sterile container. The samples were then incubated at 37°C and examined for bacterial growth. Results Before HLD, the positive culture rate was 83·9% (26/31) for the oral route DBE and 100% (26/26) for the anal route DBE (P=0·0406). After HLD, the positive culture rate was 12·9% (4/31) for the oral route DBE and 19·2% (5/26) for the anal route DBE (P>0·05). A linear trend relationship was found between positive SCM and the length and category of diagnostic instruments - GS, CS, oral route DBE and anal route DBE. Conclusions Surveillance culture monitoring is a useful method to assess the effectiveness of HLD reprocessing of DBE. Machine washing may not achieve complete disinfection. Using AEWM regularly is mandatory to minimize cross-contamination and to ensure quality assurance. Additional procedures are necessary to employ for the longer and anal route DBE. © 2011 The Authors.

84858970668	Intravenous non-high-dose pantoprazole is equally effective as high-dose pantoprazole in preventing rebleeding among low risk patients with a bleeding peptic ulcer after initial endoscopic hemostasis	Background: Many studies have shown that high-dose proton-pumps inhibitors (PPI) do not further reduce the rate of rebleeding compared to non-high-dose PPIs but we do not know whether intravenous non-high-dose PPIs reduce rebleeding rates among patients at low risk (Rockall score < 6) or among those at high risk, both compared to high-dose PPIs. This retrospective case-controlled study aimed to identify the subgroups of these patients that might benefit from treatment with non-high-dose PPIs.Methods: Subjects who received high dose and non-high-dose pantoprazole for confirmed acute PU bleeding at a tertiary referral hospital were enrolled (n = 413). They were divided into sustained hemostasis (n = 324) and rebleeding groups (n = 89). The greedy method was applied to allow treatment-control random matching (1:1). Patients were randomly selected from the non-high-dose and high-dose PPI groups who had a high risk peptic ulcer bleeding (n = 104 in each group), and these were then subdivided to two subgroups (Rockall score ≥ 6 vs. < 6, n = 77 vs. 27).Results: An initial low hemoglobin level, serum creatinine level, and Rockall score were independent factors associated with rebleeding. After case-control matching, the significant variables between the non-high-dose and high-dose PPI groups for a Rockall score ≥ 6 were the rebleeding rate, and the amount of blood transfused. Case-controlled matching for the subgroup with a Rockall score < 6 showed that the rebleeding rate was similar for both groups (11.1% in each group).Conclusion: Intravenous non-high-dose pantoprazole is equally effective as high-dose pantoprazole when treating low risk patients with a Rockall sore were < 6 who have bleeding ulcers and high-risk stigmata after endoscopic hemostasis. © 2012 Liang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84859984311	Swab culture monitoring of automated endoscope reprocessors after high-level disinfection	AIM: To conduct a bacterial culture study for monitoring decontamination of automated endoscope reprocessors (AERs) after high-level disinfection (HLD). METHODS: From February 2006 to January 2011, authors conducted randomized consecutive sampling each month for 7 AERs. Authors collected a total of 420 swab cultures, including 300 cultures from 5 gastroscope AERs, and 120 cultures from 2 colonoscope AERs. Swab cultures were obtained from the residual water from the AERs after a full reprocessing cycle. Samples were cultured to test for aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: The positive culture rate of the AERs was 2.0% (6/300) for gastroscope AERs and 0.8% (1/120) for colonoscope AERs. All the positive cultures, including 6 from gastroscope and 1 from colonoscope AERs, showed monofloral colonization. Of the gastroscope AER samples, 50% (3/6) were colonized by aerobic bacterial and 50% (3/6) by fungal contaminations. CONCLUSION: A full reprocessing cycle of an AER with HLD is adequate for disinfection of the machine. Swab culture is a useful method for monitoring AER decontamination after each reprocessing cycle. Fungal contamination of AERs after reprocessing should also be kept in mind. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84860009385	2011 update on esophageal achalasia	There have been some breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal achalasia in the past few years. First, the introduction of high-resolution manometry with pressure topography plotting as a new diagnostic tool has made it possible to classify achalasia into three subtypes. The most favorable outcome is predicted for patients receiving treatment for type n achalasia (achalasia with compression). Patients with type I (classic achalasia) and type m achalasia (spastic achalasia) experience a less favorable outcome. Second, the first multicenter randomized controlled trial published by the European Achalasia Trial group reported 2-year follow-up results indicating that laparoscopic Heller myotomy was not superior to endoscopic pneumatic dilation (PD). Although the follow-up period was not long enough to reach a convincing conclusion, it merits the continued use of PD as a generally available technique in gastroenterology. Third, the novel endoscopic technique peroral endoscopic myotomy is a promising option for treating achalasia, but it requires increased experience and cautious evaluation. Despite all this good news, the bottom line is a real breakthrough from the basic studies to identify the actual cause of achalasia that may impede treatment success is still anticipated. © 2012 Baishideng.

84860154494	Randomized comparison of two non-bismuth-containing second-line rescue therapies for Helicobacter pylori	Background: Classical second-line anti-Helicobacter pylori includes proton-pump inhibitor, tetracycline, metronidazole, and bismuth salts, but alternative therapies are required owing to the restricted availability of the latter. Levofloxacin-containing triple therapy is recommended but is expensive. Besides, quinolone resistance in an endemic tuberculosis infection area like Taiwan is concerned. The low in vitro antibiotic resistance to amoxicillin and tetracycline in Taiwanese H. pylori strains implies that in vivo esomeprazole/amoxicillin/tetracycline (EAT) second-line rescue therapy may be effective. This study compared the efficacy of esomeprazole/amoxicillin/levofloxacin (EAL) and EAT second-line eradication therapies and determines the clinical factors influencing the efficacy of salvage regimens. Materials and methods: One hundred and twenty-eight patients who failed H. pylori eradication using the standard triple therapy for 7days are randomly assigned to either EAL group (esomeprazole 40mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1g twice daily, and levofloxacin 500mg once daily) for 7days or EAT group (esomeprazole 40mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1g twice daily, tetracycline 500mg four times daily) for 14days. Follow-up endoscopy or urea breath test was performed 8weeks later to assess treatment response. Results: The eradication rates of EAL and EAT groups were 78.1 versus 75.0%, p=.676 (in intention-to-treat analysis) and 80.3 versus 80%, p=.0964 (per-protocol analysis). Both groups exhibited similar drug compliance (95.3 vs 96.9%, p=.952) but more adverse events in the EAT group (6.3 vs 12.5%, p=.225). Conclusions: Despite low in vitro drug resistances to amoxicillin and tetracycline, the efficacy of 14-day EAT regimens attained an unacceptable report card of 75% eradication rates in intention-to-treat analysis and was not even superior to the 7-day EAL regimen. Drug-drug interaction between combined antibiotics should be considered other than in vivo drug resistances. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84861945576	Comparison of argon plasma coagulation in management of upper gastrointestinal angiodysplasia and gastric antral vascular ectasia hemorrhage	Background: Vascular ectasias, including gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) and angiodysplasia, are increasingly recognized as important sources of gastrointestinal bleeding. This study investigated and compared the efficacies and outcomes of treatment of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) angiodysplasia and GAVE hemorrhage by endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC).Methods: From January 2006 to December 2009, 46 patients diagnosed with upper GI bleeding caused by angiodysplasia or GAVE at a tertiary hospital were recruited into this study. They included 26 males and 20 females with an average age of 65.6 years (range, 45-90 years). All patients underwent APC for hemostasis during an endoscopic procedure. Parameters such as underlying co-morbidities, number of endoscopic treatment sessions, recurrent bleeding, and clinical outcomes during follow-up were analyzed.Results: The 46 patients with UGI vascular ectasia hemorrhage included 27 patients with angiodysplasia and 19 with GAVE. The patients with angiodysplasia were older than those with GAVE (71.6 ± 10.2 years versus 61.8 ± 11.9 years, P = 0.005). More GAVE patients than angiodysplasia patients had co-existing liver cirrhosis (63.2% versus 25.9%, P = 0.012). The patients with GAVE had a higher rate of recurrent bleeding (78.9% versus 7.4%, P < 0.001) and required more treatment sessions to achieve complete hemostasis (2.4 ± 1.4 versus 1.1 ± 0.1, P < 0.001) than those with angiodysplasia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that age greater than 60 years (odds ratio (OR) = 8.929, P = 0.003), GAVE (OR = 0.021, P < 0.001), and previous radiation therapy (OR = 11.667, P = 0.032) were associated with higher rates of recurrent bleeding. Further multivariate analysis revealed that GAVE was the only independent risk factor for recurrent bleeding after APC treatment (OR = 0.027, P < 0.001).Conclusion: Endoscopic hemostasis with APC is a safe treatment modality for both angiodysplasia and vascular ectasia bleeding.

84863989640	Risk factors influencing the outcome of peptic ulcer bleeding in end stage renal diseases after initial endoscopic haemostasis	Background and Aims: Patients suffering from peptic ulcer (PU) bleeding who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may encounter more adverse outcomes. The primary objective is to investigate the risk factors that influence the outcomes of ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with PU bleeding after successful initial endoscopic haemostasis. Methods: A total of 540 patients with PU bleeding after initial endoscopic haemostasis in a tertiary hospital were investigated retrospectively. They were sorted into three groups after randomised age-matched adjustment: ESRD group (n = 90), CKD group (n = 90) and control group (n = 360). Main outcome measurements were rebleeding, requirement for blood transfusion and surgery, length of hospital stay and mortality. Results: The rebleeding rates were 43% for the ESRD group vs. 21% for the CKD group vs. 12% for the control group (overall p = < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed the predictors of rebleeding were ESRD, time to endoscope, and non-high-dose proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) users. The risk factors for bleeding-related mortality were presence of moderate degree of CKD and ESRD group, time to endoscope, and Rockall score. All-cause mortality was related to presence of moderate degree of CKD and ESRD group, platelet count, time to endoscope, Rockall score and length of hospital stay. Conclusions: ESRD patients who suffered from PU bleeding were at risk of excessive rebleeding and mortality with frequent occurrence of delayed rebleeding. This study suggests that early endoscopy for initial haemostasis and high-dose intravenous PPI are associated with the reduction of rebleeding risk especially in patients with high Rockall scores. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84865579921	Surveillance cultures of samples obtained from biopsy channels and automated endoscope reprocessors after high-level disinfection of gastrointestinal endoscopes	Background: The instrument channels of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopes may be heavily contaminated with bacteria even after high-level disinfection (HLD). The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines emphasize the benefits of manually brushing endoscope channels and using automated endoscope reprocessors (AERs) for disinfecting endoscopes. In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of decontamination using reprocessors after HLD by comparing the cultured samples obtained from biopsy channels (BCs) of GI endoscopes and the internal surfaces of AERs.Methods: We conducted a 5-year prospective study. Every month random consecutive sampling was carried out after a complete reprocessing cycle; 420 rinse and swabs samples were collected from BCs and internal surface of AERs, respectively. Of the 420 rinse samples collected from the BC of the GI endoscopes, 300 were obtained from the BCs of gastroscopes and 120 from BCs of colonoscopes. Samples were collected by flushing the BCs with sterile distilled water, and swabbing the residual water from the AERs after reprocessing. These samples were cultured to detect the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria.Results: The number of culture-positive samples obtained from BCs (13.6%, 57/420) was significantly higher than that obtained from AERs (1.7%, 7/420). In addition, the number of culture-positive samples obtained from the BCs of gastroscopes (10.7%, 32/300) and colonoscopes (20.8%, 25/120) were significantly higher than that obtained from AER reprocess to gastroscopes (2.0%, 6/300) and AER reprocess to colonoscopes (0.8%, 1/120).Conclusions: Culturing rinse samples obtained from BCs provides a better indication of the effectiveness of the decontamination of GI endoscopes after HLD than culturing the swab samples obtained from the inner surfaces of AERs as the swab samples only indicate whether the AERs are free from microbial contamination or not. © 2012 Chiu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84866270143	The efficacy of second-line anti-helicobacter pylori therapy using an extended 14-day levofloxacin/amoxicillin/proton-pump inhibitor treatment - a pilot study	Background: Large meta-analyses of second-line Helicobacter pylori eradication with fluoroquinolone triple therapy have shown that neither 7-day nor 10-day therapy provides 90% or better treatment success. Reports describing second-line H. pylori eradication using 14-day fluoroquinolone-containing triple therapy are few. Current study aimed to determine the efficacy of a 14-day levofloxacin/amoxicillin/proton-pump inhibitor regimen as second-line therapy and the clinical factors influencing the outcome. Materials and methods: One-hundred and one patients who failed H. pylori eradication using the standard triple therapy for 7 days were randomly assigned to either a levofloxacin/amoxicillin/esomeprazole group (levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, and esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily for 14 days) or a esomeprazole/metronidazole/bismuth salt/tetracycline group (esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily, metronidazole 250 mg four times daily, tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg four times daily, and tetracycline 500 mg four times daily for 14 days). Follow-up to assess treatment response consisted of either endoscopy or a urea breath test, which were carried out 8 weeks later. Results: Eradication rates attained by levofloxacin/amoxicillin/esomeprazole and esomeprazole/metronidazole/bismuth salt/tetracycline treatments in the per-protocol analysis were 44/47 (93.6%; 95% CI = 86-99.8) and 43/47 (91.8%; 95% CI = 83.2-98.5). In the intention-to-treat analysis, these were 43/47 (86.3%; 95% CI = 76.5-96.1) in the LAE group (four lost to follow-up) and 43/50 (86%; 95% CI = 76-96) in the EMBT groups. The observed adverse events were 25.5% and 38.5% among the two groups. There was 100% drug compliance among the levofloxacin/amoxicillin/esomeprazole group. Levofloxacin-resistant strains occurred at a frequency of 32.3%. H. pylori eradication rates for the levofloxacin-susceptible strains and levofloxacin-resistant strains were 92% (11/12) and 33% (1/3) in the per-protocol analysis. Conclusions: A 14-day levofloxacin/amoxicillin/esomeprazole triple therapy approach provides a >90% per-protocol report card with the caveat that this approach is markedly less effective in the presence of fluoroquinolone resistance. Levofloxacin-resistant strains are increasing in Taiwan. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

0036923884	Caroli's disease - A report of two siblings	A 26-year-old man had suffered from several episodes of right upper-quadrant pain for 6 months. Abdominal ultrasonography showed multiple saccular dilatations of the intrahepatic biliary tract, with hepatolithiasis at the bilateral hepatic lobe. Abdominal computed tomography also revealed saccularly dilated intrahepatic ducts with hepatolithiasis. Communication between saccular dilatations of the intrahepatic biliary tract and normal bile ducts was demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Choledochal cyst type V (Caroli's disease) was diagnosed. The patient's 29-year-old sister was also diagnosed with Caroli's disease based on abdominal sonography. An ultrasonography survey was carried out on the family. Reports of Caroli's disease occurring in two siblings are rare in the literature. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84867879350	Impact factors for difficult cecal intubation during colonoscopy	BACKGROUND: There are no accepted means of identifying patients in whom colonoscopy is likely to be more difficult and allocate time accordingly. AIMS: To identify patient-related, endoscopist-related, and procedure-related factors associated with difficult cecal intubation. METHODS: This was a prospective study performed at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical Center, from January to December 2009. Data pertaining to patient information (age, sex, weight, waist circumference and buttock girth, bowel habit, and abdomen surgery history) were recorded prospectively. Procedure-specific information including the need to alter patient position, application of external compression, and cecal intubation time (CIT) was documented. RESULTS: A total of 859 consecutive patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 50.5±11.4 years. CIT was longer in women compared with men (410±195 vs. 376±224 s; P=0.021). Older patients had longer CITs-an additional 2.1 seconds for each incremental year (P=0.001), and poor bowel preparation increased CIT (P=0.019). Patients who required a position change or abdominal compression took longer to reach the cecum (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the importance of colon preparation and the need for abdominal compression and a change of position when performinga difficult colonoscopy.

84875239600	The effect of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after endoscopic interventions	Purpose: All previous studies reported the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with either a mixture of nonvariceal and variceal bleeding or variceal bleeding alone. Reports on sole peptic ulcers bleeding are lacking. We aimed to assess the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after endoscopic interventions and the risk factors associated with recurrent bleeding. Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective chart review study was conducted on 148 cirrhotic patients with acute peptic ulcer hemorrhage who underwent therapeutic endoscopic procedures. Patients who received prophylactic intravenous ceftriaxone were classified as group A (n = 38) and those who did not receive antibiotics were classified as group B (n = 110). The outcomes were prevention of infection, length of hospital stay, time of rebleeding, and death. Results: More patients suffered from recurrent bleeding and infection in group B than those in group A (28.2 vs. 5.3 %; p = 0.003, and 26.4 vs. 10.5 %; p = 0.043, respectively). The risk factors associated with recurrent bleeding were being male (OR = 3.4; p = 0.024), those with advanced stage of cirrhosis with Child-Pugh's class C (OR = 3.8; p < 0.001), and those without antibiotic prophylaxis (OR = 8.9; p = 0.003). The observed 30-day survival was virtually identical for both groups (p = 0.279). Conclusions: Antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients after endoscopic interventions for acute peptic ulcer hemorrhage reduced infections and decreased rebleeding. Male gender, cirrhosis Child-Pugh's class C, and no antibiotic prophylaxis were independent predictors of recurrent bleeding. Further studies should be directed to explore ways to improve the overall outcome of these patients. © 2012 Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.

84876423790	The Outcome of Prophylactic Intravenous Cefazolin and Ceftriaxone in Cirrhotic Patients at Different Clinical Stages of Disease after Endoscopic Interventions for Acute Variceal Hemorrhage	Antibiotic prophylaxis with norfloxacin, intravenous ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone has been recommended for cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage but little is known about intravenous cefazolin. This study aimed to compare the outcome of intravenous cefazolin and ceftriaxone as prophylactic antibiotics among cirrhotic patients at different clinical stages, and to identify the associated risk factors. The medical records of 713 patients with acute variceal bleeding who had received endoscopic procedures from were reviewed. Three hundred and eleven patients were entered for age-matched adjustment after strict exclusion criteria. After the adjustment, a total of 102 patients were enrolled and sorted into 2 groups according to the severity of cirrhosis: group A (Child's A patients, n = 51) and group B (Child's B and C patients, n = 51). The outcomes were prevention of infection, time of rebleeding, and death. Our subgroup analysis results failed to show a significant difference in infection prevention between patients who received prophylactic cefazolin and those who received ceftriaxone among Child's A patients (93.1% vs. 90.9%, p = 0.641); however, a trend of significance in favor of ceftriaxone prophylaxis (77.8% vs. 87.5%, p = 0.072) was seen among Child's B and C patients. More rebleeding cases were observed in patients who received cefazolin than in those who received ceftriaxone among Child's B and C patients (66.7% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.011) but not in Child's A patients (32% vs. 40.9%, p = 0.376). The risk factors associated with rebleeding were history of bleeding and use of prophylactic cefazolin among Child's B and C patients. In conclusion, this study suggests that prophylactic intravenous cefazolin may not be inferior to ceftriaxone in preventing infections and reducing rebleeding among Child's A cirrhotic patients after endoscopic interventions for acute variceal bleeding. Prophylactic intravenous ceftriaxone yields better outcome among Child's B and C patients. © 2013 Wu et al.

84878721323	The effects of endoscopic-guided balloon dilations in esophageal and gastric strictures caused by corrosive injuries	Background: Esophageal stricture (ES) and gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) can occurred in patients injured by the ingestion of corrosive agents. These complications may occur concurrently but has not been reported in the literature. The aims of this study are to assess the effects and complications of endoscopic-guided balloon dilations (EBD) in patients with corrosive-induced upper gastrointestinal strictures, either ES or GOO alone and simultaneous occurrences of both (ES + GOO).Methods: From July 2002 to December 2009, 36 patients with corrosive-induced upper gastrointestinal strictures in a tertiary hospital were recruited into this study. The patients were divided into three groups, ES group (n = 18), GOO (n = 7), and ES + GOO group (n = 11). All strictures were dilated under direct visualization by using through-the-scope balloon catheters to the end point of 15 mm. The end-point of treatment was successful ingestion of a solid or semisolid diet without additional dilation for more than 12 months.Results: These 36 patients included 15 males and 21 females with average age of 47 years ranging from 25 to 79 years. The success rates for ES group is significantly better than GOO and ES + GOO group (83.3% vs. 57.1% vs. 36.4% p = 0.035). Less complications were observed in ES group than in GOO and ES + GOO group (16.7% vs. 42.9% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.041). GOO group needed more sessions of dilations in order to achieve success dilations than ES and GOO groups (13.7 ± 4.9 vs. 6.1 ± 4.7 vs. 5.5 ± 2.1, p = 0.011).Conclusions: Corrosive injuries complicated with ES can be effectively and safely treated by EBD. However, the success rates declined significantly in patients with GOO with or without ES and amore complications occurred. © 2013 Chiu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84883524782	Current status in the treatment options for esophageal achalasia	Recent advances in the treatment of achalasia include the use of high-resolution manometry to predict the outcome of patients and the introduction of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The first multicenter randomized, controlled, 2-year follow-up study conducted by the European Achalasia Trial group indicated that laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) was not superior to pneumatic dilations (PD). Publications on the long-term success of laparoscopic surgery continue to emerge. In addition, laparoscopic single-site surgery is applicable to advanced laparoscopic operations such as LHM and anterior fundoplication. The optimal treatment option is an ongoing matter of debate. In this review, we provide an update of the current progress in the treatment of esophageal achalasia. Unless new conclusive data prove otherwise, LHM is considered the most durable treatment for achalasia at the expense of increased reflux-associated complications. However, PD is the first choice for non-surgical treatment and is more costeffective. Repeated PD according to an "on-demand" strategy based on symptom recurrence can achieve long-term remission. Decision making should be based on clinical evidence that identifies a subcategory of patients who would benefit from specific treatment options. POEM has shown promise but its long-term efficacy and safety need to be assessed further. © 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84884614538	Overexpression of galectin-3 enhances migration of colon cancer cells related to activation of the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway	Background Galectin-3 has been independently correlated with malignant behavior in human colon cancer. The involvement of galectin-3 in the invasiveness of colon cancer cells remains to be determined. We investigated whether galectin-3 was involved in the colon cancer cell migration mediated by certain kinase pathways. Methods We studied 2 colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1 and Caco2) and clinical samples. Immunostaining and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression of galectin-3 in vitro and in the clinical samples. Short hairpin RNA and overexpression of galectin-3 were used to study loss- and gain-of-function in a wound-healing assay and a Transwell migration assay, and Western blotting was used to study the Ras-Raf signaling pathway. Results Galectin-3 was expressed at lower levels in DLD- 1 than in Caco2 cells. The lower galectin-3 level in DLD-1 cells was associated with decreased cell migration, in comparison with that of Caco2 cells. Overexpression of galectin-3 increased the migration rate of DLD-1, while knockdown of galectin-3 decreased the migration. Overexpression of galectin-3 was correlated with increased lamellipodia formation and distal lung localization in a mouse model. The galectin-3 enhancement of DLD-1 cell migration was mediated by K-Ras, Raf and Erk1/2 pathway activation, but not the H-Ras, p38, or JNK activation. Conclusions Galectin-3 plays an important role in regulating colon cancer cell migration and potential distal localization. The galectin-3 enhancement of cell migration is mediated through the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway. Specific targeting of the K-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2 pathway may be useful for treating colon cancers associated with increased galectin-3 expression. © Springer 2012.

84887005630	Target-controlled infusion vsmanually controlled infusion of propofol with alfentanil for bidirectional endoscopy: A randomized controlled trial	Background and study aims: The best anesthesia methods for analgesia and sedation during gastrointestinal endoscopy are still debated. The aim of this study was to compare the recovery time, clinical presentations, and satisfaction between target-controlled infusion (TCI) and manually controlled infusion (MCI) in same-day bidirectional endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy followed by colonoscopy). Patients and methods: A total of 220 patients with American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1 or 2 were enrolled and randomized into the TCI or MCI groups.

0042233478	Correlation of the morphology and size of colonic polyps with their histology	Background: Colonic adenomatous polyps are premalignant lesions; early recognition and use of a polypectomy for these polyps can reduce the occurrence of colorectal cancer. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the complications of polypectomy and the relationship between the morphology and size of colonic polyps and their histology. Methods: Data on colonic polyps from 324 patients who received a polypectomy between April 1998 and December 2001 were collected. These included 207 men and 117 women, ranging in age between 17 and 86 years old, and who had had a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopic examination. A polypectomy was performed on those colonic polyps discovered, and their morphology, size, and histology were analyzed. Results: The histological findings of these polyps included adenoma, carcinoma, hyperplastic, and inflammatory polyps. One and a half percent (n = 6) were carcinomas, all of which belonged to the Yamada III or IV polyp group and were more than 1 cm in size, except for 1 polyp which was 0.7 cm. One case was complicated by colon perforation, and 2 cases experienced mild bleeding with no need for a blood transfusion or hospitalization. Conclusions: Morphology and size are closely related to the malignant change in colonic polyps. Colonic polyps with a size greater than 1 cm and classified as Yamada type III or IV have a higher potential for malignant change, and a polypectomy should be considered when they are discovered. A polypectomy is a safe procedure with only minor complications.

0041736477	Dengue fever with acute acalculous cholecystitis	Dengue fever (DF) with acute acalculous cholecystitis is rarely reported. To investigate the incidence, treatment, and prognosis of acute acalculous cholecystitis in DF patients, we retrospectively studied 10 patients with DF and acute acalculous cholecystitis. From October 2001 to July 2002, 131 patients were diagnosed with DF. Ten of 131 DF patients (7.63%) had complications of acute acalculous cholecystitis. Two patients underwent cholecystectomy and one underwent percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage due to poor resolution of acute acalculous cholecystitis. We found acute acalculous cholecystitis in a small proportion of patients with DF. In our experience, closely monitoring vital signs to avoid shock and correct thrombocytopenia to avoid bleeding could be adequate for most patients. In some cases, surgical treatment may be needed for DF fever patients with complications of diffuse peritonitis.

0142212205	Current treatment options in esophageal achalasia	Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus characterized by aperistalsis and failure of the lower esophagus to relax, resulting in symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain and weight loss. Manometric study is the gold standard for diagnosis, which must at least meet the criteria of the absence of or abnormal swallowing relaxation of the LES, and aperistalsis of the esophageal body. However, endoscopes and radiologic tests are often as important in distinguishing secondary achalasia caused by malignancy. Therapeutic trends for the treatment of esophageal achalasia have changed a great deal in past decades. These changes include endoscopic and minimally invasive surgical procedures such as laparoscopic or thoracoscopic cardiomyotomy, or more aggressively, cardioplasty or esophageal resection. In this review article, we discuss the benefits and outcomes of each individual option. To date, the results of minimally invasive surgical treatment seem to be better when compared to medical management or endoscopic procedures, despite the higher initial expenses, and pneumatic dilation provides the most cost-effective treatment option for achalasia under most clinically reasonable circumstances. Finally, one new trend in alternative treatment, botulinum toxin injection therapy, is used only in a small number of older of high-risk patients.

84900438918	The influential roles of antibiotics prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after initial endoscopic treatments	The influential roles of antibiotic prophylaxis on cirrhotic patients with peptic ulcer bleeding are still not well documented. The purpose of this study is to clarify these influential roles and to identify the risk factors associated with rebleeding, bacterial infection and in-hospital mortality. A cross-sectional, chart review study was conducted on 210 cirrhotic patients with acute peptic ulcer hemorrhage who underwent therapeutic endoscopic procedures. Patients were divided into group A (with prophylactic intravenous ceftriaxone, n = 74) and group B (without antibiotics, n = 136). The outcomes were length of hospital days, prevention of infection, rebleeding rate and in-hospital mortality. Our results showed that more patients suffered from rebleeding and infection in group B than group A (31.6% vs. 5.4%; p<0.001 and 25% vs. 10.8%; p = 0.014 respectively). The risk factors for rebleeding were active alcoholism, unit of blood transfusion, Rockall score, model for end-stage liver disease score and antibiotic prophylaxis. The risk factors for infection were active alcoholism, Child-Pugh C, Rockall score and antibiotic prophylaxis. Rockall score was the predictive factor for in-hospital mortality. In conclusions, antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients after endoscopic interventions for acute peptic ulcer hemorrhage reduced infections and rebleeding rate but not in-hospital mortality. Rockall score was the predictive factor of in-hospital mortality. © 2014 Yang et al.

84904823428	Outcome of holiday and nonholiday admission patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding: A real-world report from southern taiwan	Background. Recent findings suggest that patients admitted on the weekend with peptic ulcer bleeding might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, other reports found that there was no "holiday effect." The purpose of this study was to determine if these findings hold true for a real-life Taiwanese medical gastroenterology practice. Materials and Methods. We reviewed the medical files of hospital admissions for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding who received initial endoscopic hemostasis between January 2009 and March 2011. A total of 744 patients were enrolled (nonholiday group, n = 615; holiday group, n = 129) after applying strict exclusion criteria. Holidays were defined as weekends and national holidays in Taiwan. Results. Our results showed that there was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups. We also observed that, compared to the nonholiday group, patients in the holiday group received earlier endoscopy treatment (12.20 hours versus 16.68 hours, P = 0.005), needed less transfused blood (4.8 units versus 6.6 units, P = 0.02), shifted from intravenous to oral proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) more quickly (5.3 days versus 6.9 days, P = 0.05), and had shorter hospital stays (13.05 days versus 17.36 days, P = 0.005). In the holiday and nonholiday groups, the rebleeding rates were 17.8% and 23.41% (P = 0.167), the mortality rates were 11.63% versus 13.66% (P = 0.537), and surgery was required in 2.11% versus 4.66% (P = 0.093), respectively. Conclusions. Patients who presented with peptic ulcer bleeding on holidays did not experience delayed endoscopy or increased adverse outcomes. In fact, patients who received endoscopic hemostasis on the holiday had shorter waiting times, needed less transfused blood, switched to oral PPIs quicker, and experienced shorter hospital stays. © 2014 Tsung-Chin Wu et al.

84908655578	Levofloxacin-containing second-line anti-Helicobacter pylori eradication in Taiwanese real-world practice	Background: Quinolone-containing triple therapy is recommended as an option for non-bismuth containing second-line Helicobacter pylori eradication. Current available Taiwanese reports in the literature used 7-day quinolone-containing triple therapy. As a result, some physicians still prescribe 7-day regimens in real-world practice in Taiwan. This study aimed to further assess the appropriateness of 7-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy as second-line therapy. Methods: We enrolled 61 patients who failed H. pylori eradication using the standard triple therapy for 7 days and were prescribed levofloxacin-containing second-line triple therapy (levofloxacin 500 mg once daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, and esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily). Routine follow-up with either endoscopy or urea breath test was done 8 weeks later to assess treatment response. Results: The eradication rates were 78.7% in the intention-to-treat analysis and 81% in the per-protocol analysis. The incidence of adverse events was 6.6%. Drug compliance was 95.1%. Antibiotic resistance showed the following results: Amoxicillin (0%), levofloxacin (23.5%), clarythromycin (35.3%), metronidazole (17.6%), and tetracycline (0%). Conclusion: The 7-day levofloxacin-containing triple therapy provides an unacceptable per-protocol report card as the second-line treatment for anti-H. pylori eradication in Taiwan and should be modified by either extending the duration to 10-14 days or seeking other regimens.
