0029857657	How many fold types of protein are there in nature?	Many protein structures have now been determined and reveal that protein molecules can adopt the same fold despite having very different sequences. It has been suggested that, owing to different stereochemical constraints, the number of ways that a sequence can fold may be limited. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask how many fold types exist in nature. Several groups have tackled this problem with very different results. In the present study, a novel statistical sampling approach is used to reestimate this number. The results suggest that the number of protein folds in nature is probably several hundreds.

0029894582	Kinetic differentiation between ligand-induced and pre-existent asymmetric models	Negative cooperativity can be accounted for either by the pre-existent asymmetry model or by the ligand-induced sequential model. It is virtually impossible to deduce the mechanism of negatively cooperative interaction solely from the binding curves. Distinguishing between these two possible mechanisms for negative cooperativity usually requires experiments other than equilibrium binding. In the present communication, a kinetic method is proposed to distinguish between these two possible mechanisms for negative cooperativity. As an example of use of the new method, experimental data for the modification of creatine kinase by 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid were taken from literature and reanalyzed by using the present method. The result indicates that under conditions in which creatine kinase forms the postulated 'transition state analogue' complex, the two subunits in the enzyme molecule have different tertiary structures and behave as different types of subunit.

0029918937	Ascertaining the number of essential thiol groups for the folding of creatine kinase	Although the unfolding and refolding of proteins have been extensively studied in tile literature, relatively few attempts have been made to see how many residues of the total residues of a certain amino acid in an enzyme can be modified without seriously affecting its folding. Based on a statistical analysis of the quantitative relationship between the extent of modification of protein functional groups and the decrease in their biological activity, a method proposed by Tsou is widely used to determine the number of residues essential for the catalytic activity of modified proteins. In the present paper, Tsou's method is applied to determine the number of cysteine residues essential for the folding of creatine kinase. The thiol groups of the cysteine residues in fully unfolded creatine kinase were modified by 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol (MNP). The relationship between the number of MNP-groups introduced and the recovery of activity after refolding was determined. Quantitative treatment of the data by Tsou's plot shows that among the cysteine residues modified in each subunit of creatine kinase, only three are essential for its folding.

0029799477	Kinetics of inactivation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A by bromopyruvic acid	The kinetic theory of substrate reaction during the modification of enzyme activity has bee applied to a study of the inactivation kinetics of ribonuclease A by bromopyruvic acid. The results show that irreversible inhibition belongs to a non-competitive complexing type inhibition. On the basis of the kinetic equation of substrate reaction in the presence of the inhibitor, all microscopic kinetic constants for the free enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex and the enzyme-product complex have been determined. The non-competitive inhibition type indicates that neither the substrate nor the product affects the binding of bromopyruvic acid to the enzyme and that the ionization state of His-119 may be the same in both the enzyme-substrate and the enzyme-product complexes.

0030571611	Modeling substrate inhibition of microbial growth	This article presents a general equation for substrate inhibition microbial growth using a statistical thermodynamic approach. Existing empirical models adapted from enzyme kinetics, for example, the Haldane-Andrews equation, often criticized for not being physically based for microbial growth, are shown to derive from the general equation in this article, and their empirical parameters are shown to be well defined physically. Three sets of experimental data from the literature are used to test the modeling abilities of the general equation to represent experimental data. The results are compared with those obtained by fitting the same data set to a widely used empirical model existing in the literature. The general equation is found to represent all three experimental data sets better than the alternative model tested. In addition, a graphical method existing in enzyme kinetics is successfully adapted and further developed to determine the number of inhibition sites of a basic functional unit of a bacterial cell.

0030750819	Inactivation kinetics of the reduced spinach chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by subtilisin	The course of inactivation of the reduced spinach chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by digestion with subtilisin has been followed by the progress curve method [Tsou, C.L. (1988) Adv. Enzymol. 61, 381-436] and found to follow first-order kinetics. On the basis of the hydrolysis of the substrate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, at different concentrations during proteolysis by subtilisin, the first-order inactivation rate constants for the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex can both be determined. The ratio between the inactivation rate constants for the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex indicates strong protection against subtilisin proteolysis by the substrate. It is proposed that the above ratio can be used as a quantitative measure of substrate protection for enzyme inactivation generally. As it has been found that the site of proteolysis is located in a loop region near the N-terminus and well away from the active site, the substrate protection indicates a conformation change of the enzyme away from the substrate binding site.

0030773047	Characterization of the interactions between the small GTPase Cdc42 and its GTPase-activating proteins and putative effectors: Comparison of kinetic properties of Cdc42 binding to the Cdc42-interactive domains	The small GTPase Cde42 interacts with multiple factors to transduce diverse intracellular signals. The factors that preferentially recognize the GTP-bound, active state of Cdc42 include a panel of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), the Cde42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif-containing molecules, and the RasGAP domain containing IQGAP1 and IQGAP2. In the present study, we have determined the kinetic parameters underlying the functional interactions between the Cdc42-binding domains of some of these factors and Cdc42 by monitoring the continuous release of γP(i) and have compared the ability of the domains to bind to Cdc42. The catalytic efficiencies (K(cat)/K(m)) of the GAP domains of Bet, 3BP-1, and p190 on Cdc42 are found to be 60-, 160-, and over 500-fold less than that of Cdc42GAP, respectively, and the differences are due, to a large part, to differences in K(m). The K(m) Values of the GAP domains compare well to the binding affinity to the guanylyl imidodiphosphatebound Cdc42, suggesting a rapid equilibrium reaction mechanism. The affinity of the Cdc42-binding domains of the CRIB motif of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein and p21(cdc42/rac)activated kinase 1, and the RasGAP-related domain of IQGAP1, which all inhibit the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42, are found to be 4, 0.7, and 0.08 μM, respectively. These quantitative analysis provide insight that Cdc42GAP functions as an effective negative regulator of Cdc42 by fast, relatively tight binding to the GTP-bound Cdc42, whereas IQGAP1 interacts with Cdc42 as a putative effector with over 10-fold higher affinity than the CRIB domains and GAPs, and suggest that various GAPs and effectors employ distinct mechanism to play roles in Cdc42-mediated signaling pathways.

0030993278	Inactivation kinetics of dihydrofolate reductase from Chinese hamster during urea denaturation	The kinetic theory of substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity has been applied to the study of inactivation kinetics of Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase by urea. On the basis of the kinetic equation of substrate reaction in the presence of urea, all microscopic kinetic constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate binary and ternary complexes have been determined. The results of the present study indicate that the denaturation of dihydrofolate reductase by urea follows single-phase kinetics, and changes in enzyme activity and tertiary structure proceed simultaneously in the unfolding process. Both substrates, NADPH and 7,8-dihydrofolate, protect dihydrofolate reductase against inactivation, and enzyme-substrate complexes lose their activity less rapidly than the free enzyme.

This equation has been extended to analyze the spectroscopic titration experiment where the dilution of protein solution cannot be neglected, the displacement study, and the effect of non-specific binding. Thus, with a non-linear regression program, all unknown binding parameters can be determined correctly by fitting these equations to the experimental data without any data transformation. As an example of the use of the new equations, the experimental data for receptor-insulin binding were taken from literature and reanalyzed by using a non-linear regression data analysis program.

0031815861	A re-estimation for the total numbers of protein folds and superfamilies	The issue of the number of protein folds is steeped in controversy despite its significance for understanding evolution and predicting protein structure from amino acid sequence. Using various assumptions, several research groups have tackled this problem with very different results. In the present study, a more rigorous statistical approach is used to address this question. From three different data sets, the total number of protein folds is estimated to be about 650. A detailed theoretical analysis suggests that (i) a random sample of non-transmembrane protein families has been selected for crystallization and structural determination, (ii) except for about 40 folds, most protein folds occurring in nature contain about the same number of different protein families. With the estimation of the total number of protein folds, the number of naturally occurring superfamilies can then be estimated as 1150.

0031442554	Substrate induced reactivation of spinach ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase denaturated by low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride	The unfolding and refolding bahavior of the hexadecameric ribulose-1,5- biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) from spinach in solutions of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was studied. By a number of criteria (enzyme activity, protein fluorescence, circular dichroism), the enzyme was judged to be almost completely unfolded in 6 M GdnHCl. The changes in enzyme activity occur at low concentrations of GdnHcl than those required to bring about changes in circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence, as has been found for other enzymes. Spinach Rubisco is completely inactive in 0.5 M GdnHCl with no apparent changes observed in the overall structure of the enzyme as monitored by CD and intrinsic fluorescence. The result of the size-exclusion chromatography indicates that the inactive enzymes still exists in the hexadecameric state. On dilution of the GdnHCL, reactivation of the inactive enzyme by low concentration of GdnHCl occurred. The regain of activity was time-dependent and obeyed first-order kinetics, and the substrate, ribulose- 1,5-biphosphate, can stimulate this reactivation process. The result suggests that the inactivation of Rubisco in dilute GdnHCl is caused by the conformational changes at the active site instead of the inhibition of guanidine hydrochloride or the dissociation of the oligomeric enzyme molecules.

0031455351	Three-state kinetic analysis of chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride	The unfolding behavior of dihydrofolate reductase from Chinese hamster in solutions of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was studied. The GdnHCl- induced unfolding of the dihydrofolate reductase monitored by intrinsic fluorescence shows a biphasic transition, while the change in the enzyme activity is a single exponential process. The rate constant of inactivation is consistent with that of the fast conformational change. Therefore, the kinetic intermediate of protein unfolding should be a partially folded and inactive form. On the basis of the kinetic equation of substrate reaction in the presence of GdnHCl, all microscopic kinetic constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complexes have been determined. Both substrates, NADPH and 7,8-dihydrofolate, protect dihydrofolate reductase against inactivation.

0032190031	Activation mechanism and modification kinetics of Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase by p-chloromercuribenzoate	Substrate effects on the activation kinetics of Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase by p-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB) have been studied. On the basis of the kinetic equation of substrate reaction in the presence of pCMB, all modification kinetic constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate binary and ternary complexes have been determined. The results of the present study indicate that the modification of Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase by pCMB shows single-phase kinetics, and that changes in the enzyme activity and tertiary structure proceed simultaneously during the modification process. Both substrates, NADPH and 7,8-dihydrofolate, protect dihydrofolate reductase against modification by pCMB. In the presence of a saturating concentration of NADPH, the value of k(cat) for 7,8-dihydrofolate in the enzyme-catalysed reaction increased four-fold on modification of Cys-6, accompanied by a two-fold increase in K(m) for the modified enzyme. The utilization of the binding energy of a group to increase k(cat) rather than reduce K(m) implies that the full binding energy of the group is not realized in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, but is used to stabilize the enzyme-transition-state complex.

0032211226	A novel method for determining kinetic parameters of dissociating enzyme systems	The theoretical analysis has been presented for the kinetics of dissociating-associating enzyme-catalyzed reactions. On the basis of the kinetic equation of substrate reaction, a general procedure is developed for determining the kinetic constants of dissociating-associating enzyme reactions. By analyzing the experimental data of initial velocity and steady- state velocity as functions of enzyme and substrate concentration, all unknown kinetic parameters can be determined from several simple, sequential calculations. This method is simple and rigorous, and the required experiments may also not be difficult for most dissociating enzyme systems. Therefore, the present method should be a useful addition to the available methods for studying subunit dissociation of enzymes. In comparison to other physical methods, the advantage of this method is not only its usefulness in the study of self-associating reactions at very low protein concentration but its convenience in the study of substrate effects on subunit-subunit interactions.

0032506297	Comparison of conformational changes and inactivation of soybean lipoxygenase-1 during urea denaturation	The unfolding and inactivation of soybean lipoxygenase-1 during urea denaturation has been compared. Equilibrium study indicates that inactivation of the enzyme occurs at low urea concentrations before significant conformational change of the molecule as a whole. In the presence of 6.0 M urea, the unfolding of soybean lipoxygenase-1, as monitored by fluorescence intensity, is a triphasic process, while the inactivation of the enzyme shows single-phase kinetics. The rate constant of inactivation is consistent with that of the fast conformational change of the enzyme. The results suggest that active sites of lipoxygenase-1 containing iron cofactor are situated in a limited region of the enzyme molecule that is more fragile to denaturants than the protein as a whole. The kinetic theory of substrate reactions catalyzed by unstable enzymes (Duggleby (1986) J. Theor. Biol. 123, 67-80) has been applied to study the effect of substrate on enzyme inactivation. On the basis of the kinetic equation of substrate reaction in the presence of urea, inactivation rate constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex have been determined. The substrate, linoleic acid, has no effect on inactivation of the ferric form of lipoxygenase-1. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

0032517250	The inactivation kinetics of papain by guanidine hydrochloride: A re-analysis	The kinetic theory of the substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity has been applied to study the inactivation kinetics of enzymes by denaturant. However, an important problem related to the determination of the inactivation rate constants has not been considered in a previous publication (Xiao, et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1164 (1993) 54-60). In most denaturation experiments, the high concentrations of denaturants may greatly affect the kinetic behavior of the system to preclude the use of the kinetic parameters determined in the absence of denaturant. In the present study, the kinetic equation of substrate reaction in presence of denaturant has been derived. A re-examination of the effect of high concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride on the inactivation of papain, taking into consideration the effect of high concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride on the Michaelis constant, showed that, for papain, the substrate gives no protection on its inactivation. It is the purpose of the present communication to stress the importance of observing the effect of the denaturant on the kinetic parameters for kinetic analysis of enzyme inactivation by denaturants generally.

A general equation is developed and shown to provide a good theoretical basis for the existing pH models that have been widely used to describe the effects of pH on microbial growth kinetics. Four experimental data sets are used to test the general equation developed. The four data sets exhibited a variety of functional curve shapes, for example, symmetrical and asymmetrical bell-shaped, when the specific growth rate of microorganisms is plotted as a function of pH. All four data sets are found to be well represented by the general equation. The existing pH model was, however, found to represent only one out of four data sets, i.e., the symmetrical case.

In the present study, a kinetic analysis of autocatalytic reaction modulated by regulatory ligands is presented. On the basis of the kinetic equation, a novel procedure is developed to evaluate the kinetic parameters of the reaction.

37849034569	Quantifying the relationship of protein burying depth and sequence	Protein burying depth (BD) is a structural descriptor that is exploited not only to find whether a residue is exposed or buried, but also to determine how deep a residue is buried. The widely used solvent accessible surface area is mainly focusing on the study of protein surface residues, while protein BD can provide more detailed information about the arrangement of buried residues, which may be used to study protein deep level structure and the formation of protein folding nucleus. In this work, we analyse the relationship of protein BD and sequences, and describe it by nonlinear functions estimated by support vector machines. We examine the functions by crossvalidation tests and find strong correlation between residue BD and local sequence environment. By further taking account the size of the molecule where a residue is located, we find that the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed depths improves from 0.60 to 0.65. Moreover, nearly half of the deepest 10% residues in a protein sequence can be correctly predicted. Our study suggests that a residue's burying extent is able to be predicted, to some degree, by itself and its local neighbouring residues. The methods used to estimate the sequence-depth functions are expected to become more useful in the investigation of protein structures and folding mechanism. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

38049050836	Negative regulation of caspase 3-cleaved PAK2 activity by protein phosphatase 1	The p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) is activated by binding of small G proteins, Cdc42 and Rac, or through proteolytic cleavage by caspases or caspase-like proteases. Activation by both small G protein and caspase requires autophosphorylation at Thr-402 of PAK2. Although activation of PAK2 has been investigated for nearly a decade, the mechanism of PAK2 downregulation is unclear. In this study, we have applied the kinetic theory of substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity to study the regulation mechanism of PAK2 activity by the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1α). On the basis of the kinetic equation of the substrate reaction during the reversible phosphorylation of PAK2, all microscopic kinetic constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate(s) complexes have been determined. The results indicate that (1) PP1α can act directly on phosphorylated Thr-402 in the activation loop of PAK2 and down-regulate its kinase activity; (2) binding of the exogenous protein/peptide substrates at the active site of PAK2 decreases both the rates of PAK2 autoactivation and inactivation. The present method provides a novel approach for studying reversible phosphorylation reactions. The advantage of this method is not only its usefulness in study of substrate effects on enzyme modification but also its convenience in study of modification reaction directly involved in regulation of enzyme activity. This initial study should provide a foundation for future structural and mechanistic work of protein kinases and phosphatases. © 2008 Science in China Press.

The results indicate that (a) the presence of glucose-1-phosphate has no influence on either the rate of dissociation or the rate of association, and hence does not shift the dimer-tetramer equilibrium of phosphorylase a; (b) the binding of glycogen to the enzyme decreases the association rate of the dimer to form the tetramer, but has no effect on the dissociation rate of the tetramer; (c) both the dimeric and tetrameric form of phosphorylase a can bind glycogen, but the tetrameric form has a lower affinity for glycogen and is catalytically inactive.

0033179440	Influence of substrates on in vitro dephosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase a by protein phosphatase-1	The kinetic theory of the substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity has been applied to a study of the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a by protein phosphatase-1 (ppase-1). On the basis of the kinetic equation of the substrate reaction in the presence of ppase-1, all the inactivation rate constants for the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate(s) complexes have been determined. Binding of the allosteric substrate, glucose 1-phosphate, to one subunit of phosphorylase a protects completely against ppase-1 action on either the same subunit or the adjacent subunit, whereas binding of the non-allosteric substrate, glycogen, to one subunit protects this subunit partially, but has no effect on the modification on the neighbouring subunit. Analysis of the data suggests that the allosteric behaviour of phosphorylase a can be interpreted in terms of a modified concerted model. The present method also provides a novel approach for studying dephosphorylation reactions. Since the experimental conditions used resemble more closely the in vivo situation where the substrate is constantly being turned over while the enzyme is being modified, this new method would be particularly useful when the regulatory mechanism of the reversible phosphorylation reaction toward certain enzymes is being assessed.

0032843762	What is the minimum number of residues to determine the secondary structural state?	The failure of protein secondary structural prediction is commonly attributed to the neglect of long-range interactions. The question is, what is the minimum length of subsequence required to determine the central secondary structural state, stabilized only by local interactions? In the present work, the 20 amino acids were classified into eight groups to analyze systematically the relationship between the length and secondary structural state of subsequences in the PDB database. It was found that the fraction of subsequences with a unique central secondary structural state increases with increasing length, and the minimum length of subsequence required to determine the central secondary structural state is about 14-17 residues. The low accuracy of secondary structure prediction does not result from the neglect of long-range interactions, but may result from the limitation of the available protein database size or prediction algorithm.

0032879344	New evidence for the denaturant binding model	Denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) or urea is one of the primary ways of measuring the conformafional stability of proteins and comparing the stability of mutant proteins. Despite the widespread use of these two denaturants to provide quantitative data for the free energies of unfolding, the mode of action of these agents is not well understood. We are not even certain whether the action of these agents on proteins is direct and can be regarded as ligand binding, or indirect and involves a change in the properties of solvent (water) in the presence of GdnHCl and urea. In this paper, an extensive kinetic study of the inhibition of ribonuclease A and papain by urea has been performed. The results suggest that the effect of urea on activities of these enzymes can be well described by the denaturant binding model. The binding constants of urea determined by the present method are nearly identical to that determined from a variety of different studies on model compounds and proteins.

The conventional method have some problems in that it is impossible to quickly acquire the generation power at the maximum power (MP) point, i.e., the efficiency of electric power generation is very low, and the amount of electric power generated by solar cell is always changing with weather conditions. Normally, the different solar cells have different diode factor (n) and reverse saturation current (Io). Theoretical and simulative results show that the approximately linear relationship exists between the optimal output current and the short-circuit current, and if the weather conditions are sameness, a piece of solar cell have same photocurrent under different diode factor n and reverse saturation current Io conditions. A new combined perturb and observe (PO) method is described in order to acquire the actual diode factor and reverse saturation current. This paper describes a rapid maximum power point tracking method which is based on the actual n and Io. An expiatory program is applied to acquire the actual maximum power point. The correctness and validity of expiatory coefficients is verified through simulation. The simulation results verified the correctness and validity of MPPT algorithm.

For three-bladed upwind horizontal axis wind turbine, the blade pitch control is used primarily to adjust the power coefficient and obtain the optimal power at high wind speed, but it also make aerodynamic load, such as edgewise, flapwise and torsion moment, change during variable pitch control. Hydraulic mechanism is used in a process requiring large driving forces and torques, fast response and high stiffness. Therefore, the variable pitch mechanism is operated using electro-hydraulic proportional technology in this paper. Simulation results are presented and analysed to show that aerodynamic load and output power are sensitivity to pitch angle for wind turbine blade.

Crystals of Dvl2-DIX(G65A) protein were obtained, but the diffraction data encountered an unexpected lattice-translocation defect. These Site III mutations of Dvl2-DIX retained the ability to hetero-interact with Ccdl-DIX, and we thus successfully generated various complexes between Dvl2-DIX mutants and wildtype Ccdl-DIX. After extensive trials, crystals of the Dvl2-DIX(G65A)-Ccdl-DIX complex were produced, but of poor quality and unsuitable for diffraction studies. Optimization is under way.

84908505907	Structural insights into the negative regulation of BRI1 signaling by BRI1-interacting protein BKI1	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential steroid hormones that have crucial roles in plant growth and development. BRs are perceived by the cell-surface receptor-like kinase brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1). In the absence of BRs, the cytosolic kinase domain (KD) of BRI1 is inhibited by its auto-inhibitory carboxyl terminus, as well as by interacting with an inhibitor protein, BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1 (BKI1). How BR binding to the extracellular domain of BRI1 leads to activation of the KD and dissociation of BKI1 into the cytosol remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of BRI1 KD in complex with the interacting peptide derived from BKI1. We also provide biochemical evidence that BRI1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1) plays an essential role in initiating BR signaling.

42149145580	Best tracking performance under plant uncertainty and control energy constraint	This paper has investigated best tracking performance for linear feedback control systems in the case that plant uncertainty and control effort need to be considered simultaneously. Firstly, an average integral square criterion of the tracking error and the plant input energy over a class of additive model errors is defined. Then, utilizing spectral factorization to minimize the performance index, we obtain an optimal controller design method, and furthermore study optimal tracking performance under plant uncertainty and control energy constraint. The results can be used to evaluate optimal average tracking performance and control energy in designing practical control systems.

43849090818	Optimal power capturing of multi-MW wind generation system	Recently, an increasing number of multi-MW (1MW and up) wind generation systems are being developed and variable speed-variable pitch (VS-VP) control technology is usually adopted to improve the fast response speed and obtain the optimal energy, which means to obtain the maximum power at low wind speed and the rated power at high wind speed. However, the power generated by wind turbine changes rapidly for the continuous fluctuation of wind speed and direction, and wind energy conversion systems are of strong nonlinear characteristics for many uncertain factors and external disturbances. Based on modeling and analyzing of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and the hydraulic variable pitch mechanism (HVPM), this paper presents an adaptive fuzzy proportional integral derivative (AFPID) control strategy to capture optimal power. Simulation results show that the controller can improve the wind turbine performance than conventional PID controller.

The main objective of using a variable speed-variable pitch control strategy is to improve response speed and get maximum energy. But the power generated by wind turbine changes rapidly because of the continuous fluctuation of wind speed and direction. At the same time, wind energy conversion systems have strong nonlinear characteristics with many uncertain factors. Fuzzy control needs no accurate mathematical model and sliding-mode control can provide a good robustness and stability of system. In the paper a new kind of state controller is proposed by fuzzy sliding-mode control theory and the simulation model of a 1.5 MW variable speed-variable pitch wind turbine is established with the simulation software. Simulation results show the fuzzy sliding-mode controller may also eliminate the steady state error, compensate the nonlinearity and have excellent robustness.

48749104294	Modelling and analysing the hydraulic variable-pitch mechanism for a variable-speed wind turbine	Modern wind turbines are controlled in varying wind speed by blade pitching for power control. To satisfy the requirement of large driving forces and torques, fast response and high stiffness, hydraulic technology is usually:used in the variable-pitch mechanism. The model of the hydraulic variable-pitch mechanism (HVPM) is simplified by a first-order inertia system in most literature. This simplified representation neglects the actual characteristics of the HVPM, and it is not precise and reasonable. Therefore, HVPM modelling is implemented and analyzed in this paper. Simulation results show that consequently the variable-speed wind turbine performs well at above rated wind speeds.

53149142471	What is the minimum number of residues to determine the secondary structural state?	The failure of protein secondary structural prediction is commonly attributed to the neglect of long-range interactions. The question is, what is the minimum length of subsequence required to determine the central secondary structural state, stabilized only by local interactions? In the present work, the 20 amino acids were classified into eight groups to analyze systematically the relationship between the length and secondary structural state of subsequences in the PDB database. It was found that the fraction of subsequences with a unique central secondary structural state increases with increasing length, and the minimum length of subsequence required to determine the central secondary structural state is about 14-17 residues. The low accuracy of secondary structure prediction does not result from the neglect of long-range interactions, but may result from the limitation of the available protein database size or prediction algorithm. © 1999 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Together with Medea, mother against Dpp (Mad), the founding member of the Smad family, specifically transduces the Dpp signal from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Here, the crystal structure of the MH2 domain of Mad, which closely matches those of other Smad MH2 domains, is reported at 3.2 Å resolution. The conservation of Smad protein structures is consistent with their evolutionary conserved and significant function. Furthermore, sequence alignment revealed that most of the variant amino acids in Smad proteins specific to the BMP pathway (Smad1, Smad5 and Mad) were clustered at the surface. In particular, Ser296 and Asp297 of Mad introduced a negative patch into the positive surface observed in the surface electrostatic potential of Smad1 MH2. © 2008 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved.

55549104054	Enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α in different phosphorylation states	The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are essential signaling molecules that mediate many cellular effects of growth factors, cytokines, and stress stimuli. Full activation of the MAP kinases requires dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TXY motif of the activation loop by MAP kinase kinases. Down-regulation of MAP kinase activity can be initiated by multiple serine/threonine phosphatases, tyrosine-specific phosphatases, and dual specificity phosphatases (MAP kinase phosphatases). This would inevitably lead to the formation of monophosphorylated MAP kinases. However, the biological functions of these monophosphorylated MAP kinases are currently not clear. In this study, we have prepared MAP kinase p38α, a member of the MAP kinase family, in all phosphorylated forms and characterized their biochemical properties. Our results indicated the following: (i) p38α phosphorylated at both Thr-180 and Tyr-182 was 10 -20-fold more active than p38α phosphorylated at Thr-180 only, whereas p38α phosphorylated at Tyr-182 alone was inactive; (ii) the dual-specific MKP5, the tyrosine-specific hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and the serine/ threonine-specific PP2Cα are all highly specific for the dephosphorylation of p38α, and the dephosphorylation rates were significantly affected by different phosphorylated states of p38α; (iii) the N-terminal domain of MPK5 has no effect on enzyme catalysis, whereas deletion of the MAP kinase-binding domain in MKP5 leads to a 370-fold decrease in k

At present, more and more energy demand gives immense pressure to Chinese government.

This procedure is particularly useful for the fast zymogen autoactivation reactions.

72449193948	Cooperative-PSO-based PID neural network integral control strategy and simulation research with asynchronous motor controller design	This paper focuses on the design of robustness controller for asynchronous motor. a new PID neural network-integral (PIDNN-I) synthesis control strategy is proposed for the controller design, in which NARMA-L2, an approximated model of nonlinear auto regressive moving average(NARMA) model, is employed to represent the input-output behavior of the motor and gives out the expected control input. PID neurons network (PIDNN), as a kind of novel neural network model with dynamic characteristics, is adopted in NARMA-L2 to identify the motor. PIDNN integrates the advantages of PID with those of artificial neuron network. However, the conventional back-propagation (BP) algorithm, which easily gets trapped in local minimum and is being adopted in the current model, constrains the identifying ability of PIDNN so as to harm to the completion of the controller design. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a new population-based evolutionary global optimization method, is proposed to replace the BP algorithm to train the neurons model. Cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO), an improved version of cooperative random learning particle swarm optimization (CRPSO), is put forward to enhance the performances of the conventional PSO in the design. Due to the existence of the tracking error caused by approximate error between identifying and real system, integral (I) control is introduced into the design, namely adopting PIDNN control in large tracking error scale and PIDNN-I control in small tracking error scale. Compared with conventional PID control strategy, simulation results demonstrate that the CPSO-based PIDNN-I synthesis control strategy has improved the control performances of asynchronous motor in robustness and accuracy efficiently.

Simulation results of the MPIDNN controllers based on BP, PSO and CRPSO algorithms indicate that CPSO-based MPIDNN controller is more effective than the other three in controlling the MIMO systems. The CPSO algorithm makes MPIDNN controller better in performances than BP algorithm in accuracy, stability and robustness.

The effects of the parameters, such as the aerodynamic data, the blade geometry parameter, the hub height, the wind speed of the hub, the coefficient of the wind shear, the blade radius, the tower radius and the overhang distance, on the performance are analyzed. Then, the lead-lag load and the flapping load of a wind turbine with the rated power of 2 MW are calculated and analyzed under two conditions: with and without consideration of the wind shear and the tower shadow. The results show that with the increase in the capacity of the wind turbine, its size becomes larger, and thus the influences of the wind shear and the tower shadow on the load and power cannot be ignored. Therefore, the individual pitch technology has greater attractive application than the collective pitch technology.

We set the linking weights of the first two layers as constant values. Only the interlayer and output layer linking weights of PID neural network (PIDNN) were used as the optical parameters of PSO. It reduced dimension of particles and improved training speed obviously. Then the conventional PID controller was replaced with PIDNN controller. Simulation research was carried out based on transfer function of converters control system.

79953155959	Molecular basis of Wnt activation via the DIX domain protein Ccd1	The Wnt signaling plays pivotal roles in embryogenesis and cancer, and the three DIX domain-containing proteins, Dvl, Axin, and Ccd1, play distinct roles in the initiation and regulation of canonical Wnt signaling. Overexpressed Dvl has a tendency to form large polymers in a cytoplasmic punctate pattern, whereas the biologically active Dvl in fact forms low molecular weight oligomers. The molecular basis for how the polymeric sizes of Dvl proteins are controlled upon Wnt signaling remains unclear. Here we show that Ccd1 up-regulates canonical Wnt signaling via acting synergistically with Dvl. We determined the crystal structures of wild type Ccd1-DIX and mutant Dvl1-DIX(Y17D), which pack into "head-to-tail" helical filaments. Structural analyses reveal two sites crucial for intrafilament homo- and hetero-interaction and a third site for interfilament homo-assembly. Systematic mutagenesis studies identified critical residues from all three sites required for Dvl homo-oligomerization, puncta formation, and stimulation of Wnt signaling. Remarkably, Ccd1 forms a hetero-complex with Dvl through the "head" of Dvl-DIX and the "tail" of Ccd1-DIX, depolymerizes Dvl homo-assembly, and thereby controls the size of Dvl polymer. These data together suggest a molecular mechanism for Ccd1-mediated Wnt activation in that Ccd1 converts latent polymeric Dvl to a biologically active oligomer(s). © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79954541621	Control of HVDC-light transmission for offshore wind farms based on input-output feedback linearization and PSO	HVDC-Light has the advantages of flexible operating ways and reliability, especially in the transmission problem of offshore wind power. But it needs many PI controllers in the two converters (wind farm side, grid side). So there are many parameters need to be set which is difficult. This paper adopted the control mode that the outside loop controlled the voltage and the inside loop controlled the current. The inside loop made use of input-output feedback linearization method to make the nonlinear coupled converter mathematical model be linearization and decoupled. And it can substitute pole placement for PI parameters setting. Namely that it changed the problem of adjusting PI parameters to the one of pole placement. The control objective is to track the given values of active and reactive current from outside loops. The outside loop PI parameters are optimized with cooperation random particle swarm optimization(CRPSO) algorithm.

79955529278	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 3-mediated cross-talk between MAPKs ERK2 and p38α	MAPK phosphatase 3 (MKP3) is highly specific for ERK1/2 inactivation via dephosphorylation of both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine critical for enzymatic activation. Here, we show that MKP3 is able to effectively dephosphorylate the phosphotyrosine, but not phosphothreonine, in the activation loop of p38α in vitro and in intact cells. The catalytic constant of the MKP3 reaction for p38α is comparable with that for ERK2. Remarkably, MKP3, ERK2, and phosphorylated p38α can form a stable ternary complex in solution, and the phosphatase activity of MKP3 toward p38α substrate is allosterically regulated by ERK2-MKP3 interaction. This suggests that MKP3 not only controls the activities of ERK2 and p38α but also mediates cross-talk between these two MAPK pathways. The crystal structure of bisphosphorylated p38α has been determined at 2.1 Å resolution. Comparisons between the phosphorylated MAPK structures reveal the molecular basis of MKP3 substrate specificity. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79955538576	Molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of Smad1/5 protein by Carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting Protein (CHIP)	The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of ligands signals along two intracellular pathways, Smad2/3-mediated TGF-β/activin pathway and Smad1/5/8-mediated bone morphogenetic protein pathway. The C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the degradation of Smad proteins and many other signaling proteins. However, the molecular mechanism for CHIPmediated down-regulation of TGF-β signaling remains unclear. Here we show that the extreme C-terminal sequence of Smad1 plays an indispensable role in its direct association with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of CHIP. Interestingly, Smad1 undergoes CHIP-mediated polyubiquitination in the absence of molecular chaperones, and phosphorylation of the C-terminal SXS motif of Smad1 enhances the interaction and ubiquitination.Wealso found that CHIP preferentially binds to Smad1/5 and specifically disrupts the core signaling complex of Smad1/5 and Smad4. We determined the crystal structures of CHIP-TPR in complex with the phosphorylated/pseudophosphorylated Smad1 peptides and with an Hsp70/Hsc70 C-terminal peptide. Structural analyses and subsequent biochemical studies revealed that the distinct CHIP binding affinities of Smad1/5 or Smad2/3 result from the nonconservative hydrophobic residues at R-Smad C termini. Unexpectedly, the C-terminal peptides from Smad1 and Hsp70/Hsc70 bind in the same groove of CHIP-TPR, and heat shock proteins compete with Smad1/5 for CHIP interaction and concomitantly suppress, rather than facilitate, CHIP-mediated Smad ubiquitination. Thus, we conclude that CHIP inhibits the signaling activities of Smad1/5 by recruiting Smad1/5 from the functional R-/Co-Smad complex and further promoting the ubiquitination/degradation of Smad1/5 in a chaperone-independent manner. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79960889262	DPC-based control strategy of VSC-HVDC converter for offshore wind farm	DPC (Direct Power Control) is designed for the grid-connected VSC-HVDC system of offshore wind farm, which applies the virtual flux technology to calculate the system power. The AC voltage sensors and PLL are saved to increase system reliability and decrease cost. The power and virtual flux models of three-phase VSC are constructed to estimate flux and power. The voltage reference signal is directly calculated according to the error of power, and the SPWM wave is generated to replace the hysteresis control and avoid the PI parameter adjustment of internal control loop. The results of simulation with Matlab/Simulink indicate that, the converters at both sides can operate without AC voltage sensors, and the system needs less parameter adjustment and has fast response speed and high steady-state tracking accuracy.

Compared with the conventional PO and the fuzzy MPPT method, the simulative results show that both the system output efficiency and performance are effectively improved when wind speed varies frequently. The immune theory is applied to enhance the dynamic performance of system and the simulative results show that the system output libration is reduced and the output efficiency, response speed and robustness are increased.

The mathematical converter model in synchronous reference frame is expressed in the form of Lagrange equations and its strict passivity is proved. The smooth positive energy function is selected as Lyapunov function to meet the requirements of the controlled system for asymptotical stable at origin point. Damping injection is applied to accelerate the system energy dissipation and make the system quickly converge to the equilibrium point. Simulation model is created with Matlab and the control modes of constant DC voltage, constant active power and constant reactive power are analyzed respectively, which shows that the instantaneous active or reactive power can be independently controlled with better transient performance than PI controller.

An efficient Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control method is helpful to improve the power supply reliability and power quality of hybrid wind-solar generating system. The fuzzy MPPT method is used in wind power unit; the fuzzy Perturb Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) MPPT method is used in photovoltaic part, which improves the sensitivity and output efficiency of system under conditions of being partially MPPT shaded, and thus implements the MPPT control of hybrid wind-solar system. Then the controller is designed based on the improved fuzzy MPPT control strategy and then verified by experiment. Experimental results and site operations show that the power supply reliability, output characteristic, dynamic characteristic and output efficiency are significantly improved.

The output characteristics of large-scale PV materials under partial shading conditions have multiple maximum power points, which make the tracking of the actual maximum power point (MPP) a difficult task. A novel combined fuzzy and perturb and observe (PO) control method is suggested to extract maximum power from the PV materials under these conditions. The ability of the proposed method and its increased performance as compare with the traditional fuzzy control method is evaluated by means of experimental tests performed on a real PV power system and based on the MSP430x44x microcontroller. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

80755172330	Dual role of BKI1 and 14-3-3 s in Brassinosteroid signaling to link receptor with transcription factors	The plasma membrane-localized plant steroid hormone receptor, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), is quiescent in the absence of steroids, largely due to a negative regulator, BRI1 KINASE INHIBITOR 1 (BKI1). Here, we report that the steroid-induced, plasma membrane-dissociated and phosphorylated BKI1 also plays positive roles in BR signaling by interacting with a subset of 14-3-3 proteins. The cytosolic fraction of BKI1 carboxyl terminal region enhances BR signaling. Mutations of two serine residues in this region lead to reduced phosphorylation by the BRI1 kinase and constitutive plasma membrane localization. The 14-3-3 proteins can interact with the phosphorylated BKI1 through a motif that contains the two phosphorylation sites to release inhibition of BRI1 by BKI1. Meanwhile, the cytosolic BKI1 antagonizes the 14-3-3 s and enhances accumulation of BRI1 EMS SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1)/BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) in the nucleus to regulate BR-responses. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The structure of MMC(Modular Multilevel Converter) is adopted as its main circuit and its equivalent mathematical model is established. The sub-modules of each bridge arm are sorted according to their capacitor voltages, which, combined with the arm current direction, determines the states of sub-modules to ensure that the instantaneous capacitor voltage of every sub-module is equal within the same arm. Dual close-loop vector control strategy is applied: the converter at wind farm side controls DC voltage while the converter at grid side controls active power. The inner loop adopts the current feed-forward decoupled mode to control the active power and reactive power independently. The simulation system model is set in Matlab and the advantage of adopted topological structure and the correctness of applied control strategy are verified.

82955205873	Structural insights into the autoactivation mechanism of p21-activated protein kinase	p21-activated kinases (PAKs) play an important role in diverse cellular processes. Full activation of PAKs requires autophosphorylation of a critical threonine/serine located in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Here we report crystal structures of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PAK1 kinase domain. The phosphorylated PAK1 kinase domain has a conformation typical of all active protein kinases. Interestingly, the structure of the unphosphorylated PAK1 kinase domain reveals an unusual dimeric arrangement expected in an authentic enzyme-substrate complex, in which the activation loop of the putative "substrate" is projected into the active site of the "enzyme." The enzyme is bound to AMP-PNP and has an active conformation, whereas the substrate is empty and adopts an inactive conformation. Thus, the structure of the asymmetric homodimer mimics a trans-autophosphorylation complex, and suggests that unphosphorylated PAK1 could dynamically adopt both the active and inactive conformations in solution. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

84255172878	A distinct interaction mode revealed by the crystal structure of the kinase p38a with the MAPK binding domain of the phosphatase MKP5	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a pivotal role in a myriad of cellular functions. The specificity and efficiency of MAPK signaling are controlled by docking interactions between MAPKs and their cognate proteins. Many MAPK-interacting partners, including substrates, MAPK kinases, phosphatases, and scaffolding proteins, have linear sequence motifs that mediate the interaction with the common docking site on MAPKs. We report the crystal structure of p38a in complex with the MAPK binding domain (KBD) from MAPK phosphatase 5 (MKP5) at 2.7 Å resolution. In contrast to the well-known docking mode, the KBD binds p38a in a bipartite manner, in which two distinct helical regions of KBD engage the p38α docking site, which is situated on the back of the p38a active site. We also determined the crystal structure of the KBD of MKP7, which closely resembles the MKP5 KBD, suggesting that the mechanism of molecular recognition by the KBD of MKP5 is conserved in the cytoplasmic p38- and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-specific MKP subgroup. This previously unknown binding mode provides new insights into how MAPKs interact with their binding partners to achieve functional specificity.

84855288969	Molecular mechanism for inhibition of a critical component in the Arabidopsis thaliana abscisic acid signal transduction pathways, SnRK2.6, by protein phosphatase ABI1	Subclass III SnRK2s (SnRK2.6/2.3/2.2) are the key positive regulators of abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana. The kinases, activated by ABA or osmotic stress, phosphorylate stress-related transcription factors and ion channels, which ultimately leads to the protection of plants from dehydration or high salinity. In the absence of stressors, SnRK2s are subject to negative regulation by group A protein phosphatase type 2Cs (PP2C), whereas the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of the kinase domain of SnRK2.6 at 2.6-Å resolution. Structure-guided biochemical analyses identified two distinct interfaces between SnRK2.6 and ABI1, a member of group A PP2Cs. Structural modeling suggested that the two interfaces lock SnRK2.6 and ABI1 in an orientation such that the activation loop of SnRK2.6 is posited to the catalytic site of ABI1 for dephosphorylation. These studies revealed the molecular basis for PP2Cs-mediated inhibition of SnRK2s and provided important insights into the downstream signal transduction of ABA. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84855885984	A continuous spectrophotometric assay for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases	We describe a convenient and simple continuous spectrophotometric method for the determination of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase activity with its protein substrate. The assay relies on the measurement of phosphoprotein product generated in the first step of the MAPK kinase reaction. Dephosphorylation of the phosphoprotein is coupled to a MAPK phosphatase to generate phosphate, which is then used as the substrate of purine nucleoside phosphorylase to catalyze the N-glycosidic cleavage of 2-amino 6-mercapto 7-methyl purine ribonucleoside. Of the reaction products ribose 1-phosphate and 2-amino 6-mercapto 7-methylpurine, the latter has a high absorbance at 360 nm relative to the nucleoside and, hence, provides a spectrophotometric signal that can be continuously followed. In the presence of excess phosphatase, the phosphorylated protein substrate molecules undergo dephosphorylation almost immediately after their formation; the steady-state use of the resultant inorganic phosphate is a reflection of the constant initial velocity of the exchange reaction. The validity of this method has been confirmed by using it to measure the activities of MEK1 (MAPK/ERK kinase 1) and MKK6 (MAPK kinase 6) toward their physiological substrates. Our findings of the MAPK kinases in the current study provide evidence that the substrate binding affinities of this subfamily of protein kinases are at the submicromolar concentration. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84859379654	NMR studies of the interaction between human programmed cell death 5 and human p53	Human programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) is a protein playing a significant role in regulating both the apoptotic and paraptotic cell deaths. Resent findings show that PDCD5 is a positive regulator of Tip60 and also has a potential ability to interact with p53. Here we aim to experimentally characterize the nature of the interactions between PDCD5 and the p53 N-terminal domain (NTD) and to depict the binding mode between two proteins. The interprotein binding interfaces were determined by NMR experiments performed with PDCD5 and various fragments of p53 NTD. The binding affinity was investigated using the NMR titration experiments. Analysis revealed that the PDCD5 binding site on p53 is localized within residues 41-56 of p53 TAD2 subdomain while p53 binds preferentially to the positively charged surface region around the C-terminals of helices α3 and α5 and the N-terminal of helix α4 of PDCD5. The binding is mainly mediated through electrostatic interactions. The present data suggested a model for the interaction between PDCD5 and the p53 NTD. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84860710266	A new pattern-based method for identifying recent HIV-1 infections from the viral env sequence	The long asymptomatic stage of HIV infection poses a great challenge in identifying recent HIV infections. This is a bottleneck for monitoring HIV epidemic trends and evaluating the effectiveness of national AIDS control programs. Several serological methods were used to address this issue with some success. Because of high false-positive rates in patients with advanced infection or in ART treatment, UNAIDS still hesitates to recommend their use in routine surveillance. We developed a new pattern-based method for measuring intra-patient viral genetic diversity for determination of recent infections and estimation of population incidence. This method is verified by using several datasets (424 subtype B and 77 CRF07_BC samples) with clearly identified HIV-1 infection times. Pattern-based diversities of recent infections are significantly lower than that of chronic ones. With larger window periods varying from 200 to 350 days, a higher accuracy (90%-95%) not affected by advanced disease nor ART treatment could be obtained. The pattern-based genetic method is supplementary to the existing serology-based assays, both of which could be suitable for use in low and high epidemic regions, respectively. © 2012 The Author(s).

84862521440	Accurate prediction of protein structural class	Because of the increasing gap between the data from sequencing and structural genomics, the accurate prediction of the structural class of a protein domain solely from the primary sequence has remained a challenging problem in structural biology. Traditional sequence-based predictors generally select several sequence features and then feed them directly into a classification program to identify the structural class. The current best sequence-based predictor achieved an overall accuracy of 74.1% when tested on a widely used, non-homologous benchmark dataset 25PDB. In the present work, we built a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to convert the 440-dimensional (440D) sequence feature vector extracted from the Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) of a protein domain to a 4-dimensinal (4D) structural feature vector, which could then be used to predict the four major structural classes. We performed 10-fold cross-validation and jackknife tests of the method on a large non-homologous dataset containing 8,244 domains distributed among the four major classes. The performance of our approach outperformed all of the existing sequence-based methods and had an overall accuracy of 83.1%, which is even higher than the results of those predicted secondary structure-based methods. © 2012 Xia et al.

It can solve the chatting problem when the system input parameters exists disturbances. The mathematical model of the three-level voltage source converters (VSC) in offshore wind farms high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission was developed. A new SMVSC controller based on instantaneous active and reactive power error was proposed. The PIDNN can online train the network with the chosen energy function to get the global optimal solution, which gets the optimal parameter of the sliding-mode control (SMC) in real time. In addition, analytical methods based on Lyapunov function were proposed to guarantee the convergence of tracking error. Matlab simulation results show the proposed method can make system global stability, have stronger robust under system disturbance, and can be easily applied to digital control systems. © 2012 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84863337771	ROP11 GTPase Negatively Regulates ABA Signaling by Protecting ABI1 Phosphatase Activity from Inhibition by the ABA Receptor RCAR1/PYL9 in Arabidopsis	The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many key processes in plants, such as seed germination, seedling growth, and abiotic stress tolerance. In recent years, a minimal set of core components of a major ABA signaling pathway has been discovered. These components include a RCAR/PYR/PYL family of ABA receptors, a group of PP2C phosphatases, and three SnRK2 kinases. However, how the interactions between the receptors and their targets are regulated by other proteins remains largely unknown. In a companion paper published in this issue, we showed that ROP11, a member of the plant-specific Rho-like small GTPase family, negatively regulates multiple ABA responses in Arabidopsis. The current work demonstrated that the constitutively active ROP11 (CA-ROP11) can modulate the RCAR1/PYL9-mediated ABA signaling pathway based on reconstitution assays in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. Furthermore, using luciferase complementation imaging, yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we demonstrated that CA-ROP11 directly interacts with ABI1, a signaling component downstream of RCAR1/PYL9. Finally, we provided biochemical evidence that CA-ROP11 protects ABI1 phosphatase activity from inhibition by RCAR1/PYL9 and thus negatively regulates ABA signaling in plant cells. A model of how ROP11 acts to negatively regulate ABA signaling is presented. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

For these, direct power control strategy of MMC and the strategy of balancing capacitor voltage were researched. First, the method of sorting arm module voltage and adding average control signals to reference were combined. Then, the double-loop proportion regulators were used to make capacitor voltage be consistent and track the given value which made the fluctuation range of capacitor voltage to be significantly reduced. It improved the quality of converter output waveforms. Finally, the strategy of virtual flux direct power control was used for MMC.

84864517982	Physical and functional interaction between the ID1 and p65 for activation of NF-κB	Inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding-1 (ID1) is an important helix-loophelix (HLH) transcription factor involved in diverse biological functions including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence. Recently, it was reported that ID1 can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway in a variety of cancer cells and a T cell line, but the mechanisms involved in ID1-mediated transactivation of NF-κB are not clear. In this study, we demonstrate by both in vitro pull-down assays and a cell-based in vivo two-hybrid system that ID1-mediated NF-κB activation is due to its physical interaction with p65. We have identified that the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) in p65 and the HLH domain in ID1 are vital for their interaction. Interestingly, a single site mutation (Leu76) in the HLH domain of ID1 protein drastically decreased its ability to bind with p65. Using a dualluciferase assay, we demonstrated that the interaction between ID1 and p65 modulates activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated that, by affecting the nuclear translocation of p65, ID1 is essential in regulating TNF-α-induced p65 recruitment to its downstream target, the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) promoter. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.

In the view of nonlinear and strong coupling characteristic of converter, a kind of backstepping controller combined with integral unit was presented. Firstly, a virtual control was designed for voltage outside-loop based on the mathematic model of converter in two phase rotating frame (dq frame). It can make the Lyapunov function of DC voltage system satisfy asymptotically stable condition. Secondly, the control quantity was designed to guarantee that the state variable of current subsystem can track the virtual control and keep the asymptotically stable of the whole system. Finally, the integral unit of DC voltage was added into the control strategy for eliminating steady-state error. It also solves the problem that the system can't comeback to zero-point for step response because of not including integral unit. MTALAB was used for simulation and the results were compared with conventional PI controllers which show that the method is effective and feasible.

In this report, we demonstrate that p38α MAP kinase can phosphorylate RCAN1 at multiple sites in vitro and show that phospho-RCAN1 is a good protein substrate for calcineurin. In addition, we found that unphosphorylated RCAN1 noncompetitively inhibits calcineurin protein phosphatase activity and that the phosphorylation of RCAN1 by p38α MAP kinase decreases the binding affinity of RCAN1 for calcineurin. These findings reveal the molecular mechanism by which p38α MAP kinase regulates the function of RCAN1/calcineurin through phosphorylation. © 2012 The Author(s).

0037200054	The specificity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases	The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) is the founding member of a family of mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) that are central components of signal transduction pathways for cell proliferation, stress responses, and differentiation. The MAPKs are unique among the Ser/Thr protein kinases in that they require both Thr and Tyr phosphorylation for full activation. The dual phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 in ERK2 is catalyzed by MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1). However, the identity and relative activity of protein phosphatases that inactivate ERK2 are less well established. In this study, we performed a kinetic analysis of ERK2 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases using a continuous spectrophotometric enzymecoupled assay that measures the inorganic phosphate produced in the reaction. Eleven different protein phosphatases, many previously suggested to be involved in ERK2 regulation, were compared, including tyrosinespecific phosphatases (PTP1B, CD45, and HePTP), dual specificity MAPK phosphatases (VHR, MKP3, and MKP5), and Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP2Cα, and λPP). The results provide biochemical evidence that protein phosphatases display exquisite specificity in their substrate recognition and implicate HePTP, MKP3, and PP2A as ERK2 phosphatases. The fact that ERK2 inactivation could be carried out by multiple specific phosphatases shows that signals can be integrated into the pathway at the phosphatase level to determine the cellular response to external stimuli. Important insights into the roles of various protein phosphatases in ERK2 kinase signaling are obtained, and further analysis of the mechanism by which different protein phosphatases recognize and inactivate MAPKs will increase our understanding of how this kinase family is regulated.

0037316987	Flexibility analysis of enzyme active sites by crystallographic temperature factors	Protein flexibility is inherent to protein structural behavior. Experimental evidence for protein flexibility is extensive both in solution and in the solid state. A major question is whether the flexibility observed in enzymes is simply an inherent property of proteins that must always be borne in mind or is essential for catalysis or substrate binding. The temperature factors or B-values, as determined crystallographically, are linearly related to the mean square displacement of an atom and give an indication of atomic flexibility in the crystalline state. In this paper, we describe the frequency distributions of the normalized B-factor (B′-factor) for the active site and non-active site residues in the selected 69 apo-enzymes. This analysis was performed over the entire sequences and for different structural subsets defined by the three-dimensional structure of proteins, as α-helices, β-structures and coil conformation and buried and non-buried residues. The results show that in all cases, the active site residues predominantly occur in region of low B′-factor and the non-active site residues have a tendency to exist in the high B′-factor region. This observation suggests that the active site residues, in general, are less flexible than the non-active site residues and therefore the vibrational and the fast collective motions of the C

0037129951	A kinetic approach for the study of protein phosphatase-catalyzed regulation of protein kinase activity	The activities of many protein kinases are regulated by phosphorylation, The phosphorylated protein kinases thus represent an important class of substrates for protein phosphatases. However, our ability to study the phosphatase-catalyzed substrate dephosphorylation has been limited in many cases by the difficulty in preparing sufficient amount of stoichiometrically phosphorylated kinases. We have applied the kinetic theory of substrate reaction during irreversible modification of enzyme activity to the study of phosphatase-catalyzed regulation of kinase activity. As an example, we measured the effect of the hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) on the reaction catalyzed by the fully activated, bisphosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2/pTpY). Because only a catalytic amount of ERK2/pTpY is required, this method alleviates the need for large quantities of phospho-ERK2. Kinetic analysis of the ERK2/pTpY-catalyzed substrate reaction in the presence of HePTP leads to the determination of the rate constants for the HePTP-catalyzed dephosphorylation of free ERK2/pTpY and ERK2/pTpY•substrate(s) complexes.

Because hypoxia is an important stimulus for human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (HPASMC) proliferation and PAH, we performed miRNA microarray assays in hypoxia-treated and control HPASMC. We found that miR-210 is the predominant miRNA induced by hypoxia in HPASMC. Induction of miR-210 was also observed in whole lungs of mice with chronic hypoxia-induced PAH. We found that transcriptional induction of miR-210 in HPASMC is hypoxia-inducible factor-1a dependent. Inhibition of miR-210 in HPASMC caused a significant decrease in cell number due to increased apoptosis. We found that miR-210 appears to mediate its antiapoptotic effects via the regulation of transcription factor E2F3, a direct target of miR-210. Our results have identified miR-210 as a hypoxia-inducible miRNA both in vitro and in vivo, which inhibits pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis in hypoxia by specifically repressing E2F3 expression. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.

The method can predict the reference current value of the next sampling instant within the current sampling time rapidly and accurately. Combined with the quality equation, the best reference voltage vector can be chosen for the next switch period. The corresponding switching signals can be obtained by the voltage space vector modulation(SVM). Simulation results have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. It can eliminate the static error and discretization error, and achieve unity power factor operation.

84871729367	Protection scheme for DC microgrid distribution system	The low voltage DC (LVDC) distribution system is a new concept and a promising technology to be used in the future smart distribution system having high level cost-efficiency and reliability. In this paper, a low-voltage (LV) DC microgrid protection system design is proposed. Usually, an LVDC microgrid must be connected to an ac grid through converters with bidirectional power flow and, therefore, a different protection scheme is needed. This paper describes practical protection solutions for the LVDC network and an LVDC system laboratory prototype is being experimentally tested by MATLAB/SIMULINK. The results show that it is possible to use available devices to protect such a system. But other problems may arise which needs further study. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84873386803	Proportional-integral-differential neural network based sliding-mode controller for modular multi-level high-voltage DC converter of offshore wind power	This article presents an improved sliding-mode control method for a modular multi-level high-voltage DC converter. It merges the merits of the proportional-integral-differential neural network and can solve the chattering problem that exists in conventional sliding-mode control on-line. The reaching law parameters of sliding-mode control can be adjusted by the proportional-integral-differential neural network without the previously needed of off-line learning. The Lyapunov function is chosen as the energy function for real-time training of the proportional-integral-differential neural network. In addition, the stability of the control system is carefully studied, and the global optimal solution is achieved. The MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) simulation results show that the proposed method can make the system globally stable, can achieve stronger robustness under system disturbance, and be applied easily to digital signal processor based modular multi-level converter high-voltage DC control systems. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

84874516335	Application of an improved PSO-based PID neural network controller for VSC-HVDC	An improved niche chaotic particle swarm optimization (INCPSO) method for voltage source converter based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) system was presented. It emerges the good features of niche and chaotic mutation evolutionary algorithms for searching the global best parameters of proportional-integral-derivative neural-network (PIDNN). With the introduction of restricted competition selection (RCS) method into the niche mechanism, the global exploration ability of PSO is enhanced. Simultaneously, the precise local exploitation performance can be well achieved by using the chaotic mutation algorithm with tent-mapping functions. The INCPSO can solve the premature phenomenon and local convergence problem of traditional PSO, and give a balance point between the exploration and exploitation capability. The detail steps of parameters optimizing for PIDNN controller in VSC-HVDC system was presented, and a numerical example was carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of INCPSO. Simulation results show that the INCPSO search capability is more accurate, effective and robust. The INCPSO based PIDNN controller provides a feasible control scheme in the offshore wind farm VSC-HVDC system. © 2013 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84874542658	Constrained infinite-time receding horizon predictive control based on laguerre model and its application to thermal process	In the design of traditional model predictive controller, the future control signal is obtained based on the forward shift operator. However, when it comes to rapid sampling, complicated process dynamics or high demands on closed-loop performance, it needs numbers of forward shift operators to get a better result of the control signal which leads to plenty of optimized variables and heavy computational burden when implemented on-line. The constrained infinite-time receding horizon predictive control based on laguerre model (CIRHPCL) was proposed by using Laguerre function. The shortcomings above can be overcome; meanwhile, the number of optimized variables is reduced that results in small computational load. Good control performance and system stability can be obtained by using the infinite-time performance index, furthermore, the CIRHPCL proposed is very easily tuned because of a small number of adjustable parameters. © 2012 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84875589513	Predictive direct power control strategy for offshore wind power VSC-HVDC converter	The developed DPC scheme is based on predictive control theory to achieve direct control of instantaneous active and reactive power of the converter. For this purpose, at the beginning of each switching period in the sense of deadbeat control. Therefore it can eliminate the active and reactive power tracking errors at the end of switching period. Meanwhile, combined with space vector modulation (SVM) and the DC bus voltage outer-loop analysis and design, it can obtain the predictive direct power control strategy (P-DPC). When compared to the traditional DPC method, the main features of the proposed P-DPC method, are that it does not need to detect the grid voltage vector position (such as phase-locked loop-PLL, etc.), transfer them into synchronous rotating reference frame and inner-current loop decoupling control. Its switching frequency is fixed. The uncompleted decoupling problem caused by interference of tracking errors and inaccurate parameters are well solved, that improve the system's stability. The unity power factor operation can be realized in stationary reference frame. A PWM-VSC model is set up in Matlab/simulation software, and the results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control methods, which can available for reference in offshore VSC-HVDC engineering.

0142211300	The Mechanism of p21-activated Kinase 2 Autoactivation	The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) play an important role in diverse cellular processes. PAK2 is activated by autophosphorylation upon binding of small G proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac in the GTP-bound state. However, the mechanism of PAK2 autophosphorylation in vitro is unclear. In the present study, the kinetic theory of the substrate reaction during modification of enzyme activity has been applied to a study of the autoactivation of PAK2. On the basis of the kinetic equation of the substrate reaction during the autophosphorylation of PAK2, the activation rate constants for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex have been determined. The results indicate that 1) in the presence of Cdc42, PAK2 autophosphorylation is a bipartite mechanism, with the regulatory domain autophosphorylated at multiple residues, whereas activation coincides with autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain at Thr-402; 2) the autophosphorylation reactions in regulatory domain are either a nonlimiting step or not required for activation of enzyme; 3) the autophosphorylation at site Thr-402 on the catalytic domain occurs by an intermolecular mechanism and is required for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates examined; 4) binding of the exogenous protein/peptide substrates at the active site of PAK2 has little or no effect on the autoactivation of PAK2, suggesting that multiple regions of PAK2 are involved in the enzyme-substrate recognition. The present method also provides a novel approach for studying autophosphorylation reactions. Since the experimental conditions used resemble more closely the in vivo situation where the substrate is constantly being turned over while the enzyme is being modified, this new method would be particularly useful when the regulatory mechanisms of the reversible phosphorylation reaction toward certain enzymes are being assessed.

0346037279	Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism of the p21-activated protein kinase PAK2	The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) play important roles in diverse cellular processes. In the present study, we provide an in-depth kinetic analysis of one of the PAK family members, PAK2, in phosphorylation of a protein substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP), and a synthetic peptide substrate derived from LIM kinase, LIMKtide. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the initial reaction velocity of PAK2 phosphorylation of MBP is consistent with both randomly and compulsorily ordered mechanisms. Further kinetic studies carried out in various concentrations of sucrose revealed that solvent viscosities had no effect on k

To avoid completely shut down the MMC system under SMs fault, a fundamental-frequency zero-sequence injection based neutral-shift method is adopted to enable the fail-safe energy transfer. This approach enhances both the reliability and availability of MMC while avoiding the undesired unbalanced stresses among the healthy SMs. Rigorous simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed control methods.

11244331450	Kinetic analysis of zymogen autoactivation in the presence of a reversible inhibitor	Limited proteolysis is a highly specific irreversible process, which can serve to initiate physiological function by converting a precursor protein into a biologically active form. When the activating enzyme and the activated enzyme coincide, the process is an autocatalytic zymogen activation (i.e. reactions in which the zymogens serves as a substrate for the corresponding active enzyme). The activity of proteases is frequently regulated by the binding of specific protease inhibitors. Thus, to understand the biological regulation of proteolysis, one must understand the role of protease inhibitors. In the present study, a detailed kinetic analysis of autocatalytic reaction modulated by a reversible inhibitor is represented. On the basis of the kinetic equation, a novel procedure is developed to evaluate the kinetic parameters of the reaction. As an example of the application of this method, effects of acetamidine, p-amidinobenzamidine and benzamidine on the autoactivation of trypsinogen by trypsin were studied.
