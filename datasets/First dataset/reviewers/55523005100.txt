84942034654	Efficient public verification on the integrity of multi-owner data in the cloud	Cloud computing enables users to easily store their data and simply share data with others. Due to the security threats in an untrusted cloud, users are recommended to compute verification metadata, such as signatures, on their data to protect the integrity. Many mechanisms have been proposed to allow a public verifier to efficiently audit cloud data integrity without receiving the entire data from the cloud. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has considered about the efficiency of public verification on multi-owner data, where each block in data is signed by multiple owners. In this paper, we propose a novel public verification mechanism to audit the integrity of multi-owner data in an untrusted cloud by taking the advantage of multisignatures. With our mechanism, the verification time and storage overhead of signatures on multi-owner data in the cloud are independent with the number of owners. In addition, we demonstrate the security of our scheme with rigorous proofs. Compared to the straightforward extension of previous mechanisms, our mechanism shows a better performance in experiments.

30944447352	SANTT: Sharing anonymized network traffic traces among researchers	A wide variety of network traffic archives exist in the Internet research community. They provide researchers with traffic traces to study network dynamics, usage characteristics and growth patterns. Because of the limitation of traces collecting distributing tools as well as privacy present in traces, they cannot be deployed widely. Sharing anonymized network traffic traces (SANTT) is presented, a novel system which aims to share valuable network traffic traces safely. It introduces a new prefix-preserving anonymization scheme to sanitize privacy in packets and takes advantage of the capability of specific high-speed traffic capturing hardware. Having got rid of privacy from raw traces, SANTT distributes new traces by multicast, which makes it easy for researchers to access. By using a collection of real and synthetic testing environment, it is shown that SANTT implemented on IXP2400 platform can deal with the heaviest traffic (1,1953,125 PPS) offered by Gigabit links, with high correctness and stability.

Finally, we show that the proposed scheme satisfies the desired security properties, such as correctness, group key secrecy, forward secrecy and backward secrecy. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is be applicable to WSNs.

41649112579	Efficient and universally composable security oblivious transfer	Non-committing encryption achieved only semantic security, in contrast, applications often require security against chosen ciphertext attacks. A main ingredient in the previous adaptive universally composable (UC) oblivious transfer protocols are non-committing encryptions. the previous proposals are not UC secure against adaptive adversaries in the so-called non-erase model. A new UC secure oblivious transfer protocols were proposed and schemes utilize two primitives of the verifiably smooth projective hashing and deniable encryption as constructed by. the double trapdoor decryption mechanism based on trapdoor commitment. Our construction is based on the decisional composite residuosity in common reference string (CRS) model.

43349098289	A new approach for UC security concurrent deniable authentication	Deniable authentication protocols allow a sender to authenticate a message for a receiver, in a way which the receiver cannot convince a third party that such authentication ever took place. When we consider an asynchronous multi-party network with open communications and an adversary that can adaptively corrupt as many parties as it wishes, we present a new approach to solve the problem of concurrent deniable authentication within the framework of universally composable (UC) security. We formulate a definition of an ideal functionality for deniable authentication. Our constructions rely on a modification of the verifiably smooth projective hashing (VSPH) with projection key function by trapdoor commitment. Our protocols are forward deniable and UC security against adaptive adversaries in the common reference string model. A new approach implies that security is preserved under concurrent composition of an unbounded number of protocol executions; it implies non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols and more. The novelty of our schemes is the use of witness indistinguishable protocols and the security is based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption. This new approach is practically relevant as it leads to more efficient protocols and security reductions. © 2008 Science in China Press.

69249164325	Leveled group key management with efficient revocations for wireless sensor networks	Wireless sensor networks are often deployed in hostile environments. Protecting the communication against node capture is one of the most important design objectives. Focused on the revocations of resource constrained nodes, an efficient leveled group key management scheme is proposed. This scheme is based on a novel application of an a-ary logical key tree. Since sensor nodes may leave or join the WSN frequently, a sublevel session key is introduced to protect the sensitive information transmitted in the network. In a leave event, the rlegal sensors in the key tree are partitioned into disjointed subtrees. The group key can be updated securely by encrypting the new group key with the common keys shared by the sensors in the same subtree. When a sensor requests to join the communication group, it is assigned a sublevel session key which is used to communicate with GCKS and other legal sensors. The current session key is sent to the new sensor only after it gets the trust of GCKS. This scheme is scalable, stateless and simple to employ.

So it not only fits for real deployment, but also supports some specific requirement (ex target tracking). Former researchers mainly adopt k-NN method in infrastructure based locating. However, its computing complexity is proportional to the size of sample set, which makes it unscalable when the system grows large. This paper proposes a novel infrastructure WLAN locating method by utilizing neural networks and a new training method to overcome the effect of different power levels of client devices. Through real deployment and testing, the result shows that the computing complexity is much lower than the k-NN method, while the accuracy is very close. Copyright 2008 ACM.

First, the network topology was simplified by combining the chain-clusters and the star-clusters. Next, to prevent the adversary uncover all the administrative keys by a few colluding sensors, the number of sensors needed to capture WSN was increased. Then, the sensors of key combinations distribution were sorted through a coloring algorithm. Based on all these operations, the presented scheme distributed the administrative keys based on the hamming distance and EBS. Furthermore, the approaches handling the join event and leave event were described. Two experiments were performed to study the potential for collusions and the influence of size of compromised nodes on the effectiveness against collusions.

79953186900	A hierarchical key assignment scheme based on Diffie-Hellman algorithm	In content-based access control systems, the subject is only allowed or denied to access the object. There are partial orders between different subjects and objects. The traditional access control policy manages these subjects and objects independently, and does not consider the partial orders which may improve the efficiency. By considering the partial orders, a hierarchical key assignment scheme is proposed in this paper, so as to make the assignment of keys to achieve secure communication and access control, improving the efficiency. The objects can be formed into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using the partial orders between these objects. Then, assign each vertex in the DAG an encryption key based on Diffie-Hellman algorithm, while each vertex may derive the encryption keys of its child vertices by the encryption key of itself. These assigned keys are used to encrypt the resources of the vertices. Thus, the access control of the resources can be achieved by the assignment of the encryption keys. The proposed scheme consists of the phases of system initialization and key updating, and supports user dynamics and topology changes. The security is based on DDH assumptions. It can be used for content-based hierarchical access control.

However, these elimination criteria have obvious computational redundancy. A new elimination criteria based on triangular inequality in subspace was proposed. By finding the optimal reference point of distance computation, the new elimination criteria can reject more unlikely codewords than other elimination criteria using variance and norm. The elimination criteria based on variance can be seen as the special case of new elimination criteria. Before the search process, all codewords in the codebook are Hadamard-transformed and sorted in the ascending order of their first elements. During the search process, the mean value of a vector was used to terminate the search process, and the new elimination criteria based on triangular inequality in subspace was applied to reject most unlikely codewords. Experiments results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is much better than other nearest neighbor codeword search algorithms. Compared with the Hadamard-Transformed based Equal-Average Equal-variance Equal-norm Nearest Neighbor Search algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduces the computational time by 8% to 26%.

So the method of QDI random data-path swapping, which is based on the metastability is put forward. By adopting the two-level swapping structure, the metastability generator and metastability filter, the random swapping between the data-path group and the data-path can be implemented. Simulation results show that, the method has the characteristic of preferable power balance, and the leakage of the side-channel information brought by the differences of the parasitic capacitor and the load capacitor, can also be counteracted.

84875018020	Reversible data hiding in encrypted images by reserving room before encryption	Recently, more and more attention is paid to reversible data hiding (RDH) in encrypted images, since it maintains the excellent property that the original cover can be losslessly recovered after embedded data is extracted while protecting the image content's confidentiality. All previous methods embed data by reversibly vacating room from the encrypted images, which may be subject to some errors on data extraction and/or image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel method by reserving room before encryption with a traditional RDH algorithm, and thus it is easy for the data hider to reversibly embed data in the encrypted image. The proposed method can achieve real reversibility, that is, data extraction and image recovery are free of any error. Experiments show that this novel method can embed more than 10 times as large payloads for the same image quality as the previous methods, such as for PSNR=40 dB. © 2013 IEEE.

84881006002	Action-based multilevel access control for structured document	Cloud computing is a promising computing paradigm which has recently drawn extensive attention from both academia and industry. Meanwhile, structured document plays a vital role as information carrier in cloud computing. Therefore apparently, secure access to structured document is a key technology for the quality control of cloud services. In order to prevent information leakage and unauthorized access to the structured document, which is a common problem caused by lack of the multilevel security mechanism in current cloud computing environment, we propose an action-based multilevel access control model (referred to as the AMAC) and provide a formal description of access control policies. In our AMAC model, we employ noninterference theory in the information flow to establish AMAC noninterference model, and prove the security of multilevel access control policies in our AMAC model. Comparison and analysis with the existing access control models demonstrate that the AMAC model not only improves the flexibility of access control policies on the basis of roles, contexts and access actions, but also realizes multilevel security mechanism in terms of the security levels of the user, the access actions and the structured document.

84883571161	Privacy-preserving logistic regression outsourcing in cloud computing	Cloud computing enables customers with limited computational resources an economically promising paradigm of computation outsourcing. However, how to protect customers' confidential data that is processed and generated during the computation is becoming a major security concern. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we present a secure outsourcing mechanism for training and evaluating large-scale logistic regression classifier in cloud. Our mechanism enables a customer to securely harness the cloud, while keeping both the sensitive input and output of the computation private. Thorough security analysis and prototype experiments on Amazon EC2 demonstrate the validity and practicality of our proposed design. Copyright © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

84890080767	FDR-ABE: Attribute-based encryption with flexible and direct revocation	In attribute-based encryption (ABE) systems, the revocation issue is essential and difficult, since users may change their attributes frequently in practice and each attribute is conceivably shared by multiple users. To our knowledge, all the existing ABE schemes fail to support flexible and direct revocation due to the burdensome update of attribute secret keys and cipher texts. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, in this paper, we formalize the notion of cipher text policy ABE with flexible and direct revocation (FDR-CP-ABE), and give out a concrete construction, which supports direct attribute and user revocation and is applicable to the data sharing architecture. The proposed FDR-CP-ABE scheme outperforms the previous revocation-related methods in that it has constant-size cipher texts and only partial cipher texts need to be updated whenever revocation events occur. Furthermore, we show that our FDR-CP-ABE scheme is provably secure in the standard model and it cannot be achieved by trivial combinations of the techniques of CP-ABE and BE. © 2013 IEEE.

84893594141	Certificateless public auditing for data integrity in the cloud	Due to the existence of security threats in the cloud, many mechanisms have been proposed to allow a user to audit data integrity with the public key of the data owner before utilizing cloud data. The correctness of choosing the right public key in previous mechanisms depends on the security of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificates. Although traditional PKI has been widely used in the construction of public key cryptography, it still faces many security risks, especially in the aspect of managing certificates. In this paper, we design a certificateless public auditing mechanism to eliminate the security risks introduced by PKI in previous solutions. Specifically, with our mechanism, a public verifier does not need to manage certificates to choose the right public key for the auditing. Instead, the auditing can be operated with the assistance of the data owner's identity, such as her name or email address, which can ensure the right public key is used. Meanwhile, this public verifier is still able to audit data integrity without retrieving the entire data from the cloud as previous solutions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first certificateless public auditing mechanism for verifying data integrity in the cloud. Our theoretical analyses prove that our mechanism is correct and secure, and our experimental results show that our mechanism is able to audit the integrity of data in the cloud efficiently. © 2013 IEEE.

84893623418	A secure self-destruction scheme with IBE for the internet content privacy	With the rapid emerging of novelty Web services and cloud services, privacy information and documents of users become increasingly easy to be exposed in the Internet. To tackle the issue of lifecycle security of the privacy information and documents in the Internet, in this paper, we propose the idea of combining the three security methods of multilevel security, identity-based encryption (IBE), and distributed hash table (DHT) network. And we further propose an IBE-based secure self-destruction (ISS) scheme to protect the confidentiality and privacy of the Internet content by self-destruction after a predefined time. In our proposed ISS security scheme, the Internet content is first partitioned into many segments with diverse security levels, and each segment is encrypted with a symmetric key to obtain primitive ciphertext. By applying the methods of association and extraction, the primitive ciphertext is turned to associated ciphertext, which is then divided into extracted ciphertext and encapsulated ciphertext. The latter is encapsulated into the Internet content self-destructing object (CDO), which is stored into the storage services provider. Furthermore, to protect the privacy security when the CDO expired, the symmetric key is encrypted using the IBE algorithm based on the identity of the authorized user. The combination of this key's ciphertext and the extracted ciphertext, by means of Lagrange polynomial processing, generates mixture ciphertext shares. Then those shares are distributed into nodes within the DHT network and will be automatically discarded over the deadline when the primitive ciphertext and the symmtric key are unrecoverable. Consequently, the ISS scheme achieves the aim of secure self-destruction. Comprehensive analysis shows that the ISS scheme is able to satisfy all the design demands and is more secure than existing schemes. The ISS scheme can resist against not only the traditional cryptanalysis and brute-force attack, but also the Sybil attack (e. g., hopping attack and sniffer attack) from the DHT network.

84894146817	CL-TAP: An efficient certificateless based trusted access protocol for WLAN	Based on the certificateless public key cryptography and the trusted computing technologies, a certificateless based trusted access protocol for WLAN (Wireless local area networks) is proposed. Such protocol realizes the mutual authentication and unicast session key agreement between STA and AP within 3 protocol rounds. In particular, the platform authentication and integrity verification are achieved during the authentication procedure. The security properties of the new protocol are examined using the Extended Canetti-Krawczyk security model. The analytic comparisons show that the new protocol is very efficient in both computing and communications.

84897489354	A secure self-destruction scheme for composite documents with attribute based encryption	In order to protect the confidentiality and privacy security of the composite documents within the whole life cycle, we leverage attribute-based encryption (ABE) algorithm to propose a secure self-destruction scheme for composite documents, referred to as SelfDoc. We firstly set up a new composite document structure by employing the idea of multilevel security, and then, use an access key to encrypt the composite document and the ABE algorithm to encrypt the access key. After a series of algorithms for extracting and transforming from the two ciphertexts, we obtain ciphertext shares and encapsulated self-destruction object, both of which are stored into two distributed hash table (DHT) networks and cloud servers respectively. Nodes in the DHT networks will self-discard the ciphertext shares periodically, so the original ciphertext and access key are unrecoverable after the expiration time, and the function of secure self-destruction is achieved. Compared with existing schemes, the security analyses indicate that SelfDoc scheme is able to resist the traditional cryptoanalysis or brute-force attack, and the Sybil attacks from the DHT networks.

84907733019	Action-based multi-level access control model	The developments of communication, computer, and multimedia technologies have speeded up information transmission. The information has been becoming multi-dimensional. The multi-level security could not only ensure the correctness of information transmission, but also keep the integrality and confidentiality of the data. The traditional multi-level security models have been implemented with the classic access control models, such as RBAC (role-based access control), which solve the problems of multi-level access control to some extent. But they could not accommodate the users' requirements of multi-level permission management at anytime and anywhere with the consideration of the temporal and environmental factors in the existing multi-level security access control mechanisms. How to implement the multi-level access control with the consideration of time and environment has become a problem to be solved. Firstly, we present an action-based multi-level access control model, which integrates the BLP and ABAC (action-based access control) together by extending the security level to action. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of permission specification with time and environment, we make the description of security level more detailed by defining the reading level (lr) and writing level (lw). The corresponding security rules and proof have been given. Finally, we give the implementing scheme of our model. By integrating the temporal state and environmental state together for the current complicated network, our scheme could solve the problems of the multi-level management and access control.

84910680779	Preserving identity privacy on multi-owner cloud data during public verification	The low prices on cloud data storage and sharing services incentive users to outsource their data to the cloud. Because data stored in the cloud may be lost or corrupted, users are suggested to verify data integrity before the utilization of cloud data. A series of schemes have been proposed to enable a public verifier to efficiently check the correctness of cloud data without downloading the whole data from the cloud server. Unfortunately, few of them have considered about public verification on multi-owner cloud data while still preserving identity privacy of owners from public verifiers, where each block in these cloud data should be signed by multiple owners. In this paper, we design a novel public verification scheme to audit the integrity of multi-owner data stored in the cloud. With our scheme, a public verifier is able to efficiently check the integrity of multi-owner data with a very small communication cost compared with the size of the entire data. Meanwhile, the private identities of these owners are protected and not revealed to any public verifier. In addition, our scheme can also efficiently support group dynamics for multiple owners and enable batch verification. Security analyses and experimental results indicate our scheme is correct, secure and efficient.

84915745371	Attribute-based data sharing with flexible and direct revocation in cloud computing	Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic primitive for implementing fine-grained data sharing in cloud computing. However, before ABE can be widely deployed in practical cloud storage systems, a challenging issue with regard to attributes and user revocation has to be addressed. To our knowledge, most of the existing ABE schemes fail to support flexible and direct revocation owing to the burdensome update of attribute secret keys and all the ciphertexts. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, we formalize the notion of ciphertext-policy ABE supporting flexible and direct revocation (FDR-CP-ABE), and present a concrete construction. The proposed scheme supports direct attribute and user revocation. To achieve this goal, we introduce an auxiliary function to determine the ciphertexts involved in revocation events, and then only update these involved ciphertexts by adopting the technique of broadcast encryption. Furthermore, our construction is proven secure in the standard model. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that FDR-CP-ABE outperforms the previous revocation-related methods.

84922866378	An action-based fine-grained access control mechanism for structured documents and its application	This paper presents an action-based fine-grained access control mechanism for structured documents. Firstly, we define a describing model for structured documents and analyze the application scenarios. The describing model could support the permission management on chapters, pages, sections, words, and pictures of structured documents. Secondly, based on the action-based access control (ABAC) model, we propose a fine-grained control protocol for structured documents by introducing temporal state and environmental state. The protocol covering different stages from document creation, to permission specification and usage control are given by using the Z-notation. Finally, we give the implementation of our mechanism and make the comparisons between the existing methods and our mechanism. The result shows that our mechanism could provide the better solution of fine-grained access control for structured documents in complicated networks. Moreover, it is more flexible and practical.
