34548177310	Real time dynamic compensated storage control model for cascade reservoirs	The Successive Approximate Decomposition Coordination Model based on forecasting and reservoir storage compensation was developed-for flood control of cascade reservoirs. By using this model the dynamic control schemes of reservoir storage for flood control can be obtained. The model was consisted of two components: the compensative dispatch module for obtaining the optimal operation processes of all reservoirs with the suggested flood storage restricting the same iterative calculation and the flood storage module for calculating the allowable minimum flood storage of each reservoir according to the results of the others obtained from the results of the former module. The application to Qingjiang cascade hydropower plants shows that the proposed model can give the controlling rules for optimal dynamic flood storage and elevates the efficiency of reservoir system management and utilization of flood water.

34548715825	Historical temporal trends of hydro-climatic variables and runoff response to climate variability and their relevance in water resource management in the Hanjiang basin	The Danjiangkou reservoir lies in the upper Hanjiang basin and is the source of water for the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) in China. Any significant change in the magnitude or timing of runoff from the Danjiangkou reservoir induced by changes in climatic variables would have significant implications for the economic prosperity of the area in the Hanjiang basin as well as for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. In this paper the following issues are investigated: (1) Temporal trends of annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature from 1951 to 2003 in the Hanjiang basin are analyzed using the Mann-Kendall and the linear regression methods; spatial distributions of precipitation and temperature are interpolated by the inverse distance weighted interpolation method. (2) Temporal trends of runoff, precipitation and temperature from 1951 to 2003 in the Danjiangkou reservoir, an upper stream basin of the Hanjiang River, are further tested. (3) To assess the impact of climate change on water resources and predict the future runoff change in the Danjiangkou reservoir basin, a two-parameter water balance model is used to simulate the hydrological response for the climate change predicted by GCMs for the region for the period of 2021-2050. The results indicate that (1) at the α = 0.05 significance level precipitation in the Hanjiang basin has no trend, but the temperature in the same region has significant upward trends in most parts of the Hanjiang basin. (2) The mean annual, spring, and winter runoffs in the Danjiangkou reservoir basin have decreasing trends. (3) The results simulated for the period 2021-2050 show that runoff of the Danjiangkou reservoir would increase in all the seasons, mainly in response to the predicted precipitation increase in the region. Sensitivity analysis shows that a 1 °C and 2 °C increase in temperature would reduce the mean annual runoff to about 3.5% and 7%, respectively. A decrease/increase of the mean monthly precipitation of 20% and 10% would decrease/increase the mean annual runoff to about 30% and 15%, respectively. The results of this study provide a scientific reference not only for assessing the impact of the climate change on water resources and the flood prevention in the Hanjiang basin, but also for dimensioning the middle route of the SNWDP in China. © 2007.

34648833491	Application of the automatic telemetering system for soil moisture condition to the oasis agricultural areas	The importance of establishing the automatic telemetering system for soil moisture and irrigation decision-making information system in the arid irrigation areas was stated in detail in this paper. However, there is little research on establishing the drought-resistance decision-making information system through the method for hydrological drought-monitoring of the change of soil moisture in the farmland so far. It also introduces the method for monitoring soil moisture and the forecasting model for irrigation in arid irrigation areas. Moreover, the paper specially states the way of information transferring, structure and function of the automatic telemetering system and irrigation decision-making system for soil moisture. Research results indicated that the integrated management system for the comprehensive information including soil moisture, meteorological information, irrigation, agricultural activities, can be applied through the information technology. As a result, the application of the system improved the level of irrigation management and water resources use. Much useful implication can be abstracted from the research for water resource management in the arid and semi-arid areas.

34848906789	Non-identical models for seasonal flood frequency analysis	The aim is to build a seasonal flood frequency analysis model and estimate seasonal design floods. The importance of seasonal flood frequency analysis and the advantages of considering seasonal design floods in the derivation of reservoir planning and operating rules are discussed, recognising that seasonal flood frequency models have been in use for over 30 years. A set of non-identical models with non-constant parameters is proposed and developed to describe flows that reflect seasonal flood variation. The peak-over-threshold (POT) sampling method was used, as it is considered to provide significantly more information on flood seasonality than annual maximum (AM) sampling and has better performance in flood seasonality estimation. The number of exceedences is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution (Po), while the peak exceedences are described by the exponential (Ex) and generalized Pareto (GP) distributions and a combination of both, resulting in three models, viz. Po-Ex, Po-GP and Po-Ex/GP. Their performances are analysed and compared. The Geheyan and the Baiyunshan reservoirs were chosen for the case study. The application and statistical experiment results show that each model has its merits and that the Po-Ex/GP model performs best. Use of the Po-Ex/GP model is recommended in seasonal flood frequency analysis for the purpose of deriving reservoir operation rules. Copyright © 2007 IAHS Press.

The synchronous-asynchronous encounter probability of rich-poor precipitation was analyzed. The results show that synchronous frequency of both rich and poor exhibits descending tendency from south to north, and the encounter frequency of synchronous poor precipitation is slightly greater than synchronous rich precipitation, while the frequency of both normal precipitation is the smallest. The amount of water transferred to receiving areas is limited during dry season, which needs to jointly operate with other water resource projects to ensure the water security of receiving areas.

Secondly, the operating rules are established by using the statistical analysis of the optimal data set. Thirdly, the operating rules are refined by using the simulation based optimization method.

38549104230	A real-time flood updating model based on the Bayesian method	A real-time flood forecasting model based on the Bayesian method was proposed and developed, and it is used to update the forecasts of a deterministic model. In order to quantify the hydrological uncertainty, a prior distribution describing the natural uncertainty about the hydrological data, and a likelihood function describing the uncertainty of the hydrological model and parameters, were formulated. Then the prior distribution and the likelihood function were integrated together to form a Bayesian posterior distribution that provided more useful information than the traditional deterministic updating procedures. An auto-regressive (AR) model and recursive least-squares estimate (RLS) model were chosen as parallel schemes to compare with the proposed updating model. The Baiyunshan Reservoir basin data was used as a case study. All three updating models were employed to update the discharge estimates of the deterministic hydrological model. It is shown that the proposed model not only has a more superior forecasting precision, but also provides the distribution of the observed discharge as well as the interval estimates, which is more complete in the frame of reference and combines the forecasting and decision-making processes together.

Encountering risk of AMFOD and that of corresponding magnitudes between two rivers were analyzed. Two peak points of July 15th and September 13th were obtained with a risk of 0.02% and 0.008% respectively.

The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) were applied to reservoir flood routing for risk estimation of reservoir flood operation. The uncertainty of inflow hydrograph forecasting error was transformed into that of reservoir water level, through the derivation of relation between variance rate of SDEs and standard error of inflow forecasting error. The Geheyan reservoir was selected as a case study. Extreme and overtopping risks of the reservoir under different forecasting accuracy were estimated, which can provide the guide to reservoir flood control.

84867410802	Comparison of different statistical downscaling methods and evaluation indicators in climate change impact on runoff	The application of statistical downscaling techniques and their evaluation indicators in climate change impacts studies on runoff in Hanjiang basin were compared and assessed by focusing on the key issues of climate change impacts studies on water resources currently. The NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis data and CGCM3 and HadCM3 under A2 scenario being the background of large-scale climate, large-scale climate factors were downscaled by using SSVM and SDSM statistical downscaling techniques, which were used as inputs for hydrological models. Then the simulated runoffs corresponding to various scenarios were analyzed comprehensively. The results show that for the same GCM, the simulation results of runoff vary greatly by using precipitation as the input to hydrological models through different statistical downscaling techniques. Evaluation indicators of precipitation simulation and runoff simulation results through statistical downscaling techniques demonstrate that rainfall runoff calculation cannot be fully utilized in evaluation indicator system of precipitation. While the evaluation of runoff simulation should be a key reference in turn to asses the simulation of precipitation by using the downscaling method in the climate changes impact on runoff.

84888038210	Measure of correlation between river flows using the copula-entropy method	Analysis of the dependence between the main stream and its upper tributaries is important for hydraulic design, flood prevention, and risk control. The concept of total correlation, computed by the copula-entropy method, was applied to measure the dependence. This method only needs to calculate the copula entropy instead of the marginal or joint entropy, which estimates the total correlation more directly and avoids the accumulation of systematic bias. To that end, bivariate and multivariate Archimedean and metaelliptical copulas were employed, and multiple-integration and Monte Carlo methods were used to calculate the copula entropy. The methodology was applied to the upper Yangtze River reach in China, which has five major tributaries: Jinsha, Min, Tuo, Jialing, and Wu. Results showed that the selected copulas fitted the empirical probability distributions satisfactorily. There was a significant difference in total correlation values, when different copula functions were used. The copula entropy, calculated using the multiple-integration and Monte Carlo methods, led to similar results. The total correlation among the rivers was not high, and the one between Min and Tuo Rivers was the largest. There was some dependence among Jinsha, Min, and Tuo rivers, which constitutes a threat to flood control by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The flows of the Jinsha, Jialing, Min, and Tuo rivers significantly influence the flood occurrence in the Yangtze River. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84908265357	Deriving the optimal refill rule for multi-purpose reservoir considering floodcontrol risk	For most multi-purpose reservoirs, there is a conflict between the flood control and refill operations. Refill before the end of the flood season is a valuable and effective solution to the conflict. In this paper, we present a method to derive the optimal refill rule for multi-purpose reservoir considering flood control risk. The paper begins with an investigation of the temporal trends of historical reservoir inflow series during refill period by the methods of linear regression, Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho test. Six refill rules are then proposed. A procedure to couple a flood control risk module with utilization benefits analysis module is then developed to derive the optimal refill rule. China's Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is selected as a case study. The application results show that the optimal refill rule is that refill begins on September 1 with storage level reaching 160. m on September 30 linearly. Compared with the original rule, the optimal refill rule can increase hydropower generation by 7.19%, decrease spilled water by 25.07%, and improve the fullness storage rate to 95.35%, without increasing flood control risk.

42949106960	Seasonal flood frequency analysis and flood prevention standard	The flood quantile estimated by conventional seasonal flood frequency is less than or equal to annual maximum estimator, and can not satisfy a given flood prevention standard. A bivariate joint distribution with Pearson Type III distribution margins is developed based on Gumbel-Hougaard Copula and used to describe two seasonal maximum flood series. A relational equation between annual maximum flood and seasonal maximum floods is developed, and the relationship between the frequencies of seasonal flood quantiles and design flood prevention standard is also given. Ultimately a new seasonal flood frequency analysis method is proposed and developed. Compared with the conventional annual maximum method, the seasonal design floods estimated with the proposed method are slightly greater in the main flood season and less in other flood seasons. It is shown that the proposed method could satisfy flood prevention standard and provide a new way for determining seasonal design floods.

The SACOM consists of three components. First one is compensate operating module for obtaining the optimal operation processes of all the reservoirs. Second one is pre-release forecasting module for calculating the allowable maximum water level of every reservoir.

45749125334	A new design flood hydrograph method based on bivariate joint distribution	The design flood hydrograph (DFH) consists of the flood peak, flood volume, etc. that need to be described by the joint behaviour of several non-independent random variables. Conventional flood frequency analysis is based on the univariate distribution of either flood peak or flood volume, while bivariate flood frequency analysis describes the flood peak and volume jointly, and then provides more information to the flood hydrograph. A new DFH derivation method based on a bivariate joint distribution is proposed and developed. In this method, a copula is used to obtain the bivariate joint distribution of flood peak and volume with Pearson type III (P3) distribution margins. Application of the proposed DFH method to the Geheyan reservoir is demonstrated and discussed. The proposed method is superior to the conventional method with a more reasonable shape for consideration of the correlation between flood peak and volume. This study provides an alternative way for derivation of DFH in hydraulic engineering practice. Copyright © 2008 IAHS Press.

45749144824	Optimal design of seasonal flood control water levels for the Three Gorges Reservoir	Reservoirs are one of the most effective measures for integrated water resources development. Flood control water levels (FCWL) for different seasons are adopted to obtain more economic benefits without lowering the flood protection standard. In this study, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to conduct simulations for optimal design of seasonal FCWL for the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). For a given design flood protection standard, the seasonal FCWL for different seasons should not remain unchanged during the flood season and should be determined optimally. In view of the fact that the seasonal FCWL risk should be less than that of an annually designed FCWL, a simulation-based optimal seasonal FCWL model was developed to simultaneously maximize the benefits and minimize the flood risk. By using the 122-year (from 1882 to 2003) daily discharge data series, a multi-objective GA with mixed encoding was used to optimize the seasonal FCWL for TGR and yielded a set of Pareto solutions. The results indicate that the proposed model can make an effective trade-off between the flood control, hydropower generation and navigation, and can enhance the water use efficiency and the economic benefits of TGR without reducing the design flood protection standard.

The existing literatures only consider the distribution of flood magnitudes, but ignors the flood occurrence dates. In this paper, Von Mises distribution and Pearson Type III distribution are used to describe the occurrence dates and magnitudes of annual maximum flood respectively. A bivariate joint distribution with Von Mises distribution and Pearson Type III distribution margins is developed based on the Gumbel Archimedean Copula and used to describe the annual maximum flood series. The approaches for calculating conditional probability, joint probability and bivariate return period are presented. Case study shows that the bivariate joint distribution can fit both occurrence dates and magnitudes of annual maximum flood series well.

52249108925	Effect of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on solute transport in groundwater	The Bayesian inference method and stochastic simulation technique are applied to quantitatively study the impact of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on solute transport in groundwater and a 2-D analysis of ideal flow is carried out. In the analysis the uncertainty due to stochastic simulation and the influence of the uncertainty of the parameters in the model are taken into account. The results show that the posterior distributions of parameters are dissymmetrical. When more conditional data are incorporated in the analysis, the standard deviation of parameters will be smaller and the centralized trend is more obvious. The uncertainty of solute transport increases with the increase of time elapsed and decreases with the increase of the number of conditional data. When the uncertainty of parameters is taken into account, the uncertainty of solute transport obviously increases.

56249111980	Coupling the long-term and short-term optimization models for reservoir operation	In order to maximize the benefits obtained from reservoir operation, optimization models should be applied. Both long-term and short-term optimization models should be included, and they should be coupled appropriately to consider both long-term and short-term benefits. This paper presents a methodology to couple the long-term and short-term optimization models. The methodology is applied to operate a reservoir to show the obtained benefits. The Discretized Deterministic Dynamic Programming (DDDP) is used as the optimization algorithm, and is applied to both long-term and short-term optimization models. The long-term DDDP model uses the historical monthly average inflows as the inputs, and the outputs are the monthly average releases and water levels. The monthly water levels are then interpolated into daily water levels, which are used as the terminal conditions for the short-term optimization model. For each short term optimization cycle, the initial water level is the actual water level reached at the end of the previous stage. The short-term DDDP model optimizes the operation within the short-term optimization cycle, but only the first day's optimization results (the release and water level) are applied for real operation. This process is repeated iteratively until the end of the long-term optimization cycle is reached. The overall optimization time horizon is one hydrological year. Then the benefits obtained over the whole hydrological year are calculated and compared to the actual benefits obtained from the real reservoir operation. This coupling methodology is applied to a reservoir sited on the main channel of the Qingjiang River (a tributary of Changjiang River) in China. The benefits from the reservoir operation are interpreted as the electricity obtained. The results showed that on average, there is a 7% increase in electricity generated compared to the actual electricity generated (2.2 × 10

56249127875	Appropriate application of artificial neural networks for flow forecasting	The research presented in this paper is to determine the appropriate complexity and appropriate training of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). For an ANN, 'complexity' refers to the network structure and thus to the number of neurons in the network. The ANN is used for one-day ahead forecasting of the discharge in the river Meuse (western Europe) at Borgharen (in the south of the Netherlands), based on the recorded precipitation upstream of Borgharen. The forecasting performance is measured with the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient R2 and the Relative Mean Absolute Error RMAE, the applied training algorithm is the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and the applied performance function is the Mean Square Error (MSE). All networks are trained multiple times, so that not only the mean of the R2 and the RMAE values are calculated, but also the standard deviations to evaluate their uncertainties. First, the numbers of input and hidden neurons are varied to determine the effect of network complexity on the forecasting performance. Secondly, the influence of weight decay on the forecasting performance is determined for different network complexities. Weight decay is a method used to train an ANN with a modified performance function, which normally is MSE. For weight decay, a penalty term is added to the performance function to prevent the values of the weights and biases becoming too large during the training to enable a smoother network response. Different degrees of weight decay influence are introduced by varying the value of the 'decay coefficient' from 0.1 to 1, with higher values corresponding to a smaller influence of weight decay. Network complexity is now expressed in terms of the total number of neurons in the network. Thirdly, the effect of the number of training epochs (or iterations) on the forecasting performance is determined, again for different network complexities in terms of total number of neurons in the network. The network structure (or complexity) has the largest influence on the flow forecasting performance. The influence of the number of framing epochs is somewhat smaller, and weight decay has the smallest influence on the flow forecasting performance. An 8-4-1 network (8 neurons in the input layer, 4 in the hidden layer and 1 in the output layer) trained for 11 epochs with no weight decaying being applied was identified as an appropriate network. Networks simpler than an 8-4-1 network should be trained more than 13 epochs. For networks more complex than an 8-4-1 network, the appropriate training epochs range between 8 and 11. For a simple network, weight decay is not a useful method to improve the network's generalization ability. For a complex network, weight decay can help to prevent overfitting, by compensating for the negative influence of a greater network complexity on network performance provided. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.

55749085869	A real-time dynamic flood prevention storage control model for Qingjiang cascade reservoirs	By considering real-time flood forecasting and storage compensate capacity, a Real-time Dynamic Flood Prevention Storage Control Model (RDFPSCM) was proposed and developed for cascade reservoirs. The RDFPSCM consists of two components. The first component is a compensate operating module for obtaining the optimal operation processes of all the reservoirs with the suggested flood prevention storage constraints of the same iterative calculation; the second one is a flood storage module for calculating the allowable minimum flood storage of each reservoir according to the results of the other reservoirs calculated by the first module. The successive approximation approach is used to coordinate the differences between flood prevention storage constraints in the first module and allowable minimum flood prevention storage in the second module. The merits of the proposed methodology were demonstrated with an application to the Qingjiang cascade reservoirs in Hubei Province, China.

61849143273	Use of Nash's IUH and DEMs to identify the parameters of an unequal-reservoir cascade IUH model	Under the assumption that hydrograph generation was affected by n linear reservoirs with the same value of storage coefficient k, Nash proposed the formulation of the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH), which has been widely used in rainfall-runoff simulation and flood forecasting. However, the assumption of the parameter k having the same value in all reservoirs is obviously unphysical as it results in the estimated value of n not being integral. In this study, for parameter n integral, the different k value for each reservoir was derived using the Laplace transform and developing a general rule for the equation of the IUH of any order. The relationship between parameter k and the slope of the river channel estimated using digital elevation model (DEM) data is established, the parameter estimation procedures are given. As in most unit hydrograph studies, only isolated storm events are considered here. Seventeen flood events in three catchments were selected for the case studies. Application results show that the proposed method is slightly better than Nash's IUH with higher model efficiency and smaller absolute relative errors. This work provides a new methodology for the formulation of the IUH. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, this model does not take account of antecedent catchment wetness that may effect the simulation and forecasting accuracy. A modified NLPM-ANN model is proposed and developed to take the consideration of antecedent catchment wetness. The output perturbing terms of the response function in the simple linear model (SLM) in an auxiliary component are taken as inputs of ANN to represent catchment wetness. The simulated total runoff is obtained by integrating the outputs of ANN with that of the seasonal model. The rainfall-runoff data of eight catchments were selected and used to compare the modified NLPM-ANN with the NLPM-ANN models. Results show that the modified NLPM-ANN is significantly superior to the NLPM-ANN, and the model component efficiency index values are 16.82% and 16.74% over the NLPM-ANN during calibration and verification periods, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

70350708348	Coupling hydrological model with MM5 for flood forecasting in the Hanjiang basin	Accurate forecasts of river flows resulting from watershed runoff can be made by traditional forecasting methods only after the rain has fallen and been recorded by the hydrologic metering system. During flooding events, this limits the amount of lead-time available for implementation of emergency management measures. Translating precipitation forecasts into runoff forecasts can greatly improve the runoff-forecast lead time. The aim of this paper is to develop a meteorological model-based flood forecasting system for the Hanjiang basin. Firstly, a MM5 meteorological model and a VIC distributed hydrological model were established with a 9 km × 9 km mesh. Then these two models were passively coupled without any feedback interactions for flood forecasting in this basin. The proposed system was verified by using the daily hydrological and meteorological data during flood period of 2005~2007. Results show that the proposed system can simulate and forecast runoff hydrograph well, due to the acquisition of MM5 rainfall forecast, the forecast made by using the system can provide a longer lead time compared to traditional forecasting method.

Conventional flood frequency analysis methods are generally based on the univariate distributions of either flood peaks or flood volumes, and hence only provide a limited assessment of flood events. In this paper, a multicharacteristic synthesis index (MSI) method is developed to describe flood hydrographs in an integrated way by considering the multiple characteristics synthetically, such as flood peak, 1-day maximum flood volume, 3-day maximum flood volume, 7-day maximum flood volume, etc. Annual maximum flood hydrograph series are sampled and then are transformed into corresponding MSI series by the MSI method. The quantile of the MSI series corresponding to a specified design return period is estimated by conventional flood frequency analysis method. A procedure for derivation of design flood hydrograph based on the MSI quantile is proposed. An application at the Geheyan reservoir in China is given.

An optimization-simulation-test algorithm is proposed, and the optimal impounding schemes for the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) are derived using the multi-objective genetic algorithms. The results show that under the condition of ensuring flood safety, the optimal schemes can generate 17% extra hydropower energy, save 44% flood water resources and also improve the fullness storage and navigation guarantee ratios greatly. To maximize comprehensive utilization benefits on the premise of the flood control safety, the design flood routing method is well combined with the optimization method by scientifically dividing flood storage capacity into two parts and optimizing the reservoir impounding schemes, which provides a new way for studying the reservoir impounding.

A first-order non-stationary time series model, namely seasonal CAR(1), was established based on Copula function and compared with seasonal AR(1) model. Monthly stream flow data of the Yichang station was investigated and verified by using the proposed seasonal CAR(1) model. Results suggested that the proposed model can preserve the statistical properties of the recorded data series, especially the skew, non-linear dependence and probability density properties, and provides a new way for the study of hydrology and water resources simulation.

75649140209	Two new approaches to dividing flood sub-seasons in flood season using the fractal theory	This paper is an attempt to analyze the hydrological phenomena's non-linearity, randomicity, credibility and similarity. In the same season each year, the flood hydrograph is self-similar and exhibits fractal characteristics. It is an argument about using fractal theory. This paper presents two new approaches to dividing flood sub-seasons by using the fractal theory. Two approaches to calculating fractal dimensions are both the magnitude measurement in the temporal scale and the similarity measurement in the spacial scale. This paper chooses the sample series of the daily maximum discharge in the flood season from 1960 to 2002 at the Zhanghe Reservoir. Both results of the two new approaches to dividing flood sub-seasons by using fractal theory are the same. Both results of dividing flood-periods by using the fractal theory are uniform with the traditional approach. Compared with the traditional approach, fractal approaches have quantitative and objective characteristics and are convenient in calculation, and are widely used in practice. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

77952783799	Schemes of storage level control of Three Gorges reservoir during flood seasons	Storage level control during flood seasons is important to the operation and benefits of the Three Gorges reservoir(TGR). This paper analyzes the seasonal variation of reservoir inflow hydrographs, combines several multi-stage methods, and finally obtains a synthetic scheme of TGR storage level control. The scheme is obtained by three steps, adopt a different flood operation rule for each flood stage, determine the storage level limits before and after flood time by flood routing calculation to satisfy the safety requirements, and formulate an operation scheme through pre-release forecast. In comparison with the existing scheme, the power generation of TGR would be considerably increased. Verification based on a synthetic inflow series generated by a first order autoregressive model shows the applicability and reliability of the proposed scheme. Copyright.

77954023532	The dynamic control bound of flood limited water level considering inflow uncertainty in Three Gorges Reservoir	The dynamic control bound of flood limited water level (FLWL) is a fundamental and key element for implementing reservoir FLWL dynamic control. The acceptable risk constraints and quantificational analysis of flood control operation were proposed by considering the most important risk sources, i.e., reservoir inflow forecasting error and uncertainty of flood hydrograph shape. The inflow uncertainty, risk analysis and the process of dynamic control bound determination were incorporated organically, and a dynamic control bound of reservoir FLWL was calculated using forecasting pre-release and Monte-Carlo simulation methods. The application results of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) showed that the dynamic control of FLWL can effectively increase middle and small flood water resources utilization rate without increasing flood control risk.

77955860794	Optimal solute transport in heterogeneous aquifer: Coupled inverse modelling	Characterisation of transmissivity heterogeneity is critical for groundwater flow and solute transport. The heterogeneity of transmissivity is studied through variogram-based techniques. Conventionally, the parameters in variogram are obtained by fitting measurements to a theoretical variogram. However, conditioning to the sampled geological variables neglects the effects of observed concentration data. This paper presents a coupled inverse modelling system conditioning to both types of measurement. The results of a hypothetical two-dimensional steady flow indicated that the description of transmissivity and solute concentration field was improved when both measured transmissivity data and solute concentration data were combined in the coupled inverse modelling system.

77956191833	Dynamic control of flood limited water level for reservoir operation by considering inflow uncertainty	According to the Chinese Flood Control Act, reservoir water levels generally are not allowed to exceed the flood limited water level (FLWL) during flood season in order to offer adequate storage for flood prevention. However, the operation rules based on the current FLWL have neglected meteorological and real-time flood forecasting information and give too much priority to low probability floods. For floodwater utilization, dynamic control of reservoir FLWL is a valuable and effective methodology to compromise between flood control and conservation for reservoir operation during the flood season. The dynamic control bound is a fundamental key element for implementing reservoir FLWL dynamic control operation. In this paper, a dynamic control operation model that considers inflow uncertainty, i.e. the inflow forecasting error and uncertainty of the flood hydrograph shape is proposed and developed. The model consists of three modules: the first one is a pre-release module, which is used to estimate the upper boundary of dynamic control bound on basis of inflow forecasting results; the second one is a refill operation module, which is used to retain recession flood, and the third one is a risk analysis module, which is used to assess flood risk. The acceptable flood control operation risk constraints and quantificational analysis methods are given, and the dynamic control bound of reservoir FLWL is estimated by using Monte Carlo simulation. The China's three gorges reservoir (TGR) is selected as a case study. A multiple-input single-output linear systematic model is chosen for inflow forecasting of the TGR, and the future inflows are derived from gauged records by assuming that the inflow forecasting error follows a normal distribution. The application results show that the dynamic control of reservoir FLWL can effectively increase hydropower generation and the floodwater utilization rate without increasing flood control risk. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78649755000	Flood season segmentation based on the probability change-point analysis technique	The segmentation of flood seasons has both theoretical and practical importance in hydrological sciences and water resources management. The probability change-point analysis technique is applied to segmenting a defined flood season into a number of sub-seasons. Two alternative sampling methods, annual maximum and peaksover- threshold, are used to construct the new flow series. The series is assumed to follow the binomial distribution and is analysed with the probability change-point analysis technique. A Monte Carlo experiment is designed to evaluate the performance of proposed flood season segmentation models. It is shown that the change-point based models for flood season segmentation can rationally partition a flood season into appropriate sub-seasons. China's new Three Gorges Reservoir, located on the upper Yangtze River, was selected as a case study since a hydrological station with observed flow data from 1882 to 2003 is located 40 km downstream of the dam. The flood season of the reservoir can be reasonably divided into three sub-seasons: the pre-flood season (1 June-2 July); the main flood season (3 July-10 September); and the post-flood season (11-30 September). The results of flood season segmentation and the characteristics of flood events are reasonable for this region. © 2010 IAHS Press.

78650936473	Joint operation of the Three Gorges cascade reservoirs and the Qingjiang cascade reservoirs	The joint operation, of the Three Gorges cascade reservoirs and the Qingjiang cascade reservoirs was studied in this paper. Optimal models were established with objective functions to maximize power generation and to maximize power benefits, respectively, for individual and joint operation of cascade reservoirs. The models were optimized by a progressive optimization algorithm, and the storage and electric compensation benefits were analyzed. A case study using the daily runoff data of hydrological years 1982-1987 indicates that, compared with regular operation, the joint operation of five reservoirs increases the annual yield by 6.090 and 6.071 billions kW·h or the annual benefit by 1.437 and 1.470 billions Yuan by the two objective functions, respectively. Through storage compensation and power yield maximizing, the volume of wasted water by the Three Gorges cascade and the Qingjiang cascade was decreased by 56.688 and 3.673 billions m

78650943892	Regional design flood composition based on Copula function	Regional flood composition is in general a spatially stochastic problem, and the most scientific analysis method is to construct a joint distribution for the composition regions. In this paper, Copula function was used to establish the joint distribution of upper-station flood and interval-basin flood. The conditional expectation composition and most likely composition were proposed and derived. The guarantee level of equivalent frequency composition was analyzed by comparing with conditional expectation composition. A case study suggests that conditional expectation composition is at a low guarantee level. The derived equivalent frequency composition contains confidence interval and other information that is useful to decision-making. The derived most likely composition that considers the spatial correlation of regional flood is more practical. The proposed method provides a new approach for analysis of regional flood composition. © Copyright.

78751572794	Deriving Optimal Refill Rules for Multi-Purpose Reservoir Operation	This paper focuses on deriving optimal refill rules for a multi-purpose reservoir, and aims to maximize utilization benefits under the condition of flood control safety. The entire flood season is divided into multiple sub-seasons (i.e. pre-flood season, main-flood season and post-flood season). By advancing the start of the refill period to the beginning of the post-flood season, seasonal design flows during the new refill period are estimated. A multi-objective refill operation model is proposed by combining flood control and conservation together. The simulation-optimization-test framework and hybrid multi-objective genetic algorithms are developed and used to optimize the rule curves. China's Three Gorges Reservoir is selected as a case study and the application results show that the proposed model can increase the hydropower generation by 17.4%, decrease spilled water by 43.9%, and improve the refill probability greatly without decreasing the flood control standard and navigation probability during the refill period. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

78751678506	Analysis of climate change impact on precipitation in Danjiangkou reservoir basin by using statistical downscaling method	General circulation models (GCMs) are often used to assess the impact of climate change. As they operate on coarse scales, the simulation results obtained from GCMs are not particularly in accordance with comparatively smaller river basin scales. A statistical downscaling method based on a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed for downscaling daily total precipitation series from GCMs outputs for the Danjiangkou reservoir basin in China. The downscaling method is developed and validated using large-scale predictor variables derived from the National Center for Environmental Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data set. The performance of the LS-SVM downscaling method is also compared to a well-known statistical downscaling model (SDSM). The downscaling results suggest that the LS-SVM is an efficient method for downscaling daily precipitation series in the study region. The statistical relationship obtained is used to project future precipitation from CGCM2 for IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios. The downscaling results, corresponding to both scenarios, show that there is an increase in the average annual precipitation downscaled from CGCM2 by about 277.51 mm for the IPCC SRES A2 scenario and by about 157.65 mm for the IPCC SRES B2 scenario, by the 2080s.

79953229544	A new seasonal design flood method based on bivariate joint distribution of flood magnitude and date of occurrence	Seasonal design floods which consider information on seasonal variation are very important for reservoir operation and management. The seasonal design flood method currently used in China is based on seasonal maximum (SM) samples and assumes that the seasonal design frequency is equal to the annual design frequency. Since the return period associated with annual maximum floods is taken as the standard in China, the current seasonal design flood cannot satisfy flood prevention standards. A new seasonal design flood method, which considers dates of flood occurrence and magnitudes of the peaks (runoff), was proposed and established based on copula function. The mixed von Mises distribution was selected as marginal distribution of flood occurrence dates. The Pearson Type III and exponential distributions were selected as the marginal distribution of flood magnitude for annual maximum flood series and peak-over-threshold samples, respectively. The proposed method was applied at the Geheyan Reservoir, China, and then compared with the currently used seasonal design flood methods. The case study results show that the proposed method can satisfy the flood prevention standard, and provide more information about the flood occurrence probabilities in each sub-season. The results of economic analysis show that the proposed design flood method can enhance the floodwater utilization rate and give economic benefits without lowering the annual flood protection standard. © 2010 IAHS Press.

79953653366	Real-time load distribution models for the Qingjiang cascade hydropower plants	Two real-time load distribution models for the Qingjiang cascade hydropower plants are proposed and discussed in this paper. Models I distributes initial load to each power plant according to the inter-plant and inner-plant balances of water and power. If the constraint conditions of avoiding inter-plant combined nonoperation area or the conditions of large-scale load transfer are satisfied, then the model gives unit startupshutdown strategy and inner-plant economical operation based on the objective function of minimum hydropower consumption for cascade hydropower plants. Model II divides the cascade plants into several dual subsystems by aggregation and decomposition methods, and each subsystem is aggregated as a virtual power plant to optimize its object function with a generating set as a basic unit. The simulation results show that model I can save water by 1.35% and 1.45% for the Geheyan and Gaobazhou hydropower plants, respectively, and that model II by 0.95% and 1.6%. The non-operation area crossing of the Geheyan units is reduced by 9.83% and 17.3%. Thus the economic benefit and operation security of hydropower plants are significantly enhanced by the two proposed models. © Copyright.

79960034084	Flood coincidence probability analysis for the upstream Yangtze River and its tributaries	Flood coincidence probability analysis among different regions is quite important for flood design and control. The current flood coincidence probability analysis is based on the simple statistical analysis of observed data with-out theoretic methods. In this study, the daily flow data of four hydrological stations in the upstream Yangtze River and its tributaries, including the Pingshan at the Jinsha River, Gaochang at the Min River, Beibei at the Jialing River and Yichang at the Yangtze River, are selected for case study. Multidimensional copula functions are introduced and used to construct the joint distributions of flood occurrence dates and magnitudes. Flood coincidence and conditional probabilities among the upstream Yangtze River and its tributaries thus are estimated. The calculated flood encounter values are compared to the empirical ones estimated by the observed data. The results show that the proposed method is rational and provides a new approach for flood encounter analysis.

80051698341	Deriving multiple near-optimal solutions to deterministic reservoir operation problems	Even deterministic reservoir operation problems with a single objective function may have multiple near-optimal solutions (MNOS) whose objective values are equal or sufficiently close to the optimum. MNOS is valuable for practical reservoir operation decisions because having a set of alternatives from which to choose allows reservoir operators to explore multiple options whereas the traditional algorithm that produces a single optimum does not offer them this flexibility. This paper presents three methods: the near-shortest paths (NSP) method, the genetic algorithm (GA) method, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, to explore the MNOS. These methods, all of which require a long computation time, find MNOS using different approaches. To reduce the computation time, a narrower subspace, namely a near-optimal space (NOSP, described by the maximum and minimum bounds of MNOS) is derived. By confining the MNOS search within the NOSP, the computation time of the three methods is reduced. The proposed methods are validated with a test function before they are examined with case studies of both a single reservoir (the Three Gorges Reservoir in China) and a multireservoir system (the Qing River Cascade Reservoirs in China). It is found that MNOS exists for the deterministic reservoir operation problems. When comparing the three methods, the NSP method is unsuitable for large-scale problems but provides a benchmark to which solutions of small- and medium-scale problems can be compared. The GA method can produce some MNOS but is not very efficient in terms of the computation time. Finally, the MCMC method performs best in terms of goodness-of-fit to the benchmark and computation time, since it yields a wide variety of MNOS based on all retained intermediate results as potential MNOS. Two case studies demonstrate that the MNOS identified in this study are useful for real-world reservoir operation, such as the identification of important operation time periods and tradeoffs among objectives in multipurpose reservoirs. © 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.

80052156134	Joint operation of the multi-reservoir system of the Three Gorges and the Qingjiang cascade reservoirs	Optimal utilization of available water resources has become more urgent due to the rapid growth of the economy and population. The joint operation of the Three Gorges cascade and Qingjiang cascade reservoirs in China was studied in this paper. Choosing maximization of hydropower generation and hydropower revenue as objective functions respectively, optimal models were established for individual and joint operation of the cascade reservoirs. The models were solved by the progressive optimality algorithm. The storage and electric compensation benefits among cascade reservoirs were analyzed. The daily inflow data of consecutive hydrological years of 1982-1987 were selected for a case study. Compared with the design operation rule, the joint operation of the multi-reservoir system can generate 5.992 billion kWh of extra power or an increase of 5.70% by the objective function of maximum hydropower generation. Through reservoir storage compensation, the spilled water of the Three Gorges and Qingjiang cascade reservoirs was decreased by 78.741 and 5.384 billion m

80053458634	Derivation of Aggregation-Based Joint Operating Rule Curves for Cascade Hydropower Reservoirs	Operating rule curves have been widely applied to reservoir operation, due to their ease of implementation. However, these curves are generally used for single reservoirs and have rarely been applied to cascade reservoirs. This study was conducted to derive joint operating rule curves for cascade hydropower reservoirs. Steps in the proposed methodology include: (1) determining the optimal release schedule using dynamic programming to solve a deterministic long-term operation model, (2) identifying the forms of operating rule curves suitable for cascade hydropower reservoirs based on the optimal release schedule, (3) constructing a simulation-based optimization model and then using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to identify the key points of the operating rule curves, (4) testing and verifying the efficiency of the generated joint operating rule curves using synthetic inflow series. China's Qing River cascade hydropower reservoirs (the Shuibuya, Geheyan and Gaobazhou reservoirs) were selected for a case study. When compared with the conventional operating rule curves, the annual power generation can be increased by 2.62% (from 7.27 to 7.46 billion kWh) using the observed inflow from 1951 to 2005, as well as by about 1.77% and 2.52% using the synthetic inflows generated from two alternative hydrologic simulation methods. Linear operating rules were also implemented to simulate coordinated operation of the Qing River cascade hydropower reservoirs. The joint operating rule curves were more efficient and reliable than conventional operating rule curves and linear operating rules, indicating that the proposed method can greatly improve hydropower generation and work stability. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Considering the power generation and navigation, a flood control operation chart model was developed based on the inflow forecasting information. The proposed model was solved with a differential evolution algorithm. By comparing the results of different forecasting schemes, the impact of forecasting errors on flood control operation was analyzed. It is shown that the optimal reservoir flood control operation chart based on the current forecasting scheme can generate 5.3% extra hydropower energy, save 6.9% flood water resources, increase the flood peak clipping ratio by 1.7%, and the capacity to withstand the risk of 1000-year design flood can be also greatly increased.

84855849876	Prediction of variability of precipitation in the Yangtze River Basin under the climate change conditions based on automated statistical downscaling	Many impact studies require climate change information at a finer resolution than that provided by general circulation models (GCMs). Therefore the outputs from GCMs have to be downscaled to obtain the finer resolution climate change scenarios. In this study, an automated statistical downscaling (ASD) regression-based approach is proposed for predicting the daily precipitation of 138 main meteorological stations in the Yangtze River basin for 2010-2099 by statistical downscaling of the outputs of general circulation model (HadCM3) under A2 and B2 scenarios. After that, the spatial-temporal changes of the amount and the extremes of predicted precipitation in the Yangtze River basin are investigated by Mann-Kendall trend test and spatial interpolation. The results showed that: (1) the amount and the change pattern of precipitation could be reasonably simulated by ASD; (2) the predicted annual precipitation will decrease in all sub-catchments during 2020s, while increase in all sub-catchments of the Yangtze River Basin during 2050s and during 2080s, respectively, under A2 scenario. However, they have mix-trend in each sub-catchment of Yangtze River basin during 2020s, but increase in all sub-catchments during 2050s and 2080s, except for Hanjiang River region during 2080s, as far as B2 scenario is concerned; and (3) the significant increasing trend of the precipitation intensity and maximum precipitation are mainly occurred in the northwest upper part and the middle part of the Yangtze River basin for the whole year and summer under both climate change scenarios and the middle of 2040-2060 can be regarded as the starting point for pattern change of precipitation maxima. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84859631733	Appraisal of Budyko formula in calculating long-term water balance in humid watersheds of southern China	The Budyko formula for estimating the long-term average annual evaporation is applied to calculate the long-term water balance in 29 humid watersheds of southern China. As a result of overestimation of evaporation, the long-term average annual runoff is underestimated, with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) at just - 17%. A one-variable linear regression model is employed to find that the Budyko scatter and the relative errors of Budyko runoff and evaporation estimates are all closely related to the long-term aridity index. Through combining the original Budyko formula with the different linear regression models for estimating the Budyko estimation errors, three forms of revised Budyko equation for estimating the long-term average annual runoff are derived, with all their NSE values to be around 66%. After calibration, both one-parameter Turc-Pike and one-parameter Fu equations lead to the NSE value of 60% in estimating long-term average annual runoff. Two conclusions are made, with the first one being that, the nonparametric Budyko formula, although very intuitive and very simple, does not apply well in calculating long-term water balance in 29 humid watersheds in southern China. The second one is that, the parametric evaporation formulae, with locally optimized parameter values, can achieve better accuracy in estimating long-term average annual evaporation and runoff than the nonparametric Budyko evaporation formula. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84861111112	Optimal flood control operation for the Three Gorges and Qingjiang cascade reservoirs	Both separate and joint flood control operation models for the Three Gorges and Qingjiang cascade reservoirs are proposed. The models were solved by the modified progressive optimality algorithm according to the procedure of optimization-verification-adjustment and its constraint conditions were treated by dynamic penalty function. Four typical years of 1954, 1981, 1982 and 1998 were selected to derive the design flood hydrographs for the corresponding return periods by the peak and volume amplitude method. The conventional, separate and joint cascade operation flood control models were performed for these reservoirs. The results show that the separate cascade operation gives full play to the role of flood control storage compensation between cascade reservoirs, while joint cascades operation can also perform storage compensation between two cascades. The Jingjiang River flood control standards can be raised to 118-year and 136-year design floods based on 1982 typical year, and 150-year and 168-year design floods based on the average of four typical years, respectively.

The study consists of the following steps: (1) the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for the period 1961-2000 are used to calibrate and validate the statistical downscaling techniques, i.e. SSVM (Smooth Support Vector Machine) and SDSM (Statistical Downscaling Model); (2) the A2 emission scenarios from CGCM3 and HadCM3 for the same period are used as input to the statistical downscaling models; and (3) the downscaled local scale climate scenarios are then used as the input to the Xin-anjiang and HBV hydrological models. The results show that: (1) for the same GCM, the simulated runoffs vary greatly when using rainfall provided by different statistical downscaling techniques as the input to the hydrological models; (2) although most widely used statistics in the literature for evaluation of statistical downscaling methods show SDSM has better performance than SSVM in downscaling rainfall except the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSC) and root mean square error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), the runoff simulation efficiency driven by SDSM rainfall is far lower than by SSVM; and (3) by comparing different statistics in rainfall and runoff simulation, it can be concluded that NSC and RSR between simulated and observed rainfall can be used as key statistics to evaluate the statistical downscaling models' performance when downscaled precipitation scenarios are used as input for hydrological models. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84863115723	Deriving reservoir refill operating rules by using the proposed DPNS model	The dynamic programming neural-network simplex (DPNS) model, which is aimed at making some improvements to the dynamic programming neural-network (DPN) model, is proposed and used to derive refill operating rules in reservoir planning and management. The DPNS model consists of three stages. First, the training data set (reservoir optimal sequences of releases) is searched by using the dynamic programming (DP) model to solve the deterministic refill operation problem. Second, with the training data set obtained, the artificial neural network (ANN) model representing the operating rules is trained through back-propagation (BP) algorithm. These two stages construct the standard DPN model. The third stage of DPNS is proposed to refine the operating rules through simulation-based optimization. By choosing maximum the hydropower generation as objective function, a nonlinear programming technique, Simplex method, is used to refine the final output of the DPN model. Both the DPNS and DPN models are used to derive operating rules for the real time refill operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) for the year of 2007. It is shown that the DPNS model can improve not only the probability of refill but also the mean hydropower generation when compare with that of the DPN model. It's recommended that the objective function of ANN approach for deriving refill operating rules should maximize the yield or minimize the loss, which can be computed from reservoir simulation during the refill period, rather than to fit the optimal data set as well as possible. And the derivation of optimal or near-optimal operating rules can be carried out effectively and efficiently using the proposed DPNS model. © Springer 2006.

84863278151	Analysis of trends of annual and seasonal precipitation from 1956 to 2000 in Guangdong Province, China	The trends of annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation in southern China (Guangdong Province) for the period 1956-2000 are investigated, based on the data from 186 high-quality gauging stations. Statistical tests, including Mann-Kendall rank test and wavelet analysis, are employed to determine whether the precipitation series exhibit any regular trend and periodicity. The results indicate that the annual precipitation has a slightly decreasing trend in central Guangdong and slight increasing trends in the eastern and western areas of the province. However, all the annual trends are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. The average precipitation increases in the dry season in central Guangdong, but decreases in the wet season, meaning that the precipitation becomes more evenly distributed within the year. Furthermore, the analysis of monthly precipitation suggests that the distribution of intra-annual precipitation changes over time. The results of wavelet analysis show prominent precipitation with periods ranging from 10 to 12 years in every sub-region in Guangdong Province. Comparing with the sunspot cycle (11-year), the annual precipitation in every sub-region in Guangdong province correlates with Sunspot Number with a 3-year lag. The findings in this paper will be useful for water resources management. © 2012 Copyright 2012 IAHS Press.

As a result, the rainfall runoff relationship and water budget analysis in Poyang Lake regions is an unsolved problem so far. In this study, the basin area analogue and water budget methods was used to modified runoff hydrograph at the Hukou, and multiple-input single-output system model was used to derive intervening basin runoff. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) distributed hydrological model based on different types of remote sensing data was used to simulate daily runoff in the ungauged Poyang Lake Intervening Basin (PLIB). The comparison of estimated and simulated daily runoff hydrographs shows that the VIC model is performed relatively well. It is proved that with the help of remote sensed data, important hydrological characteristics of the PLIB can be reproduced and predicted. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84867283039	Joint design and operation of flood limited water levels for Qingjiang cascade reservoirs	A joint design and operation model of flood limited water levels is proposed and discussed in this paper for efficient use of flood water resources by cascade reservoirs. This model satisfies the requirement that the designed operation has no impact on the flood control standards of the Qingjiang basin, nor impact on these reservoirs' role in the Yangtze River flood control system. By using the data of daily rainfall and runoff of the basin in the period of 1951~2009, the results show that if the flood limited water levels of the Shuibuya and Geheyan reservoirs are fixed at 387.5 m and 196.0 m, respectively, then they can generate more power of 0.021 billion kW · h or an 0.302% increase in the annual average output relative to the existing operation.

84867295963	Flood control risk analysis model of impounding water in advance for Three Gorges reservoir	For the Three Gorges reservoir, impounding water in advance without increase of its flood control risk is a feasible approach to efficiently utilize its floodwater resources and maximize its comprehensive benefits, such as flood control, power generation, navigation, drought relief and eco-environment protection. This paper puts forth a flood control risk analysis model using Bayesian method for design of the impoundment, in which a multi-input single-output system model is used to route the reservoir outflow until the flood control stage. Six impounding schemes were proposed and examined, and based on the daily flow data of 1951-2010, they were calculated and compared with the normal impounding scheme in terms of hydrological risk rate. The results show that impounding in advance produces no increase in the flood control risk of the middle Yangtze.

84869424807	MODIS-based analysis of wetland area responses to hydrological processes in the Dongting Lake	The Dongting Lake is the largest lake in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River and ranks the second largest freshwater lake in China. Seasonal fluctuation of water-level in the Dongting Lake forms stable wetland resources. A large area of shallow marshes and mudflats, which are exposed over water surface during the non-flood season in the winter, provide habitats for several migratory birds. In recent years, the effects of the hydrological processes on wetland ecological system have aroused worldwide attention. The complex nonlinear relationship between the Yangtze River and the Dongting Lake has led significant changes in hydrological processes in the Dongting Lake after the running of the Three Gorges Project. Data sets of surface area in the Dongting Lake were extracted using MODIS imagery from 2000 to 2010. During interpretation process, NDVI index and NIR band threshold were set to 1000, meaning that NDVI and NIR band values less than 1000 were water wetlands and values higher than 1000 were beach wetlands, including mudflat wetlands, grass wetlands and reed wetlands. Since the water-level of the Chenglingji was proportional to the surface area in the Dongting Lake, the observed water-level data sets were used to validate the rationality of the extracted surface area data sets. The results revealed that correlation coefficient of the extracted surface area and water-level was 0. 8058. Mann-Kendall (MK) nonparametric test showed that the Z

84871456716	Optimal flood control operation for the cascade reservoirs considering stochastic reservoir inflow hydrograph	There are mainly two difficulties in the process of solving the optimal flood control operation for the cascade reservoirs, which are the uncertainty of reservoir inflow forecasts and the complexity of solution for the optimization model. In order to solve these problems, a joint distribution function of upper and interval basin floods was established by using copula function, and inflow hydrographs of cascade reservoirs were obtained by stochastic simulation method. Furthermore, a flood control optimization model for cascade reservoirs and a new algorithm, named Paralleled DE and PSO (PDP), were proposed. The Qingjiang cascade reservoirs were selected as the case study. The results showed that the stochastic simulation method based on the copula function, by which the variety and randomness of regional flood composition are considered, can simulate the worst situation for flood control operation. The proposed PDP algorithm is much easier to gain the optimum global solution than the other algorithms presented in this paper. The flood control risk at the downstream can be further reduced by this optimal flood control operation model for the cascade reservoirs.

The spatial distribution of temporal trends of the selected indices was regionally mapped and investigated by using non-parametric test method. Future projections of EPI changes derived from the output of general circulation model (HadCM3) under the SRES A2 and B2 emission scenarios were downscaled and analyzed. The results show that: (a) there is not a general significant increasing or decreasing trend in EPI for the Yangtze River basin based on historical recorded data; (b) the automated statistical downscaling method-based precipitation captures some spatial distribution of the EPI and the bias correction can improve the simulation results; (c) a mixed pattern of positive and negative changes is observed in most of the nine indices under both scenarios in the first half of twenty-first century, and they increase continuously in the second half of twenty-first century; and (d) the concurrent increase in the heavy rain and drought indices indicates the possibility of the sudden change from drought to water logging in the lower region of Yangtze River basin. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

This model was tested in a case study of the Qingjiang cascade reservoirs by comparing the dynamic joint optimization with the design operation, using flood data series of three-hours for typical wet, normal and dry years. Results show that the proposed model generated an extra power output of 179 million kW·h or a 4.51% increase and a 2.73% increase in flood water use, relative to the design operation scheme.

Directional statistics (DS) and relative frequency (RF) are two of the popular methods for identifying flood seasonality. A new method, which is an improvement over DS, the IDS method, is proposed to identify flood seasonality and partition the flood season into sub-seasons. The performance of the IDS method was evaluated using synthetic data as well as observed data. The RF, DS and IDS methods were applied to the Geheyan and Baishan reservoir basins in China, and their results were compared and analysed. The results of flood seasonality identified by the IDS method were more objective than those of the RF and DS methods. © 2013 Copyright 2013 IAHS Press.

The dynamic control of reservoir flood limiting water level (FLWL) is a valuable and effective method to compromise the flood control and conservation for reservoir operation during the flood season. This paper focuses on joint operation and dynamic control of FLWL for cascade reservoirs.

The design flood hydrograph of the Three Gorges reservoir was selected as a case study.

However, these curves excluding ecological requirement are generally derived from observed or synthetic flows and have rarely been determined by future flows under climate change. This paper develops an integrated adaptive optimization model (IAOM) for derivation of multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves including ecological operating rule curve under future climate change. Steps in the proposed IAOM include: (1) weather generator module to generate feasible future climate conditions, (2) VIC model as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflows from those future weather conditions, and (3) multipurpose reservoir optimization module to determine the optimal reservoir operations to deal with climate change. China's Danjiangkou reservoir in Han River basin is selected for a case study. The results demonstrate that the IAOM provides optimal multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves that reflect the hydrologic characteristics of future climate change. Ecological supply water operation will alleviate negative effect of dam on river ecosystem without reducing conservation benefits and flood control standard. Therefore, they can consult with reservoir administrators if it is useful results for operations. © 2013 The Authors.

The copula function was built to describe the temporal and spatial dependence between the key gauging station and others. At last, the daily flows of other sites were obtained using the copulas.

84881357049	Bivariate flood frequency analysis with historical information based on copula	Flood events consist of flood peaks and flood volumes that are mutually correlated and need to be described by multivariate analysis methods, of which the copula functions are most desirable. Until now, the multivariate flood frequency analysis methods based on copulas does not consider the historical floods or paleological information. This may underestimate or overestimate the flood quantiles or conditional probabilities corresponding to high return periods, especially when the length of gauged record data series is relatively short. In this paper, a modified inference functions for margins (MIFM) method is proposed and used to estimate the parameters of both marginal distribution and joint distribution with incorporation of historical information. The conditional probabilities of flood volumes given that the peak discharge exceeding various values were derived. The Three Gorges reservoir (TGR) in China was selected as a case study. The bivariate flood quantiles were obtained based on bivariate return period and compared with current univariate design values. It is shown that the proposed method provides an alternative way for multivariate frequency analysis with historical information. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The drought impact can be quantified using drought index time series. This study uses the monthly standardized precipitation index (SPI) time series as a drought index. Drought characteristics, namely, drought duration, severity, interval time and minimum SPI values, were determined. Five hundred years of daily rainfall data were simulated for evaluating drought characteristics. Appropriate distributions were selected for modeling drought duration, interval time, drought severity, and minimum SPI value in different drought states. The drought episodes were quantified using multivariate copula methods. Several copulas from the Archimedean and metaelliptical families were applied to construct four-dimensional joint distributions.

84891006068	Estimation of reservoir flood control operation risks with considering inflow forecasting errors	A method for quantifying inflow forecasting errors and their impact on reservoir flood control operations is proposed. This approach requires the identification of the probability distributions and uncertainty transfer scheme for the inflow forecasting errors. Accordingly, the probability distributions of the errors are inferred through deducing the relationship between its standard deviation and the forecasting accuracy quantified by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient. The traditional deterministic flood routing process is treated as a diffusion stochastic process. The diffusion coefficient is related to the forecasting accuracy, through which the forecasting errors are indirectly related to the sources of reservoir operation risks. The associated risks are derived by solving the stochastic differential equation of reservoir flood routing via the forward Euler method. The Geheyan reservoir in China is selected as a case study. The hydrological forecasting model for this basin is established and verified. The flood control operation risks in the forecast-based pre-release operation mode for different forecasting accuracies are estimated by the proposed approach. Application results show that the proposed method can provide a useful tool for reservoir operation risk estimation and management. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84892632875	Safety design for reservoir flood control based on Copula function	The current method of flood control and safety design for reservoir is based on univariate distribution and it is unable to consider the dependence structure between different flood characteristics. This paper presents a new method to improve the existing one. First, a Copula-based bivariate joint distribution of flood peak and volume is constructed and bivariate return period is used to generate various combinations of the peak and volume. Then, the design flood hydrographs, which are fully characterized by the peak and volume, are routed to determine a series of highest stages in the reservoir caused by its inflow flood, and the variation range of all these stages can be obtained. In a case study of the Geheyan reservoir on the Qing River, upper and lower bounds of the highest stages under the bivariate return period were determined and compared with those by a univariate method using the same frequency. The results show that the calculations of highest stages by univariate design fall within the two bounds, but slightly less than those by bivariate design. For design of reservoir flood control, this study suggests that the bivariate distribution gives more safe results. Copyright.

84899089108	Design flood estimation based on bivariate joint distribution of flood peak and volume	Flood event consists of flood peak and flood volume that are mutually correlated and need to be described by multivariate joint distribution. In the multivariate case, the choice for design flood for an appropriate return period leads to the infinite combinations of flood peak and flood volume that satisfy the flood prevention standard. However, not all the combinations are reasonable in hydrology so that a boundary for selection of flood peak and volume is needed. In this paper, the bivariate joint distribution of flood peak and volume is constructed by copula function. A methodology is proposed to identify the boundary for selecting bivariate combinations of flood peak and volume. Two statistically-based combinations of flood peak and volume, i. e. bivariate equivalent frequency combination and bivariate conditional expectation combination are derived with a given return period. The application results of Geheyan reservoir located at the Qingjiang River show that the highest water levels of bivariate flood combinations are slightly larger than that of univariate design flood. As a result, the bivariate equivalent frequency combination is suggested as the design flood for the safety of reservoirs. The proposed boundary identification and combination selection methods expand the application range of multivariate flood frequency analysis technique in hydrological engineering.

A risk analysis model for flood control operation of seasonal FLWL incorporating the inflow forecasting error was proposed and developed. The variable kernel estimation is implemented for deriving the inflow forecasting error density. The synthetic inflow incorporating forecasting error is simulated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) according to the inflow forecasting error density. The risk analysis for seasonal FLWL control was estimated by MCS based on a combination of the forecasting inflow lead-time, seasonal design flood hydrographs and seasonal operation rules. The Three Gorges reservoir is selected as a case study.

84903542777	Optimal allocation of water quantity and waste load in the Northwest Pearl River Delta, China	The Northwest Pearl River Delta is one of the most developed areas in China and has faced serious water problems because of its fast economic growth, urbanisation and other developments. It is widely believed that an integrated management of the socio-economic factors cross individual administrative cities is an effective way to solve the water problems. To serve this purpose, this paper aims to develop an integrated model for the optimal allocation of water quantity and waste load. In order to consider the interaction between water quantity and waste load allocation, the Saint-Venant equations were used to simulate dynamic water flow for the water quantity allocation, whereas the one dimensional advection-dispersion mass transport equation was used to simulate water quality for the waste load allocation. In addition to the maximisation of the economic benefits, which is often considered as an objective of optimal water resource allocation models, the minimisation of water shortages and maximisation of waste load were also introduced as objectives of the model. To solve the multi-objective allocation model, a second generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm was employed because of its computational efficiency and running time. The results indicate that it is a serious task to reduce the COD in the Northwest Pearl River Delta since the maximum waste load allocations under water quality targets is less than the present amount of waste discharged into rivers in the study area. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The complete formula of NIUH for river flood routing which includes initial channel storage recession flow was deduced by the Laplace transform and mathematical induction. The physical meaning of each item of the complete formula was analyzed and discussed. It is demonstrated that outflow is composed of two portions: One is the recession of the initial channel storage, the other is the inflow routed through the channel. A real-time updating approach of the river flood routing was proposed based on the complete formula. The practicability and rationality of the formula were verified through the case study. The complete formula can be considered to be a more general case of the Nash river flood routing model. It is a development of the existed NIUH theory and can adequately improve the accuracy of the river flood routing.

In this study, Copula function was used to establish the joint distribution of flood volumes between dam-site section and interval basin. A modified discrete summation method was proposed based on the conditional distribution derived by Copula function. The proposed method, which discretizes the conditional distribution curve directly, can overcome the shortcomings of traditional discrete summation method and do not need independence transformation. The design flood for downstream area of the Qingjiang cascade reservoirs was estimated by area composition method, discrete summation method and Copula-based modified discrete summation method. The Comparison results show that there are little differences of design flood values estimated by these methods. The flood quantile estimated by the proposed method is a little larger than those of other methods since it has considered the inner correlation of floods in different regions, which is much safer and reasonable. Besides, the 1000-year design peak discharge of the Gaobazhou dam-site has been cut over 40% due to the regulation of upstream cascade reservoirs.

This study proposes a new method based on the copula-entropy (CE) theory to identify the inputs of an ANN model. The CE theory permits to calculate mutual information (MI) and partial mutual information (PMI), which characterizes the dependence between potential model input and output variables directly instead of calculating the marginal and joint probability distributions. Two tests were carried out for verifying the accuracy and performance of the CE method. The CE theory-based input determination methodology was applied to identify suitable inputs for a flood forecasting model for a real-world case study involving the three gorges reservoir (TGR) in China.

Artificial neural network (ANN), as a data-driven technique, has gained significant attention in recent years and has been shown to be an efficient alternative to traditional methods for hydrological modeling. However, for different input combinations, ANN models can yield different results. Therefore, input variables and ANN types need to be carefully considered, when using an ANN model for stream flow forecasting. This study proposes the copula-entropy (CE) theory to identify the inputs of an ANN model.

This method was proposed based on a consideration of hydrological alterations induced by natural variability and human activity. It was during this process that two hydrological indices, the ratio flow deviation (RFD) and the amended annual proportional flow deviation (AAPFD), played vital roles in change point detection and the determination of EAWLR, respectively. The WLFs are closely related to species richness. The relationship between them follows a hump-backed curve and EAWLR serves as the hump part of the curve. The final results indicated that EAWLRs of Beijinggang, Nanzui and Chenglingji during flood season were 27.78-38.26 m, 25.19-38.45 m and 24.48-30.96 m, respectively, while those during non-flood season were 18.33-27.79m, 17.68-29.19 m and 15.59-22.07 m, respectively. The response to the great flood in 1998 and the drought in 2006 of Dongting Lake region verified the rationality of the results. Within the EAWLR, ecosystems can operate normally and have stable community structures to resist external interference.
