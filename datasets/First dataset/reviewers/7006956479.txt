84927510067	Fabrication of titanium dioxide nanotube array as a photocathode for hydrogen evolution	In this study, we present an effective method to fabricate TiO<inf>2</inf>-based photocathode for hydrogen production. The Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf> composites were synthesized by using TiO<inf>2</inf> nanotube arrays (TNTAs) as a support. The TNTAs were electrochemically fabricated using 20 × 18mm<sup>2</sup> titaniumfoilsastheanode. Ptions were loaded onto the TNTAs to form Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf> nanocomposites for the enhancement of photoelectron-chemical performance of water splitting. The highly oriented and ordered TNTAs at about 100 run in diameter and 17 μm in length was obtained after 8 h of anodization. The TEM images showed that Pt nanoparticles were well-dispersed on the surface of TNTAs with diameters of 1.5-5 run. In addition, TiO<inf>2</inf> and Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf> nanotube arrays were used for photoelectrochemical water splitting in 0.5 M Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte under UV light irradiation at 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. The photocurrent density at a overpotential of -0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl (-0.1 Vvs. RHE) by Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf> composite was higher than the pure TiO<inf>2</inf> nanotube arrays electrode. In addition, the overpotential of TNTAs in the presence of UV light was 0.1 V lower but and the hydrogen production was 1.3 times higher than that in dark. The hydrogen generation by TNTAs and Pt/TNTAs at -0.85V vs. Ag/AgCl under UV light irradiation was 1.9 and 15.5 times higher than that in dark.

1542513301	Characterization and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminations in surface sediment and water from Gao-ping River, Taiwan	The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water and sediment samples collected from 12 locations in Gao-ping River, Taiwan were analyzed. Molecular ratios and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to characterize the possible pollution sources. Concentrations of total 16 PAHs (ΣPAHs) in water samples ranged from below method detection limits (<MDLs) to 9.4μg/L with the mean value of 0.43±0.75μg/L (n=48), which were predominated by two- and three-ring PAHs. The ΣPAH concentrations in sediments ranged from 8 to 356ng/g-dry weight with the mean value of 80.6±31.8ng/g (n=48). Three- and four-ring PAHs including phenanthrene, anthracene and pyrene were the dominant species in sediment samples. High contents of PAHs were found in the estuary of the river and in the vicinity of industrial areas. Ratios of specific PAH compounds including phenanthrene/anthracene (Phe/Ant), fluoranthene/pyrene (FL/Pyr), chrysene/benzo[a] anthracene (Chr/BaA), low-molecular-weight PAH/high-molecular-weight PAH (LPAH/HPAH) were calculated to evaluate the possible sources of PAH contamination. These ratios reflect a mixed pattern of pyrolytic and petrogenic inputs of PAHs in Gao-ping River. The petrogenic PAHs may be mainly from the leakage of crude oil and the refined products from urban vehicle traffic, while the pyrolytic PAH input is located in the proximity near the mouth of estuary of the River. The PCA analysis confirmed that petrochemical industrial parks located in the vicinity of estuary of Gao-ping River might be the possible source for the PAH input. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

20544474014	Dechlorination of tetrachloroethylene by palladized iron in the presence of humic acid	The dechlorination of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) by palladized irons in the presence of humic acid was investigated to understand the feasibility of using Pd/Fe for the in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater. Untreated zerovalent iron (ZVI) was amended with Pd(II) ions to form palladized irons. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that Pd(II) was completely reduced to metallic Pd on the surface of ZVI. PCE was catalytically dechlorinated via β-elimination to ethane and ethylene by palladized irons. The carbon mass balances were in the range of 78-98%.

Benzene, chlorobenzene and styrene (BCS) were selected as the target compounds due to their suspected carcinogenic and mutagenic properties. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100 were used to represent the anionic and nonionic surfactants, respectively. The addition of Triton X-100 had little effect on the micellar solubilization of BCS. However, the solubilization of aromatic compounds increased significantly with the increase of SDS concentration. A 20% to 43% enhancement of the solubilization in SDS-amended systems was demonstrated. The adsorption isotherms of BCS with Triton X-100 can conveniently be fitted by Langmuirian expression. However, multilayer adsorption of chlorobenzene and styrene was observed in SDS-amended systems. The values of maximum adsorption capacity ranged from 323 to 736 μg/g. Also, the effect of Triton X-100 on maximum adsorption capacity was greater than that of SDS. Moreover, a correlation between the maximum sorption capacity and partition coefficient was established. The results of this study demonstrate that surfactants can be effectively used as chemical amendments to minimize the volatilities of monocyclic aromatic compounds and enhance sorption and solubilization in soil environments contaminated by proper selection of surfactant type and concentration.

0030013229	Anaerobic degradation of 1,1,1-trichloroethane with the amendment of different substrate and microbial concentrations	An investigation involving the supplement of different concentrations of a substrate and microorganisms was carried on under anaerobic condition to assess the concentration effects of the substrate and microorganisms on the in-situ bioremediation of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA). Experimental results demonstrated that the addition of higher concentrations of the substrate and microorganisms would enhance the biotransformation of TCA. The biotransformation rate of TCA increased progressively with the increase of the concentrations of the substrate and microorganisms.

0030031429	Effect of substrate concentration on the biotransformation of carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane under anaerobic condition	The biotransformabilities of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) and carbon tetrachloride (CT) were investigated at 35°C under low concentration of acetic acid as the auxiliary substrate to evaluate the concentration effect of the auxiliary substrate on the biotransformation of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Data shown in this study demonstrated that concentration of acetic acid could change the dechlorination capability of the microorganisms and, thus, influence the biotransformation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The rate of the biotransformation of CT and TCA in the concentration range of 100-1000 μg/l increased progressively with the increase of the substrate concentration ranged from 0 to 30 mg/l. Nearly complete biotransformation of CT was obtained in 32 days. TCA was degraded slower than CT and removal of 20-91% was observed in 85 days, depending on the concentrations of both the primary substrate and the chlorinated compound. These removal efficiencies corresponded to second-order rate coefficients of 0.0006-0.0041 l/mg-VSS/d and 2.75 x 10

0030066523	Anaerobic biotransformation of polychlorinated methane and ethene under various redox conditions	Two sets of batch-type experiments with different concentrations of acetate as the auxiliary substrate was performed under various redox conditions to evaluate the effects of the redox potential of the environment and substrate concentration on the biotransformation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE). Experimental results indicated that the redox potential of the environment is a more influential environmental factor than the substrate concentration in affecting the biotransformability of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Disappearances of 20 to 62% and 22 to 99.9% of the original concentrations of PCE and CT, respectively, were observed with the redox potentials of the microcosms ranging from 188 to -263 mV. The threshold values of -60 and 70 mV were also identified for the obvious biotransformation (> 30%) of PCE and CT, respectively. Substrate concentration effect was emphasized only when the redox potential of the microcosms was below the threshold value. The strong-electron-acceptor-inhibition hypothesis based on the thermodynamic rules provides an explanation for the difference of the biotransformability between PCE and CT under different redox potential conditions. A lower redox potential provided a relatively higher electron activity, thereby facilitating dechlorination reaction more readily. A higher substrate concentration produced more biomass than a lower substrate concentration. Results in this study have provided further insight into the foundation of in-situ bioremediation practices. Furthermore, more accurately controlling the redox potential of the environment would yield a higher remediation efficiency for the groundwater contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons.

The addition of electron donor and microorganisms was found to significantly enhance the biotransformation efficiency of TCA Addition of electron donor resulted in increasing the cell numbers of anaerobic consortia, thereby increasing the rate of dechlorination. Glucose was found to be a better electron donor, as compared to acetate and humic acid, both in experimental results as well as thermodynamic calculations under reducing environments. Microbial concentration has been observed to be a dominant factor than electron donor in facilitating biodegradation of TCA. The pseudo-first-order rate constants of TCA ranged from 0.0023 per day to 0.0077 per day, depending on the nature of electron donor and biomass supplemented. Furthermore, addition of electron donor in low biomass input system resulted in enhanced efficiency as compared to that of high biomass input system.

0031841975	Surfactant enhanced remediation of cadmium contaminated soils	An investigation involving the addition of surfactant to remediate cadmium-contaminated soils was performed to determine the optimal surfactant enhanced remediation system. Anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS), nonionic (Triton X-100, TX100) and cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) surfactants were used to elucidate the extraction efficiency of surfactant. EDTA and diphenylthiocarbazone (DPC) were also added to enhance the extraction efficiencies of surfactants. Moreover, the pH effect was examined to determine the optimal surfactant systems. The addition of anionic and nonionic surfactants can enhance the desorption rates of cadmium, lead and zinc, whereas the addition of cationic surfactant decreased the desorption efficiency of heavy metals. The desorption efficiency was found to increase linearly with the increasing surfactant concentration below critical micelle concentration (CMC) and remained relatively constant above the CMC. Moreover, the addition of EDTA can significantly enhance the desorption efficiency of heavy metals. Cationic surfactant was shown to be a more effective surfactant than nonionic and anionic surfactants in extracting heavy metals under acidic environment. The desorption efficiency of heavy metal in the surfactant/EDTA mixture system was in the order of Cd > Pb > Zn. However, the addition of DPC lowered the heavy metal removals by 2 to 4 times. Also, increasing pH value can decrease the extraction capabilities of nonionic and anionic surfactants. The results of this study demonstrate that surfactant in combination with complexing agents can be effectively used as chemical amendments to flush cadmium-contaminated soil by proper selection of type and concentration of surfactant and complexing agent at different pH values.

0031986050	Modeling transport and fate of chlorinated hydrocarbons governed by biotic transformation in porous media	A macroscopic partitioning model governed by microbial transformation was developed to elucidate the transport and fate of chlorinated hydrocarbons and microorganisms in porous media. Carbon tetrachloride (CT) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) were selected as the target compounds. A laboratory column experiment was also conducted to validate the accuracy of the model. Results obtained from the TOC concentration and microbial activities in effluent and pore water demonstrate that the steady state of the microbial growth was reached after an incubation period of 40 days. Microorganisms tended to accumulate in the first 20 cm of the column and consumed auxiliary substrate rapidly to sustain the dechlorinating capabilities. Significant degradation of CT with the concomitant increase of chloroform, the daughter product of CT via dechlorination, was also demonstrated after 57 days. TCA is more recalcitrant than CT. Removal of 42% of the original TCA input was demonstrated in 121 days. No 1,1-dichloroethane was detected. Model simulation results indicate that the predicted concentrations are all in the range close to the experimental data. A good correlation between the simulated and measured values demonstrates that the partitioning model can describe the transport and fate of chlorinated hydrocarbons and microorganisms in the contaminated groundwaters. The distribution coefficient between free-living and attached bacteria plays a prominent role in controlling the distribution pattern of microorganisms and the fate of chlorinated hydrocarbons. In addition, the interaction between the supplemental substrate and the active microorganisms significantly influences the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The valid and accurate transport model provides the basis for the accurate prediction of the transport and fate of chlorinated hydrocarbons as well as the proper selection of a remedial approach to eliminate contaminants in soil environments.

25144471344	Sol-gel-derived array DNA biosensor for the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water and biological samples	The sol-gel-derived array DNA biosensors coupled with a fluorescence detection system and a robotic pin-printing platform were fabricated to detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water and serum samples. Parameters including sol percentage, doped-amount of glycerol, dye probes, the surface coating, and DNA concentration were optimized. In addition, two fluorescent dyes, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and ethidium bromide (EDB) were selected and compared. Results showed that EDB was more sensitive to compete intercalators (PAHs) than FITC, and was selected as fluorescent dye for array-based DNA biosensors. The optimized procedure with dsDNA concentration of 23.5 μg/ml allowed the fabrication of the DNA biosensor up to 50 spots within 10 min via the developed pin-printing system. For PAH detection, the developed array DNA biosensor effectively detected naphthalene and phenanthrene in the concentration range of 0-10 mg/l in aqueous solution, but was not sensitive to fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene. In the serum samples, the apparent water solubility of high-molecular-weight PAHs was greatly enhanced by the dissolved organic compounds in serum, and an obvious DNA toxicity was exhibited in the presence of three- to five-ring PAHs. Benzo[a]pyrene showed high toxic effect at low concentration in serum samples, clearly showing that the sol-gel-derived array DNA biosensor with EDB as sensing probe can effectively detect PAHs in water and biological samples. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

34047264665	Synergistic effect of silicon and nickel ion on the dechlorination of tetrachlorothylene	Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and heavy metals are the most often found toxic chemicals in contaminated aquifers. Zero-valent silicon (ZVS) is a promising reductant to effectively reduce PCE. In addition, the reduction of metal ions by ZVS to their zero-valent forms could accelerate the dechlorination efficiency and rate of PCE. The objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of ZVS and metal ions on the dechlorination of PCE. Addition of Ni(II) was found to have better dechlorination efficiency and rate of PCE than the other metal ions (Cu, Fe, Co). XPS results showed that Ni(II) can sorb onto the surface of ZVS, resulting in the formation of Ni(0). Ethane was the major degradation product in Ni-amended solution, depicting that elimination is the major pathway for PCE dechlorination. In addition, the dechlorination rate and mechanism for PCE dechlorination under various pH and ZVS/Ni(II) ratios were determined.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and surface area analyzer were used to identify the surface species, topography and pore distribution of the organically doped sol-gel network. XPS results showed that stoichiometric ratios of oxygen-to-silicon in sol-gel materials were in the range 2.08-2.11. The sol-gel materials were partially dried and negatively charged, which retained 6-8% water content to maintain urease activity. The surface morphology of the sol-gel altered obviously when macromolecules were encapsulated, resulting in the increase in surface mean roughness from 0.207 to 2.636 nm. The specific surface area decreased dramatically after the immobilization of biomolecules and organic additives, which clearly depicts that PVA and urease were co-encapsulated into the sol-gel network.

Of the 18 organochlorine pesticides investigated, α-HCH, α-HCH, lindane, δ-HCH, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, endrin, α-endosulfan, p,p′-DDE, and p,p′-DDT were detected at concentrations ranging from 0.26 to 10.2 ng/g wet weight. Contamination with organochlorine pesticides followed the order heptachlor > dieldrin > α-endosulfan > HCH isomers > heptachlor epoxide > DDT. Frequencies of detection of organochlorine pesticide residues ranged from 2.0 to 52.3%. α-Endosulfan was the most frequently detected organochlorine pesticide in the foods analyzed, followed by heptachlor epoxide (47.6%) and α-HCH (38.9%). Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of organochlorine pesticides from foods were 1.137 μg for total HCH, 2.147 μg for heptachlor, 0.702 μg for heptachlor epoxide, 0.624 μg for endosulfan, 0.098 μg for cyclodiene, and 0.541 μg for total DDT. These EDIs were only 0.075% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for lindane, 47.5% of ADI for heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide, 0.045% of ADI for total DDT, and 1.01% of ADI for aldrin and dieldrin. Therefore, consumption of the foods analyzed does not pose a risk to consumer health.

Nine fluorescent indicators, acridine, acridine orange, neutral red, DAPI, rhodamine B, fluorescein, umbelliferone, FITC on celite and FITC-dextran, have been examined to optimize the fiber-optic system. Results showed that acridine and FITCs were sensitive to the change of pH value caused by the enzyme-substrate catalysis reaction. However, the sensitivity of acridine was 260 times lower than that of FITCs. Higher toxicity of acridine to acetylcholinesterase than FITC was also observed. Moreover, the high-molecular-weight FITC-dextran showed low leakage rate when immobilizing using sol-gel technology, showing that the FITC-dextran was a suitable pH sensitive fluorescent indicator for the OPPs biosensor.

0034238081	Determination of distribution coefficients of priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarborns using solid-phase microextraction	The determination of distribution coefficients is important for prediction of the chemical pathways of organic compounds in the environment. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a convenient and effective method to measure the distribution of chemicals in a two-phase system. In the present study, the SPME distribution coefficient (K(spme)) of 16 priority aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was determined with 100-μm poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and 85-μm polyacrylate (PA) fibers. The partition coefficients and LeBas molar volumes were used to describe the linearity of the log K(spme) values of PAHs. Also, the validation of the distribution coefficient was examined using different sample volumes. The extraction time was dependent on the types of PAHs, and 20 min to 60 h was needed to reach equilibrium. The determined log K(spme) values ranged from 3.02 to 5.69 and from 3.37 to 5.62 for 100-μm PDMS and 85-μm PA fibers, respectively. Higher K(spme) values of low-ring PAHs were observed using 85-μm PA fiber. Good linear relationships between log K(ow) and log K(spme) for PAHs from naphthalene to benzo-[a]pyrene and from naphthalene to chrysene for 100-μm PDMS and 85-μm PA fibers, respectively, were obtained. The correlation coefficients were 0.969 and 0.967, respectively. The linear relationship between log K(spme) and the LeBas molar volume was only up to benz[a]anthracene for 85-μm PA fiber and up to chrysene for 100-μm PDMS fiber. Moreover, the effect of sample volume can be predicted using the partition coefficient theory and excellent agreement was obtained between the experimental and theoretical absorbed amounts of low-ring PAHs. This reset shows that the determined log K(spme) is more accurate than the previous method for estimating analytes with log K(ow) < 6 as well as for predicting the partitioning behaviors between SPME fiber and water.

33644869123	Concentration and fate of persistent organochlorine pesticides in estuarine sediments using headspace solid-phase microextraction	The concentration and fate of persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in estuarine surface sediments in Erh-jen and Lan-yang rivers, Taiwan were investigated using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HSSPME) method to evaluate the possible pollution potential and guideline for OCP concentrations in Taiwan. The HSSPME method exhibits a good analytical performance with low detection limits for OCP determination in sediment. In addition, results obtained using the developed HSSPME method were in good agreement with those obtained using Soxhlet extraction in a certified sample. The developed analytical method was further applied to the determination of concentrations of OCP residues in surface sediments from the estuaries of the selected rivers in Taiwan. A total of 20 surface sediments from each river was collected from 10 sampling stations. The total OCP concentrations in sediments from Erh-jen River ranged from 0.17 to 5.04 ng/g-dw with the mean values of 0.25-1.24 ng/g-dw for HCHs, 0.10-0.89 ng/g-dw for cyclodienes and 0.16-0.64 ng/g-dw for DDTs. The concentrations of OCPs in sediments from Lan-yang River were in the range 0.37-0.9 ng/g-dw with an average of lower than 0.5 ng/g-dw. HCHs and DDTs were abundant in the estuarine sediments from the selected rivers. Results obtained in this study show that the origin of OCPs in the surface sediments from Erh-jen River is a combination of erosion of the weathered soils and long-range atmospheric transport, while the OCP concentrations found in Lan-yang River could be regarded as the background levels of OCPs in Taiwan. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Five kinds of SPME fibers were used and compared in this study. The extracted sample was analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection or mass spectrometry. Parameters affecting the sorption of analyte into the fibers, including sampling time, thickness of the fiber coating, and the effect of temperature, have been examined. Moreover, the feasibility of headspace SPME with different working temperatures was evaluated. The method was also applied to real samples. The 85-μm polyacrylate (PA) and 100-μm poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) fibers were shown to have the highest affinities for the selected PAHs. The PA fiber was more suitable than the PDMS fiber for the determination of low-ring PAHs while high sensitivity of high-ring PAHs was observed when a 100-μm PDMS fiber was used. The method showed good linearity between 0.1 and 100 ng/ml with regression coefficients ranging from 0.94 to 0.999. The reproducibility of the measurements between fibers was found to be very good. The precisions of PA and PDMS fibers were from 3 to 24% and from 3 to 14%, respectively. Headspace SPME is a valid alternative for the determination of two- to five-ring PAHs.

In this study, a modified dual-templating strategy for architectural design of 3D HOPC as a promising electrode material for high-rate EC applications was developed by using polystyrene and Pluronic F127 as macro- and meso-porous templates, respectively. Tetraethyl orthosilicate was also added as the silica precursor, and then the sol-gel-derived SiO<inf>2</inf> was removed by sodium hydroxide to form the second mesopore in HOPC (HOPC-s) for enhancing the accessible surface areas and pore structures. The HOPC-s formed by the templating strategy is composed of highly ordered macropores, macroporous windows, bimodal mesopores, and micropores, resulting in high specific surface area (1112 m<sup>2</sup> g <sup>-1</sup>), high total pore volume (1.18 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and an easily accessible environment for fast electrolyte ion transport. The specific capacitance of the HOPC-s electrodes can reach 316 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 25 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and maintain excellent capacitive retention at a high scan rate of 1000 mV s<sup>-1</sup> when compared with that of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC-s). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fitting shows that the pore electrolyte resistance of HOPC-s is 3 times lower than that of OMC-s, which is attributed to the hierarchical macroporous structures and short mesoporous channels. In the symmetric capacitor test, the HOPC-s also shows excellent power capability, and the energy density of 4-10 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> can be maintained over the power density range of 1-14 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, the capacitance of HOPC-s in the polycarbonate-containing ionic liquid shows 80% retention at a scan rate of 500 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, indicating that the unique hierarchical structure can provide efficient ion-buffering capacity for high-rate performance. These exceptional electrochemical performances clearly demonstrate that 3D HOPC-s is a superior material to solve the poor ion transport limitation, which can open an avenue to fabricate high-rate ECs with high power and energy densities for energy storage. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

46549086056	Characterization and composition of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in water and estuarine sediments from Gao-ping River, Taiwan	The objective of this study was to determine the concentrations and possible sources of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in water and estuarine sediments from Gao-ping River in order to evaluate the environmental quality of aquatic system in southern Taiwan. High concentrations of heavy metals including Cr, Zn, Ni, Cu and As, ranging from 10.7 to 180 mg/kg-dry weight (dw), were detected in sediments from Gao-ping River. When normalized to the principal component analysis (PCA), swinery and electroplating wastewaters were found to be the most important pollution sources for heavy metals. Of various organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues detected, aldrin and total-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were frequently found in sediments. The total concentrations of OCPs were in the range 0.47-47.4 ng/g-dw. Also, the total-HCH, total-cyclodiene, and total-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were in the range 0.37-36.3, 0.21-19.0, and 0.44-1.88 ng/g-dw, respectively. The polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in sediments from Gao-ping River ranged between 0.37 and 5.89 ng/g-dw. The PCB concentrations are positively correlated to the organic contents of the sediment particles. α-HCH was found to be the dominant compound of HCH in the sediments, showing that long-range transport may be the possible source for the contamination of HCH in sediments from Gao-ping River. In summary, trace amounts of POPs in estuarine sediments from Gao-ping River were detected, showing that there still exist a wide variety of POP residues in the river sediments in Taiwan. These POP residues may be mainly from long-range transport and weathered agricultural soils, while heavy metal contamination is primarily from the swinery and industrial wastewaters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

46849114079	Dechlorination of tetrachloroethylene in aqueous solutions using metal-modified zerovalent silicon	The combination of zerovalent metal with a catalytic second metal ion (bimetallic materials) to enhance the dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinated compounds has received much attention. Bimetallic materials not only enhance the dechlorination process but also alter the reduction pathway and product distribution. In this study, the efficiency and rate of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) dechlorination by metal-modified zerovalent silicon was investigated as a potential reductant for chlorinated hydrocarbons under anoxic conditions. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) results showed that metal ions including Ni(II), Cu(II), and Fe(II) could be reduced to their zerovalent forms on the Si surface. The dechlorination of PCE obeyed the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the pseudo-first-order rate constants (k

4644227230	Simultaneous determination of renal clinical analytes in serum using hydrolase- and oxidase-encapsulated optical array biosensors	An optical array biosensor encapsulated with hydrolase and oxidoreductase using sol-gel immobilization technique has been fabricated for simultaneous analysis and screening of multiple samples to determine the presence of multianalytes which are clinically important in relation to renal failure. Urease and creatinine deiminase were used to detect urea and creatinine, while glucose oxidase and uricase were coimmobilized with horseradish peroxidase to quantify glucose and uric acid. Moreover, the concentrations of analytes in fetal calf serum were measured and quantified using the developed sensing system. The array biosensor showed good specificity for the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples for multianalytes without obvious cross-interference. The analytical ranges of the four analytes were between 0.01 and 10 mM with detection limits of 2.5-80 μM. High precision with relative standard deviations of 3.8-9.2% (n = 45) was also demonstrated. The reproducibility of array-to-array in 3 consecutive months was 5.4% (n = 3). Moreover, the concentrations of analytes in fetal calf serum were 5.9 mM for urea, 0.13 mM for creatinine, 3.3 mM for glucose, and 0.15 mM for uric acid, which were in good agreement with results obtained using the traditional spectroscopic methods. These results demonstrate the first use of a sol-gel-derived optical array biosensor for simultaneous analysis of multiple samples for the presence of multiple clinically important renal analytes. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Various morphologies of 1-D nanostructured titanate materials including nanosheets, nanotubes, nanowires, and nanoribbons have recently been successfully synthesized using the alkaline hydrothermal method. In spite of the controversy of the chemical structures and formation mechanisms, titanate nanostructures have attracted much attention on applications of dye-sensitized solar cell, hydrogen sensing, lithium storage and photocatalysis because of their unique features of high specific surface area, ion-exchange capacity and aspect ratio, and unique optical and electrochemical properties.

61349143068	Transformation of carbon tetrachloride by biogenic iron species in the presence of Geobacter sulfurreducens and electron shuttles	The transformation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) by biogenic iron species produced from the bioreduction of various Fe(III) oxides in the presence of Geobacter sulfurreducens and electron shuttles were investigated. Cysteine and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) at concentrations of 0.5 mM and 10 μM, respectively, were added as the electron shuttles. Addition of electron shuttles enhanced the extent of reduction and rate of ferric oxide reduction. The bioreduction extents of ferric oxides by G. sulfurreducens in the presence of electron shuttles were 22.8-48.3% for ferrihydrite, 6.5-17.2% for hematite, and 3.0-11.3% for goethite. After normalization to the surface areas, a higher rate of CT reduction was observed per unit of adsorbed Fe(II) on crystalline oxides. The produced biogenic Fe(II) from crystalline iron oxides was 2.8-7.6 times lower than that obtained from ferrihydrite, while the surface area-normalized rate constant for iron-mediated CT transformation in the presence of goethite and hematite were, by factors of 2-21, higher than that obtained using ferrihydrite. These results clearly depict that G. sulfurreducens drove the reduction of CT primarily through the formation of biogenic iron species in the presence of electron shuttle under iron-reducing conditions and that it is a surface area dependent process. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

67649292543	Dechlorination of trichloroethylene by Ni/Fe nanoparticles immobilized in PEG/PVDF and PEG/nylon 66 membranes	The highly reactive bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles immobilized in nylon 66 and PVDF membranes were synthesized and characterized for dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) under anoxic conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) elemental maps showed that the distribution of Fe in nylon 66 membrane was uniform and the intensity of Ni layer was higher than that in PVDF membrane. The particle sizes of bimetallic Fe/Ni in PVDF and nylon 66 membranes were 81 ± 12 and 55 ± 14 nm with the Ni layers of 12 ± 3 and 15 ± 2 nm, respectively. Low agglomeration of immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles in nylon 66 membrane was observed, presumably attributed to the more multifunctional chelating groups in membrane. A rapid hydrodechlorination of TCE with ethane as the main end product was observed by the immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles.

It has been proven that the addition of Pd and Ni ion can enhance the dechlorination rate of PCE in the zerovalent metal system. However, the addition of Cu ion cannot enhance the PCE dechlorination in Si(0) system, because Cu ion will precipitate at pH 8.3, the optimal pH value for the activation of Si(0).

78649773375	Microwave-assisted nonhydrolytic sol-gel method for synthesis of highly crystalline titanium dioxide nanoparticles	Nanocrystalline TiO2 is of great interest owing to its potential applications in many aspects such as solar energy conversion, photocatalysis, sensors, and photochromic devices. Among the diferent synthetic approaches developed in the last few years, the nonhydrolytic processes is particularly successful to synthesize crystalline TiO2. In spite of the progress, the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 remains time- and energy-consuming. One possibility to accelerate the synthetic process is the use of microwave irradiation, which allows a more e?cient and homogeneous heating of the reaction mixture. Microwave-assisted synthesis routes for inorganic materials are not yet as popular as for organic compounds. In this study, the nonhydrolytic sol̈gel chemistry was combined with microwave heating to synthesize highly crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles in good yields within 3 hours. Several parameters including temperature, reaction time and the ratio of titanium precursor to solvent were found to influence the properties of TiO2. The synthesized titanium dioxides are further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), N2 adsorption and desorption. From XRD results, the TiO2 nanocrystallines are mainly anatase phase with the grain size of 5.7 nm. The specific surface area is about 150 m2/g. Electron microscopic images demonstrated that the TiO2 nanoparticles are near monodisperse. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 was examined by using methylene blue as the target compound. A good photodegradation efficiency was obtained when 10 mg/L methylene blue was illuminated with 305 nm UV light.

The monodispersed magnetite nanocrystals were obtained by thermal decomposition of iron-oleate complex in a high boiling point solvent in presence of oleylamine and oleic acid. The size of magnetite nanocrystal can be tuned from 7 - 11nm by changing the amount of iron-oleate complex. The other key parameters such as temperature, amount of capping agents, types of solvent were also discussed. This synthetic procedure could also apply to synthesis other type of ferrite nanocrystals.

In this study, the dechlorination of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) by Si(0) in the presence of various concentrations of PEG was investigated under anoxic conditions. Several surfactants including cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodiumdodecyl sulfate (SDS), and Tween 80 were also selected for comparison.

0035907023	Determination of organochlorine pesticides and their metabolites in soil samples using headspace solid-phase microextraction	An analytical procedure was developed using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) for the determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and their metabolites in sandy soil samples. The developed procedures involving fiber selection, temperature effect, absorption time, soil matrix and the addition of solvents of different polarity were optimized. Also, the results were compared to those achieved using Soxhlet extraction standard method. The 100-μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 65-μm PDMS-divinylbenzene showed good extraction efficiency for 18 organochlorine pesticides. An increase in the extraction efficiency of organochlorine pesticides and the metabolites was observed when the temperature increased, and an optimum temperature of 70°C for extracting OCPs was obtained. The application of other hydrophilic solvents had different effects on the extraction of organochlorine pesticides and the metabolites. Higher responses of OCPs were obtained when 5 ml of water was added to the soil. Good linearity of OCPs between 0.2 and 4 ng/g soil was observed. The relative standard deviation was found to be lower than 25%. Also the limits of detection were between 0.06 and 0.65 ng/g, which were lower than those obtained using Soxhlet extraction. Moreover, the optimized HS-SPME procedure was applied to the analysis of OCPs in certified reference material (CRM) 804-050 soil and compared with Soxhlet extraction procedure. Results obtained in this study were in good agreement with those obtained using Soxhlet extraction. The mean values obtained using HS-SPME technique were in the range of 16.5 to 1459.6 mg/kg, which corresponds to the recoveries of 68% to 127% of the certified values of CRM soil. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0035986636	Distribution and fate of organochlorine pesticide residues in sediments from the selected rivers in Taiwan	The contamination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in sediments from selected rivers in Taiwan was investigated to evaluate the pollution potentials and hazard in river sediments. Da-han River and Erh-jen River were selected as the target rivers due to their serious pollution. A total of 40 surface sediment samples were collected at five sampling stations along the rivers. Results showed that the concentrations of various pesticides in sediments were in the range of 0.57-14.1 ng/g for ∑HCH, 0.05-0.15 ng/g for aldrin, 0.12-5.8 ng/g for dieldrin, 0.22-0.64 for endrin, 0.24-6.37 ng/g for endosulfan and 0.21-8.81 ng/g for ∑DDT (p,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDT). Among the OCPs, ∑HCH, endosulfan and ∑DDT were the most dominant compounds in the river sediments. Endosulfan sulfate was the most frequent detected compound in the sediments from the selected rivers. Also, ∑DDT, dieldrin and β-HCH were in abundance. Different contamination patterns between the selected river sediments were also observed. Da-han River was mainly contaminated with endosulfan sulfate and ∑DDT. Whereas the main pesticides in Erh-jen River were β-HCH and ∑DDT. Among the cyclodiene compounds, dieldrin was in abundance in most of the sediments. Moreover, the frequencies of detection of the metabolites were higher than those of parent compounds, depicting that the sediments have contaminated for a long time. The results obtained in this study showed that there still exist a variety of OCP residues in the river sediments in Taiwan. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0036628841	Cysteine-mediated reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline iron(III) oxides by Geobacter sulfurreducens	The reductive dissolution of poorly crystalline ferric oxides in the presence of cysteine was investigated to evaluate the potential of cysteine as a possible electron carrier to stimulate the reduction of iron(III) oxides by Geobacter sulfurreducens. The extent and rate of biotic and abiotic reduction of iron(III) oxides in the presence of cysteine at various concentrations were compared. Iron(III) oxides were reduced abiotically by cysteine. The initial rate and extent of iron(III) oxide reduction were correlated linearly with the cysteine concentration ranging from 0 to 6 mM. Also, addition of 0.5-2 mM cysteine significantly stimulated the rate and the extent of iron(III) oxide reduction in cultures of G. sulfurreducens. The cysteine concentration decreased in accordance with the increase of Fe(II) concentration and reached a nearly constant residual concentration. Cysteine depletion followed first-order kinetics and increased linearly with the cysteine concentration. An 8- to 11-fold increase in the extent of iron(III) oxide reduction relative to the abiotic system was observed. Comparison of sorbed and dissolved Fe(II) concentrations between cultures amended with cysteine and with other organic chelators showed that solubilization is not the main factor in cysteine-stimulated Fe(III) reduction. Addition of cystine could enhanced the extent of iron(III) oxide reduction, concomitant with the increase of the regenerated cysteine concentration and support the hypothesis that cysteine could serve as an electron carrier to transfer electrons from G. sulfurreducens to poorly crystalline iron(III) oxides.

A total of 19 sediment samples were collected at five sampling stations along the River estuary. The concentrations of OCPs were in the range of 0.99-14.5 ng/g-dry weight (dw) for ΣHCH (α-, β-, γ-, δ-HCH), 0.46-13.4 ng/g-dw for Σcyclodiene and 0.53-11.4 ng/g-dw for ΣDDT (p,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDT). The mean concentrations of ΣHCH, Σcyclodiene and ΣDDT were 3.79, 4.87 and 2.51 ng/g-dw, respectively. The total concentrations of OCPs correspond to 1.73-71.9 μg/g-OC when normalized to TOC contents. Among the organochlorine pesticides, endosulfan sulfate, β-HCH, and p,p′-DDD were the most dominant compounds in the sediments with the average concentrations of 1.97, 3.43 and 2.08 ng/g, respectively. Also, different contamination patterns among sampling seasons were observed. The measured concentrations of OCPs collected in spring were higher than those in autumn and winter. A linear relationship between sediment characteristics and OCP residues was also demonstrated.

Effects of several parameters including the nature of membrane, initial concentration, pH value, and reaction temperature on the dechlorination efficiency were examined. The scanning electron microscopic images showed that the Ni/Fe nanoparticles were successfully immobilized inside the four membranes using polyethylene glycol as the cross-linker. The agglomeration of Ni/Fe were observed in poly(vinylidene fluoride), Millex GS and mixed cellulose ester membranes, while a relatively uniform distribution of Ni/Fe was found in nylon-66 membrane because of its hydrophilic nature. The immobilized Ni/Fe nanoparticles exhibited good reactivity towards the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons, and the pseudo-first-order rate constant for TCE dechlorination by Ni/Fe in nylon-66 were 3.7-11.7times higher than those in other membranes. In addition, the dechlorination efficiency of chlorinated hydrocarbons followed the order TCE>PCE>CT. Ethane was the only end product for TCE and PCE dechlorination, while dichloromethane and methane were found to be the major products for CT dechlorination, clearly indicating the involvement of reactive hydrogen species in dechlorination. In addition, the initial rate constant for TCE dechlorination increased upon increasing initial TCE concentrations and the activation energy for TCE dechlorination by immobilized Ni/Fe was 34.9kJmol

84864111912	Adsorption and selective recognition of 17β-estradiol by molecularly imprinted polymers	The 17β-estradiol-imprinted polymers using noncovalent approach with methacrylic acid as the functional monomer was prepared and characterized. The effect of porogenic solvents on the adsorption capacity and thermal stability of the molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were examined. Scanning electron microscopic images showed that the synthesized MIPs were bulk porous materials. The surface areas of MIPs increased from 151-188 to 239- 292 m2 g-1 when templates were removed by methanol using Soxhlet extraction. In addition, the MIPs prepared in chloroform had a higher adsorption capacity towards 17βestradiol (1,212 μg g-1) than that in acetonitrile (769 μg g-1), indicating that less polar porogenic solvent is suitable for synthesis of non-covalent MIPs. FTIR showed that the carbonyl group is the major functional group in MIPs to form monomer-template complex via H-bond. In addition, only a slight decrease (< 5 %) in adsorption capacity of the MIPs was observed when incubated at 80 °C for 5 h. Analysis of the capacity factor values (?imp') for MIPs indicated that the rebinding ability from selective recognition sites of MIPs decreased in the order 17β-estradiol>testosterone> benzo[a]pyrene>progesterone>phenol, and the ?imp' values decreased from 2.68 to 0.63, indicating the excellent selectivity of MIPs among closely related compounds. Results obtained in this study clearly indicate that the imprinted polymer is specific for recognizing 17β-estradiol. The excellent selectivity and high adsorption capacity of 17β-estradiolimprinted polymers open the door to develop MIPs for effective separation and adsorption of estrogenic compounds. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

In sol-gel immobilization, 1mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.1 provided a sufficient buffer capacity for metal ion analysis as well as the enzyme activity maintenance. Also, two analytical procedures, incubated and un-incubated systems, were compared to understand the sensitivity and applicability to heavy metal analysis. The developed optical biosensor showed high reproducibility and the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 5.1% (n=10) was obtained. Also, eight measurements can be completed automatically within 36min. The biosensor has high sensitivity to Cu(II) and Cd(II) and an analytical range of 10-230μM with a detection limit of 10μM was achieved. Moreover, biological and environmental samples were examined to evaluate the applicability of the developed biosensor.

84866519975	Engineered synthetic polymer nanoparticles as IgG affinity ligands	A process for the preparation of an abiotic protein affinity ligand is described. The affinity ligand, a synthetic polymer hydrogel nanoparticle (NP), is formulated with functional groups complementary to the surface presentation of the target protein. An iterative process is used to improve affinity by optimizing the composition and proportion of functional monomers. Since the polymer NPs are formed by a kinetically driven process, the sequence of functional monomers in the polymer chain is not controlled; only the average composition can be adjusted by the stoichiometry of the monomers in the feed. To compensate for this the hydrogel NP is lightly cross-linked resulting in chain flexibility that takes place on a submillisecond time scale allowing the polymer to "map" onto a protein surface with complementary functionality. In this study, we report a lightly cross-linked (2%) N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAm) synthetic polymer NP (50-65 nm) incorporating hydrophobic and carboxylate groups that binds with high affinity to the Fc fragment of IgG. The affinity and amount of NP bound to IgG is pH dependent. The hydrogel NP inhibits protein A binding to the Fc domain at pH 5.5, but not at pH 7.3. A computational analysis was used to identify potential NP-protein interaction sites. Candidates include a NP binding domain that overlaps with the protein A-Fc binding domain at pH 5.5. The computational analysis supports the inhibition experimental results and is attributed to the difference in the charged state of histidine residues. Affinity of the NP (3.5-8.5 nM) to the Fc domain at pH 5.5 is comparable to protein A at pH 7. These results establish that engineered synthetic polymer NPs can be formulated with an intrinsic affinity to a specific domain of a large biomacromolecule. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84885385799	Tuning the adsorption capability of multi-walled carbon nanotubes to polar and non-polar organic compounds by surface oxidation	This current study addresses the inter-relationship between the surface oxidation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and the polarity of organic solutes and its effect on the adsorption reaction between them. Results indicated that pristine MWCNTs exhibited a stronger affinity toward non-polar compounds such as phenanthrene compared to that of ozone-oxidized MWCNTs (O-MWCNTs). On the contrary, the adsorption of polar compounds, such as phenol, on MWCNTs occurred to a much less extent compared to that on O-MWCNTs as indicated by a smaller Freundlich affinity coefficient. The adsorption capability of various organic compounds on MWCNTs could be tuned. It was found that the stability of MWCNTs did not control the adsorption capacity. The solution chemistry only had minimal influence on the adsorption of phenanthrene on MWCNTs. Results demonstrated the importance of surface chemistry and the properties of adsorbates on the adsorption process. Overlooking either aspect might lead to a misinterpretation of the adsorption reaction. Understanding the interactive nature of MWCNTs adsorption provides information on the preparation of green and "smart" adsorbents according to the nature of adsorbates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84892982985	Enhanced dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride by Geobacter sulfurreducens in the presence of naturally occurring quinones and ferrihydrite	The effect of naturally occurring quinones including lawsone (LQ), ubiquinone (UQ), juglone (JQ), and 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) on the biotransformation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) in the presence of Geobacter sulfurreducens and ferrihydrite was investigated. AQDS was used as the model compound for comparison. The reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite by G. sulfurreducens was enhanced by AQDS, NQ, and LQ. However, addition of UQ and JQ had little enhancement effect on Fe(II) production. The bioreduction efficiency and rate of ferrihydrite was highly dependent on the natural property and concentration of quinone compounds and the addition of low concentrations of LQ and NQ significantly accelerated the biotransformation rate of CT. The pseudo-first-order rate constants for CT dechlorination (k

84901019190	Fabrication of hierarchically ordered porous carbons using sugarcane bagasse as the scaffold for supercapacitor applications	A promising strategy for the fabrication of hierarchically porous carbon materials (HPCMs) using sugarcane bagasse as the scaffold was developed for the application of supercapacitors with enhanced electrochemical performance. HPCMs were fabricated by evaporation-induced self-assembly using resol polymer and triblock copolymer F127 as the carbon precursor and structural directing agent, respectively. The HPCMs show a 2-dimensional hexagonally ordered structure with pore size distribution centered at 3.4 nm. After activation with carbon dioxide at 850 °C for 12 h to remove residual carbons and/or impurities, the specific surface area increases to 1638 m

84905365632	Application of zerovalent silicon for the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons - A review	The dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons by zerovalent metals has received much attention. In addition to iron, zerovalent silicon is a strong reductive material which can serve as an alternative for remediation of contaminated sites. However, little is known about the reaction kinetics and mechanism of chlorinated hydrocarbons by zerovalent silicon under anoxic conditions. In this review, parameters controlling the reactivity of silicon in dechlorination were discussed. In addition, the enhanced effects of bimetallic system including Fe/Si and Ni/Si and addition of surfactant on the dechlorination kinetics and mechanisms were also introduced and reviewed. The dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinated hydrocarbons by zerovalent silicon increased upon increasing pH from 7.2 to 9.5. The dechlorination followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics and the rate constant (k

12844287697	Simultaneous determination of pH, urea, acetylcholine and heavy metals using array-based enzymatic optical biosensor	An array-based optical biosensor for the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples in the presence of unrelated multi-analytes was fabricated. Urease and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were used as model enzymes and were co-entrapped with the sensing probe, FITC-dextran, in the sol-gel matrix to measure pH, urea, acetylcholine (ACh) and heavy metals (enzyme inhibitors). Environmental and biological samples spiked with metal ions were also used to evaluate the application of the array biosensor to real samples. The biosensor exhibited high specificity in identifying multiple analytes. No obvious cross-interference was observed when a 50-spot array biosensor was used for simultaneous analysis of multiple samples in the presence of multiple analytes. The sensing system can determine pH over a dynamic range from 4 to 8.5. The limits of detection (LODs) of 2.5-50 μM with a dynamic range of 2-3 orders of magnitude for urea and ACh measurements were obtained. Moreover, the urease-encapsulated array biosensor was used to detect heavy metals. The analytical ranges of Cd(II), Cu(II), and Hg(II) were between 10 nM and 100 mM. When real samples were spiked with heavy metals, the array biosensor also exhibited potential effectiveness in screening enzyme inhibitors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84924025962	Highly efficient reduction of 4-nitrophenol by heterostructured gold-magnetite nanocatalysts	In this study, the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol by heterostructured Au-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanocatalysts using NaBH<inf>4</inf> as the reducing agent was investigated under various environmental conditions. The electron behaviors at the interface of Au and Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles were examined to elucidate the reaction mechanisms for 4-nitrophenol reduction. The transmission electron microscopic images show that the average particle size of Au-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> heterostructures increases slightly from 14 to 18 nm after phase transfer from oil phase to aqueous solution. The X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopic results show the electron flow from Au seeds to Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, resulting in the formation of positively charged Au surface to accelerate the catalytic reduction efficiency and rate of 4-nitrophenol. In addition, the reduction of 4-nitrophenol is a surface-mediated reaction and the catalytic efficiency and rate of 4-nitrophenol is highly dependent on the initial 4-nitrophenol concentration, pH, and reaction temperature. The increase in pH lowers the reduction efficiency and rate of 4-nitrophenol and a 2.4-fold decrease in the pseudo-firstorder rate constant is observed when pH increases from 5 to 9. In addition, the Au-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanocatalysts show a good separation ability and reusability which can be repeatedly applied for complete reduction of 4-nitrophenol for at least six successive cycles without the loss of morphology and saturation magnetization. Results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate that the Au-Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> heterostructures are excellent nanocatalysts which can be applied in heterogeneous catalysis, water treatment, and green chemistry.
