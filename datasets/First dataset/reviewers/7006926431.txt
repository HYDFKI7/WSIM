84928175702	Expression of costimulatory molecule B7-H4 on spleen lymphocytes during the progression of precancerous lesions in esophagus in mice	Objective: To investigate the percentages of splenic CD4<sup>+</sup>T, CD8<sup>+</sup>T and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD2 5 ± forkhead-winged helix transcription factor 3 (foxp3)<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells and the expression of costimulatory molecule B7 homologue 4 (B7-H4) during different stages of progression of precancerous lesions in esophagus in mice. Methods: 4-Nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO) in drinking water was used to induce esophageal precancerous conditions in mice. The hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to evaluate the pathological changes in different stages of precancerous conditions. The percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>T, CD8<sup>+</sup>T and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells in splenic lymphocytes and the positive rates of B7-H4 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>T, CD8<sup>+</sup>T and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells in mice in different stages of esophageal precancerous conditions were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Results: At the time of the 12th week of giving 4-NQO in drinking water to induce esophageal cancer, the pathological abnormalities with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia occurred in esophageal tissues in mice, and the high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma in situ were developed along with the time. The percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>T and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD2 5<sup>+</sup>foxp3<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells in splenic lymphocytes in mice induced by drinking of 4-NQO were higher than those in the control mice (by drinking of distilled water) (both P < 0.01). As compared with the control mice, the positive rate of B7-H4 on the CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in mice induced by drinking of 4-NQO was higher (P < 0.01) in a time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Giving 4-NQO in drinking water can induce esophageal precancerous lesions in mice. CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, T regulatory cells and B7-H4 may be involved in tumor immune escape mechanism.

84939781854	Effect of tanreqing on chemotherapy-associated immune suppression in mice with experimentally induced lewis lung carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the effect of an injectable Chinese herbal medicine Tanreqing on chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression in a mouse model of lung carcinoma. Methods: A total of 40 C57 BL/6 mice were randomized to five groups: 1) normal control, 2) experimentally induced lung carcinoma, 3) Tanreqing treatment, 4) chemotherapy, and 5) chemotherapy combined with Tanreqing treatment. The designated treatments commenced 10 days after lung carcinoma induction and lasted for 5 days. At the end of the treatments, animals were sacrificed after periphery blood sampling, spleen and thymus were collected, and macrophages were isolated from peritoneal fluid. Thymus index and lymphocytes in peripheral blood were quantified. Apoptosis rate of thymus cells and proportion of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD3 <sup>-</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry. The viability of T and B lymphocytes were assessed by MTT assay. Bcl-2 and Fas mRNA levels in thymus were measured by RT-PCR. The cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages and their secretion of IL-12 were determined with LDH and ELISA kits. Serum levels of IgG and C3 were measured by immune turbidimetry. Results: As compared with the chemotherapy group, the chemotherapy and tanreqing combination group had signigicantly higher thymus index, lymphocyte count and T and B lymphocyte viabilities in the spleen (p<0.01), significantly higher percentages of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>-</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells in peripheral-blood lymphocyte (p<0.01), and significantly higher Bcl-2 mRNA abundance (p<0.01) but significantly lower Fas mRNA abundance(p<0.01). Peritoneal macrophages isolated from animals in the combination treatment group produced significantly higher levels of IL-2 and displayed significantly higher eytotoxieity than those isolated from animals in the chemotherapy group (p<0.01). Conclusion: The injectable Chinese herbal medicine Tanreqing appears to have an immune protective and anti-tumor immunity-enhancing activities in lung carcinoma patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods: Monocytes were purified from PBMCs obtained from healthy adults. After being challenged with interferon-γ (IFN<inf>-γ</inf>) and anti-human CD3, the cells were radomly divided into six groups by different stimulating factors: A group (IL-2: 1 000 U/ml), B group (IL-2: 000 U/ml, IL-27:20 ng/ml), C group (IL-2: 1 000 U/ml, IL-27: 10 ng/ml), D group (IL-2: 500 U/ml, IL-27: 10 ng/ml), E group (IL-2: 1 000 U/ml, IL-27:5 ng/ml), and F group (IL-2: 1000 U/ml, IL-27:40 ng/ml). The morphology of the CIK cells in different groups were evaluated by inverted microscopy. The proportion of CIK cells respectively expressing CD3 <sup>+</sup> CD56 <sup>+</sup> and CD8 <sup>+</sup> were analyzed by fluorescence activating cell sorter (FACS) on days 7, 9, 11 and 13 after treatments. The number of attached cells was counted by a computer-based cell counter. The cytotoxicity of CIK cells was determined by MTS test. Results: Compared with A, B and C groups, D group had significantly higher proportions of CD3 <sup>+</sup> CD56 <sup>+</sup> CIK cells ([66. 57 ± 2. 44]% vs [60. 03 ± 1. 75]%, [55. 51 ± 0. 03]%, and [56. 07 ± 0. 83]%; P <0. 05) and CD8 <sup>+</sup> CIK cells ([81. 67 ± 1. 97]% vs [70. 30 ± 2. 67]%, [74. 92 ± 2. 47]%, and [74. 43 ± 1. 90]%; P < 0. 05), and significantly higher index of cell expansion to culture median (4 811. 87 ± 23. 07 vs 3 257. 73 ± 91. 97, 3 790. 92 ± 64. 49, 4 009. 85 ± 43. 08; P < 0. 05) on day 11 after treatments. The highest effector to target cell ratio on day 11 in D group was 40: 1 with a cytotoxicity rate of (76. 71 ±2. 21)% which was significantly higher than that in groups A, B, and C. Conclusion: In vitro, IL-27 is capable of significantly enhancing the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CIK cells in a time-dependent manner and the optimal time of incubation seems to be 11 days.

84940323083	Expressions of MAGE-A4 and P73 protein in breast cancer tissues and their clinical significance	Objective: To investigate the expressions of melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-A4 and tumor suppressor gene P73 in breast cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues and their clinical significance. Methods: Sixty patients with breast cancer from September 2007 to December 2007 in Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University were enrolled in the study. The expressions of MAGE-A4 and P73 proteins in breast cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues were detected by immunohistochemisty assay, and their correlations with the clinicopathological features of breast cancer were analyzed. Results: The positive expression rates of MAGE-A4 and P73 in breast cancer tissues were 63. 3% (38/60) and 43. 3% (26/60), respectively, while in adjacent tumor tissues were 0 (0/60) and 85% (51/60), respectively (P <0. 01). In the breast cancer tissues, the expression of MAGE-A4 protein was positively correlated with P73 (r =0. 316, P =0. 014). MAGE-A4 protein expression was not correlated with patients age, pathological type, histological grade, clinical stage, tumor size, metastatic state of lymph node, estrogen receptor (ER), as well as progestrogen receptor (PR) status. However, MAGE-A4 protein expression was negatively correlated with expression of C-erbB2 protein (r = -0.259, P - 0.046). P73 protein expression was not correlated with patients' age, pathological type, histological grade, clinical stage, tumor size, metastatic state of lymph node, and C-erbB2 expression. Whereas, the expression of P73 protein was positively correlated with the expression of ER (r = 0. 274, P = 0. 034) and PR (r = 0. 262, P = 0. 043). Conclusion: Breast cancer tissues highly express MAGE-A4 and P73 Protein, and there exists an important regulatory mechanism between MAGE-A4 and P73 protein.

84940327387	Cytotoxicity effect of parthenolide on cancer stem cells in mouse breast cancer stem cells in vivo	Objective:To investigate the effects of parthenolide (PTL) on cancer stem cells (SCs) of mouse breast cancer in vivo, providing an experimental basis for the clinical treatment of breast cancer with PTL. Methods: The mouse breast cancer model which enriching for 4T1 breast cancer CSCs was established by chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into three groups, a control group, a 5-FU group and a PTL group. Four weeks later, the mice were sacrificed. The mouse tumor volume and weight were measured. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to measure the proportion of CD44<sup>+</sup> CD24<sup>-/low</sup> cells in different tumor tissues; Hoechst 33342 staining was used to measure the proportion of SP (side population) cells; and the expressions of ALDHl (aldehyde dehydrogenasel) and CD55 proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry. The formation of mammosphere was observed under an inverted microscope. Results: The mouse breast cancer transplanted model enriching for 4T1 breast cancer Ss was successfully prepared. PTL could significantly reduce the proportion of CD44<sup>+</sup> CD24<sup>-/low</sup> cells in the mouse transplanted tumor tissues ([42.5 ± 3.7]% vs [68.7 ± 3. 2]%,P < 0.05), decrease the percentage of the SP cells in mouse transplanted tumor tissues ([ 39.2 ± 1.8]% vs [61.3 ± 2.6]%,P < 0. 05), and inhibit the expressions of CD55 and ALDH1 proteins in the mouse tumor tissues ([18.9 ±1.5]% vs [30.1 ± 1.3]%,[8.1 ± 2.3]% vs [18.0 ± 1.4]%; all P<0.05). PTL inhibited the formation of mammosphere generated from the mouse tumor 4T1 cells culturing in serum-free medium and the growth of the mouse transplanted tumor ([0.625 ±0.159] cm<sup>3</sup> vs [1.715 ± 0.184] cm<sup>3</sup>, [1.467 ± 0.373]g vs [3.367 ±0.398] g; P <0. 05]. Conclusion: PTL can significantly reduce the CSC contents in mouse tumor tissues in vivo, which suggests that PTL could be used to target the breast cancer CSC.

Methods: Plasmids pcDNA3.0, pcDNA3.0-p53 and pCMV6-MAGE-A9 were transfeced in vitro into human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells using Lipofectamine™2000. The expressions of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> mRNA and protein in MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the luciferase activity induced by p21<sup>WAF1</sup> promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells. MTT assay were adopted to explore the effect of different plasmids on the cell proliferation. Results: The expression of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> both in mRNA and protein levels was decreased in pcDNA3.0-p53/MAGE-A9 group, compared with pcDNA3.0-p53 group (\[0.15±0.01\] vs \[0.18±0.02\], \[0.03±0.00\] vs \[0.06±0.01\], P<0.05). The luciferase activity induced by p21<sup>WAF1</sup> promoter was remarkably increased in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with plasmid pcDNA3.0-p53 (\[58.56±3.47\] vs \[1.00±0.12\], P<0.01). After transfected with pcDNA3.0-p53/MAGE-A9, the luciferase activity induced by p21<sup>WAF1</sup>promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly reduced compared with that in pcDNA3.0-p53 group (\[22.02±4.91\] vs \[58.56±3.47\], P<0.05). Compared with pcDNA3.0 group, the proliferation rate were significantly decreased in pcDNA3.0-p53 group (\[228.89±22.39\]% vs \[337.23±23.67\]%, P<0.05), while in pcDNA3.0-p53/MAGE-A9 group, it was significantly higher than that in pcDNA3.0-p53 group (\[291.51±5.91\]% vs \[228.89±22.39\]%, P<0.05). Conclusion: MAGE-A9 can inhibit the transcriptional activity of P53 and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells.

1442277104	Expression of Interleukin-21 and -23 in Human Esophageal Tumors Produced Antitumor Effects in Nude Mice	Interleukin (IL)-21 induces proliferation of activated T and natural killer (NK) cells and enhances the lytic function of NK cells. IL-23, a heterodimer composed of p19 and p40 molecule, can also enhance T cell proliferation and interferon-γ production from activated T cells; however, its effects on NK cells are currently unknown. We therefore examined whether human tumors expressing IL-21 or IL-23 could produce antitumor effects in inoculated nude mice. Esophageal tumor T.Tn cells were retrovirally transduced with the IL-21 gene (T.Tn/IL-21) or the p19-linked p40 genes (T.Tn/IL-23). The proliferation in vitro and the class I expression of the major histocompatibility complexes of these transduced cells were not different from those of parent cells. T.Tn/IL-21 and T.Tn/IL-23 cells developed small tumors in nude mice, but the tumors regressed spontaneously thereafter in contrast to parent tumors. Expressed IL-21 or IL-23 in human esophageal tumors can produce antitumor effects in a T cell-defective condition.

33745888435	Epidemic strength of cardia and distant stomach cancer in the high risk region of esophageal cancer and their implication to edoscopic screening	Objective: To discuss the epidemic strength of cardia and distant stomach cancers in the high risk region of esophageal cancer along the south Taihang mountain such as in Shexian, Linxian, and Cixian Counties, and to clarify the tasks for the control of upper gastrointestinal tract cancer as a whole in the region. Methods: Comparisons of incidence and mortality rates of esophageal, cardia and stomach cancers were made between Cixian, Linxian and Shexian Counties with reference to detection rates of cancer in situ and precancerous lesions of the three upper gastrointestinal cancers by endoscopic screening. The screening was performed from 1999 through 2004 in the three adjacent counties including a total of 6233 local residents aged 40 to 69 years old. Results: The incidence rates for cardia cancer for the male and female from 2000 through 2004 were 69.9 and 41.5, and the mortality rates were 54.3 and 33.2 respectively in Shexian County. Esophageal, cardia, and stomach cancers constitute about 70-80 percent of all malignant disease by incidence or mortality rates. Endoscopic survey with iodine staining can effectively detect squamous cell precancerous lesions in the esophagus, but the method is inadequate for the detection of adeno precancerous lesions of the cardia and stomach. Conclusion: The south Taihang mountain region is a high risk area not only for esophagus cancer, but also for cardia and stomach cancers. To control upper gastrointestinal tract cancers as a whole in the region, special attention should be paid to the control of cardia and stomach cancers. Presently, to find effective screening methods for detecting cardia and stomach precancerous lesions is especially important.

33746906228	Immune enhancement and anti-tumour activity of IL-23	Immunotherapy, including the use of cytokines and/or modified tumour cells immune stimulatory cytokines, can enhance the host anti-tumour immune responses. Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a relative novel cytokine, which consists of a heterodimer of the IL-12p40 subunit and a novel p19 subunit. IL-23 has biological activities similar to but distinct from IL-12. IL-23 can enhance the proliferation of memory T cells and the production of IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α from activated T cells. IL-23 activates macrophages to produce TNF-α and nitric oxide. IL-23 can also act directly on dendritic cells and possesses potent anti-tumour and anti-metastatic activity in murine models of cancer. IL-23 can also induce a lower level of IFN-γ production compared with that induced by IL-12. This may make IL-23 an alternative and safer therapeutic agent for cancer, as IL-12 administration can lead to severe toxic side effects because of the extremely high levels of IFN-γ it induces. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

34250635050	Dependability between upregulated expression of the uridine phosphorylase gene in gastric cancer tissues and favorable prognosis of the patients treated by PFMT	Objective: To investigate the relationship between the expression levels of uridine phosphorylase (UP) gene and the prognosis of patients with the gastric, colon and lung carcinomas. Methods: The mRNA level of UP gene was examined using RT-PCR in 28 cases of stomach carcinoma, 14 lung cancer and 22 colon carcinoma. Results: Among the 28 paired gastric samples, 20 showed higher expression level in tumors than in normal surrounding tissues and 8 cases showed equal or lower levels in the tumors. All the gastric patients received 5-Fu before and/or after the surgical resection and the prognosis of the patients whose UP gene expression in tumors was increased was relatively better than that with equal or less UP gene expression in the tumors. In contrast, most of patients with colon carcinoma (16 cases) and all with lung cancer (14 in total) did not receive 5-Fu and majority of the colon (12 cases) and lung (10 cases) specimens showed a lower expression in the cancerous region. The differential expression between the cancerous and non-cancerous regions in the patients with colon and lung cancer was not related with the prognosis. Conclusion: These data suggest that the paired expression level of UP gene in gastric cancer is a possible prognostic marker for the patients who received 5-Fu.

Methods: The oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line TE-13 was cultured with aspirin at different concentrations or for different times. Proliferation and apoptosis were measured by MTT reduction and flow cytometry. Expression of COX-2 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR and COX-2 protein levels with Western blot analysis. Nuclear NF-kappaB and cytoplasmic IkappaB protein levels were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot, respectively. Results: Aspirin significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis at concentrations of 1, 4, 8 mmol/L. Aspirin dose-dependently decreased the levels of COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein and nuclear NF-kappaB protein and increased the cytoplasmic IkappaB protein. Conclusion: We conclude that aspirin inhibits the proliferation of, and induced apoptosis in, the cultured TE-13 SCC cell line. These changes correlate with a reduction in COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, prostaglandin synthesis, an inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, and an increase in cytoplasmic IkappaB. These results support the further investigation of the cyclooxygenase pathway in investigating the potential of aspirin and similar drugs in cancer prevention and therapy.

We studied the mechanism in human esophageal cancer cell line TE13. The esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line TE-13 was cultured with NS-398 at different concentrations or for different times. Proliferation and apoptosis were measured by MTT reduction and flow cytometry. Prostaglandin F1α was determined with radioimmunoassay. Expression of COX-2 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR and COX-2 protein levels with Western blot analysis. Nuclear NF-kappaB and cytoplasmic IkappaB protein levels were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot, respectively. NS-398 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis at concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 1, and 100 μmol/L. NS-398 dose-dependently decreased the levels of COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein, nuclear NF-kappaB protein and production of PGF1α and increased the cytoplasmic IkappaB protein. In conclusion, NS-398 inhibits the proliferation of, and induced apoptosis in, the cultured TE-13 SCC cell line.

77954365693	Periplocin extracted from cortex periplocae induces apoptosis of SW480 cells through inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway	Background and Objective: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of human cancers, especially in colorectal carcinomas. This study was to analyze the inhibition effect of periplocin extracted from cortex periplocae (CPP) on proliferation of human colon carcinoma cell line SW480 and the underlying mechanism. Methods: Cell proliferation of SW480 cells was measured by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Protein expression of β-catenin in total cell lysates, cytosolic extracts, and nuclear extracts were detected by Western blot. Binding activity of the T cell factor (TCF) complex in nucleus to its specific DNA binding site was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Expressions of β-catenin, survivin, c-myc and cyclin D1 mRNA in cells after the treatment with CPP were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results: CPP significantly inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells in a time- and dosedependent manner (P<0.01). CPP (0.5 μg/mL) also caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of SW48O cells and induced cell apoptosis (P<0.05). Compared to untreated control cells, after the treatment with CPP, the protein levels of β-catenin in total cell lysates, cytosolic extracts, and nuclear extracts were reduced (P<0.01); the binding activity of the TCF complex in nucleus to its specific DNA binding site was suppressed; mRNAs of the downstream target genes survivin, c-myc and cyclin D1 were decreased (P<0.01) while β-catenin mRNA remained unchanged. Conclusion: CPP could significantly inhibit the proliferation of SW480 cells, which may be through down- regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

77954381626	Periplocin from Cortex periplocae inhibits cell growth and down-regulates survivin and c-myc expression in colon cancer in vitro and in vivo via β-catenin/TCF signaling	Cancer of the colon and rectum is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and accounts for approximately 10% of all cancer-related deaths. Although surgical resection or radiotherapy are potentially curative for localized disease, advanced colon cancer is currently associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, the development of a new and effective chemotherapeutic agent is required to target critical pathways to induce responsiveness of colon cancer cells to death signals. Dysregulation of the β-catenin/TCF pathway plays a central role in early activities of colorectal carcinogenesis. In this study, human colon cancer SW480 cells were used to investigate the effect of CPP (periplocin from Cortex periplocae) on the modulation of the β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway. Our research results showed that CPP caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth as assessed by MTT assay and an induction in apoptosis as measured by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the CPP- treated cells were characterized by a decreased expression of β-catenin protein in the total cell lysates and cytosolic and nuclear extracts. This expression alleviates the binding activity of T-cell factor (Tcf) complexes to its specific DNA-binding sites. Thus, the protein expression of the downstream elements survivin and c-myc was down-regulated. To determine the precise inhibitory mechanisms involved, further in-depth in vivo studies of CPP are warranted. In conclusion, our data suggest that CPP wields a multi-prong strategy to target the β-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway, leading to the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of growth of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, CPP may become a potential agent against colon cancer.

79951576721	Melanoma-associated antigen genes - An update	To date, dozens of melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE) have been identified. Based on the differences in tissue-specific gene expression and gene structure, the MAGE family has been divided into two big subfamilies: MAGE-I and MAGE-II. MAGE-I genes were identified as a group of highly attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy because of their wide expression in a variety of malignant tumors but silent in normal adult cells except germ-line cells lacking human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression. However, little is known regarding the functions of MAGE family members in cell activities. In this review, we briefly described the classification of MAGE family members and their expression pattern in cancer. We also summarized the mechanism of MAGE activation and the functions of MAGE family members in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. We also discussed what is known of immunotherapy targeting MAGE family. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

80052300012	A high cholesterol diet given to apolipoprotein E-knockout mice has a differential effect on the various neurotrophin systems in the hippocampus	Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is one of the major transporters of cholesterol in the body and is essential for maintaining various neural functions in the brain. Given that hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it has been suggested that altered cholesterol metabolism may be involved in the development of the pathogenesis, including neural degeneration, commonly observed in AD patients. Neurotrophic factors and their receptors, which are known to regulate various neural functions, are also known to be altered in various neurodegenerative diseases. We therefore hypothesized that cholesterol metabolism may itself influence the neurotrophin system within the brain. We decided to investigate this possibility by modulating the amount of dietary cholesterol given to apoE-knockout (apoE-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice, and examining the mRNA expression of various neurotrophin ligands and receptors in their hippocampal formations. Groups of eight-week-old apoE-KO and WT mice were fed a diet containing either "high" (HCD) or "normal" (ND) levels of cholesterol for a period of 12 weeks. We found that high dietary cholesterol intake elevated BDNF mRNA expression in both apoE-KO and WT mice and TrkB mRNA expression in apoE-KO animals. On the other hand, NGF and TrkA mRNA levels remained unchanged irrespective of both diet and mouse type. These findings indicate that altered cholesterol metabolism induced by HCD ingestion combined with apoE deficiency can elicit a differential response in the various neurotrophin ligand/receptor systems in the mouse hippocampus. Whether such changes can lead to neural degeneration, and the mechanisms that may be involved in this, awaits further research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84877276192	Pain-relieving effect of a compound isolated from white peony root oral liquid on acute radiation-induced esophagitis	Acute radiation-induced esophagitis (ARIE) is a common complication of radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of pain relief by the compound of white peony root oral liquid (cWPROL) in ARIE. An animal model of ARIE was established and either cWPROL or a mixture of lidocaine, dexamethasone and gentamycin (mLDG) was administered. We indirectly observed rat symptoms of pain by recording the weight of food and the volume of water consumed by the rats, along with changes in body weight. Additionally, the expression levels of substance P (SP) in the esophageal tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. It was demonstrated that cWPROL was able to release the pain of ARIE by decreasing the expression of SP; this may be one of the molecular mechanisms via which cWPROL induces pain relief.

84898001946	B7-H3-mediated tumor immunology: Friend or foe?	B7-H3 (CD276), a newly identified member of the B7 family of molecules, is often induced in human tumors and its overexpression is closely correlated with survival, prognosis or tumor grade. Although cancer immunotherapy has not been completely translated into clinical successes, interest has been further enhanced by the realization of these costimulatory molecules' potential as targets to modulate clinical immune responses. Despite ample evidence implicating B7-H3 in tumor immune escape, a steady flow of reports have suggested that it may also have antitumor effects under certain circumstances. The safety and efficacy of targeting B7-H3 with a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced-stage central nervous system cancer in children has been proven, making B7-H3 an attractive therapeutic target for this kind of tumor. In addition, B7-H3 was shown to promote invasion and accelerate carcinogenesis in tumor progression according to its nonimmunological regulatory roles. In this review, we discuss current understanding of the diverse functions of B7-H3 in carcinogenesis and cancer progression, and consider future directions for designing cancer immunotherapeutic agents targeting B7-H3. © 2013 UICC.

44849139512	IL-27-mediated activation of natural killer cells and inflammation produced antitumour effects for human oesophageal carcinoma cells	Interleukin (IL)-27, composed of p28 and EBV-induced gene 3 subunits, has diverse functions in enhancing cell-mediated immunity and silencing the immunity. We examined whether forced expression of the p28-linked EBI3 gene in human oesophageal carcinoma cells (Eca109) produced antitumour effects in a T cell-defective condition. Tumour growth of Eca109 cells expressing IL-27 (Eca109/IL-27) was retarded in nude mice compared with parental and vector DNA-transduced tumours and survival of the mice inoculated with Eca109/IL-27 cells was prolonged. Expression of the tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-1β and IL-6 genes was up-regulated in Eca109/IL-27 tumour specimens while the tumours remained small in size but the increased transcription was subsequently down-regulated in enlarged tumours. Spleen cells from mice-bearing Eca109/IL-27 tumours produced interferon-γ and showed YAC-1-targeted cytotoxic activities greater than those of mice inoculated with parental or vector DNA-transducer tumours.

51749098431	Effect of Cortex Periplocae lupane acetate on immunoregulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes	Objective: Effect of Corlex Periplocae lupane acetate (CPLA) on immunoregulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was studied. Methods: Lymphocytes from human peripheral blood were isolated and co-incubated with phytohemagglutin (PHA) and different concentration of CPLA. The effect of CPLA on the proliferation of lymphocytes and phagocytosis of macrophage to the growth of human esophageal carcinoma cells ECA-109 were measured by MTT method. Effect of CPLA on IFN-γ mRNA expression was determined by using RT-PCR. TNF-α and IL-2 secretion in supernatant of lymphocytes and macrophage culture after CPLA treatment were determined with ELISA assay. Results: The proliferation of lymphocytes was enhanced by 5 - 40 μg/mL CPLA after activation of the proliferation of lymphocytes from human peripheral blood with PHA in a dose dependent manner (P<0.01). The expression of IFN-γ mRNA in lymphocytes was enhanced by 20 and 40 μg/ mL CPLA (P<0.01). CPLA could strengthen the macrophage to inhibit the proliferation of esophageal carcinoma cells significantly (P<0.01), which may be related with TNF-α production. The production of IL-2 and TNF-α by lymphocytes could be augmented by CPLA treatment in a dose dependent manner (P<0.01). Conclusion: CPLA could regulate the immune response of lymphocytes and macrophage from human peripheral blood, which may be related with killing carcinoma cells.

57749116568	Challenge and promise: Roles for Livin in progression and therapy of cancer	Livin is a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein gene family, which is highly expressed in a variety of human neoplasms. Several studies have shown that down-regulation of Livin expression increases the apoptotic rate, reduces tumor growth potential, and sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, emerging data reveal that Livin fragments cleavaged by caspases restored paradoxical proapoptotic activity during the apoptotic process, suggesting that Livin cleavage will become a highly potent proapoptotic agent in the future. In this article, we review the current understanding of the versatile roles of Livin in the apoptotic cascade and exploit the promising approach to interfere with Livin as a novel strategy for cancer therapy.

65249156653	Aberrant CpG island hypermethylation of RASSF1A in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma	Ras-association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, is inactivated in several human tumors, usually by hypermethylation of its promoter region. RASSF1A induces cell cycle arrest through inhibition of cyclin D1 accumulation. In this work, the promoter methylation status of the RASSF1A in 92 gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and corresponding normal tissues were investigated using Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) approach, immunohistochemistry method and RT-PCR were used respectively to examine the protein expression and mRNA expression of RASSF1A in tumors and corresponding normal tissues. Cyclin D1 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry. RASSF1A was methylated in 54/92 (58.7%) tumor specimens, which was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (p < .001). Methylation frequencies of stage III and IV tumor tissues were significantly higher than that in stage I and II tumortissues (p < .05). By immunostaining, 43/92 (46.7%) tumor tissues demonstrated heterogeneous, positive immunostaining of tumor tissues was significantly reduced with comparison to matched normal tissues (p < .001). mRNA expressions of RASSF1A in GCA tumor tissues were reduced significantly with comparison to the corresponding normal tissues (OD value: 0.2376 ± 0.2315 vs 0.6874 ± 0.2668, p< .001). RASSF1A mRNA expression in methylation group of GCA was significantly different from that in unmethylation group (p< .001). Cyclin D1 hyper-expression was found in 72/92 (78.3%) cases and correlated with RASSF1A methylation (p < .05). Our data suggested that epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A gene expression by promoter hypermethylation may play an important role in GCA. ©Informa Healthcare USA.

65849212912	4-1BB (CD137) ligand enhanced anti-tumor immune response against mouse forestomach carcinoma in vivo	Cancer occurrence and development has been demonstrated to be associated with escape from immune surveillance, and low costimulatory molecules expression has been considered as one of the important reasons for cancer evading the immune system. 4-1BB (CD137) is a costimulatory molecule expressed on the surface of activated T cells. Interaction of 4-1BB with its natural ligand (4-1BBL) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) has been shown to amplify T-cell mediated immunity. We therefore examined whether murine cancer cells expressing 4-1BBL could produce anti-tumor effects in inoculated mice. Mouse forestomach carcinoma (MFC) cells were transfected with 4-1BBL gene (MFC/4-1BBL). The proliferation of the transduced cells in vitro was not different from that of parental cells. However, MFC/4-1BBL cells developed small tumors and induced higher cytotoxicity of tumor infiltration lymphocyte (TIL). Production of cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2) in serum and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity of splenocytes from mice immunized with mitomycin C (MMC)-treated MFC/4-1BBL cells were significantly higher than that from mice immunized with MMC-treated parental MFC and MFC/pMKITneo cells. These results suggest that modification of cancer cells with 4-1BBL gene can produce anti-tumor immune responses. Copyright © 2008 by The Chinese Society of Immunology.

67649506339	Plk3 inhibits pro-apoptotic activity of p73 through physical interaction and phosphorylation	Plk3, one of Polo-like kinase family members, is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and DNA damage response. In this study, we found that Plk3 inhibits pro-apoptotic activity of p73 through physical interaction and phosphorylation. During cisplatin (CDDP)-mediated apoptosis, Plk3 was transcriptionally induced, whereas its protein level was kept at basal level, suggesting that Plk3 might rapidly degrade in response to CDDP. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down experiments demonstrated that Plk3 interacts with p73. Luciferase reporter assays and RT-PCR experiments revealed that Plk3 inhibits p73-mediated transcriptional activity. Consistent with these results, pro-apoptotic activity of p73 was blocked by Plk3. Additionally, Plk3 decreased the stability of p73. Intriguingly, kinase-deficient Plk3 failed to inhibit p73 function, indicating that kinase activity of Plk3 is required for Plk3-mediated inhibition of p73. Indeed, in vitro kinase reaction showed that NH

67649946192	Quercetin inhibit human SW480 colon cancer growth in association with inhibition of cyclin D1 and survivin expression through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway	Aim: The Wnt signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cellular developmental processes and human carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of quercetin on the growth of the colon carcinoma cell line and the regulation effect of quercetin on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Methods: MTT assay was used to determine the reduction of cell viability of quercetin on SW480 cells and clone 26 cells. The apoptotic rate and cell-cycle analysis after treatment with quercetin was determnined by flow cytometry. Effects of quercetin on mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and survivin were detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR. After treatment with quercetin, the protein expression of cyclin D1 and survivin in SW480 cells was analyzed by Western blot analysis. We built a Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway reporter gene model. The regulation effect of quercetin on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling transcription was investigated by using this reporter gene model. Results: Quercetin reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner in SW480 and clone 26 cells. The percentages of SW480 cells and clone 26 cells at G2/M phase were increased significantly after treatment with 40∼80 μmol/Lquercetin for 48 hours. Quercetin induced the apoptosis of SW480 cells in a dose-dependent manner at the concentration of 20, 40, 60, anf 80 μmol/L. However, quercetin only induced the apoptosis of clone 26 cells at the concentration of 80 μmol/L. Quercetin downregulated transcriptional activity of β-catenin/Tcf in SW480 cells transiently transfected with the TCF-4 reporter gene. Within 24 hours of treatment, a 160-μmol/L concentration of quercetin reduced β-catenin/Tcf transcriptional activity by about 18-fold. Cyclin D1 and the survivin gene were downregulated markedly by quercetin in a dose-dependent manner at both the transcription and protein expression levels. Conclusion: The results indicate that the molecular mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of quercetin in SW480 colon cancer cells is related to the inhibition of expression of cyclin D1 and survivin as well as the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway could be qualified as one of the promising targets for innovative treatment strategies of colorectal cancer. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Methods: SW480 cells were incubated with quercetin at several concentrations and for different time. The MTT colorimetric assay was used to examine the effect of quercetin on the proliferation of SW480 cells. Reporter gene plasmid TOPflash or FOPflash was cotransfected into SW480 cells together with pRL-null plasmid, and the reporter gene assay was performed to detect the changes of the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF in SW480 cells after quercetin was added. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to examine the transcriptional level and protein expression level of β-catenin target genes, Cyclin D1 and Survivin. Results: The proliferation of SW480 cells was inhibited significantly by quercetin within the concentrations from 40 to 160 μmol/L, P < 0.01, showing a dose- and time-dependent manner. The TCF-4 reporter gene activity in SW480 cells was inhibited significantly by quercetin within the concentrations from 10 to 160 μmol/L, P < 0.05, and mRNA and the protein expression of β-catenin/TCF target genes, Cyclin D1 and Survivin in SW480 cells were also down-regulated markedly by quercetin, in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: Quercetin can inhibit the proliferation of SW480 cells in vitro and the anti-tumor mechanism may be related to the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

76149120418	Nerve growth factor and receptors are significantly affected by histamine stimulus through H	Nerve growth factor (NGF) as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of human pancreatic cancer. NGF is synthesized as a proform (proNGF) that, when cleaved, releases mature ligand (mNGF). proNGF and mNGF bind to high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA) and low-affinity receptor p75 to different extents. Histamine is a potent stimulator of NGF in the inflammatory lesion as determined by ELISA. This has generally been attributed to the accumulation of mNGF. To determine the effect of histamine on nerve growth factor/receptor expression in human pancreatic cancer, the present study explored intracellular and extracellular NGF production and p75 and TrkA membrane receptor expression in the PANC-1, KMP-6 and PK-1 cell lines. Histamine enhanced NGF secretion and mRNA expression in PANC-1 and KMP-6 cells, but not in PK-1 cells. proNGF was revealed using Western blotting to be the predominant form of NGF, but was significantly reduced by histamine. p75 receptor binding was increased with histamine treatement, but no significant alteration was observed for TrkA. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an important indicator of cell proliferation, was significantly reduced by histamine stimulation. H

Methods: The mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from cord blood under axenic condition, and were induced by GM-CSF and IL-4 to differentiate into DCs. The DCs were divided into 3 groups on the fifth day: an ICA group, a TNF-α group and a control group. The morphology of DCs was observed under inverted microscope and transmission election microscope. Expression of CD83, CD80 and CD86 on DCs was examined by flow cytometry. IL-12 and IFN-γ levels in the culture supernatant of DCs were detected by ELISA. The proliferation of T cells stimulated by DCs was determined by MTT assay. Results: Cord blood mononuclear cells derived-DCs had a typical morphological characteristic of mature DCs after stimulation with ICA. Expression of CD1a, CD83, CD80 and CD86 on DCs in ICA group was up-regulated compared with that in control group (P < 0.05); moreover, CD86 expression on DCs in ICA group was significantly higher than that in TNF-α group (P < 0.05). IL-12 and IFN-γ production in ICA group and proliferation of T cells induced by DCs in the ICA group were markedly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), and were similar to those in the TNF-α group. Conclusion: ICA can induce differentiation and maturation of DCs derived from cord blood mononuclear cells, and enhances the immune activity of DCs.

Patients and Methods: All residents from 21 townships in Cixian, Hebei province were divided into an intervention group (9 townships, 11,382 people) who took up riboflavin-fortified salt and a control group (12 townships, 10,711 people) who were free from riboflavin-fortified salt. Some 1,300 of the control group and 950 of the intervention group were randomly selected to undergo endoscopy examination using iodine dying with multi-point biopsy and histopathology examination. Among them 155 of the intervention group and 120 of the control group were tested for the blood riboflavin level with refernce to the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC). Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence data were further obtained from the Cixian Cancer Registry. Results: The results of endoscopy suggested the mucosal status of the intervention group to be better than that of the control group. It showed 82.1% of the mucosal status of control group to be normal, 14.8% to have dysplasia, and 3.1% pre-cancer or cancer, respectively, as compared to 84.8%, 13.6% and 1.6%, respectively, for the intervention group. The mean EGRAC values for the intervention and control groups were 1.452 and 1.606, respectively (P<0.01); compared with normal mucous membrane of esophagus, the lack of riboflavin increased the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OR=3.921, 95%CI =1.853~11.936), but the risk of dysplasia did not increase (OR=3.421, 95%CI=0.912-10.159); after intervention, the six years average esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence of the intervention group (112.46/100,000) was lower than in the control group (142.11/100,000), although there was no statistical significance (u=1.858, P>0.05). Conclusion: It proved practical and effective to improve the status of riboflavin and esophageal mucosa by taking up riboflavin-fortified salt.

77952423756	Advances in viral-vector systemic cytokine gene therapy against cancer	Current strategies for cancer gene therapy consist mainly of direct inhibition of tumor cell growth and activation of systemic host defense mechanisms. Cytokine gene-transduced tumor cells have been used as vaccines in clinical trials, which have shown good safety profiles and some local responses but substantial lack of systemic efficacy. Cytokines should be directed at the level of gene selection and delivery, in order to identify the optimal cytokine and achieve efficient and durable cytokine expression at the level of improving immune stimulation. In this review, we will summarize the current achievements of cytokine gene therapy, especially viral-vector, and their applications in cancer treatment. Additionally, we will also discuss and propose future perspectives about cancer gene therapy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77953212672	Potential biomarkers for esophageal carcinoma detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry	Background: Currently, no satisfactory biomarkers are available to screen for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The goal of this study was to find biomarkers and establish a serum protein fingerprint model for early diagnosis of ESCC using the ClinProt protocol of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Methods: Serum samples were collected from 62 patients with ESCC, nine patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and 38 healthy individuals. Proteomic spectra of mass to charge ratio (m/z) were generated following the application of plasma to weak cationic-exchanger magnetic beads (WCX-MB). The spectral data were analyzed using a support vector machine, and potential biomarkers were chosen for system training and used to construct diagnostic models. Results: Three differential patterns were established using MALDI-TOF MS. Pattern 1, consisting of 11 protein peaks, separated ESCC patients from the healthy individuals with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 88.4%. Pattern 2, consisting of eight protein peaks, separated ESCC in stage I and stage II from stage III and stage IV with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 82.3%. Pattern 3, consisting of seven protein peaks, separated ESCC from EA with a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 80.0%. Conclusions: These results suggested that MALDI-TOF MS combined with MB separation yields significantly higher sensitivity and specificity for the detection of serum protein in patients with ESCC.

77953373943	Trichosanthin inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells and reversed the methylation of syk gene	Objective: To study the methylation status of spleen tyrosine kinase (syk) gene during apoptosis of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells induced by trichosanthin (TCS), and explore the relationship between the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells and methylation status of syk gene to search for a novel demethylated medicine. Methods: The effects of TCS on proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells were detected by MTT assay. The change of cell morphology was observed by Giemsa staining. Cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry after treatment with different concentrations of TCS for 48 h. The methylation status of syk was detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The expression of syk, Dnmts (including dnmt1, dnmt3a, dnmt3b), and demethylation gene (MBD2) at mRNA levels was assayed using RT-PCR. The effect of TCS on the activity of Dnmts in MDA-MB-231 cells was examined by colorimetric method. Results; TCS significantly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro in a time-and concentration-dependent manner (P <0.05). TCS caused typical apoptotic morphological changes in MDA-MB-231 cells such as vacuolar degeneration, pyknosis, and karyorrhexis, induced apoptosis, and arrested cells in S phase. The apoptotic rate of MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly higher than control group (P < 0.05). All the effects were in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. TCS reversed the methylation of the promoter of syk gene in MDA-MB-231 cells. Syk mRNA had a negative expression in MDA-MB-231 cells but its expression was detected after TCS treatment. No significant difference in expression of Dnmts and MBD2 at mRNA levels was detected in MDA-MB-231 cells before and after TCS treatment (P > 0.05). However, the activity of Dnmts in MDA-MB-231 cells was decreased. Conclusion: TCS inhibits proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells and has significant demethylation effects on sky gene, so it may become a novel kind of demethylation drugs.

Methods: MTT method was used to test the sensitivity by peripheral blood lymphocytes of 228 cancer patients and 20 healthy adults to 9 kinds of chemotherapeutic agents. Chemosensitivity testing was performed simultaneously with peripheral blood lymphocytes and tumor cells of 90 patients to investigate the correlation between the two kinds of cells. Results: 1) All of these, chemotherapeutic drugs showed various degrees of inhibitive function towards peripheral blood lymphocytes of control group. However, the inhibition rates were lower than those of tumor patients, and there was a significant difference betwween the two groups. 2) Except for 5-FU, VCR and Vp-16, the inhibition rates had significant differences among the three kinds of tumor cells. The inhibitive functions of 5-FU and VCR towards gastric cardia carcinoma were obvious, and there was a significant difference compared with the gastric cancer group and esophageal carcinoma group (P were 0.000 and 0.041, respectively). The funtion of 5-FU was greatest and its average inhibition rate was up to 46.33%. The inhibition rates of Vp-16 also had a significant difference between the gastric cardia carcinoma group and esophageal carcinoma group, P=0.000. 3)There was no significant difference of sensitivity between peripheral blood lymphocytes and tumor cells towards 9 kinds of chemotherapeutic agents, P were from 0.264 to 1.000. Conclusion: For patients whose tumor sample can not be obtained, it is feasible to use their peripheral blood lymphocytes to carry out the chemosensitivity test in vitro, and it is valuable for selecting chemotherapeutic agents.

77953412181	CD1a and CD83 expression in tumor infiltrating dendritic cells of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and tumor-infiltrating lymph node	Objective: To investigate CD1a and CD83 expression in tumor infiltrating dendritic cell (TIDC) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and tumor-infiltrating lymph node tissues, and to discuss its relationship with the clinical pathological characteristics of esophageal carcinoma. Methods: Seventy-eight paraffin samples were obtained from pathologically diagnosed esophageal carcinoma patients in the fourth hospital of Hebei medical university during 2002 to 2003. Flow cytometry was used to examine the expression of CD1a and CD83 on TIDC in 78 esophageal carcinoma tissues, 24 normal esophageal mucosal samples, 35 normal lymph nodes and 32 tumor-infiltrating lymph nodes. Results: (1) The expression of CD1a and CD83 in ESCC tissues was significantly lower than those in the normal esophageal mucosa (P < 0.05). (2) CD1a expression was not correlated with the tumor infiltration, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis of esophageal carcinoma (all P > 0.05), while CD83 expression was correlated with the clinical stage and lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.05). (3) There was no significant difference in CD1a expression between normal lymph node and tumor-infiltrating lymph node (P > 0.05), but CD83 expression in tumor-infiltrating lymph node was less than that in the normal lymph node (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The expression of CD83 in TIDC can reflect the local immune status of esophageal carcinoma, and also plays an important role in the development and progression of esophageal carcinoma. CD83 expression may serve as a biomarker for evaluating biological characteristics of esophageal carcinoma.

77953412331	Anti-tumor effects of CIK in nude mice bearing cervical cancer cell line HeLa-luc	OBJECTIVE: To discuss the anti-tumor activity of cytokine-induce killer (CIK) cells re-infused to mice inoculated with cervical cancer cells and its related mechanisms. METHODS: The BALB/C nude mice inoculated with cervical cancer cell line HeLa-luc were used as an animal model. The CIK cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donor were cultured. The CIK cells or PBS were re-infused through peri-tumor. Tumor changing was detected by using in vivo biouminescence imaging. The tumor size and weight were recorded for evaluation. The level of IFN-γ in peripheral blood of bearing-tumor mice was detected by ELISA. The histopathological changes of the tumor, lung, liver and spleen were observed by HE staining. RESULTS: The tumor size in the experiment group was smaller than that in the control group after CIK treatment (P < 0.05). The inhibitory rates of the fifth week and eighth week were 47.18% and 64.38% respectively after being inoculated with cervical cancer cell line HeLa-luc. The level of IFN-γ in the experiment group [(61.92 ± 6.49) ρg/mL] was higher than that in the control group [(34.30 ± 1.78) ρg/mL] on the eighth week after being inoculated with cervical cancer cell line HeLa-luc (P <0.01). The histopathological changes of tumor had no significantly difference in the two groups. In the experiment group, cancer nodules were not found in the lung and liver, but there were many inflammatory cells. Many cancer nodules were found in the lung and it was not found in the liver in the control group. Cancer nodules were found in the spleen in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The CIK cells show potent anti-tumor activity in animal experiment, and its mechanisms is related to IFN-γ. This study can provide a theroretical basis in clinical adoptive immunotherapy.

77953415777	Correlation analysis of hypermethylation in the promoter region of TSP1 gene and the expression of TGF-β1 in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma	Objective: To investigate the methylation status of thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) gene and protein expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA). Methods: Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was used to detect the methylation status of TSP-1 gene, RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression of TSP1 in cardia adenocarcinoa tissues and pericancerous tissues, respectively. Immunohistochemistry method was used to detect the protein expression of TGF-β1 in GCA tissues and corresponding normal tissues. Results: TSP1 gene was methylated in 34/96 (35.4%) GCA specimens, which was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues(P <0.001). The methylation frequencies of stage III and IV GCA tissues were significantly higher than those in stage I and II GCA tissues(P <0.05). TSP1 mRNA and protein expressions in GCA tissues were significantly lower than those in corresponding normal tissues (P <0.05) and were correlated with the methylation status. TGF-β1 protein expression was significantly increased in GCA tissues, fifty out of ninty six (52.1%) gastric cardia adenocarcinoma tisssues demonstrated positive immunostaining of TGF-β1 and the frequency of positive protein expression of TGF-β1 was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (P <0.001). The protein expression of TGF-β1 was significantly increased with the increase in the TNM staging and decrease in the differentiation degree of GCA (P <0.05). Hypermethylation of TSP1 was correlated with the protein expression of TGF-β1 in GCA tissues(P <0.05). Conclusion: Promoter hypermethylation of TSP1 gene and overexpression of TGF-β1 protein are involved in the initiation and progression of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. Gene silence induced by hypermethylation in the promoter region of TSP1 gene may be one of the mechanisms for oncogenesis of gastric cardia adenoma.

77953420531	Study on apoptosis-inducing effect for mouse mammary cancer cells transfected with IL-23 gene in vitro and in vivo	Objective: To investigate the changes in apoptosis of mouse mammary cancer cells (MA-891) after transfection with IL-23 gene in vitro and in vivo and explore the anti-tumor mechanism of IL-23. Methods: IL-23 gene was transferred into two packing cell lines (ectotrophic ψ2 and amphotrophic PA317) in sequence by a retrovirus vector (LXSN), and the positive cellular clones that can produce retroviruses carrying IL-23 gene were screened by G418. The retroviruses were used to transduce the mIL-23 gene into mouse mammary cancer cells (MA-891). After being screened by G418, IL-23/MA-891 cells expressing IL-23 protein were obtained. The expression of IL-23 protein in IL-23/ MA-891 cells was detected by ELISA method. The proliferations of MA-891, LXSN/MA-891 and IL-23/MA-891 cells were detected by MTT assay in vitro. Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with IL-23/MA-891, LXSN/MA-891 and the parental MA-891 cells and the solid tumor formation was observed in vivo. The apoptosis of tumor cells from mice injected with different MA-891 cells was detected by TUNEL and flow cytometry analysis. The expressions of Fas and survivin were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting in vivo. Results: IL-23 gene was successfully transfected into MA-891 cells. The stable IL-23/ MA-891 cells with over-expression of IL-23 was obtained. Transfection with IL-23 gene had significant effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of MA-891 cells in vitro (P > 0.05). But the tumor growth in mice was greatly inhibited and apoptosis ratio of tumor tissues was significantly increased in the IL-23 gene-transfected group compared with the control group (P <0.01). The expression of Fas on the surface of cells was up-regulated and the expression of survivin was significantly decreased (P <0.01). Conclusion: Transfection with IL-23 gene has no significant effects on the apoptosis of MA-891 cells in vitro. But IL-23 exerts its anti-tumor effect by up-regulating the expression of Fas and down-regulating the expression of survivin in vivo.

METHODS: The LPA1, LPA2 and LPA3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODN) were integrated into 3AO and SKOV3 cells lines. Transfection and expression were confirmed by the means of RT-PCR and Western blotting. The biological characteristics of the transfected cells were studied by the observation of their growth and proliferative periods. The effect of LPA on MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expressions and activities in transfected ovarian cells was analyzed by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: The LPA1 gene, LPA2 and LPA3 protein expressions were decreased in ovarian cancer cells with LPA1, LPA2 and LPA3 ASODN transfection. The transfected cells growth characteristics were not different before and after the transfectation. The gelatin zymography confirmed that LPA-induced the activities and protein expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 decreased in the transfected cells with LPA2 and LPA3 receptors ASODN, compared with those in the control group and SODN group (P<0.05). The activities and protein expressions of MMPs in LPA1 receptors ASODN cells did not decrease, compared with those in the control group and SODN group (P>0.05). CONCLSUIONS, LPA receptors antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can inhibite the expressions of LPA receptors gene and protein. LPA2 and LPA3 were more efficient in LPA-induced MMPs activity. LPA2 and LPA3 play important roles in the process of LPA-induced MMP invasion and metastasis of ovarian carcer cells.

METHODS: Luciferase-related literature was retrieved in PubMed and cnki from 1996. 1 to 2007. 12. Key words were reporter gene and luciferase, and 617 articals were got together. The included criteria: 1) Luciferase biological characteristics. 2) Luciferase application as reporter gene. Fifty-five papers were further studied, and of which references were looked for. Finally 19 documents were reviewed. RESULTS: Luciferases are enzymes that emit light in the presence of oxygen and a substrate (luciferin), and which are highly specific and have high sensitivity, and in the absence of excitation light, they have non-specific interference, so the signal-noise ratio is high. They have irreplaceable advantages to other reporter genes. They have been widely used for real-time, low-light imaging of gene expression in cell cultures, individual cells, whole organisms, and transgenic organisms. It is a very practical research method. CONCLUSION: Luciferase as a reporter gene has shown good prospects, it has yet become an important tool in the scientific research fields, and has promoted the genetic engineering research in particular.

Methods: Human B lymphoma cells were detected for expression of Syk gene by RT-PCR. Methylation specific PCR was used to detect methylation of Syk promoter region. The proliferation activities of cells were measured by a MTT assay. The cell cycle progression and apoptosis induced by 5-aza-CDR on Raji and Ramos cells were determined by flow cytometry, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Results: The expression of Syk mRNA was detected in Raji cells, but abscent in Ramos cells. No methylation in the Syk gene promoter was found in Raji and Ramos cells. The proliferations of Raji and Ramos were markedly inhibited by 5-aza-CDR in both of dose and time-dependant manner, P<0.05. The apoptosis rates of Raji and Ramos cells were significantly high in the group treated with 5-aza-CDR, P<0.05. The agarose gel electrophoresis showed that there was a clear "DNA ladder" and ultramicrostructure changes of apoptosis, but the cell cycles of Raji and Ramos cells were not obviously altered, P>0.05. Conclusions: There is no significant correlation between the silencing of Syk gene and gene methylation in Raji and Ramos cells. 5-aza-CDR could obviously inhibit the proliferation and augment apoptosis, but not alter the cell cycle.

77954908057	Correlation of polymorphisms in the promoter region of transforming growth factor β1 with the risk of developing gastric cardia adenocarcinoma	Objective: To investigate the possible association of C-509T, G-800A, and C-988A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the promoter region of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) gene with the susceptibility to gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) in a population of Northern China. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction amplification refractory mutation system (PCR-ARMS) analysis were used to detect the distribution of SNPs of C-509T, G-800A and C-988A in 214 GCA patients and 298 healthy controls, respectively. The level of TGF-β1 was measured using ELISA and the protein expression of TGF-β1 in tumor tissues and corresponding normal tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry method. Results: The overall genotype and allelotype distributions of C-509T polymorphism of TGF-β1 gene in GCA patients were significantly different from those in healthy controls (P<0.05). The subjects with T allelotype had significantly increased risk of developing GCA compared with those with C allelotype carriers [after adjustment for gender, age, and family history of upper digestive tract tumor, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-2.06]. Compared with CC genotype, the subjects with CT and TT genotypes had significantly increased risk of developing GCA (adjusted OR = 1.84 and 2.02, respectively; 95% CI = 1.30-2.37 and 1.37-2.59, respectively). The genotype and allelotype distributions of G-800A and C-988A polymorphism of TGF-β1 were not significantly different between GCA patients and healthy controls (P>0.05). The serum level of TGF-β1 was significantly higher in GCA patients than that in healthy controls (P<0.01) and it was significantly higher in C-509T T allelotype carriers than non C-509T carriers (P<0.05). The protein expression of TGF-β1 in GCA tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (65.5% vs 15.5%, P<0.01) and it was higher in C-509T T allelotype carriers than non C-509T carriers (P<0.05). Conclusion: T allelotype of C-509T in the promoter region of TGF-β1 may be one of the genetic predisposition genes for developing GCA in Northern China and T allelotype carriers may have increased risk of developing GCA by stimulating the over-expression of TGF-β1.

77956508697	Helicobacter pylori infection may be implicated in the topography and geographic variation of upper gastrointestinal cancers in the Taihang Mountain high-risk region in Northern China	Backgrounds: Helicobacter pylori infection is prevalent in China. Chronic infection of the bacterial not only causes distal stomach cancer, but also confers risk to gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. Because H. pylori infection is inversely associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma, globally the infection rate is significantly correlated with the ratio of squamous carcinoma to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. These agree with the topography of upper gastrointestinal cancer observed in the Taihang Mountain high-risk region where both gastric cardia and non-cardia adenocarcinoma coincide with esophageal squamous cancer, but with almost no distal esophageal adenocarcinoma. Moreover, as altitude increases from plain to mountains, we observed progressively increasing incidence rates of gastric adenocarcinomas in recent years in the region. Because H. pylori infection is a definite carcinogen to gastric adenocarcinoma and is more prevalent in the mountain than in plain areas due to undeveloped living conditions, the observation gives the impression as though H. pylori infection is implicated. Aims: This article aims to note the role of H. pylori infection in upper gastrointestinal cancer in the Taihang Mountain high-risk region in northern China. Materials and Methods: First the unique topography and geographic variation of upper gastrointestinal cancer in the region is described to indicate a possible role of H. pylori infection, then we review studies on prevalence of H. pylori infection in the high-risk region and describe difference in socioeconomic development and water hygiene between the plains and the mountains as related to the prevalence of H. pylori infection. Results: Coincidence of gastric cancer in the region and a progressively increasing rate of the cancer from the plain towards the mountains indicate H. pylori infection may be implicated in upper gastrointestinal cancer. Conclusion: International collaboration is needed to study H. pylori and upper gastrointestinal cancer in the region when rapid industrialization is just beginning. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

77957339300	Influence of transfection of CD40L gene on cell proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells	Objective: CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction plays an essential role in cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response. However, the role of CD40L in mouse colon cancer gene therapy is not clear. We aimed to investigate the impacts of CD40L gene on the biological features such as proliferation and invasion capabilities of colon26 cells and discuss the feasibility of using CD40L as a molecular target for colon cancer gene therapy. Methods: The pMKITneo-CD40L plasmids were transfected into mouse colon26 cells mediated by LipofactamineTM2000. The mRNA transcription of CD40L was analyzed by RT-PCR. Western blot and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to detect the CD40L protein expression. MTS method was used to determine the effect of CD40L gene transfection on cell growth: the phenotype of CD40L cells was assessed using flow cytometry; the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR; the invasion of cells was detected with Transwell chamber invasive assay. Results: RT-PCR indicated that the level of CD40L mRNA expression was (1.09 ± 0.12) after transfection with CD40L gene, which was increased by 59.21% and 58.33% compared with the cells transfected with empty vector (0.69 ± 0.08) and the non-transfection group (0.69 ± 0.11, P < 0.05). The level of MMP-2 mRNA was significantly decreased in colon26/CD40L cells. MTS showed that there was no significant difference in the growth speed between colon26/CD40L cells and parent colon26 cells. The expression levels of CD80 and CD86 were higher in colon26/CD40L cells than those on parent cells. The result of Transwell assays suggested that the invasion ability of colon 26/CD40L cells decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The immunogenicity of colon26/CD40L cells are enhanced and the invasion capability is decreased. The malignant phenotype of colon26 cells is inhibited after CD40L gene transfection.

77956895711	A positive family history of esophageal/gastric cardia cancer with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is associated with a younger age at onset and more likely with another synchronous esophageal/gastric cardia cancer in a Chinese high-risk area	Background: To find a genetic component in gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (GCA). Methods: Age at onset (AO) and rate of another synchronous primary upper gastrointestinal carcinoma (RASPUGIC) were compared among the three GCA groups with positive (N = 766), negative (N = 2167), and missing family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer (FHUGIC) (N = 198). These 3131 GCAs were diagnosed on 3128 primary GCA patients of a consecutive surgical cohort treated from 1973 through 1994 at the Department of Thoracic Surgery in the 4th Hospital of Hebei Medical University in a high-risk region in northern China. Results: Overall, GCAs of positive FHUGIC showed a significantly younger AO and a significantly higher RASPUGIC than the negative group (54.68 ± 7.35 vs 55.94 ± 7.47 years old, Pt-test = 0.000; 3.1% vs 1.3%, χ2 = 11.02, P = 0.001). The difference in AO and RASPUGIC between the positive and the negative FHUGIC GCAs is significant or nearly significant in most subgroups; minimizing the possibility of a false association due to bias or confounding (e.g. significant stage-specific differences in AO between familial and sporadic GCAs observed in the subgroup of T2,3N0M0 (P = 0.000) and T2,3,4N1M0 (P = 0.03) exclude the possibility of ascertainment bias towards an earlier diagnosis in familial cases), and the association between FHUGIC and RASPUGIC is statistically significant for GCAs of younger AO (<55 yr old, RASPUGIC 3.8% vs 1.6% vs 1.1% for the positive, negative and missing FHUGIC GCAs respectively, χ2 = 6.50, P = 0.04), but not significant for the later onset GCAs (≥55 yr old, RASPUGIC 2.5%, 1.1%, 1.9% for the positive, negative and missing FHUGIC respectively, χ2 = 4.22, P = 0.12). Conclusion: These findings suggest a genetic component in GCA in the Chinese high-risk region, and genetic predisposition may determine the age at onset and number of primary upper gastrointestinal cancer. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods: Co-immunoprecipitation experiment was used to examine the interaction between Plk3 and P73. Immunofluorescence was used to examine the localization of Plk3 and P73 in cells. Different deletion mutants of GST-P73 fusion protein were prepared. A site-mutation plasmid of GST-P73 (1-130) was constructed by converting threonine86 to alanine86 (T86A) and was named GST-P73 (1-130) (T86A). The phosphorylated domains and sites of P73 by Plk3 were determined by in vitro phosphorylation assay. The effect of Plk3 on P73-mediated apoptosis of HeLa cells was examined by cleaved PARP detection. Results: Plk3 could interact with P73; Plk3 and P73 co-located in the cell nuclei. Different deletion mutants of GST-P73 fusion protein were successfully prepared, and Plk3 phosphorylated P73 at N-terminal 63-113 amino residues. Point mutation (T86A) of GST-P73 (1-130) fusion protein could not influence the phosphorylation status of P73 by Plk3. Furthermore, Plk3 inhibited P73-mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells. Conclusion: Plk3 can interact with and phosphorylate P73 at N-terminal 63-113 amino residues (but not at the 86 threonine), thereby inhibiting P73-mediated apoptosis of HeLa cells.

78049379495	Promoter methylation of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta receptor type II gene and the expression of TGF-β1 in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma: A correlation analysis	Objective: To investigate the promoter methylation status of transforming growth factor beta receptor type 2 gene (TGFBR2) in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and its correlation with TGF-β1 protein expression. Methods: The methylation-specific PCR (MSP), RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry methods were used to examine the methylation status of the 5′-CpG island, mRNA transcription, and protein expression of TGFBR2 in GCA tissues and adjacent normal tissues, respectively. Immunohistochemistry method was used to detect the protein expression of TGF-β1 in tumors and corresponding normal tissues. Results: TGFBR2 gene was methylated in 52/110 (47.3%) tumor specimens, which was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (P < 0.01). The methylation frequencies of TGFBR2 in stages III and IV tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in stages I and II tumor tissues (P < 0.05) and the methylation frequencies in the high, moderate, and low differentiation groups were significantly different (P < 0.05). TGFBR2 mRNA and protein expressions in tumor tissues were significantly lower than those in corresponding normal tissues and were correlated with its methylation status (P < 0.01). The positive immunostaining of TGF-β1 was greatly increased (65.5%, 72/110) in GCA tissues, which was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (P < 0.01). The positive protein expression of TGF-β1 was significantly increased with the increase in the GCA stage and decrease in GCA differentiation (P < 0.05). The protein expression of TGFBR2 was inversely correlated with TGF-β1 expression in GCA (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Promoter hypermethylation of TGFBR2 and the over expression of TGF-β1 protein may play important roles in the initiation and progression of GCA. Gene silencing induced by promoter hypermethylation of TGFBR2 may be one of the mechanisms for the initiation of GCA.

78449260394	CD40L-expressing mouse colon cancer colon26 vaccine enhances DC activities	Objective: To explore the in vitro and in vivo effects of CD40L-expressing murine colon cancer colon26 vaccine on activities of dendritic cells (DCs). Methods: The CD40L gene was transfected into colon26 cells using lipofactamine method, and the stable colon26/CD40L transfectants were obtained. Colon26/CD40L cells were co-cultured with DCs, and the phenotype of DCs was examined by flow cytometry; the expressions of cytokine genes such as IL-12, IL-23, IL-18 and IFN-γ were examined by RT-PCR; and the IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-γ levels in co-cultured supernatants were measured by ELISA. Tumor-bearing BALB/c mouse model was prepared by subcutaneous injection of colon26 cells, and treated with DCs impulsed with colon26/CD40L vaccine. IL-12, IL-23, IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β levels in mouse peripheral blood were detected by ELISA; and the histopathological changes of the liver, spleen and tumor tissues were observed by H-E staining. Results: Colon26 cells stably expressing CD40L (colon26/CD40L vaccine) were successfully obtained. DCs, when co-cultured with colon26/CD40L vaccine, had up-regulated expressions of co-stimulatory molecules, including CD80, CD86, MHC I and MHC (II (P < 0.01). The expressions of IL-12, IL-23, IL-18 and IFN-γ mRNA genes were only detected in DC-colon26/CD40L system, not in other co-cultured systems. And the DC-colon26/CD40L co-cultured system showed higher IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-γ levels (P < 0.01). Compared with mice treated with colon26/CD40L or DCs, mice treated with DCs-colon26/CD40L had smaller tumor volumes and lower weights (P < 0.05), increased IL-12, IL-23, and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood (P < 0.01), decreased IL-10 and TGF-β levels (P < 0.01), and better histopathological changes of tumor tissues. Conclusion: CD40L-expressing colon cancer cells can promote the maturation, induce the cytokine secretion, and enhance the activities of DCs in vitro and in vivo.

78449278461	CD10-bearing fibroblast inhibits matrigel invasive potency of interleukin-1α-producing squamous cell carcinoma by diminishing substance P levels in the tumor microenvironment	CD10 is a neutral endopeptidase, which cleaves various peptide substrates including substance P. CD10 expression has been detected in peritumoral fibroblasts (Fb) within the invasive area of various cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, the biological significance of CD10-bearing Fb remains largely unknown. We examined dynamic interactions of Fb with tumorigenic A431 SCC cells or non-tumorigenic HaCaT squamous cells. The SCC and HaCaT cells did not synthesize CD10, while Fb constitutively expressed CD10. When co-cultured, SCC markedly upregulated fibroblastic CD10 expression compared with HaCaT, which was mainly attributable to SCC-derived interleukin-1α (IL-1α). Both SCC and Fb autonomously secreted substance P, which eventually enhanced the invasive capacity of SCC in a matrigel invasion assay by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-2, but not MMP-9. Transfection of siRNA for CD10 successfully knocked down the CD10 expression in Fb (CD10ND-Fb). In the presence of CD10ND-Fb, substance P levels in supernatants as well as MMP production and the invasive potency of SCC were significantly augmented compared with control scramble RNA-transfected Fb. We also transfected CD10 vector to Fb and found that the matrigel invasive ability of SCC cells was downregulated co-cultured with CD10 vector-transfected Fb rather than empty vector-transfected Fb. In conclusion, the CD10-bearing Fb generated by SCC-derived IL-1 inhibited the invasive capacity of SCC by diminishing the microenvironmental concentration of substance P.

78650873383	Triterpenes compound extracted from cortex periplocae inhibits tumorigenesis of esophageal cancer Eca109 cells in nude mice and related mechanisms	Objective: To investigate the inhibitory effect of triterpenes compound extracted from cortex periplocae (TCPP) on tumorigenesis of luciferase-marked Eca109 cells (Eca109, human esophageal cancer cell line; Eca109-luc) in nude mice and the related mechanisms. Methods: Eca109-luc-implanted tumor model was prepared by subcutaneously injecting Eca109-luc cells into nude mice. After treated with TCPP, the volume and weight of transplanted tumors in nude mice were measured, and tumor growth was monitored with in vivo imaging system. Morphology of transplanted tumor tissues was observed by H-E staining; apoptosis of transplanted tumor cells was analyzed by flow cytometry; and survivin expression in transplanted tumor tissues was examined by Western blotting analysis. Results: The growth of implanted tumor in nude mice was markedly inhibited by TCPP, and the volume and weight of tumors were significantly decreased, with the inhibitory rate being 40.7%. TCPP treatment induced inflammatory cell infiltration and necrosis of tumor cells in implanted tumor tissues, and the apoptosis rate of tumor cells was significantly higher than that in soybean oil control group (P < 0.05). Expression level of survivin protein in implanted tumors was significantly lower in TCPP-treated group than that in control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: TCPP can inhibit proliferation of human esophageal cancer Eca109 cells in vivo, which might be associated with the down-regulation of survivin and apoptosis of tumor cells.

78650893871	IL-27 promotes apoptosis of human pancreatic carcinoma Aspc1 cells	Objective: To investigate the effect IL-27 on apoptosis of human pancreatic carcinoma Aspc1 cells and its in vivo anti-tumor activity. Methods: PA317/IL-27 retrovirus vector was transfected into Aspc1 cells and the stable clones (Aspc1/IL-27) were obtained by selecting with G418. The effects of IL-27 on production of IL-27, proliferation, and MHC- I expression of Aspc1 cells were determined by ELISA, cell counting and flow cytometry, respectively. Aspc1/IL-27, Aspc1/LXSN (Aspc1 cells stably transfected with empty vector) and Aspc1 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and the growth of transplanted tumors and survival time of mice were observed. Apoptosis and ultramicrostructure of the implanted-tumor cells were examined by TUNEL and electron microscope respectively. Results: Aspc1 cells stably transfected with PA317/IL-27 (Aspc1/IL-27) were successfully prepared. Aspc1/IL-27 cells secreted high levels of IL-27, while Aspc1/IL-27 and Aspc1 cells did not secreted IL-27 (P <0.01). Aspc1/IL-27 transfection did not affect the expression of MHC- I on Aspcl cells (P > 0.05). The growth of implanted-tumors was significantly slower and the survival time was longer in Aspc1/IL-27 group than those in Aspc1/LXSN and Aspc1 groups (P < 0.05). Apoptosis rate of implanted-tumor cells in Aspc1/IL-27 cells was significantly higher than those in Aspc1/LXSN and Aspc1 groups ([19.5 ± 2.4]%, [8.5 ± 0.3]%, [9.1 ± 0.8]%, P < 0.01). Conclusion: IL-27 gene transfection exerts in vivo anti-tumor activity by inducing apoptosis of human pancreatic carcinoma cells.

78650679889	Cathepsin K-upregulation in fibroblasts promotes matrigel invasive ability of squamous cell carcinoma cells via tumor-derived IL-1α	Background: Cathepsin K (CTSK), a cysteine protease with strong collagenolytic properties, is involved in extracellular matrix turnover. In the previous studies, CTSK expression was detected in peritumoral fibroblasts (Fbs) around squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but not in those surrounding benign epidermal tumors. However, the mechanism governing CTSK expression in epidermal tumors remains unclear. Objective: To study the regulatory mechanisms of fibroblastic CTSK expression in the SCC-stromal interaction. Methods: We examined dynamic interactions of Fbs with tumorigenic SCC cells (A431 and A253) or normal human keratinocytes. Results: SCC cells and normal keratinocytes did not synthesize CTSK, while Fbs constitutively expressed CTSK. When cocultured, SCC cells upregulated fibroblastic CTSK expression more potently than did normal keratinocytes, which was mainly attributable to SCC-derived IL-1α. Coculturing Fbs with SCC cells significantly augmented the matrigel invasive ability of SCC cells, which was downregulated when cocultured with CTSK knockdown Fbs or in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-1α antibody. Conclusion: The CTSK-upregulated Fbs generated by SCC-derived IL-1α may play a crucial role in the progression and invasion of SCC. © 2010 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

78751700772	Effects of ethanol extract of cochinchina momordica seed on invasion and metastasis of mouse melanoma B16 cells in vitro and in vivo	Objective: To investigate the effects of ethanol extract of cochinchina momordica seed (CMSEE) on the invasion and metastasis of melanoma B16 cells in vitro and in vivo, as well as its probable mechanism. Methods: Effects of CMSEE (20, 25 and 30 μg/mL) on the invasion and metastasis of B16 cells were detected by scratch assay and Transwell assay. The transcriptional levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 and MMP-2 in B16 cells treated with different doses of CMSEE (20, 25 and 30 μg/mL) for various times (0, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h) were detected by RT-PCR. Expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 proteins in B16 cells treated with CMSEE were analyzed by Western blotting. The B16-implanted mouse model was established, and the metastasis and invasion of B16-implanted tumors were observed after treatment with CMSEE. Results: After treatment by 20-30 μg/mL CMSEE, the diameters of scratch became broader than the control group (P <0.05), and B16 cells through the Transwell chambers were decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner (P <0.05). CMSEE could down-regulate the expression levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 mRNAs and proteins in a dose-dependent manner. Expressions of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 proteins in B16 cells treated with CMSEE did not changed. CMSEE effectively inhibited the metastasis and invasion of B16-implanted tumors in the mice. Conclusion: CMSEE could inhibit the invasion and metastasis of melanoma B16 cells in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanism may be related with down-regulating the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNAs and proteins.

79953229606	Inhibitory effects of manumycin combined with cisplatin on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cell line 3AO in vitro and in vivo	Objective: To investigate the inhibition effects of manumycin combined with cisplatin (DDP) on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cell line 3AO and the growth of transplantation tumors in nude mice, and to analyze its possible mechanisms. Methods: MTT colorimetric assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of manumycin combined with DDP on 3AO cells. The model of nude mice bearing ovarian transplantation tumor was established. The expressions of survivin, NF-κB, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and caspase-3 proteins were detected by immunohistochemical method. The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate were examined by flow cytometry. Results: The proliferation of 3AO cells was inhibited by manumycin in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P <0.05). The manumycin of 10, 20, 40 or 60 μmol/L could strengthen the cytotoxic effect of DDP on 3AO cells. The tumor size in nude mice of each drug-treated group was significantly smaller than that of the control (untreated) group (P <0.05). Compared with the DDP alone and the manumycin alone group, the expressions of survivin, NF-κB and VEGF proteins were significantly down-regulated while the expression of caspase-3 protein was significantly up-regulated (P <0.05) in the combination (manumycin plus DDP) group (P <0.05). The apoptosis rates were increased gradually in the control group, manumycin group, DDP group and the combination group. In each drug-treated group, the number of cells in G

Methods: Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and PCR analyses were used to detect the genotype of TGFBR1 Int7G24A (intron 7) and *6A (exon 1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 468 GCA patients and 584 healthy controls. The expression levels of TGFBR1 protein in surgically resected tumor tissues and corresponding carcinoma adjacent normal tissues in 110 patients with GCA were detected by immunohistochemistry method, and the relationship between the expression of TGFBR1 protein and the genotype was analyzed. Results: The distributions of genotype and allelotype frequencies of TGFBR1 Int7G24A polymorphism in GCA patients were significantly different from those in the healthy controls (P<0.05). The risk of GCA in patients with A allelotype was increased 1.34 folds as the patients with G allelotype [adjusting for age, gender and family history of upper gastrointestinal diseases, odds ratio (OR) =1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.03-1.87]. Compared with GG genotype, the AA genotype significantly elevated the risk of GCA (adjusted OR =2.17, 95% CI =1.15-3.72). Compared with GG genotype, GA or AA genotype carriers had a higher risk of stage III and IV GCA (adjusted OR=1.41, 95% CI=1.05-1.98). The genotype and allelotype distributions of TGFBR1 *6A polymorphism in GCA patients were not significantly different from those in the healthy controls (P>0.05). The positive-expression rate of TGFBR1 protein in GCA tissues (27.3%) was significantly lower than that in the adjacent normal tissues (100%) (P<0.01). However, the TGFBR1 protein expression was not associated with the genotypes of TGFBR1 Int7G24A and *6A (P>0.05). Conclusion: A allelotype of TGFBR1 Int7G24A may be one of the factors that affect the risk of developing GCA in Northern China. Copyright@2009-2010 Tumor All rights reserved.

This study was to investigate the association between the NF- kappaB (κB) pathway and the apoptosis of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB- 231 induced by celecoxib. Methods: The expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell proliferation and cell cycle were detected by MTT and flow cytometry (FCM), respectively. The protein expressions of caspase- 3 and p65 in MDA-MB-231 cells were detected by western blot. Results: After incubation with different concentrations of celecoxib for 48 h, COX-2 mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with untreated cells (P<0.05). Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced drastically in a dose- and time-dependent manner after celecoxib treatment (P<0.05).

79955798948	Correlation of hypermethylation of TSP1 gene with TGF-β1 level and T cell immunity in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma	Background and Objective: Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is an inhibitor of angiogenesis and its promoter hypermethylation has been found resulting in gene silencing in some primary human carcinomas. This study was to investigate the promoter methylation of TSP1 and its correlation with TGF-β1 level and T cell immunity in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA). Methods: Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) approach and immunohistochemistry method were used to examine the methylation status of the 5' CpG island and expression of TSP1 protein, respectively. The level of TGF-β1 was measured by ELISA and T cell immunity of GCA by flow cytometry analysis. Results: TSP1 methylation frequency was significantly higher in tumor specimens than in the corresponding normal tissues (35.4% vs. 3.1%, P<0.001) and slgniflcanty higher In Stages III and IV tumor tissues than In Stages I and II tumor tissues (P<0.05). TSP1 protein expression was significantly lower in the tumor tissues than in the corresponding normal tissues (P<0.05) and statistically correlated with its methylation status (P<0.01). The total level of TGF-β1 was significanty higher in the GCA patients than in the healthy controls (P<0.05) and slgnificanty higher In Stages III and IV GCA patients than in Stages I and II GCA patients (P<0.05). The level of active TGF-β1 was significanty higher in the GCA patients with hypermethylation of TSP1 than in the GCA patients without methylation of TSP1 (P<0.05), but there was no statistical difference (P>0.05). The function of T cell immunity was significantly different between the GCA patients with hypermethylation of TSP1 and those without methylation of TSP1 (P<0.05). Conclusions: Promoter hypermethylation of TSP1 may play an important role in the development of GCA and reflect the biological behaviours of GCA.

79956286459	Polymorphisms of transforming growth factor-β1 associated with increased risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in north China	Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) is a multifunctional cytokine that has been implicated in the oncogenesis and tumour progression. However, the association of TGF-β1 polymorphism with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible association of the polymorphisms of TGF-β1 with susceptibility to GCA in a population of north China. A case-control analysis was performed to assess the association of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TGF-β1 and GCA risk. The genotype and allele distributions of TGF-β1 G-800A, C-988A, G915C and C788T in GCA patients were not significantly different from that in healthy controls (P>0.05). The -509T and 869C allele significantly elevated the risk of developing GCA (adjusted OR=1.45 and 1.41; 95% CI=1.04-2.10 and 1.07-2.08, respectively). The CT and TT genotype of C-509T and the TC and CC genotype of T869C significantly elevated the risk of developing GCA. When stratified by tumour stage, the -509T and 869C allele carriers had an increased risk of TNM stage III+IV GCA as compared with noncarriers. The C-509T and T869C SNP are in a strong linkage disequilibrium (D'=0.94). Compared with C/T haplotype, T/C haplotype significantly increased the risk of developing GCA. The TGF-β1 level and expression were higher in GCA patients with -509T or 869C allele than in those without T or C allele (P<0.05). GCA patients with -509TT and 869CC genotype had higher apoptotic tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in their cancer tissues than those with -509CC and 869TT genotype. In all, TGF-β1 C-509T and T869C polymorphisms may be associated with an increased risk of GCA in north China. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

0036142697	Activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 - A potential marker of prognosis for epithelial ovarian cancer	Objectives and methods. To investigate the relationship between the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and clinical characteristics in patients with epithelial ovarian tumors, we examined the expression of MMP-2 in 26 epithelial benign ovarian tumors (EBOT) and 41 epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOC) using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. We also analyzed pro-MMP-2 and activated MMP-2 in epithelial ovarian tumors using Western blot. Results. The expression levels of MMP-2 mRNA and overall protein were higher in EOC than in EBOT, but the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). MMP-2 mRNA and immunoreactive protein for MMP-2 were not significantly associated with clinicopathological features in EOC. The positive percentages of the active form of MMP-2 were 71% in EOC and 42% in EBOT, respectively (P < 0.05). The positive percentage of the active form of MMP-2 in stage III and IV EOC was significantly higher (81%) than that (33%) in stage I and II EOC (P = 0.01). The expression of activated MMP-2 was significantly related to disease progression in EOC (P = 0.02). The percentages of active MMP-2 in positive immunoreaction tumor cells and fibroblasts were, respectively, 96 and 89%. The difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.54). The positive and negative predictive values of active MMP-2 for disease progression were 65 (19/29) and 75% (9/12), respectively, and the accuracy was 68% (28/41). Conclusion. MMP-2 generally appears in epithelial ovarian tumors and there is a tendency to express more MMP-2, and especially activated MMP-2, in EOC. MMP-2 mRNA and pro-MMP-2 are not associated with the clinicopathological features in patients with EOC. There was a significant relationship between activated MMP-2 and invasiveness, metastasis, and disease progression in EOC and activated MMP-2 is a potential marker of prognosis. © 2002 Elsevier Science.

0035732446	Suppression of macrophage interleukin-12 and tumour necrosis factor-α production in mice infected with Toxocara canis	Toxocara canis induces a predominantly Th2 type response with enhanced amounts of interleukin (IL)-4 and reduced amounts of interferon (IFN)-γ in infected mice. In this study, we investigated the macrophage function of T. canis-infected mice from the standpoint of cytokine production. C3H/HeN mice were infected with T. canis by oral administration of embryonated eggs. Ten days after infection, macrophages were obtained from spleen and peritoneal cavity, were cultured with lipopolysaccharide, and cytokines in the culture supernatant were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Macrophages from T. canis-infected mice produced IL-1 and IL-6 equivalent to macrophages from normal mice. The production of IL-10 and tumour growth factor (TGF)-β was enhanced, but IL-12 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α production was diminished. The addition of IFN-γ, anti-IL10 antibody, anti-TGF-β antibody or indomethacin did not restore the production of IL-12 and TNF-α by macrophages from T. canis-infected mice. Furthermore, the stimulation of normal macrophages with T. canis antigen in vitro induced IL-1α, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β, but not IL-12 and TNF-α. These results indicate that cytokine producing pattern of macrophages is altered by T. canis-infection, and this altered macrophage function may play an important role in the modification of the immune response to T. canis.

79958722358	Clustering and geographic variation of upper gastrointestinal cancers in a high-risk region of esophageal cancer in Northern China	Aim: Geographic variation of upper gastrointestinal carcinomas (UGIC) was assessed in a high-risk region in northern China. Methods: Shexian, Linzhou, Yangcheng and Cixian are four counties with world agestandardized incidence rates (ASR) of esophageal cancer as high as 124.9, 99.5, 160.1, and 164.9 per 100,000 respectively for males, and 70.8, 68.8, 92.1, and 104.6 for females for 1998 to 2002. Geographically, Shexian is entirely mountainous, Linzhou and Yangcheng are mostly mountainous, and Cixian is one-third mountains, onethird hills, and the other third plains. The corresponding populations is 382,000, 982,000, 395,000 and 625,000 as in 2000. In the present analyses, the world ASRs of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG), gastric non-cardia carcinoma (GNCC), and the percentages of these in overall tumor ASRs for 1998 to 2002 were compared across the four counties to show geographic variation and clustering. Additionally, site-specific detection rates of precursors and cancers in our population-based endoscope surveys with local 40- to 69-year-old residents were also compared between a Cixian commune (2,013 surveyed) and a Shexian commune (1,514). Results: ASRs for ESCC, AEG, and GNCC combined amount to 210.5 to 325.8 per 100,000 in men and 117.5 to 185.7 in women, accounting for respectively 70.6 to 82.1% and 53.4 to 77.0 % of the all ASRs. In geographic distribution, the percentages of AEG and GNCC in UGICs increased from Cixian (males 32.8%, females 22.1%) to Yangcheng (50.7%, 38.6%) and Linzhou (52.7%, 41.4%), and further to Shexian (61.7%, 61.9); while that of ESCC decreased in the same direction from Cixian, to Yangcheng and Linzhou, and further to Shexian (67.2%, 77.9%; 49.3%, 61.4% and 47.3%, 58.6%; to 38.3%, 38.1%). Similarly, the detection rates of low- and high-grade intraepithelia neoplasia as well as cancers of the esophagus were significantly higher in the Cixian commune than the Shexian commune (8.7, 4.4, 0.7% vs 7.0, 3.2, 0.4% P=0.004); but the rates for the esophagogastric junction were systematically and significantly lower in the Cixian than in the Shexian commune (2.2, 0.5, 0.8 % Vs 3.3, 0.9, 1.7 %, P=0.001). Conclusions: Clustering of upper gastrointestinal carcinomas may suggest the existence of common risk factors, while geographic variation in topography/histology may be related to regional differences in carcinogen exposure. These observations identify a need for environment improvement, such as programs to improve drinking water conditions. To study high susceptibility in a historically low mobile population, international collaborative research in this region may prove to be very fruitful.

79959708884	B7-H4 expression associates with cancer progression and predicts patient's survival in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	A retrospective cohort study including 112 patients suffering from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was performed to investigate the expression of B7-H4 in ESCC and determine its association with patient's clinicopathological parameters and survival. Expression levels of B7-H4 on tumor cells and densities of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the surgical specimens of ESCC tissues were characterized using immunohistochemical assays. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of B7-H4 expression levels and densities of TILs in tumor sections. Positive B7-H4 immunostaining was observed in 107 of 112 (95.5%) of ESCC tissue sections. We further divided all patients into two major subgroups, a lower B7-H4 expression group with 46 patients and a higher B7-H4 expression group with 66 patients. We found that expression levels of B7-H4 on tumor cells were significantly correlated with patient's gender (P = 0.0288), distant metastasis (P = 0.0500), and TNM stage (P = 0.0258). Moreover, tumor cell B7-H4 expression was inversely correlated with densities of CD3

79961119989	In vitro study on anti-esophageal cancer immunity induced by antigen-sensitized and interleukin 27 gene-modified dendritic cells	Objective: To investigate the anti-esophageal cancer immunity induced by antigen-sensitized and interleukin 27 (IL -27) gene-modified dendritic cells (DCs). Methods: DCs isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with esophageal cancer were modified by recombinant retrovirus-mediated IL -27 gene, and then sensitized by the cleaved products from esophageal carcinoma Eca109 cells by using repeated freezing-thawing method. The secretion levels of IL-27, IL-12 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in culture supernatant of DCs and the level of IFN-γ in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were examined by ELISA method. The expression levels of CD1a, CD83, CD80 and CD86 molecules on DCs surface were measured by FCM. The proliferative activity of T lymphocytes and the killing efficacy of CTLs against Eca109 cells induced by DCs were evaluated by MTT method. Results: After being modified by IL -27 gene and sensitized by tumor antigen, the secretion levels of IL-12[(107.85±7.20) ng/L], IL-27[(430.39±10.12) ng/L] and IFN-γ[(411.97±17.80) ng/L] of DCs were increased, and the expressions of CD83[(82.67±7.92)%], CD80[(78.33±7.31)%] and CD86[(85.33±4.32)%] molecules were also elevated. Meanwhile, the proliferation capacity of autologous T lymphocytes was enhanced after stimulation by DCs, and the secretion level of IFN-γ[(751.50±31.30) ng/L] in the culture supernatant of DCs was increased. The DCs modified by IL -27 gene and sensitized by tumor antigen could significantly induce the strongest cytotoxicity of antigen-specific CTLs against Eca109 cells (P<0.01). Conclusion: IL -27 gene modification enhances the capacity of DCs in inducing autologous T lymphocytes to generate specific antitumor immunity against esophageal carcinoma. The mechanism of this immune response may be closely relevant to the activation of the second signal for presenting antigen cells such as DCs, the promoted capacity of DCs secreting IL-27 and IL-12, and the activation of T cells resulting in the enhanced capacity of CTLs excreting IFN-γ.

80053003943	CD10 expressed by fibroblasts and melanoma cells degrades endothelin-1 secreted by human keratinocytes	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent multifunctional peptide linked to wound healing, pigmentation, carcinogenesis, and fibrosclerotic processes in the skin. Whereas ET-1 was thought to be digested by receptor-mediated endocytosis, it is also reported to be biochemically degraded by the neutral endopeptidase CD10 using kidney homogenates. Although keratinocytes (KC) and fibroblasts (Fb) are sources of both ET-1 and CD10, respectively, there is no report investigating the direct association betweenCD10expression and its function in relation toET-1 degradation in the skin. CD10 expression in melanoma cells is associated with clinical prognosis, suggesting an important role in the invasive and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. Here, cultured KC produced much higher amounts of ET-1 than did cultured Fb or melanoma cells. In contrast, KC and A375 melanoma cells did not express CD10, while Fb, SK-MEL-28 and G361 melanoma cells constitutively expressed CD10. KC-derived ET-1was down-modulated by both CD10-positive Fb and CD10-positive melanoma cells, and the inhibition was partially reversed under substitution conditions using CD10-knockdown Fb or CD10-knockdown melanoma cells. This indicates that CD10 on cultured Fb and melanoma cells is biochemically active in the degradation or down-modulation of ET-1 secreted from KC. These findings may lead to better understanding of skin homeostasis and of the malignant potential of melanoma.

80053290404	Expression of melanoma antigen-A11 in breast cancer tissues and its promoting effect on the proliferation of breast cancer cells	Objective: To investigate the expression of melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A11 in breast cancer tissues and their corresponding para-cancerous tissues and the effect of MAGE-A11 expression on the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Methods: The expression of MAGE-A11 protein in breast cancer tissues and their corresponding para-cancerous tissues from 60 cases was detected by immunohistochemisty.The relationship between the expression of MAGE-A11 protein and the clinicopathological features was analyzed. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were transfected with pCMV-AC-MAGE-A11-GFP plasmid. The effect of MAGE-A11 expression on the proliferation of breast cancer cells was detected by MTT method and colony formation assay. Results: Of 60 samples of breast cancer tissue, 31 had positive expression of MAGE-A11, and the positive expression rate was 51.7%. The expression of MAGE-A11 protein was negative in 60 samples of para-cancerous tissue. The expression of MAGE-A11 protein was not related to the age, pathological type, histological grade, clinical stage, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor (ER) -α, progestrogen receptor (PR), and amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB-1) in patients with breast cancer (P > 0.05), while the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)/C-erbB2 and ER-β were related to the expression of MAGE-A11 protein (P <0.05). The proliferation rate and the number of colony-forming units of MCF-7 cells were significantly increased after transfection with pCMV-AC-MAGE-A11-GFP plasmid (P <0.05). Conclusion: The expression of MAGE-A11 protein is related to the expressions of C-erbB2 and ER-β in breast cancer tissues. MAGE-A11 may promote the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

80053156121	The flavonoid Baohuoside-I inhibits cell growth and downregulates survivin and cyclin D1 expression in esophageal carcinoma via β-catenin-dependent signaling	Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignancies and is associated with a dismal prognosis. Although treatment options have increased for some patients, overall progress has been modest. Thus, there is a great need to develop new treatments. We found that Baohuoside-I, a flavonoid extracted from a Chinese medicinal plant, exhibits anticancer activity. Here, we demonstrated that Baohuoside-I significantly inhibited Eca109 human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell proliferation and induced Eca109 cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The growth inhibitory effect of Baohuoside-I on the Eca109 tumor cell line was examined by MTT assay; the induction of apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Eca109-luc cells were injected into the subcutaneous tissue of nude mice to establish xenograft tumors. Our results revealed that Baohuoside-I caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth and an induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, Baohuoside-I-treated cells were characterized by decreased expression of the β-catenin gene and protein in the total cell lysates. Thus, the gene and protein expression of the downstream elements survivin and cyclin D1 was downregulated. To determine the precise inhibitory mechanisms involved, further in-depth invivo studies of Baohuoside-I are warranted. Our study provides the first evidence that Baohuoside-I inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting β-catenin-dependent signaling pathways. Thus, Baohuoside-I is a potential candidate in ESCC disease therapy.

80054936234	Cholecystokinin octapeptide exerts its therapeutic effects on collagen-induced arthritis by suppressing both inflammatory and Th17 responses	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), an accepted murine experimental disease model with diverse histopathological features similar to human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CIA was induced in DBA/1J mice by immunization with chicken collagen type II (CII). CCK-8 at different doses was intraperitoneally administered daily for 1 week. Mice treated with CCK-8 at doses of 5 and 10 nmol but not 1 nmol displayed much delayed onset of CIA and significantly lower incidence and decreased severity of arthritis. CCK-8 treatment significantly reduced the production of cytokines (IL-17, IL-23, IL-6 and TNF-α) and chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 in the joints of arthritic mice or in synovial cell culture supernatant, and increased the levels of IFN-γ and TGF-β. T cells from CCK-8 treated mice proliferated much less, produced low level of IL-17 and high levels of IFN-γ and TGF-β. Moreover, CCK-8 treated mice showed lower levels of CII-specific IgG, particularly that of IgG2a, in sera than those from control mice. These results indicate that CCK-8 is effective in suppressing both inflammatory and Th17 responses in CIA. CCK-8 may represent a new therapeutic modality for rheumatoid arthritis. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

80054095759	Effect of baohuoside-I on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway of human esophageal carcinoma cell Eca-109	Objective: To study the effect of baohuoside-I extracted from Periplocae Cortex on proliferation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway of human esophageal carcinoma cell Eca-109. Methods: The expressions of β-catenin, Cyclin D1, and Survivin protein in Eca-109 cells were measured with flow cytometry (FCM). The expressions of β-catenin, Cyclin D1, and Survivin mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. Results: After treatment with 25 and 50 μg/mL of baohuoside-I for 48 h, the expression levels of β-catenin, Cyclin D1, Survivin mRNA, and protein were decreased significantly (P<0.01), but with 12.5 μg/ML of baohuoside-I the expression level was not decreased significantly compared with the control group. Conclusion: Baohuoside-I from Periplocae Cortex could inhibit the proliferation of Eca-109 cells. This effect associais with down-regulation expression of β-catenin, Cyclin D1, Survivin, and their proteins, which affects on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

80055108188	IL-12 family cytokines: Hot key molecules in tumor immunotherapy	Cytokines, which can improve the host immunity and hamper the immune escape of tumor cells, have become an important strategy for tumor biotherapy. Interleukin (IL)-12 cytokine family is composed of heterodimeric cytokines, including IL-12, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-35; they are produced by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells and play critical roles in the differentiation of helper T (Th) cells. IL-12 induces IFN-γ production through activating signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 signaling pathway and enhances cellular immune response; IL-27 augments cellular and humoral immune responses through activating STAT1 pathway; exogenous IL-23 can produce anti-tumor effects, while endogenous IL-23 induces the production of IL-17 by activating STAT3, promoting development and progress of tumors; and IL-35 may be a potential immunosuppressive cytokine. In summary, IL-12 cytokine family plays distinct roles in anti-tumor immune responses and has become a focus of study in the research and immune therapy of tumors.

Methods: Three pairs of miRNAs specifically targeting P65 gene (P65miRNA 1, P65miRNA 2 and P65miRNA 3) were designed and transfected into MDA MB 231 cells, the level of P65 protein was detected by Western blotting, and P65miRNA with best silencing result was selected and used in the following experiments. The adhesive and invasive abilities of MDA MB 231 cells before and after transfection were measured by adhesion assay and Transwell assay, respectively. mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP 2) and MMP 9 were detected by RT PCR and the activities of MMP 2 and MMP 9 were examined by gelatin zymography assay. Results: P65miRNA 1, P65miRNA 2 and P65miRNA 3 plasmids were successfully constructed, P65miRNA 1 and P65miRNA 2, but not P65miRNA 3, tranfection strongly inhibited the expression of P65 protein in MDA MB 231 cells (>80%). The adhesion of MDA MB 231 cells was not significantly influenced by P65miRNA 1 and P65miRNA 2 transfection (P>0.05), while the invasive ability of MDA MB 231 cells was significantly reduced after P65miRNA 1 or P65miRNA 2 transfection (0.371±0.039, 0.309±0.046 vs 0.698±0.065, P<0.05). Besides, mRNA expression of MMP 2 (0.281±0.018, 0.478±0.023 vs 1.056±0.072, 1.128±0.059, P<0.05) and MMP 9 (0.193±0.013, 0.371±0.035 vs 1.206±0.069, 1.089±0.057, P<0.05) and activities of MMP 2 and MMP 9 in MDA MB 231 cells after P65miRNA 1 or P65miRNA 2 transfection were significantly decreased. Conclusion: Targeting silence of P65 expression can inhibit in vitro invasion of TNBC MDA MB 231cells, which is related to the down regulation of MMP 2 and MMP 9 expression and their activities.

80455160129	Cholecystokinin octapeptide significantly suppresses collagen-induced arthritis in mice by inhibiting Th17 polarization primed by dendritic cells	Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) is a neuropeptide, and is shown to be a potent immunomodulator with predominant anti-inflammatory effects. Although the regulatory effect of CCK-8 on macrophages and B cells has been defined, the effect of CCK-8 on dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells is not well understood. In this study, we showed that CCK-8 reduced the expression of CD80, CD86, and MHCII on DCs. Moreover, CCK-8 promoted Th1 and inhibited Th17 polarization by increasing the production of IL-12 and decreasing the production of IL-6 and IL-23 on DCs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of CCK-8 to mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was found to effectively reduce the incidence of arthritis, delay its onset and prevent the occurrence of joint damage. Collectively, these results suggest that CCK-8 significantly suppresses the incidence and severity of CIA in mice, through the inhibition of DC mediated Th17 polarization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

81155152264	Dickkopf-1 is involved in invasive growth of esophageal cancer cells	Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. High levels of DKK1 protein were found in a series of cancers. However, the role of DKK1 in the progression of esophageal carcinoma is not fully understood. In the present study, RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression of DKK1 in esophageal carcinoma tissues, matched adjacent normal esophageal tissues, and esophageal carcinoma cell lines. Our results showed that the expression of DKK1 was upregulated on both mRNA and protein levels in esophageal carcinoma tissues compared with the adjacent normal esophageal tissues, meanwhile, in four esophageal carcinoma cell lines analyzed, expression of DKK1 was detected with different levels. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluoresence revealed that the distribution of DKK1 was mainly in the cytoplasm in both carcinoma tissues and cell lines. To further explore the biological effects of DKK1 on proliferation, cell cycle and invasion capability, we constructed the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-Tab-2b-DKK1 which can effectively overexpress DKK1. Subsequently, we observed that exogenous expression of DKK1 in EC9706 cell line resulted in an increased rate of proliferation, and S stage and G2/M stage ratio whereas G0/G1 ratio was decreased. In order to evaluate the invasion capability Boyden chamber was analyzed which implied that overexpression of DKK1 resulted in an increase in the invasion ability in EC9706 cell line. Taken together, the study indicates that DKK1 might be a key regulator in the progression of esophageal carcinoma and a potential therapeutic target in esophageal carcinoma. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Interestingly, germ cells do not express MHC class I antigen, implying that these gene products should be ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy. The strict tumor-specific expression of MAGE-As has led to several immunotherapeutic trials targeting some of these proteins. In this review, we briefly described the expression and activation mechanism of MAGE-As in cancer. We also summarized the biological functions of MAGE-As in cell progress and the progress of the cancer immunotherapy targeting MAGE-A family. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

83455186354	Association of nitrogen compounds in drinking water with incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Shexian, China	The incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is the eighth most common malignancy worldwide, is highest in China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between nitrogen compounds in drinking water with the incidence of ESCC by geographical spatial analysis. The incidence of ESCC is high in Shexian county, China, and environmental factors, particularly nitrogen-contaminated drinking water, are the main suspected risk factors. This study focuses on three nitrogen compounds in drinking water, namely, nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia, all of which are derived mainly from domestic garbage and agricultural fertilizer. The study surveyed 48 villages in the Shexian area with a total population of 54,716 (661 adults with ESCC and 54,055 non-cancer subjects). Hot-spot analysis was used to identify spatial clusters with a high incidence of ESCC and a high concentration of nitrogen compounds. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect risk factors for ESCC incidence. Most areas with high concentrations of nitrate nitrogen in drinking water had a high incidence of ESCC. Correlation analysis revealed a signiicant positive relationship between nitrate concentration and ESCC (P = 0.01). Logistic regression analysis also conirmed that nitrate nitrogen has a signiicantly higher odds ratio. The results indicate that nitrate nitrogen is associated with ESCC incidence in Shexian county. In conclusion, high concentrations of nitrate nitrogen in drinking water may be a signiicant risk factor for the incidence of ESCC. © 2012 Tohoku University Medical Press.

METHODS: pcDNA3. 1flag-LPA2 and pcDNA3. 1flag-LPA3 were transfected into ovarian cancer cells lines (SKOV3 and 3AO) with lipofectamine reagent. Transfection and expression were confirmed by the means of Western blotting. The effect of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) on MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression and activity in transfected ovarian cells was analyzed by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: High expression of LPA2 and LPA3 protein was analyzed by Western blotting. The gelatin zymography confirmed that LPA- induced the activity and protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 increased significantly in the transfected LPA2 and LPA3 receptors genes cells, compared with that in the control groups and vector groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is confirmed that ovarian carcer cells with high expression of LPA2 and LPA3 genes in vitro have been established. LPA2 and LPA3 are more efficient in LPA-induced MMPs activity. LPA2 and LPA3 play an important role in the process of LPA-induced MMP invasion and metastasis of ovarian carcer cells.

However, the expression pattern of MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A11 in breast cancer patients is still unclear. The purpose of our study is to investigate the expression pattern and prognostic significance of MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A11 in breast cancer patients. Methods: Formalin-fixed and paraYn-embedded tissues and the clinicopathological parameters from 75 primary breast cancer patients were collected. The expressions of MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A11 proteins were immunohistochemically detected, and the association of MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A11 expressions with the clinicopathological parameters and the survival of breast cancer patients were analyzed. Results: The expression rates of MAGE-A10 and MAGEA11 in breast cancer specimens were 73.3 and 52.0%, respectively. MAGE-A11 expression was more frequent in estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast carcinomas compared with ER-negative breast carcinomas (P = 0.004). MAGE-A11 expression was positively associated with HER-2 expression (P = 0.003). Overall survival of patients with MAGE-A11-negative expression was significantly longer than those patients with positive MAGE-A11 expression (P = 0.030), but no difference of overall survival was found between patients with MAGE-A10-negative and -positive expression (P = 0.881). Conclusions: MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A11 are tumorspecific antigens, and MAGE-A11 expression probably is a potential poor prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

Methods: The pooled data from 32 cancer registration areas in China from 2003 to 2007 were collected, and the incidence and mortality rates of bladder cancer were calculated. The international comparison was performed according to the data of GLOBOCAN 2008. Results: The incidence rate of bladder cancer was 6.69/100 000, which were 7.79/100 000 and 2.93/100 000 in urban and rural areas, respectively. The incidence rate of bladder cancer in urban areas was 2.7 folds as high as that in rural areas. The mortality rate of bladder cancer was 2.53/100 000, which were 2.82/100 000 and 1.52/100 000 in urban and rural areas, respectively. The mortality rate of bladder cancer in urban areas was 1.9 folds as high as that in rural areas. The age standardized incidence rate of bladder cancer was increased in four cancer registration areas including Beijing, Shanghai, Qidong and Linzhou between 1988 and 2007. The age standardized incidence rate of bladder cancer in the developed countries was 3 folds as high as that in the developing countries. The incidence rate of bladder cancer in China was higher than that in the developing countries, whereas it was lower than that in the developed countries. Among 184 countries, China ranks 72nd in men and 69th in women by the incidence rate of bladder cancer. Conclusion: The incidence rate of bladder cancer in urban areas is higher than that in rural areas of China, which is also higher in males than in females. It ranks between the developed and the developing countries, but moves in the upward direction. Copyright © 2012 by TUMOR.

84860346238	A polymorphism at the miR-502 binding site in the 3'-untranslated region of the histone methyltransferase SET8 is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma outcome	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can bind to the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of messenger RNAs, where they interfere with translation and thereby regulate cell differentiation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Genetic polymorphisms in the 3'-UTRs targeted by miRNAs alter the strength of miRNA binding in a manner that affects the behavior of individual miRNAs. The histone methyltransferase SET8 has been reported to methylate TP53 and regulate genomic stability. We analyzed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs16917496) within the miR-502 miRNA seed region for the 3'-UTR of SET8 in Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The SET8 CC genotype was independently associated with longer postoperative survival in patients with HCC by multivariate analysis (relative risk, 0.175; 95% CI = 0.053-0.577; p = 0.004). The SET8 CC genotype was associated with reduced SET8 protein levels based on the immunostaining of 51 HCC tissue samples. We also found that the low SET8 levels were associated with longer HCC survival. Our data suggest that SET8 modifies HCC outcome by altering its expression, which depends, at least in part, on its binding affinity with miR-502. The analysis of genetic polymorphisms in miRNA binding sites can help to identify patient subgroups that are at high risk for poor disease outcomes. Copyright © 2011 UICC.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential mechanisms through which CPLA inhibits N-nitrosomethyl- benzylamine (NMBA)-induced rat esophageal tumorigenesis. We treated F344 rats subcutaneously with the esophageal carcinogen NMBA (0.5 mg/kg body weight) and intramuscularly with CPLA (20 mg/kg), 3 times a week for 5 weeks. Rats were then sacrificed at weeks 9, 15 or 25, esophageal tissues were collected and tumor data were recorded. To investigate the mechanisms by which CPLA modulates tumorigenesis in esophagus, we evaluated the protein expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin and the gene expression of c-myc. CPLA significantly (P<0.05) reduced the incidence of esophageal tumors observed at 25 weeks from 93.3% in NMBA-treated controls to 33.3% in the NMBA- and CPLA-treated rats. CPLA reduced β-catenin and c-myc expression, but increased GSK-3β expression, in preneoplastic lesions of the esophagus. These results suggest a novel tumor-suppressive role of CPLA through the activation of GSK-3β expression and the inhibition of β-catenin and c-myc expression. Therefore, CPLA is a potential therapeutic candidate for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

84863056662	Correlation between MTA2 overexpression and tumour progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	The aim of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological outcome and prognostic significance of metastasis-associated gene 2 (MTA2) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Immunohistochemical staining for MTA2 was performed on surgical specimens obtained from 162 patients with ESCC. Relationships between MTA2 expression and clinicopathological factors, including prognosis, were analyzed. Significant correlations were noted among MTA2 overexpression and TNM clinical classification staging, depth of invasion, presence of regional lymph node metastasis, presence of distant metastasis, lymphatic invasion, blood-vessel invasion and the 5-year survival rates. The expression of MTA2 protein was correlated with tumour progression. Patients with MTA2 overexpression tended to have poor prognosis compared to patients with MTA2 underexpression.

84863297929	Effects on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest contribute to the antitumor responses of interleukin-27 mediated by retrovirus in human pancreatic carcinoma cells	Interleukin (IL)-27, composed of p28 and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) subunits, has diverse functions in regulating immune systems. Human melanoma cells have been shown to express both IL-27 receptor subunits, and growth inhibition by IL-27 was detected. We investigated whether forced expression of the p28-linked EBI3 gene in human pancreatic carcinoma cells (AsPC1) by retroviral vector would produce IL-27-mediated antitumor effects and the related mechanisms. The data demonstrated that AsPC1 cells expressed both IL-27 receptor subunits, and tumor growth of AsPC1/IL-27 in mice was retarded compared with vector DNA-transduced tumors and survival of the mice was prolonged. Expression of cytokines such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β in tumor specimens increased, while the secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α from spleen cells of mice bearing IL-27-transfected tumors increased. Moreover, cell cycle arrest was induced in AsPC1/IL-27 inoculated mice with upregulated p21 expression and downregulated survivin expression. The appearance of apoptotic cells increased in tumor specimens of mice bearing IL-27-transfected tumors compared with the mice bearing DNA-transfected tumors by confirming the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and activated apoptotic pathways through detection of cleaved PARP. These results suggest that transfection of the IL-27 gene into human pancreatic carcinoma cells could produce antitumor effects in vivo and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis could be the mechanism of IL-27 action in tumor regression.

84863835408	RNA interference-mediated silencing of Stat5 induces apoptosis and growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells	It has been reported that Stat5 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Inhibition of Stat5 in tumor cell lines has been associated with growth suppression and induction of apoptosis. However, no one of published studies have investigated the expression and role of Stat5 in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we used human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC7721 as a model to demonstrate that Stat5 was highly expressed in these cells. Next we showed that RNAi mediated Stat5 knockdown could inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of SMMC7721 cells in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Stat5 knockdown inhibited the growth and induced the apoptosis of SMMC7721 cells in xenografts in nude mice. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Stat5 plays an important role in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Inhibition of Stat5 by RNAi holds promise to be a novel gene therapy vector for hepatocellular carcinoma.

84864201370	Comparative study on the proportion of familial cancer in esophageal and gastric cardia carcinomas by the site of primary cancer in a high-risk region	Objective: This study aims to compare the proportion of familial carcinomas in esophageal and gastric cardia carcinomas by the site of the primary cancer in a high-risk region. Methods: Data from 7 267 consecutive esophageal and gastric cardia carcinoma patients who underwent surgery between 1970 and 1994 in the Department of Thoracic Surgery of The Fourth Hospital of the Hebei Medical University were collected to analyze changes in median age at diagnosis, family history, sex ratio, and the prevalence of multiple primary cancers (MPC), including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the upper, middle, and lower third of the esophagus, and adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia (gastrocardiac adenocarcinoma, GCA). Results: Patients with a positive family history ranked first in MPC cases, with 42.1% for males and 59.3% for females. The proportion of patients with a positive family history who had single primary cancers of the upper, middle, and lower third of the esophagus, and GCA was cut down to 38.5%, 26.3%, 26.55%, and 11.2% in males (P = 0.000), and 25.0%, 22.3%, 23.9%, and 9.8% in females, respectively (P = 0.000). Moreover, the median age of onset for patients with cancers in the above mentioned sites was 49, 52, 55, and 56 years old in males, and 50, 53, 55, and 56 years old in females (both P = 0.000), with a significant increase in the age of onset in both male and female patients (male: P = 0.002, female: P = 0.004). The sex ratio between the males and females increased site-specifically by 2.2, 2.1, 2.2, and 6.2 :1 (P = 0.000). Based on the comparison of the ratio of MPCs among the cases in relation to SCC of the upper, middle, and lower third of the esophagus and GCA, the percentage also decreased to 21.2%, 2.3%, 2.2%, and 1.4% in males and 14.3%, 2.4%, 3.4%, and 3.0% in females (male: P = 0.02, female: P = 0.04). Conclusion: These observations suggest that the proportion of familial cancers gradually decreased in patients with SCC of the upper, middle, and lower third of the esophagus and GCA in the high-risk region of Hebei province. This result has clinical significance and needs further molecular investigation.

84864310894	Targeting NF-κB p65 with an artificial microRNA suppresses growth of MDA-MB-231 human triplenegative breast cancer cell line	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) becomes a major therapeutic challenge because of its poor overall outcome and lack of benefit from targeted therapy. NF-κB p65 has been implicated as a pivotal mediator of breast cancer cell growth and dysfunctions in apoptosis, and its expression correlates with a higher incidence of invasion and metastases. To validate the function of p65, p65miRNA was used to knock down p65 expression. Notably, reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis and suppressed invasiveness were observed in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells. Study of the possible mechanism indicated that these effects occurred through silencing of the canonical NF-χB signaling pathway, as evidenced by decreased its transcriptional activity. These results provide evidence on the potential value of p65 inhibiting TNBC, which indicates great promise of p65 as a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.

84866089239	LMO4 inhibits p53-mediated proliferative inhibition of breast cancer cells through interacting p53	Aims: The LIM domain only proteins (LMOs) which consist of four members (LMO1-LMO4) are a family of nuclear transcription coregulators that are characterized by the exclusive presence of two tandem LIM domains and no other functional domains. They regulate gene transcription by functioning as linker or scaffolding proteins by virtue of their LIM domains and are involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes with several DNA-binding factors and transcriptional regulatory proteins. In the present study, we tried to find the physical interaction between p53 and LMO4, and the effect of LMO4 on p53-mediated proliferative inhibition of breast cancer cells. Main methods: FCM analysis was developed to detect the apoptosis of breast cancer cells after adriamycin (ADR) treatment. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of LMO4 and p53-related genes and proteins. Immunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the interaction between LMO4 and p53. Colony formation assay was developed to detect the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Key findings: We found that p53 was induced, but LMO4 was down-regulated in response to ADR. We also found that enforced expression of p53 inhibited the expression of LMO4, suggesting that LMO4 is a direct transcriptional target of p53. Furthermore, LMO4 can interact with p53 and inhibit p53-mediated inhibition of colony formation of breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells. Significance: The present study showed that LMO4 is a direct target of p53 and inhibits p53-mediated proliferative inhibition of breast cancer cells through interacting p53. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84869492476	Overcoming erlotinib resistance with tailored treatment regimen in patient-derived xenografts from naïve Asian NSCLC patients	Overall benefits of EGFR-TKIs are limited because these treatments are largely only for adenocarcinoma (ADC) with EGFR activating mutation. The treatments also usually lead to development of resistances. We have established a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from treatment naïve Asian NSCLC patients, including those containing "classic" EGFR activating mutations. Some of these EGFR-mutated PDXs do not respond to erlotinib: LU1868 containing L858R/T790M mutations, and LU0858 having L858R mutation as well as c-MET gene amplification, both squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Treatment of LU0858 with crizotinib, a small molecule inhibitor for ALK and c-MET, inhibited tumor growth and c-MET activity. Combination of erlotinib and crizotinib caused complete response, indicating the activation of both EGFR and c-MET promote its growth/survival. LU2503 and LU1901, both with wild-type EGFR and c-MET gene amplification, showed complete response to crizotinib alone, suggesting that c-MET gene amplification, not EGFR signaling, is the main oncogenic driver. Interestingly, LU1868 with the EGFR L858R/T790M, but without c-met amplification, had a complete response to cetuximab. Our data offer novel practical approaches to overcome the two most common resistances to EGFR-TKIs seen in the clinic using marketed target therapies. What's new? EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib and gefitinib, are the two approved treatments for NSCLC adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients with activating EGFR mutations that occur more frequently in non-smoking Asian female patients. However, drug resistance rapidly developed with two dominant genotypes: EGFR T790M "gatekeeper" mutation and c-met gene amplification. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) mimics human cancers and has been reported to be predictive of drug effects in patients. The present study established a cohort of NSCLC, including non-ADC PDX models of Asian origin containing EGFR mutations. Some of the models are found to be resistant to TKIs with classic mechanisms as seen in the clinics. We demonstrated that two existing target therapies could be tailored to overcome these resistances: 1) crizotinib, a c-MET inhibitor, was effective in overcoming resistance caused by c-met gene amplification, particularly when combined with erlotinib; 2) cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitor of distinct mechanism of action, was potent against EGFR T790M mutant. Our observation could therefore have important and practical implication treating EGFR TKI resistant patients in the clinic. Copyright © 2012 UICC.

84868591599	Concordant repression and aberrant methylation of transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway genes occurs early in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma	The loss of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) response due to the dysregulation of TGF-β receptor type I (TGFBR1), type II (TGFBR2) and Smad4 is well known for its contribution to oncogenesis, although the role of the genes of TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) is poorly understood. In the present study, the methylation status and expression of TGF-β receptor type I (TGFBR1), type II (TGFBR2), and Smad4 was investigated in GCA and dysplasia. MSP approach was used to detect the methylation status of TGFBR1, TGFBR2, and Smad4. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR methods were used respectively to examine the protein and mRNA expression of them in tissues. The methylation frequency of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 in the tissues of high grade dysplasia and GCA was significantly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues (p < 0.01) and was significantly associated with mRNA and protein expression of the two genes (p < 0.05). The methylation frequency of Smad4 in the 30 ∼171 sites was higher than that in the -248 ∼ 26 sites and was associated with the loss of Smad4 expression. The decreased expression of TGFBR1, TGFBR2 and Smad4 was correlated with increased expression of TGF-β1 in GCA. In all, these data suggest that methylation of TGFBR1, TGFBR2 and Smad4 may exist in the gastric cardia dysplasia stages and plays an important role in these genes silencing and subsequently affect the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

84872728206	Effect of topotecan on retinocytoma cell apoptosis and expression of Livin and PTEN	Background Retinocytoma (RB) is a very common intraocular malignant tumor during infancy. Chemotherapy has gradually been used as the first-line treatment for intraocular RB in recent years. In this study, Livin and PTEN expressions were observed in the RB tissue, along with the growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-induced effects of topotecan (TPT) on RB HXO-Rb44 cell strain. This study aimed to investigate the antigrowth effects of TPT on RB cell strain HXO-Rb44. Methods Max-Vision™ rapid immunohistochemistry was adopted to detect Livin and PTEN expressions in the normal retina and in RB, and their relationship with RB clinicopathologic features was analyzed. Human RB cell strain HXO-Rb44 was cultivated and passaged. MTT method was used to measure the survival rates of HXO-Rb44 cell strains under various TPT concentrations. IC50 values were calculated. Flow cytometry was used to detect the effects of various TPT concentrations on HXO-Rb44 cell apoptosis. Western blotting was used to detect the differences of Livin and PTEN protein expressions during cell apoptosis. Results The positive expressions of Livin and PTEN in the RB group were obviously different from those in the normal control group. In RB tissue, Livin expression was relevant to PTEN expression. TPT could significantly induce the occurrence of cell apoptosis and had a dependent relationship with drug concentration. Livin and PTEN expression levels varied with the extension of the effect time of TPT based on Western blotting analysis. Conclusions Livin and PTEN have high and low expression levels in the RB tissue, respectively. Both of them have key roles in RB occurrence and development. TPT could induce human RB cell strain HXO-Rb44 cell apoptosis, and its mechanism is associated with the inhibition of Livin and PTEN expressions.

84873656861	An Ester extract of cochinchina momordica seeds induces differentiation of melanoma B16 F1 cells via MAPKs signaling	Cochinchina momordica seeds (CMS) have been widely used due to antitumor activity by Mongolian tribes of China. However, the details of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we found that an EtOAc (ethyl ester) extract of CMS (CMSEE) induced differentiation and caused growth inhibition of melanoma B16 F1 cells. CMSEE at the concentration of 5-200 μg/ml exhibited strongest anti-proliferative effects on B16 F1 cells among other CMS fractions (water or petroleum ether). Moreover, CMSEE induced melanoma B16 F1 cell differentiation, characterized by dendrite-like outgrowth, increasing melanogenesis production, as well as enhancing tyrosinase activity. Western blot analysis showed that sustained phosphorylation of p38 MAP accompanied by decrease in ERK1/2 and JNK dephosphorylation were involved in CMSEE-induced B16 F1 cell differentiation. Notably, 6 compounds that were isolated and identified may be responsible for inducing differentiation of CMSEE. These results indicated that CMSEE contributes to the differentiation of B16 F1 cells through modulating MAPKs activity, which may throw some light on the development of potentially therapeutic strategies for melanoma treatment.

84873699578	Overexpression of p65 attenuates celecoxib-induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line	Background: Celecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor that has been reported to reduce the risk of breast cancer. In our previous study, celecoxib induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and its effects were mediated by downregulation of NF-κB signaling. The NF-κB p65/RelA subunit may play a role in cell death through the activation of anti-apoptotic target genes including the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and Bcl-2 families, and inhibition of protein kinase B/Akt. The aim of the present study was to investigate p65 as the potential target of celecoxib treatment and determine whether p65 overexpression can override the inhibitory effect of celecoxib on NF-κB activity and affect cell survival.Methods: The effects of p65 overexpression on celecoxib-inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity were examined by western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell viability and cell death were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay, and the levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase. Anti-apoptotic NF-κB target genes and cell cycle regulators were examined by western blotting to screen for the expression of target genes under direct regulation by p65.Results: Overexpression of p65 increased NF-κB transcriptional activity and interfered with celecoxib-mediated apoptosis as assessed by MTT assay and caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP expressions. Exogenously overexpressed p65 upregulated NF-κB-responsive genes, including anti-apoptotic genes such as survivin and XIAP, and the cell cycle regulatory gene cyclin D1. However, p65 overexpression did not affect celecoxib-induced p-Akt inactivation, suggesting that celecoxib might have separate molecular mechanisms for regulating Akt signaling independently of its inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity.Conclusions: p65 is a pivotal anti-apoptotic factor that can reverse celecoxib-induced growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells. © 2013 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84874010773	Lethal effects of parthenolide on mouse breast cancer CSC in vitro	Objective: To investigate the lethal effects of Parthenolide (PTL) on cancer stem cells (CSC) of mouse breast cancer in vitro. Methods: Serum-free mammosphere suspension culture fluid was used to culture 4T1 cell lines in a manner designed to enrich for the breast cancer CSC. The 10th generation mammosphere cells were used as the experimental cells. The experimental cells were divided into 5 groups: the control group, the 5-FU group, the PTL group, the 5-FU+PTL group and the PTL+NAC (N-Acetylcysteine) group. The experimental cells were treated with the appropriate drugs, and then the cells were cultured using serum-free medium. Seven days later, the mammosphere forming conditions were observed and mammosphere cells were collected for testing the CD44 + CD24-/low cell content, detecting the non-fluorescent dye staining side population (SP) cells ratio, and evaluating the MDR1, BCRP and mRNA expression levels. Results: The CSC in the 4T1 cell line were enriched by the serum-free suspension culture, and the CD44+CD24-/low cell ratio reached 68.9±3.78%. After treatment with different drugs, the cells of the control, the 5-FU and the PTL + NAC groups formed visible mammospheres. Nevertheless, fewer mammospheres were formed in the cells of the PTL group, and no cells survived in the 5-FU+PTL group. In the control, 5-FU, PTL, and PTL+NAC groups, the CD44+CD24-/low cell contents were 71.2±2.3%, 75.6±3.1%, 10.3±1.9% and 58.1±2.6% respectively, and the percentage of the non-fluorescent staining (SP) cells were 56.7±3.4%, 62.0± 2.7%, 8.1 ±1.1% and 51.5±2.3%, respectively. The cell contents were more significantly decreased in the PTL group than in the other three groups (P<0.01), with a statistical significance when comparing the differences among the groups (P<0.01). Compared with the cells of the control group, the relative expression of MDR1 and BCRP genes was 1.16±0.21 and 1.09±0.13 in the cells of the 5-FU group, respectively; 0.22±0.15 and 0.27±0.11 in the cells of the PTL group, respectively; and 0.89±0.18 and 0.93±0.14 in the cells of the PTL+NAC group, respectively. Conclusion: PTL can target the CSC of breast cancer, change the state of CSC, and significantly reduce the CSC content of the cultured mammosphere cells. The antioxidant NAC can apparently antagonize this effect of PTL in vitro.

84874396207	Despite shared susceptibility loci, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma embraces more familial cancer than gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in the Taihang mountains high-risk region of northern central China	Background In China, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) share susceptibility loci, but different rates of multiple primary cancer and male/female ratio suggest the proportion of familial cancer is not equal. Methods The percent of cases with a positive family history, median onset age, rate of multiple primary cancer, and male/female ratio associated with upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA were compared to reveal the proportion of familial cancer. The 7267 subjects analyzed constituted all ESCC and GCA cases in whom the cancer was resected with cure intention between 1970 and 1994 at the 4th Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Results A positive family history for cancer was most often associated with the multiple primary ESCC and/or GCA cases, e.g. with 42% of the males and 59% of the females. For upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA, the percent of cases with a positive family history decreased by 38.5%, 26.3%, 26.5%, and 11.2% in males (P <0.000) and 25.0%, 22.3%, 23.9%, and 9.8% in females (P <0.0001). Median onset age increased from 49, 52, 55, to 56 years old in males and from 50, 53, 55, to 56 years old in females (both P <0.0001) for upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA. Male/female ratio increased from 2.2, 2.1, 2.2, to 6.2:1 for upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA (P <0.0001). For upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA, the percent of multiple primary cancers decreased from 21.2%, 2.3%, 2.2%, to 1.5% in males and from 14.3%, 2.4%, 3.4%, to 3.1% in females. The preponderance of males, smoking, drinking, or onset-age ≥50 years was significantly higher in GCA than in ESCC, and the difference in the rates of multiple primary cancers between the preponderant and the non-preponderant cases was significant in GCA, but not in ESCC, suggesting non-equal requirement for genetic susceptibility when environmental hazards did not exist. Conclusions The proportion of familial cancer in upper gastrointestinal carcinomas decreases by the priamry site of upper, middle, lower third esophagus and gastric cardia. Considering familial and sporadic cancers differ in preventability, screening strategy and recurrence, our findings have basic and clinical implications.

Methods: The expression levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β messenger RNA in peripheral blood were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; expression levels of CD80 and CD86 in DCs stimulated by sCD40L were detected using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: Expression levels of IL-10 and TGF-β genes in the peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients were significantly increased compared with patients with benign ovarian tumors (P < 0.05). The expression levels of CD80 and CD86 in DCs cultured in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor + IL-4 + stem cell factor + Flt-3 ligand + sCD40L group were significantly increased compared with those in the control group, as assessed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A variety of cytokines in combination with sCD40L can promote the proliferation of cord blood-derived DCs and induce their maturation as well as stimulating a specific antitumor response. © 2013 Zhang et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84878399228	The expression and clinical significance of melanoma-associated antigen-A1, -A3 and -A11 in glioma	Melanoma-associated antigens (MAGEs) were initially identified in melanoma and have since been widely studied. Melanoma-associated antigen-As (MAGE-As), a subfamily of MAGEs, are expressed in germ cells and various types of cancer, and are considered to be ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy. Glial cells and melanocytes originate from the neural ectoderm, so tumors derived from these two types of cells, i.e. gliomas and melanomas, may have common biological characteristics. However, studies on the expression of the MAGE-A family in gliomas are limited and conflicting. In the present study, the expression levels of MAGE-A1, -A3 and -A11 were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the association of their expression levels with the clinicopathological parameters, overall survival (OS) and ki-67 labeling indices of glioma patients were analyzed. The results showed that i) the expression levels of MAGE-A1, -A3 and -A11 proteins in the glioma tissues were 64.1, 51.3 and 57.7%, respectively and that no MAGE-A1, -A3 or -A11 expression was detected in the normal brain specimens; ii) the expression levels of MAGE-A1 and -A11 increased with ascending pathological grades and were positively correlated with the ki-67 labeling index; and iii) the OS of the patients in the groups with high MAGE-A1 (P=0.005) and -A11 (P=0.019) expression was statistically lower compared with the groups with low expression and no significant differences in OS were detected between the patients in the groups with high and low MAGE-A3 expression (P=0.304). Based on these results, we conclude that MAGE-A1, -A3 and -A11 may be used as ideal targets for glioma immunotherapy, and that MAGE-A1 and -A11 expression may be involved in tumor cell proliferation. These proteins may be potential indicators of a poor prognosis in glioma patients.

84880584612	Prevalence of Th17 and Treg cells in gastric cancer patients and its correlation with clinical parameters	Th17 cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells have been reported to share reciprocal developmental pathways but exhibit opposite effects, and the balance between them controls inflammation and autoimmune diseases. However, information regarding Th17/Treg cells in cancer-bearing hosts is still limited. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of Th17 cells in relation to Treg cells in gastric cancer patients, and evaluated how the imbalance in Th17/Treg cells in gastric cancer correlates with clinical and pathological parameters. We observed that the accumulation of Th17 and Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment was gradually increased according to disease progression, leading to an imbalance in Th17/Treg cells in gastric cancer patients. TGF-β and interleukin (IL)-6 present in the gastric cancer microenvironment promoted the differentiation and expansion of Th17 cells, and increased numbers of Th17 cells promoted tumor progression through promotion of inflammation by secretion of IL-17. Treg cells promoted tumor progression by helping cancer cells escape from host immunosurveillance by secreting TGF-β, and a high level of TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment promoted differentiation and expansion of Treg cells. In conclusion, the imbalance in Th17/Treg cells was involved in the development and progression of gastric cancer. A better understanding of the nature, regulation, and function of Th17 and Treg cells in tumor immunity may aid in the development of novel and effective immunotherapy for gastric cancer.

84881088731	B7-H3 is Overexpressed in Patients Suffering Osteosarcoma and Associated with Tumor Aggressiveness and Metastasis	B7-H3 is a member of the B7-family of co-stimulatory molecules, which has been shown to be broadly expressed in various tumor tissues, and which plays an important role in adaptive immune responses. The role of B7-H3 in osteosarcoma, however, remains unknown. In this study we used immunohistochemistry to analyze B7-H3 expression in 61 primary osteosarcoma tissues with case-matched adjacent normal tissues, and 37 osteochondroma and 20 bone fibrous dysplasia tissues. B7-H3 expression was expressed in 91.8% (56/61) of the osteosarcoma lesions, and the intensity of B7-H3 expression in osteosarcoma was significantly increased compared with adjacent normal tissues, osteochondroma and bone fibrous dysplasia tissues (p<0.001). Patients with high tumor B7-H3 levels had a significantly shorter survival time and recurrence time than patients with low tumor B7-H3 levels (p<0.001). Moreover, tumor B7-H3 expression inversely correlated with the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8

Methods: Eighty-two postoperative breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen therapy, who were admitted to gynecologic ward of Hebei Medical University Forth Hospital from July 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009 due to their gynecologic problems, were collected, and their clinicopathological information were anaylzed retrospectively. Results: Of 82 patients, 74 were followed-up, 4 were lost, and 4 were dead. The types of endometrial pathology of patients receiving tamoxifen included endometrial polypoid hyperplasia (n = 16, 21.6%), endometrial polyps (n = 14, 18.9%), adenomyoma (n = 11, 14.9%), atypical hyperplasia (n = 4, 5.4%) and endometrial carcinoma (n = 9, 12.2%). The related factors analysis revealed that endometrial diseases were positively associated with menopause, which meant that the postmenopausal patients were more likely to suffer from endometrial cancer. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the duration of tamoxifen use and endometrial cancer, especially for the patients receiving tamoxifen for 5 years or more. The endometrial thickness by B-ultrasonic examination was also positively correlated with endometrial cancer. Conclusion: Tamoxifen therapy in postoperative breast cancer patients can lead to endometrial diseases. Postmenopausal patients and the patients receiving tamoxifen for 5 years or more are more likely to develop endometrial cancer. Combination of B-ultrasonic examination and hysteroscopy is an effective way to find endometrial lesions induced by tamoxifen therapy. Copyright © 2013 by TUMOR.

84883257316	Immunostimulatory effect of a composition isolated from white peony root oral liquid in the treatment of radiation-induced esophagitis	The aim of this study was to explore the immune repairing effect of a composition isolated from white peony root oral liquid (cWPROL), a traditional Chinese herbal composition, in the treatment of experimental radiation-induced esophagitis in rats. A total of 128 Wistar rats were randomly divided into eight groups, irradiated with 43 Gy 60Co γ rays to induce esophagitis and treated by different methods. Flow cytometry, hematological analysis and immune nephelometry were used to detect the absolute numbers and percentages of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, numbers and classification of leukocytes, and the levels of IgG and complement C3 in the peripheral blood of the rats at each experimental time point. Following irradiation, the total number of leukocytes, absolute numbers and percentages of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and levels of IgG and complement C3 in the peripheral blood of the rats were decreased. Furthermore, the total numbers of leukocytes, absolute numbers and percentages of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and levels of IgG and complement C3 in the peripheral blood were higher in the administered with cWPROL by intra-esophageal perfusion compared with those in the untreated irradiated groups, but lower in the groups treated with a mixture of lidocaine hydrochloride, dexamethasone sodium phosphate and gentamicin sulfate. This study suggested that cWPROL is able to repair the impaired cellular and humoral immunity of rats with radiation-induced esophagitis.

84884481500	Effect of p-hydroxylcinnamaldehyde on differentiation of melanoma cells and its mechanism	Objective: To explore the monomer compounds in the seeds of Momrodica cochinchinensis and to study the differentiation of mouse melanoma B16 cells induced by p-hydroxylcinnamaldehyde (PHC). Methods: After being treated by five kinds of compounds [PHC, coniferylaldehyde, p-hydroxylbenzaldehyde (PHB), 3-O-methoxyaniline-p-hydroxylbenzaldehyde, and ligballinol] for 48 h, the inhibitory rate of B16 cell growth was measured by sulforhadamine B (SRB); Morphological changes of B16 cells induced by PHC for 24, 48, and 72 h were observed by Giemsa staining and phase contrast microscope; Melanin content and the activity of tyrosinase in B16 cells 48 h after the administration were assessed by colorimeter. The expression of tyrosinase mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. Results: All the five compounds had the inhibitory effect on the B16 cells. Among them, PHC showed the strongest effect in the dose-and time-dependent manner; PHC could induce B16 cells dendritic growth 48 h after the treatment, and the morphological changes were typically differentiated; PHC also increased the melanin production and the activity of tyrosinase. There was a significant difference compared to the control group (P < 0.05). After treated by PHC for 6, 12, and 24 h, the expression levels of tyrosinase mRNA, tyrosinase 1 mRNA, and tyrosinase 2 mRNA were significantly increased (P < 0.01) in a time-dependent manner. Conclusion: PHC could inhibit the proliferation of B16 cells and the mechanism is related to the differentiation of B16 cells.

84889048164	The mechanism of apoptosis of TE-13 cells induced by ethanol extract of Forsythia suspensa root in vitro	Objective: To investigate the probable mechanism of FSEER (ethanol extract of Forsythia suspensa root)-induced apoptosis of esophageal cancer TE-13 cells in vitro . Methods: Change of mitochondrial membrane potential in TE-13 celsl after treatment with different concentrations of FSEER (0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 mg/mL) for 24 h was examined by FCM (flow cytometry). The expressions of apoptosisassociated proteins [cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9 and Cyt-C (cytochrome-C)] in esophageal cancer cells after FSEER treatment were detected by Western blotting. The expression levels of Bax, Bad, Noxa, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNAs in TE-13 cells after treatment with different concentrations of FSEER for 24 h were detected by RT (reverse transcription)-PCR. Results: FSEER (0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 mg/mL for 24 h) can significantly reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential of TE-13 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as compared with the TE-13 cells without any treatment (P < 0.05). The result of Western blotting showed that the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9 and Cyt-C in TE-13 cells after FSEER treatment were significantly increased but the expression level of caspase-8 had no change as compared with those of the TE-13 cells without any treatment (P < 0.05). RT-PCR showed that FSEER could up-regulate the expression levels of Bax, Bad and Noxa mRNAs and down-regulate the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNAs. Conclusion: The underlying mechanism of FSEER-induced apoptosis of TE-13 cells may be related to the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Copyright © 2013 by TUMOR.

84892524555	Expressions of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in Breast Cancer and their Expression Mechanism	Background and Aims: The MAGE gene encodes cancer/testis antigens that are selectively expressed in various types of human neoplasms but not in normal tissues other than testis and placenta. However, the expression pattern of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in breast cancer patients is still unclear. The purpose of our study is to investigate the expression pattern and mechanism of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in breast cancer patients. Methods: The expression of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 was investigated in 60 breast benign diseases specimens, 60 tumor-free breast specimens and 60 breast cancer specimens by RT-PCR, and their correlation with clinicopathological parameters was elucidated. We examined the influence of the DNA methylase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) together with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on the expression of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 genes in two breast cancer cell lines. Results: The expression rates of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in breast cancer specimens were 45 and 66.7%, respectively. MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 expression was positively associated with estrogen-receptor (ER) and HER-2 expression (p<0.05). 5-Aza-CdR treatment alone could induce the expression of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in cell lines that did not express this antigen. TSA treatment alone had no influence on MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 gene expression. However, TSA was able synergistically to enhance 5-aza-CdR-mediated MAGE-A transcription (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our data show that MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 are tumor-specific antigens and not only DNA hypermethylation but also histone deacetylation is responsible for themechanism underlying MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 gene silencing. © 2014 IMSS.

84893750400	Heat-shock protein 90 inhibitors synergistically enhance melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7-mediated cell killing of human pancreatic carcinoma	Pancreatic cancer is one of the intractable diseases and an effective therapeutic strategy is required to improve the prognosis. We examined possible antitumor effects of adenoviruses expressing melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (Ad-mda-7) and a heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor to human pancreatic carcinoma cells. Ad-mda-7 and an Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA), produced cytotoxic effects, and a combinatory use of Ad-mda-7 and GA further achieved synergistic effects. Administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species, eliminated Ad-mda-7-and GA-mediated cytotoxicity. Ad-mda-7 augmented phosphorylated AKT levels but GA did not influence the phosphorylation. GA-treated cells showed cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase but not caspase-3, and upregulated Hsp70 and LC3A/B II levels, whereas Ad-mda-7-treated cells did not. GA treatments augmented ubiquitination and markedly increased melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7 (MDA-7) expression levels. These findings suggest that Ad-mda-7-mediated cytotoxicity is dependent on reactive oxygen species but independent of apoptosis or autophagy, and that GA-mediated cytotoxicity was linked with caspase-independent apoptosis and/or autophagy. A mechanism underlying the combinatory effects of Ad-mda-7 and GA remained complex and the synergism is attributable to multiple factors including increased MDA-7 protein stability by GA. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

84894082488	Dickkopf-1 is oncogenic and involved in invasive growth in non small cell lung cancer	Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the role of DKK1 in the progression of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not fully understood. In this study, RT-PCR and Western blot were used to examine the expression of DKK1 in a panel of ten human NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC tissues. DKK1 expression was highly transactivated in the great majority of these cancer lines. The expression of DKK1 was upregulated on both mRNA and protein levels in NSCLC tissues compared with the adjacent normal lung tissues. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluoresence revealed that DKK1 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm in both carcinoma tissues and cell lines. DKK1 protein expression was also evaluated in paraffin sections from 102 patients with NSCLC by immunohistochemistry, and 65(63.73%)tumors were DKK1 positive. Relative analysis showed a significant relationship between DKK1 positive expression and lymph node metastasis(P<0.05). Patients with DKK1-positive tumors had poorer DFS than those with negative ESCC (5-year DFS; 15.4% versus 27%, P = 0.007). To further explore the biological effects of DKK1 in NSCLC cells, we over-expressed DKK1 in NSCLC 95C cell using eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-Tab-2b and performed a knockdown of DKK1 in LTEP-a-2 cell using a short hairpin RNA expression vector pSilencer 5.1. DKK1 did not have any effect on proliferation, but seemed to play a role in migration and invasion capability. Overexpression of DKK1 promotes migratory and invasive activity of 95C, while DKK1 knockdown resulted in the suppression of migration and invasion potentials of LTEP-a-2 cell. Taken together, these results indicate that DKK1 may be a crucial regulator in the progression of NSCLC. DKK1 might be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC. © 2013 Li et al.

84896725801	Incidence and risk of treatment-related mortality with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody in cancer patients: A meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials	Background: Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab have emerged as an effective targeted therapy in the treatment of cancer patients, but the overall incidence and risk of fatal adverse events (FAEs) associated with these agents is still unclear. Methods: Databases from PubMed, Web of Science and abstracts presented at ASCO meeting up to May 31, 2013 were searched to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies included prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating MoAbs in cancer patients with adequate data on FAEs. Statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the summary incidence, odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using either random effects or fixed effect models according to the heterogeneity of included studies. Results: A total of 14,776 patients with a variety of solid tumors from 21 clinical trials were included in our analysis. The overall incidence of MoAbs associated FAEs was 1.7% (95%CI: 1.1-2.5%), and the incidence of cetuximab-related FAEs was higher than that of panitumumab (2.0% versus 0.9%). Compared with the controls, the use of MoAbs was associated with a significantly increased risk of FAEs, with an OR of 1.37 (95%CI: 1.04-1.81, p=0.024). Subgroup analysis based on EGFR-MoAbs drugs, phase of trials and tumor types demonstrated a tendency to increase the risk of FAEs, but the risk did not increase in breast cancer, esophagus cancer and phase II trials. Conclusions: With present evidence, the use of EGFR-MoAbs is associated with an increased risk of FAEs in patients with advanced solid tumors. © 2013 Li et al.

84898900594	Erythropoietin modulates the antimelanoma activity of various chemotherapeutic agents	OBJECTIVE: Erythropoietin receptor(EPOR) expression and the role of erythropoietin (EPO) to regulate the anticancer activity of dacarbazine (DTIC) and cisplatin (DDP) in the melanoma cell line B16 and its relation to the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins were studied. METHODS: Expression of EPOR mRNA and protein was detected by RT-PCR and cell immunochemistry. Effects of EPO combinding with dacarbazine or cisplatin on B16 cells proliferation was measured by MTT methods and colony forming assay. Expressions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax mRNA and proteins were analyzed by real-time fluoregenic quantitative PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: EPOR mRNA and protein expressed in B16 cells. Pretreatment of B16 cells with EPO can significantly increase resistance to dacarbazine treatment (P<0.05), while EPO did not affect the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin (P>0.05). After treatment with EPO, expression of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA and proteins in B16 cell is increased (P<0.05), while Bax mRNA and protein remained unchanged(P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: B16 cells expressed EPOR. EPO can regulate antineoplastic activity of chemotherapeutic agents and the effect is drug related, and its mechanism is probably related to regulating expression of bcl-2 family proteins.

84900416405	The clinicopathologic significance of the loss of BAF250a (ARID1A) expression in endometrial carcinoma	Objective: AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes the BAF250a protein. Recent studies have shown the loss of ARID1A expression in several types of tumors. We aimed to investigate the clinical and pathologic role of BAF250a in endometrial carcinoma. Methods: We examined the expression of BAF250a and its correlation with the expression of p53, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, hypoxiainduciblefactor- 1α, and vascular endothelial growth factor in normal and various malignant endometrial tissues. Results: The expression of BAF250 was significantly down-regulated in endometrial carcinomawhen compared with normal endometrial tissues. The loss of BAF250a expression was found in 25% of endometrial carcinoma samples but not in normal endometrial tissues, complex endometrial hyperplasia, and atypical endometrial hyperplasia samples. Subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, especially uterine endometrioid carcinoma and uterine clear cell carcinoma, had higher frequency of loss of BAF250a expression. In addition, the expression of BAF250a was positively correlated with estrogen receptor and negatively correlated with p53 in poorly differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the expression of BAF250awas significantly associatedwith the differentiation status of endometrial carcinoma but not associated with clinical stage, the depth of myometrial invasion, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival of patients with endometrial carcinoma. Conclusions: Our data showed that loss of BAF250a is frequently found in high-grade endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas but not in other types of endometrial carcinoma. The loss of BAF250a expression does not have prognostic value for endometrial carcinoma. Copyright © 2014 by IGCS and ESGO.

84904510200	The feasibility of comprehensive staging surgery via laparoscopic operation in patients with ovarian cancer and its clinical significance	Objective: To explore the feasibility and safety of comprehensive staging surgery via laparoscopic operation and its clinical significance. Methods: A retrospective analysis of medical records was conducted in 35 inpatients diagnosed of ovarian cancer (stage I, n = 29; stage II, n = 4; stage III, n = 2) in Department of Gynecology of Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between January 2010 and January 2013. Of the 35 patients, 15 underwent comprehensive staging operation via laparoscopic operation and 20 via open operation. The general conditions during and after operation and the postoperative survival were observed and compared between the two groups. Results: All operations completed successfully in 15 patients in the laparoscopic operation group, and no perioperative complications were observed. The intraoperative blood loss and the rate of postoperative analgesia in the laparoscopic operation group were both less than those in the open operation group (P < 0.05), but the differences in duration of operation, number of abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes resected, recovery time of gastrointestinal function, rate of postoperative complications, rate of postoperative recurrence, rate of increase in pathological stage, hospitalization expenses, duration of hospital stay after operation and the rate of chemotherapy after operation were not statistically significant between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in the cumulative survival rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Comprehensive staging operation for ovarian cancer especially for early-stage cancer is feasible and safe. It has the merits of smaller wound, less blood loss during the operation and more rapid recovery. Copyright© 2014 by TUMOR.

84905986639	Leptin promotes metastasis by inducing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 lung cancer cells	Leptin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine associated with obesity, has been reported to participate in carcinogenesis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is also considered as a key event in tumor metastasis. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of leptin in the promotion of EMT leading to metastasis in A549 lung cancer cells. We investigated the effect of leptin on migration of A549 cells using wound healing and transwell assays. The incidence of EMT in A549 cells was examined by real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining. The expression of TGF-β in A549 cells was detected by real-time PCR, and blocking of TGF-β in A549 cells was achieved by siRNA techniques. Additional work was performed using 100 patient samples, which included samples from 50 patients diagnosed with lung cancer and an additional 50 patients diagnosed with lung cancer with metastatic bone lesions. Leptin expression was measured using immunohistochemistry techniques. We demonstrated that leptin can effectively enhance the metastasis of human lung cancer A549 cell line using both wound healing and transwell assays. We also found the incidence of EMT in A549 cells after leptin exposure. Furthermore, we detected the expression of TGF-β in A549 cells, which had been reported to play an important role in inducing EMT. We showed that leptin can significantly upregulate TGF-β at both the mRNA and protein levels in A549 cells. Using siRNA to block the expression of TGF-β in A549 cells, we confirmed the role of TGF-β in the promotion of metastasis and induction of EMT. Furthermore, we found that in patient samples leptin was present at higher levels in samples associated with diagnosis of lung cancer bone metastases tissue than lung cancer tissue. Our results indicated that leptin promoted the metastasis of A549 human lung cancer cell lines by inducing EMT in a TGF-β -dependent manner.

84907663980	Expression of melanoma antigen genes in human breast cancer: Association with major demographic and pathophysiologic variables and effect of drug treatment	Objective: The purpose of our study was to analyze the expression of melanoma antigen genes MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in benign and malignant breast cancer specimens and in breast cancer cell lines following drug treatment. Methods: Tissue specimens were obtained from tumor-free breast (n = 60), benign breast cancer (n = 60) and malignant breast cancer (n = 60), respectively. The mRNA abundance and protein content of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in these specimens were detemiined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively and were analyzed for their associations with the major demographic, physiologic and pathologic variables. To examine the influence of chemotherapeutic drugs on MAGEs in breast cancer, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5-Aza-2 ’-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a DNA ethylase inhibitor, and trichostatin (TS), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, either each alone or both together, and mRNA levels of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 were assessed by RT-PCR. Results: MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 transcripts were detected in 45% and 66.7% of breast cancer specimens respectively and MAGE-A9 and MAGE-All proteins in 43. 3% and 63. 3% of cancer specimens, respectively. MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 expression was positively correlated with the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidemial growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) in cancer specimens (P <0. 05). Neither transcripts nor proteins of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 were detected in nomial control specimens. While 5-Aza-CdR alone induced the expression of MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 in the test cell lines, TSA alone showed no effects. However, TSA was able to enhance 5-Aza-CdR-induced MAGE-A transcription (P <0.01). Conclusion: MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 are tumor-specific antigens. Both DNA hypemiethylation and histone deacetylation are possible mechanisms underlying MAGE-A9 and MAGE-A11 gene silencing.

84907464381	Bortezomib prevents oncogenesis and bone metastasis of prostate cancer by inhibiting WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2	Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in males, and bone metastases remain a significant source of morbidity and mortality in this population. Ubiquitin ligase E3s and proteasomes were thought to play essential roles in the development of cancers, therefore, they were proposed as therapy targets for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. Bortezomib, wellknown as a proteasome inhibitor, has been observed with exact anticancer effect both in cell and animal models for several solid tumor types, including prostate cancer. To explore activities of the ubiquitin ligase E3s WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 in oncogenesis and bone metastasis of prostate cancer, as well as in the functional mechanism of bortezomib in preventing prostate cancer, transcription and expression levels of WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 genes in cell lines or tissues of benign prostate hyperplasia and human prostate cancer with and without bone metastasis were tested. Moreover, human prostate cancer PC3 cell lines were treated with bortezomib at different concentration gradients and then their proliferation at different time points, mRNA and protein levels were investigated. The results indicated that transcription and expression levels of WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 genes in prostate cancer without bone metastasis were significantly higher compared to those in benign prostate hyperplasia (P<0.05), whereas significantly lower than prostate cancer metastatic to bone (P<0.05). Furthermore, bortezomib reduced the transcription and expression levels of WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 genes in prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, thus, inhibiting the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Elevated transcription and expression levels of ubiquitin ligase E3s WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2 genes may be the mechanisms of occurrence, development and metastasis of prostate cancer. In addition, bortezomib can prevent prostate cancer and its bone metastasis by downregulating WWP1, Smurf1 and Smurf2.

84908094665	Low-dose decitabine induces MAGE-A expression and inhibits invasion via suppression of NF-κB2 and MMP2 in Eca109 cells	Decitabine, a demethylating drug, is the first-line treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes and gains better overall survival, which is based on epigenetic mechanism. Activated by promoter demethylation, melanoma-associated antigens-A (MAGE-A), cancer-testis antigens are attractive targets for immunotherapy. Our purpose was to investigate whether decitabine could show anti-tumor effects for esophageal cancer and explore its mechanism. In addition, we aimed to examine its modulation for most MAGE-A members. The results showed the baseline expression were MAGE-A2, -3,-9, and -10 in Eca109 cells and decitabine (0.5μM) could induce MAGE-A8 and -A4 whereas reduce MAGE-A9 and -A10. Moreover, decitabine (0.5μM) inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasive ability by 15%, 34% and 47.2%, respectively and decreased expressions of NF-κB2 and MMP2. Our results demonstrated that low-dose decitabine induced the expression of MAGE-A8 and -A4, and inhibited cell invasion through decreasing expression of MMP2 and NF-κB2, which provides possibilities for combing decitabine with immunotherapy targeting MAGE-A to treat advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
