By taking the Open and Modular Architecture Controller (OMAC) as a reference, a motion controller with B-spline interpolation function is developed. The controller divides the controlling tasks in accordance with real-time request, executes the man-machine interactive, code analysis and parameter mapping in an offline environment and runs the interpolation operation, discrete logic control and inverse kinematic transformation in a real-time thread. Therefore, the real-time performance of the controller is well realized by methods above. To simplify the procedure of NC program, the machining information received by the controller are vectors in a part coordinate system. Furthermore, the controller can offer a good generality by developing Inverse Kinematic Transformation Module (IKTM) units suitable for various 5-axis machine tools and designing the parameters of machine tools as the customizable parameters. The mapping relation between the orientation and the position parameters in the NC program is established by the controller. As a result, the motions of linear axes and motion of rotary axis meet the machining requirement well and good machining accuracy is obtained. In a machining process, when the NC program capacity for B spline interpolation is 15% that of the NC program capacity for linear interpolation, its interpolation error is 0.45% that of the linear one.

84859121131	Simulation of non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of thermoplastics during fiber placement process	Currently more and more thermoplastic composites are applied in aircraft structures. During automated fiber placement process, thermoplastic composites, which adopted "in-situ consolidation" technology, can be formed and consolidated in several minutes. Therefore, using "in-situ consolidation" technology instead of autoclave technology is more economically. However, some technical indicators of laminates using "in site consolidation" technology are below the autoclave laminates. In order to eliminate the most significant barriers, the automated fiber placement process should be studied. The crystallization rate of thermoplastic in the cooling stage of automated fiber placement is one of the most important factors. In order to obtain the special crystallization, the cooling temperature and cooling time should be strict controlled. According to the coupling phenomena between the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics and the heat transfer in thermoplastic during the cooling stage, a mathematical model has been established. By solving above model, the relationship among cooling temperature, cooling time and relative crystallization rate has been obtained. Above simulated data can guide the cooling stage of automated fiber placement process. Â© Smithers Rapra Technology, 2012.

Employing first order derivatives of both the reference states and uncertainty parameters, the linear approximation of the dynamic system and inequality constraints can be obtained. After that, the Lyapunov differential equations can be formed based on the linear approximation and the upper bound for the worst case of the inequality state constraints accepted by the uncertain parameters can be obtained. Then the bi-level min-max optimization problem is transformed into a normal single-level optimization control problems which can be solved easily.
