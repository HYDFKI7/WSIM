16844377515	Autonomic dysfunction in Machado-Joseph disease	Objective: Machado-Joseph disease is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia with expanded trinucleotide repeats. Although autonomic nervous system degeneration was documented in postmortem reports, the autonomic dysfunction in patients with Machado-Joseph disease, either in clinical analysis or electrophysiological investigations, has not yet been studied in detail. Methods: Fifteen patients with genetically confirmed Machado-Joseph disease and 34 healthy subjects were studied. The study design included a detailed questionnaire, R-R interval variation on deep breathing or Valsalva maneuver, and sympathetic skin response evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve or magnetic stimulation of the neck. Results: Sixty-seven percent of patients had at least 3 symptoms involving different aspects of autonomic functions. Voiding problems and thermoregulatory disturbance were the most common symptoms. Ten (71%) of 14 patients had abnormal R-R interval variation with a significant reduction of the mean ratio. Prolonged latency or absence of sympathetic skin response to electrical stimulation was identified in 73% of patients and to magnetic stimulation, in 53%. R-R interval variation and sympathetic skin response showed good correlation with the functional stage. Electrical stimulation revealed the highest sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value compared with other tests. Conclusion: The present investigation documents that autonomic dysfunction is not uncommon in patients with Machado-Joseph disease and might be related to the clinical progression.

20344366570	Pallidotomy effect on the cortical excitability in patients with severe Parkinson's disease	Surgical lesions in the medial pallidum have been shown to ameliorate motor deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is believed that interruption of the pallido-thalamocortical projections to the motor cortex is required for the satisfactory results. In this report, we adopt cortico-cortical inhibition as the tool to assess the pallidotomy effect on cortical excitability in PD. Interstimulus interval between 1 and 15 msec were investigated. The average peak-to-peak amplitude was measured and calculated at each delay. A total of 8 patients (M:F = 4:4) 54.9 years of age (SD = 9.6) and 10 controls were recruited for the study. In the controls, the inhibitory phenomenon was observed from the 1-msec to the 4-msec delay points and the maximal inhibition was at the 3-msec delay point (33.69% ± 6.50% of the control response). Mild facilitation was noticed since the 5-msec delay point and thereafter. In patients before operation, a similar trend of inhibition was also observed in the initial 4 msec with the maximal inhibition also at the 3-msec delay point (64.66 ± 6.77% of the control response). In the postoperative group, the short interstimulus interval inhibition can no longer be observed and the conditioned response was 95.06 ± 23.68% of the control at the 3-msec delay point. The suppression was gone at and after the 7-msec delay point. Results of repeated-measures analysis of variance show a significant difference among the controls and PD patients before and 3 months after pallidotomy (F = 3.40, P = 0.05). Post hoc examination revealed a significant difference between the controls and PD patients 3 months after pallidotomy at the 3-msec delay point (P = 0.004). However, no correlation was observed between the 3-msec inhibition and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor score or the dyskinesia score. The results suggest that pallidotomy can modulate the cortical inhibitory circuitry in patients with PD. © 2004 Movement Disorder Society.

0029988652	Random mitotic segregation of mitochondrial DNA in MELAS syndrome	We describe the heterogeneity of clinical features and molecular genetic characteristics of the probands and other members in two families with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. A point mutation at the 3243rd nucleotide position of mtDNA was found only in some of the maternal lineage members of the two families. Furthermore, the proportions of mutant mtDNA were varied and found only in some tissues of the individuals. Intriguingly, in some subjects, the mutant mtDNA was found in blood cells or hair follicles but was absent in muscles. The data do not support the notion of a selective advantage of wild-type mtDNA to rapidly replicating cells. We suggest that a rapid replicative segregation may occur in early embryogenesis.

0030040698	Dopa-responsive dystonia: Clinical and family study in Taiwanese	We report the clinical features of four female patients with dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), and the survey of the family members. The patients were 2 sisters and 2 sporadic patients from 3 families. Their age of onset ranged between 5 and 13 years. The clinical manifestation was characterized by limb dystonia which was relieved by L-dopa treatment. Diurnal fluctuation disappeared 15 years later in one patient. There was a wide spectrum of Parkinsonian features and variability of dystonia. Response of L-dopa was still excellent 20 years later. In survey of the family members, there was neither bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor nor dystonia.

0029782497	Botulinum toxin A injection in the treatment of hemifacial spasm	Introduction - There are conflicting reports concerning the variation in duration of symptoms relief for patients with hemifacial spasm who have undergone several injections of botulinum A toxin (BOTX-A). We present our experience of BOTX-A injections in Taiwanese patients to analyze this issues, and to inspect whether the efficacy of treatment depends on the pre-injection severity. Material and method - From July 1992 to December 1994, 137 patients received injections of BOTX-A. We used objective and subjective score system to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of BOTX-A injection. Results - The overall successful rate of substantial relief of spasm was 88%. The mean duration of response was 20 weeks. Patents with more severe spasm tended to have shorter duration of improvement. The effects of consecutive injections remained fairly constant over the first 4 injections. Conclusion - The BOTX-A injection is an effective and safe treatment for patients with hemifacial spasm and the effect could be sustained over the consecutive injections.

0030759541	Asymmetric dystonia with frontal white matter lesions in Wilson's disease	Asymmetrical manifestation of dystonia was investigated in 26 patients with Wilson's disease with modified dystonia rating scale and correlated with the asymmetricity of CT and/or MRI findings. Ten patients (eight men and two women) had dystonia. The age of disease onset ranged from 11 to 30 years with a mean of 18.6 ± 5.2 years. The duration of the illness was from 2 to 15 years (mean 7.0; S.D. 3.6). Six patients had subcortical white matter lesions in the frontal and/or parietal lobes, as well as lesions in the basal ganglia. Five patients, who had asymmetrical white matter lesions in the frontal lobes and symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia and the thalamus, developed more severe contralateral dystonia. The other four patients with symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia and the thalamus had nearly-symmetrical dystonia. One patient with symmetrical lesions in the frontal lobes and the basal ganglia also had symmetrical manifestation of dystonia. We suggest that the interruption of the loop between the thalamus and premotor cortex by subcortical white matter lesions may enhance contralateral dystonia.

0031044334	Reciprocal inhibition in Parkinson's disease	We studied the inhibition of median H-reflex by conditioning stimuli on the radial nerve in 14 normal controls, 6 patients with unilateral and 1 patient with predominantly left-sided Parkinson's disease. In normal controls, the electrophysiological studies were performed on their right hands, yet both hands were examined in patient group. In the controls, we identified three inhibitory phases, with maximal inhibition at conditioning-test intervals of 0 ms (41.66 ± 4.73%), 20 ms (45.19 ± 4.33%), and 100 ms (44.55 ± 6.84%), respectively. In the less- or a- symptomatic side of the patient group, the inhibitory patterns are similar to those of the controls. However, in the symptomatic arms, loss of inhibition, or even mild potentiation, was observed in the third inhibitory phase. When the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides of patients were compared, in contrast to the striking phenomenon found between symptomatic side and the controls, no difference was observed in the third phase. The current results imply that, although no obvious rigidity can be detected on the asymptomatic sides, subtle functional corruption may have occurred within the contralateral basal ganglia in patients with unilateral Parkinson's disease. The remarkable change of the third phase on the symptomatic sides of patients suggests the perturbation of the polysynaptic long latency reflex pathway may somehow play a role in the rigidity pathogenesis.

0031774524	X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy: Clinical and molecular studies in a Taiwanese family	We describe clinical, biochemical, and molecular studies on a Taiwanese family with X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy. There were three probands and five female carriers among the 23 members examined. The clinical manifestations included progressive muscle weakness, diffuse fasciculation, postural tremor, muscle cramps, dysarthria, dysphagia, diabetes, and gynecomastia. Phenotypic expression varied among the affected subjects. Two carriers also had postural tremor and perioral fasciculation. Endocrine tests were normal except for a mild increase in serum testosterone and/or growth hormone in one patient and one carrier. Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia was observed in two patients, one carrier, and one healthy offspring. Molecular genetic studies confirmed elongation of the CAG triplet repeat in exon 1 of the gene for the androgen receptor. Sequence analysis showed that there were 42 to 43 CAG repeats in the three probands and 42 to 45 in the five carriers. The mutant allele had a tendency to increase by one or two repeats from one generation to the next. The length of CAG repeats at which the mutant allele became unstable was shorter in our family than in previous reports. The normal allele was also unstable and had a tendency to shrink by one to five repeats during transmission. These findings suggest that the number of CAG triplet of repeats is variable in both the mutant and normal alleles.

0031918123	Long-term progression in chronic manganism: Ten years of follow-up	We studied the long-term clinical course of five patients with chronic manganese intoxication. The mean scores of the King's College Hospital Rating Scale for Parkinson's disease increased from 15.0 ± 4.2 in 1987 to 28.3 ± 6.70 in 1991 and then to 38.1 ± 12.9 in 1995. The deterioration was most prominent in gait, rigidity, speed of foot tapping, and writing. Tissue concentrations of manganese in blood, urine, scalp hair, and pubic hair returned to normal. Follow-up MRIs did not show paramagnetic high-signal intensity on T1-weighted images. The data indicate that clinical progression in patients with manganese parkinsonism continues even 10 years after cessation of exposure.

0031985250	Electrophysiological studies of early stage corticobasal degeneration	We conducted electrophysiological studies in two Asian patients with probable corticobasal degeneration (CBD). The duration of illness from onset was 16 and 20 months, respectively. The clinical manifestations were markedly asymmetric and characterized by cortical sensory loss, apraxia, action myoclonus, action tremor, and akinetic-rigid parkinsonism. Neither patient responded to levodopa therapy. Simple photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) study showed significantly decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the frontoparietal areas and thalamus opposite to the predominantly affected limb. A series of electrophysiological studies failed to identify giant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), enhanced long latency electromyography (EMG) reflex, and cortical spikes preceding myoclonic jerk. However, the earliest cortical component of the median nerve SEP was exclusively enlarged in one patient and preserved with depression of the subsequent components in the other patient. Significantly shorter postmotor-evoked potential (MEP) silent period was found after the transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in both patients. CBD is a unique clinical entity characterized by action myoclonus probably the result of the pathologic hyperexcitability of the motor cortex, based on a loss of inhibitory input from the sensory cortex.

0032127701	Emotional symptoms are secondary to the voice disorder in patients with spasmodic dysphonia	The aims of this study were to evaluate the emotional status and life quality of the patients with spasmodic dysphonia (SD) before and after botulinum toxin treatment, and to ascertain whether SD is a somatoform disorder. Ten patients with spasmodic dysphonia were injected unilaterally into the vocal cord with botulinum toxin. Before botulinum toxin treatment, two clinician's rating scales - Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and three self-rating psychometrics - Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Life Quality Scale (GHQ/QL-12), and Symptom Distress Checklist (SCL-90) were applied. Self-rating scales were also administered in 20 matched normal controls. The patients were reevaluated 1 month after botulinum toxin treatment. The Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) was also rated by the patients themselves and a speech pathologist. The mean scores of SD patients were significantly higher than that of controls in SDS, and subscales of somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism in SCL-90. The mean score of GHQ/QL-12 was significantly higher in the control group. The scores of HDRS, SDS, GHQ/QL-12 and subscales of somatization, depression, and anxiety in SCL- 90 showed significant improvement after botulinum treatment. In CGI, seven patients were rated as improved by patients themselves and the speech pathologist. The patients with SD had more anxiety, depression and somatization symptoms, and poor life quality than normal controls. Their emotional status and life quality improved after botulinum toxin treatment. The results suggest that the emotional symptoms of patients with SD are mainly secondary to voice disorder.

23844546188	The evolution of contrast enhancement in granulomatous amebic encephalitis	In the literature, variable enhanced patterns in cases of granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) have been reported. The reason for this variety is still unknown. We report a case of GAE in whom serial images showed different enhanced patterns as the lesions evolved. The enhanced pattern was nodular or gyriform at its early stage, became ring-like as the lesions enlarged and at its late stage, developed into a heterogeneous pattern. We concluded that the variable enhanced patterns seen in GAE might correspond to the evolution of the lesions. Realizing the serial changes may help us in the early diagnosis and treatment of this fatal disease. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

29844432320	DYT1 mutation in a cohort of Taiwanese primary dystonias	To investigate the DYT1 gene mutation in Chinese ethnic, we examined a series of 200 patients with primary dystonias (11 familial and 189 sporadic), 53 of their asymptomatic relatives, 97 patients with familial or early-onset parkinsonism, and 200 healthy subjects. The GAG deletion at codon 946 was only found in three sporadic dystonia patients and seven of their asymptomatic familial members. The frequency of GAG deletion was 1.5% in dystonia patients, and was 6.7% in early-onset dystonias (≦26 years). We conclude that DYT1 mutation is a minor cause of primary dystonias in a cohort of Taiwanese population. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33746079596	A common missense variant in the LRRK2 gene, Gly2385Arg, associated with Parkinson's disease risk in Taiwan	Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are a cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether LRRK2 variants influence susceptibility to the commoner, sporadic forms of PD remains largely unknown. Data are particularly limited concerning the Asian population. In search for novel, biologically relevant variants, we sequenced the LRRK2 coding region in Taiwanese patients with PD. Four newly identified variants and another variant recently found in a Taiwanese PD family were tested for association with the disease in a sample of 608 PD cases and 373 ethnically matched controls. Heterozygosity for the Gly2385Arg variant was significantly more frequent among PD patients than controls (nominal p value=0.004, corrected for multiple comparisons=0.012, gender- and age-adjusted odds ratio=2.24, 95% C.I.: 1.29-3.88); this variant was uniformly distributed across genders and age strata. Two novel variants, Met1869Val and Glu1874Stop, were found in one PD case each; their pathogenic role remains, therefore, uncertain. The remaining two novel variants (Ala419Val and Pro755Leu) were present with similar frequency in cases and controls, and were therefore, interpreted as disease-unrelated polymorphisms. Our findings suggest that the LRRK2 Gly2385Arg is the first identified, functionally relevant variant, which acts as common risk factor for sporadic PD in the population of Chinese ethnicity. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33750362215	Genetic and DAT imaging studies of familial parkinsonism in a Taiwanese cohort	We here summarize the results of genetic investigations on a series of 82 parkinsonian patients from 60 families in Taiwan. We found 13 parkin patients in 7 families (12%), 2 PINK1 sibs from 1 family, and 1 LRRK2 patient from 1 family with I2012T mutation. We also identified SCA2 in 8 patients from 5 families (8%) and SCA3 in 3 patients from 1 family, all presenting with parkinsonian phenotype. In the available patients with parkin, PINK1, SCA2 and SCA3, the dopamine transporter (DAT) scan revealed that the reduction of uptake was primarily observed in the bilateral putamen, basically sharing a similar pattern with that in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. We concluded that the genetic causes contributed to about 25% of our series of familial parkinsonism. The parkin mutations and SCA2 were the most frequent genetic causes in our series with Chinese ethnicity. The results of DAT scan indicated that bilateral putamen was essentially involved in various genetically-caused familial parkinsonism. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

Because the results were to be compared with previous observations, we employed the same scoring system. The clinical manifestations were foot dystonia, wide based gait, rigidity, and difficulty in walking backwards. Resting tremor was rarely seen, but tongue tremor was found in 2 patients. The asymmetry initially present in 2 patients persisted 18 years later. Measurements had previously revealed rapid progression in the initial 10 years. We found a plateau over the following decade. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34047108732	The after-effect of human theta burst stimulation is NMDA receptor dependent	Objective: To provide pharmacological evidence that the after-effects of theta burst stimulation (TBS) involve plasticity like changes in cortical synaptic connections, using the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine. Methods: We performed a double blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of memantine on the response of six healthy volunteers to TBS. We measured rest (RMT) and active (AMT) motor thresholds, and the amplitude of MEPs before and after continuous and intermittent TBS (cTBS/iTBS) after the administration of placebo or memantine. Results: Memantine had no effect on RMT and AMT, while it blocked the suppressive effect of cTBS and the facilitatory effect of iTBS. Conclusions: The effects of iTBS and cTBS rely on NMDARs to produce after-effects in the motor cortex of conscious humans. Significance: The NMDA dependency of the after-effects of TBS adds to the understanding of the underlying mechanism of TBS, and suggests that these after-effects are likely to involve plasticity like changes at synaptic connections in motor cortex. © 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

0032841216	Random X chromosome methylation patterns in the carriers with clinical phenotypic expressions of X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy	Objectives - We report the unusual phenotypic expression in 2 female carriers of a family with X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy (X- BSN). We analyze the methylation pattern of the androgen receptor (AR) gene to inspect the possibility of non-random X chromosome inactivation to be the underlying mechanism. Material and methods - Twenty-three members in 3 generations of a Taiwanese family were examined and studied for genomic DNA analysis. We analyzed the sequence of the first exon of the AR gene to identify the numbers of CAG repeats, and to determine the methylation pattern by using the restriction enzymes Hpa II and Hha I. Results - There were 3 probands and 5 carriers and 2 of the carriers manifested clinical symptoms. Sequence analysis revealed that the numbers of trinucleotide repeats ranged from 42 to 45 in one allele of the X-chromosome in the 5 female carriers. The restriction pattern of the Hpa II and Hha I recognizable sites of the X- chromosome indicated a random methylation. Conclusion - Our data suggest that molecular genetic studies are important in confirming the diagnosis of X-BSN and early detection of female carriers, and the random or non-random methylation pattern of the X-chromosome is not a determining factor for partial expression of the abnormal AR gene in some carriers.

39349090420	Effect of physiological activity on an NMDA-dependent form of cortical plasticity in human	Retention of motor learning can be enhanced or degraded by subsequent performance of a different task. Neurophysiologically this may reflect interference in synaptic plasticity by ongoing neural activity in the brain. Here we demonstrate that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) dependent aftereffects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) also are subject to interference effects, suggesting that it may be possible to investigate these basic mechanisms in the intact human brain. We measured the motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle after continuous or intermittent theta burst (cTBS/iTBS) forms of rTMS. In resting subjects, cTBS depressed MEPs and reduced SICI for about 20 min, whereas iTBS had the opposite effect. However, if subjects contracted the FDI during TBS, then effects on the MEP were abolished, although effects of cTBS on SICI remained. Contraction immediately after TBS enhanced the facilitatory effect of iTBS and reversed the usual inhibitory effect of cTBS into facilitation. Contraction 10 min after cTBS (iTBS not tested) had only a transient (3-4 min) effect on MEPs. These interactions with behavior may relate to mechanisms of interference between learning paradigms in human and be similar to effects on synaptic long-term potentiation/depression described in animal experiments. © The Author 2007.

41449083238	Abnormal cortical excitability with preserved brainstem and spinal reflexes in sialidosis type I	Objective: To examine neurophysiological evidence of functional involvement of the brainstem and spinal cord and motor cortical excitability in sialidosis type I, a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NEU1 gene. Methods: We investigated particular pathways in the brainstem, spinal cord and motor cortex in 12 genetically proven cases of sialidosis type I by assessing blink reflex recovery cycle (BR), spinal reciprocal inhibition (RI), input-output curves (I/O), short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF) and silent period (SP). Results: The BR and RI were normal. The slope of I/O was significantly increased, and SICI and the duration of SP were reduced in sialidosis patients. Conclusions: Despite reports of pathology involving brainstem and anterior horn neurones, there were no obvious abnormalities in spinal and brainstem reflexes in the present patients, suggesting that the major clinical effects may be caused by changes at a level above the brainstem. Significance: For the first time, the integrity of certain brainstem and spinal cord reflexes in addition to motor cortical facilitatory and inhibitory circuits has been assessed in genetically proven type I sialidosis. This provides new data to aid in understanding of the pathophysiology of motor system dysfunction in this condition. © 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

77954111693	Microstructural changes in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy: A diffusion tensor imaging study	Purpose: To determine whether progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is associated with specific diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) patterns of diffusivity, anisotropy, and coherence in functionally relevant brain areas. Materials and Methods: In all, 17 PSP patients and 17 controls were scanned using a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Patients were assessed in the off-medication condition using the Hoehn and Yahr staging and the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, motor subscale (UPDRS-III). Diffusion information were analyzed in relation to disease severity and subtypes. Results: Numerous changes in diffusion properties were identified in the subcortical areas. In the midbrain, fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased and MD (mean diffusivity) increased with disease progression. UPDRS-III scores correlated positively with both FA in the caudate and MD in the pons. DTI analysis of disease subtypes demonstrated significant differences between PSP-Parkinsonism and Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome in axial diffusivity values in the putamen and globus pallidus, as well as in intervoxel diffusion coherence values in themiddle cerebellar peduncle. Conclusion: Our findings, cautiously interpreted, demonstrate the advantage of using a functional imaging technique to aid in the specificity of defining more precisely the pathological processes taking place in white and gray matter regions in PSP. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77954194496	Asymmetric involvement in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Clinical, brain imaging, and electroencephalographic studies	Objective: To ascertain the characteristics of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and to determine the findings of electroencephalography (EEG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: We pooled patients at a hospital from 2000 to 2008, and classified them according to WHO diagnostic criteria as having probable or possible CJD. We retrospectively analyzed their clinical manifestations, brain MRI, and EEG findings to evaluate correlations among them. Results: In this study, 12 probable and 4 possible CJD patients were identified. Ten patients with probable CJD had asymmetric manifestations with hemiparesis, focal myoclonus, dystonia or apraxia; 9 had clinical manifestations mimicking the corticobasal syndrome. In contrast, neurological examinations did not show asymmetric signs in 4 patients with possible CJD. EEG showed a typical periodic sharp wave complex (PSWC) in 12 patients with probable CJD; most of them had bright signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging of the cortex and/or basal ganglia. There was a high tendency for asymmetric clinical manifestations that correlated with the presentation of PSWC and cortical lesions observed on the brain MRI scan. Conclusions: Our study indicates that asymmetric extrapyramidal symptoms/signs, in clinical features with characteristic abnormalities on MRI and EEG findings, might contribute to early diagnosis of sporadic CJD.

84867370167	Modulation of the Disturbed Motor Network in Dystonia by Multisession Suppression of Premotor Cortex	Daily sessions of therapeutic transcranial brain stimulation are thought to prolong or amplify the effect of a single intervention. Here we show in patients with focal hand dystonia that additional, new effects build up progressively over time, making it difficult to predict the effect of long term interventions from shorter treatment sessions. In a sham-controlled study, real or sham continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was given once daily for five consecutive days to dorsolateral premotor cortex (PMd). Five days of real, but not sham, premotor cTBS improved intracortical inhibition in primary motor cortex (M1) to a similar extent on day 1 and day 5. However 5 days of cTBS were required to restore the abnormal PMd-M1 interactions observed on day 1. Similarly, excessive M1 plasticity seen at baseline was also significantly reduced by five days of real premotor cTBS. There was only a marginal benefit on writing. The results show that additional, new effects, at sites distant from the point of stimulation, build up progressively over time, making it difficult to predict the effect of long term interventions from shorter treatment sessions. The results indicate that it may take many days of therapeutic intervention to rebalance activity in a complex network. © 2012 Huang et al.

41749104438	Restless legs syndrome	The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder to take possession of increasing attention. RLS is characterized by an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations, that occurs or worsen at rest and is relieved by activity. The symptoms of RLS have a major impact on nocturnal sleep and daytime functions. The clinical diagnostic criteria were established and published in 2003 by International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). All four essential criteria must be met for a positive diagnosis. However, RLS encompassed an idiopathic form of genetic or unknown origin and secondary forms associated with many causes. Special awareness should be kept for differential diagnosis such as uremia, iron deficiency anemia, polyneuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Polysomnography, actinography, L-dopa loading test, and suggested immobilization test (SIT) are helpful tools to reduce the diagnostic puzzle of false positive and false negative. Pathophysiological concepts of RLS are essentially based on the neuroimaging and neurophysiological data to assume a dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, possibly on the A11 neuron group localized in the hypothalamus. These neurons modulate spinal excitability and alter the sensory processing predominantly of leg afferents. Treatment may be closely linked to the dopaminergic system and iron metabolism. Dopaminergic stimulation with levodopa or dopamine agonists is the first choice in idiopathic restless legs syndrome, but the long-term adverse effect of augmentation should be carefully monitored.

46849086960	Analysis of the LRRK2 Gly2385Arg variant in primary dystonia and multiple system atrophy in Taiwan	The c.G7153A variant in the LRRK2 gene (protein effect: Gly2385Arg) is emerging as an important risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) in the Han Chinese and Japanese populations. The prevalence of this variant in other neurodegenerative diseases and movement disorders remains almost completely unexplored. Using MALDI-TOF, we studied the Gly2385Arg variant in a large cohort of patients with primary dystonia (n = 335) and a smaller series of patients with clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 57). The Gly2385Arg variant was identified in heterozygous state in 14 patients with primary dystonia (4.18%) and in three patients with MSA (5.26%). These frequencies do not differ statistically from that reported previously by us in Taiwanese controls (5%). We conclude that the Gly2385Arg variant is not associated with primary dystonia in Taiwan, supporting the specificity of the association between this variant and PD. Whether the Gly2385Arg variant modifies the risk for MSA deserves further study in larger samples. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

52649111119	The LRRK2 Arg1628Pro variant is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease in the Chinese population	The c.G4883C variant in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene (protein effect: Arg1628Pro) has been recently proposed as a second risk factor for sporadic Parkinson's disease in the Han Chinese population (after the Gly2385Arg variant). In this paper, we analyze the Arg1628Pro variant and the associated haplotype in a large sample of 1,337 Han subjects (834 patients and 543 controls) ascertained from a single referral center in Taiwan. In our sample, the Arg1628Pro allele was more frequent among patients (3.8%) than among controls (1.8%; p = 0.004, OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.29-3.52). Sixty heterozygous and two homozygous carriers of the Arg1628Pro variant were identified among the patients, of which only one was also a carrier of the LRRK2 Gly2385Arg variant. We also show that carriers of the Arg1628Pro variant share a common, extended haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. Parkinson's disease onset age was similar in patients who carried the Arg1628Pro variant and in those who did not carry it. Our data support the contention that the Arg1628Pro variant is a second risk factor for Parkinson's disease in the Han Chinese population. Adding the estimated effects of Arg1628Pro (population attributable risk [PAR] ∼4%) and Gly2385Arg variants (PAR ∼6%) yields a total PAR of ∼10%. © 2008 The Author(s).

63549100950	The effect of continuous theta burst stimulation over premotor cortex on circuits in primary motor cortex and spinal cord	Objective: To understand the effect of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) given to the premotor area, we studied the circuits within the primary motor cortex and spinal cord after cTBS over the dorsal premotor area (PMd). Methods: Three sets of parameters, including corticospinal excitability, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) and forearm reciprocal inhibition (RI) were tested. Results: Paralleling the effects of cTBS applied directly to the primary motor cortex, cTBS over the left PMd suppressed corticospinal excitability as measured by the change in the size of MEPs evoked by single pulse TMS over primary motor cortex. Premotor cTBS appeared to have a longer lasting, but no more powerful effect on corticospinal excitability than motor cTBS, however, unlike motor cTBS it had no effect on SICI or ICF. Finally, although premotor cTBS had no effect on spinal H-reflexes, it did reduce the third phase of RI between forearm extensor and flexor muscles. Conclusions: Premotor cTBS is a quick and useful way of modulating excitability in cortical and possibly subcortical motor circuits. Significance: Premotor cTBS can be used as an alternative to regular rTMS to evaluate cortical function, motor behaviours and the response to disease therapy. © 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

67651241755	A longitudinal study of Taiwanese Sialidosis type 1: An insight into the concept of cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome	Background and purpose: Sialidosis type 1 (ST-1) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited long-term follow-up report. This study is to document the chronological profile of ST-1. Methods: We perform serial analysis of 17 Taiwanese patients with ST-1 focusing on evolution of clinical features, electrophysiological findings, genetic studies, and neuroimage examinations. Results: All patients had a mutation at 554A→G in exon 3 of the NEU1 gene causing Ser182Gly substitution. Fifteen patients were homozygous. Two patients were heterozygous with novel mutations, 956C→T causing Ala319Val in one and 163C→T causing Gln55stop codon in the other. The neuraminidase activity was markedly decreased in all 11 available patients. Only three patients (17.6%) manifested the macular cherry-red spot. The majority of patients (82.3%) developed full-blown manifestation of myoclonus, ataxia, and seizures within 5 years. Abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials with giant cortical waves were found in all patients. Prolonged P100 peak latency of the visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were found in 16 patients (94.1%) in the early stage even without visual symptoms. Conclusion: ST-1 in Taiwanese population illustrates distinct characteristics of phenotype with infrequent cherry-red spot. We suggest to screen the NEU1 mutations in patients presenting action myoclonus with abnormal VEPs, even without macular cherry-red spots. © 2009 EFNS.

0035241251	Clinical and genetic studies on familial parkinsonism: The first report on a parkin gene mutation in a Taiwanese family	In summary, we reported clinical as well as genetic studies on autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms of young-onset familial parkinsonism. Clinical features in each group were essentially similar. In one out of three families with autosomal recessive inheritance, homozygous deletional mutation of exon 3 of the parkin gene was found. This is the first report on the presence of an exonic deletional mutation of parkin gene mutation among Taiwanese. Clinical as well as genetic implications of our observations are discussed.

77949952528	The prevalence of restless legs syndrome in Taiwanese adults	Aim: Few studies have examined the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in Asian populations, with existing data suggesting substantially lower rates of RLS in Asian populations compared with Caucasians. However, varying definitions of RLS as well as problematic methodology make conclusions about RLS prevalence in Asian populations difficult to interpret. The current study therefore examines the prevalence of RLS in Taiwanese adults. Methods: Subjects were 4011 Taiwanese residents over the age of 15 years. Data was collected using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system between 25 October 2006 and 6 November 2006. Results: The prevalence of RLS in Taiwanese adults was found to be 1.57%. In addition, individuals with RLS had a higher body mass index (BMI) and incidence of chronic conditions and comorbidities including insomnia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, arthritis, backache and mental illness. Women with RLS also had a higher incidence of post-menopausal syndrome. Conclusion: Findings from the current study suggest that the prevalence of RLS in Taiwan is 1.57% by telephone interview. Individuals with RLS had a higher incidence of chronic insomnia and many other chronic disorders. The association and long-term consequences of RLS with these chronic disorders warrants further longitudinal observation and study. © 2010 The Authors.

77951857856	Restoration of motor inhibition through an abnormal premotor-motor connection in dystonia	To clarify the rationale for using rTMS of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) to treat dystonia, we examined how the motor system reacts to an inhibitory form of rTMS applied to the PMd in healthy subjects and in a group of patients with focal hand dystonia and DYT1 gene carriers. Continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) with 300 and 600 pulses (cTBS300 and cTBS600) was applied to PMd, and its after-effects were quantified by measuring the amplitude of MEPs evoked by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1), short interval intracortical inhibition/facilitation (SICI/ICF) within M1, the third phase of spinal reciprocal inhibition (RI), and writing tests. In addition, in DYT1 gene carriers, the effects of cTBS300 over M1 and PMd on MEPs were studied in separate experiments. In healthy subjects, cTBS300 and cTBS600 over PMd suppressed MEPs for 30 min or more and cTBS600 decreased SICI and RI. In contrast, neither form of cTBS over PMd had any significant effect on MEPs, while cTBS600 increased effectiveness of SICI and RI and improved writing in patients with writer's cramp. NMDYT1 had a normal response to cTBS300 over left PMd. We suggest that the reduced PMd to M1 interaction in dystonic patients is likely to be due to reduced excitability of PMd-M1 connections. The possible therapeutic effects of premotor rTMS may therefore involve indirect effects of PMd on SICI and RI, which this study has shown can be normalised by cTBS. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society.

77952682136	High frequency of multiexonic deletion of the GCH1 gene in a Taiwanese cohort of dopa-response dystonia	Large deletions in the GCH1 gene have been reported in a minority of cases of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). In this study, we performed an extensive clinical and genetic investigation of 22 affected members in eight families. Sequence analysis revealed five different mutations in five families (n = 10); Ser81-Pro (novel), Ser76X, Gly203Arg, 249del A, and IVS5 + 3insT. Applying multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, we detected a large heterozygous deletion of exons 1-3 in the remaining three families (n = 12), which was verified by quantitative real-timePCRanalysis. Therefore, the large deletion accounted for 37.5% of the total families and 55% of our DRD population. The deletion appeared to have high penetrance and was associated with multifocal dystonia and adult onset in males. Adult-onset patients were commonly presenting with resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, indistinguishable fromthose in Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, a high frequency of multi-exonic deletion of GCH1 was identified in the Taiwanese DRD population. By dosage analysis, we were able to detect a mutation in all patients. Our study demonstrates that dosage analysis is necessary for molecular diagnostics in DRD patients of Han Chinese ethnicity. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77953873397	Acute neuroborreliosis with involvement of the central nervous system	Background: Lyme neuroborreliosis has not been previously reported in Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to describe the important characteristics of Lyme neuroborreliosis caused by Borrelia burgdorferi-like species in Taiwanese patients. Methods: Patients with acute neurological symptoms without a clear explanation during September 2005 to December 2008 were enrolled. All patients received extensive auxiliary investigations, including clinical evaluation by neurological examination, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, serological screening tests of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by indirect immunofluorescent assay, and Western immunoblot analysis conducted for seroreactivities in serum and CSF of Borrelia burgdorferi-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. Results: Eleven patients who presented with acute central nervous system (CNS) syndrome fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for neuroborreliosis. In the CSF studies, lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevation of total protein and normal glucose was noted in 9 patients. The clinical syndromes were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological studies. Ten of 11 patients were found to have brain stem or spinal cord lesions on neuroimaging studies, and 8 patients had concomitant peripheral nervous system involvement with electrophysiological evidence of multiple root lesions with an acute or subacute course. Conclusions: Lyme neuroborreliosis presenting as acute CNS syndrome with peripheral nervous system involvement simultaneously in the disease course, especially acute myelopolyradiculitis, in Taiwan is different from Lyme neuroborreliosis seen in Europe and North America. The treatment outcome is variable and based on the severity of initial neurological deficits, early diagnosis, and early management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77955063970	Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease: Two cases of dopa-responsive juvenile parkinsonism with drug-induced dyskinesia	There are very few conditions that present with dopa-responsive juvenile parkinsonism. We present two such children with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) who had an initial good levodopa response that was soon complicated by disabling dopa-induced dyskinesia. One child was diagnosed by rectal biopsy in life, and the other diagnosis was confirmed at postmortem. In this patient, dopamine transporter imaging showed severely decreased binding of the radiotracer in the striatum on both sides. Bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation in this patient produced initial improvement, but this was not sustained. Both patients died within 10 years of symptom onset. As well as levodopa responsiveness with rapid onset of dyskinesia, clues to the diagnosis of NIID in patients presenting with parkinsonism include the presence of gaze-evoked nystagmus, early onset dysarthria and dysphagia and oculogyric crises. Differential diagnosis of clinical symptoms and neuropathological findings are discussed including the approach to rectal biopsy for early diagnosis. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society.

77956467119	Reversal of plasticity-like effects in the human motor cortex	A number of experiments in animals have shown that successful induction of plasticity can be abolished if an individually ineffective intervention is given shortly afterwards. Such effects are termed depotentiation/de-depression. These effects contrast with metaplasticity/homeostatic plasticity in which pretreatment of the system with one protocol modulates the response to a second plasticity-inducing protocol. Homeostatic plasticity maintains the balance of plasticity in the nervous system at a stable level whereas depotentiation/de-depression abolishes synaptic plasticity that has just occurred in order to prevent ongoing learning. In the present study, we developed novel protocols to explore the reversal of LTP- and LTD-like effects in healthy conscious humans based on the recently developed theta burst form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS). The potentiation effect induced by intermittent TBS (iTBS) was completely erased by a short form of continuous TBS (cTBS150) given 1 min after iTBS, whereas the depressive effect of continuous TBS (cTBS) was successfully abolished by a short form of iTBS (iTBS150). The reversal was specific to the nature of the second protocol and was time dependent since it was less effective when the intervention was given 10 min after induction of plasticity. All these features are compatible with those of depotentiation and de-depression demonstrated in animal studies. The development of the present protocols would be helpful to study the physiology of the reversal of plasticity and learning and to probe the abnormal depotentiation/de-depression shown in animal models of neurological diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease with dyskinesia, dystonia and Huntingon's disease). © 2010 The Authors.

77958151334	Large SGCE deletion contributes to Taiwanese myoclonus-dystonia syndrome	We report three novel deletions of the SGCE gene in three families with myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) syndrome in Taiwan. Their clinical characteristics included: early onset, dominant myoclonus and dystonia in the neck, trunk and upper limbs. By direct sequencing of the SGCE gene coding regions, we identified a small heterozygous deletion (c.842delA) in exon 7 of the three sibs and asymptomatic father in the first family and an eight-base heterozygous deletion (c.524_531del) in exon 5 of the mother and a daughter in the second family. Using multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a large heterozygous deletion of 2-11 exons was identified in the father and a son in the third family which was undetected by initial sequencing. It is the largest intragenic deletion ever reported. In conclusion, we have identified three novel mutations of SGCE in the respective three M-D families. The large deletion was responsible for one third of these M-D families which might implicate an important contribution to Taiwanese M-D syndrome. We suggest that the contribution of large deletion should be further verified in a large cohort of patients with M-D syndrome in Han Chinese. © 2010.

78650174666	Analysis of the UCHL1 genetic variant in Parkinson's disease among Chinese	The inverse association of the functional ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) S18Y variant with Parkinson's disease (PD) among Caucasian populations has been debated. We conducted a large-scale analysis to investigate the age-of-onset effect of the UCHL1 variant in PD among ethnic Chinese. Individual data sets from 5 centers comprising a total of 4088 study subjects were analyzed. In the univariate analysis, only data from 1 center showed a trend towards a protective effect among young subjects. However, in the combined analysis, no significant association between the UCHL1 variant and PD was detected (A allele frequency 0.531 vs. 0.528, p=0.87, OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92-1.1). Among subjects less than 60 years old, the OR is 0.99 (95% CI 0.84-1.16, p=0.88). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that family history, UCHL1 variant and the interaction of UCHL1 variant and age at onset (p=0.816) were not significantly associated with PD. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

79953029602	The theoretical model of theta burst form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation	Objective: Theta burst stimulation, a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, can induce lasting changes in corticospinal excitability that are thought to involve long-term potentiation/depression (LTD/LTD)-like effects on cortical synapses. The pattern of delivery of TBS is crucial in determining the direction of change in synaptic efficiency. Previously we explained this by postulating (1) that a single burst of stimulation induces a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory effects and (2) those effects may cascade to produce long-lasting effects. Here we formalise those ideas into a simple mathematical model. Methods: The model is based on a simplified description of the glutamatergic synapse in which post-synaptic Ca

0036315882	Environmental risk factors of young onset Parkinson's disease: A case-control study	While the cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown, recent evidence suggests certain environmental factors, such as well water drinking, herbicides and pesticides exposure, and neurotoxins, may trigger the chain of oxidative reactions culminating in the death of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra to cause parkinsonism. Most studies to date focused on PD with old age onset. However, there is a peculiar group of parkinsonian patients, the young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD), in whom the age of onset is before 40. It is intriguing to know whether earlier exposure to the putative neurotoxin(s) may contribute to the earlier onset. We therefore conducted this case-control study in which 60 PD patients, 30 YOPD patients and the same number of age- and sex-matched young controls were included. Using logistic regression, we found well water drinking and head injury were risk factors for the development of YOPD. When YOPD patients were compared with PD, we found head injury and exercise were the significant predictors. Keeping all other variables constant, head injury was a risk factor and exercise appeared to be a protective factor. We conclude early exposure to well water drinking and head trauma may trigger and expedite the appearance of parkinsonian features, but such acceleration may be prevented through regular exercise. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

80052009184	Abnormal bidirectional plasticity-like effects in Parkinson's disease	Levodopa-induced dyskinesia is a major complication of long-term dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease that becomes increasingly problematic in advanced Parkinson's disease. Although the cause of levodopa-induced dyskinesias is still unclear, recent work in animal models of the corticostriatal system has suggested that levodopa-induced dyskinesias might result from abnormal control of synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we aimed to explore control of plasticity in patients with Parkinson's disease with and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias by taking advantage of a newly developed protocol that tests depotentiation of pre-existing long-term potentiation-like synaptic facilitation. Long-term potentiation-like plasticity and its reversibility were studied in the motor cortex of 10 healthy subjects, 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesias, who took half of the regular dose of levodopa and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease without levodopa-induced dyskinesias, who took either half or the full dose of levodopa. Patients with Parkinson's disease without levodopa-induced dyskinesias had normal long-term potentiation-and depotentiation-like effects when they took their full dose of levodopa, but there was no long-term potentiation-like effect when they were on half dose of levodopa. In contrast, patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesias could be successfully potentiated when they were on half their usual dose of levodopa; however, they were unresponsive to the depotentiation protocol. The results suggest that depotentiation is abnormal in the motor cortex of patients with Parkinson's disease with levodopa-induced dyskinesias and that their long-term potentiation-like plasticity is more readily affected by administration of levodopa than their clinical symptoms. © 2011 The Author.

80052800116	Contribution of glucocerebrosidase mutation in a large cohort of sporadic Parkinson's disease in Taiwan	Background and purpose: The association between glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations and Parkinson's disease (PD) is attracting increased attention worldwide. In patients of Chinese ethnicity, other than the common L444P mutation, a few mutations have been reported. However, the contribution of GBA to PD can be answered only by a thorough investigation of its mutations in a unique large population. Methods: We enrolled 1747 participants: 967 PD patients and 780 healthy individuals. We screened entire GBA coding regions and exon-intron boundaries in 30 randomly chosen PD patients, followed by testing five variants (L444P, D409H, R120W, L174P, and Q497R) in all participants. The G2385R and R1628P in LRRK2 had been previously studied in almost all participants. Results: In total, 36 patients (3.72%) carried a heterozygous mutant GBA allele (27 L444P, 7 RecNciI, and 2 D409H). Only two controls (0.26%) carried heterozygous GBA mutation (1 L444P and 1 RecNciI). In PD group, the mean age at onset in carriers was younger than in non-carriers. The difference in percentage of mutation frequencies between patients and controls was highly significant for the L444P mutation (P<0.0001). One L444P carrier was also associated with LRRK2 G2385R variant, but no atypical Parkinsonism was observed. Conclusions: The present study ascertains that L444P mutation in GBA gene may contribute to an earlier onset of development of PD in Han/Chinese population. Following LRRK2 variants, GBA is the second most frequent mutations indicated for sporadic PD development in the Han/Chinese population. These GBA carriers are associated with an earlier onset of Parkinsonism. © 2011 The Author(s). European Journal of Neurology © 2011 EFNS.

84155164899	Clinical characteristics of essential tremor in Taiwan: An exploratory-comparative study	Background: There are few large-scale clinical analyses of essential tremor (ET) in Asia. We studied the detailed clinical profile with emphasizing the age of onset, tremor location, specific tremor patterns, and rate of progression (ROP) to delineate the characteristics of Taiwanese ET patients and found the difference between the Taiwanese and the Caucasians ET patients. Methods: All ET patients fulfilled the Movement Disorders Society diagnosis criteria were investigated with a standardized assessment protocol, which including clinical evaluation, uniform severity scoring, self-reported questionnaires, accelerometry, surface electromyography, and videotaped tremor examination. Results: Of 219 patients recruited from July 2008 to October 2009, 153 completed the study protocol. Their mean age was 58.9years and 47% were women, and 33.3% had family history (FH). There was bimodal distribution in age of tremor onset in patients without but not in those with FH. Head tremor (HT) was present in 48 of 153 (31%) patients. Patients with HT showed slower tremor frequency and less ROP than those without HT. Sixty-seven (44%) patients presented with intention tremor (IT). Male gender and voice tremor were predictive factors of IT occurrence. Conclusions: Comparing with the Caucasians, Taiwanese ET patients have different patterns of onset-age distribution and lack of female predominance in ET with HT. However, patients with IT and without HT also progressed more rapid as found in the Caucasian. © 2011 The Author(s). European Journal of Neurology © 2011 EFNS.

84862959258	PLA2G6 mutations in PARK14-linked young-onset parkinsonism and sporadic Parkinson's disease	Mutations of PLA2G6 gene have been lately proposed to be the causative gene for PARK14 in patients with autosomal recessive young-onset parkinsonism (YOPD). The role of PLA2G6 mutations as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease is not clear. To study the PLA2G6 mutations in PARK14-linked patients and its association with the onset of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD), sequencing and gene dosage analyses were carried out in 25 patients (onset age ≦30 years) then the identified variants were assessed in 956 sporadic PD (sPD) patients and 802 age-matched healthy controls. Four genetic variants were identified; one patient had homozygous c.991G>T (p.Asp331Tyr) mutation, two had compound heterozygous c.991G>T/c.1077G>A (p.Met358IlefsX) mutation, one had single c.1976A>G (p.Asn659Ser) mutation, and one patient had an exon 1 hetero-deletion. The c.1077G>A mutation resulted in a 4-bp deletion in leukocyte mRNA by activating a cryptic splice site in exon 7. Only p.Asp331Tyr was identified in four sPD patients and four controls. The onset age for PLA2G6 mutation carriers was younger than that for sPD (29.86±8.59 vs. 56.84±11.33 years, P=0.0002). The analysis of previously reported PARK14 patients revealed that those who carried a truncated mutation tended to have a complicated phenotype and atrophies of cortex and cerebellum. In conclusion, PLA2G6 mutation was the second common genetic cause after PRKN mutation in our YOPD patients and might be a risk factor for early-onset PD in Han Chinese. Additionally, mutation data should be interpreted carefully because even a synonymous mutation could cause abnormal mRNA splicing. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84867885878	Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia: Clinical and genetic analysis of a Taiwanese family	Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is a rare disorder in autosomal dominant inheritance. The clinical features and genetic findings of PNKD, rarely described in the Asians, were mostly delineated from European families. The present study characterized the clinical and genetic findings of a Taiwanese PNKD family. The clinical features of our five patients in successive three generations included onset age less than 10 years, attack duration between 3 min and 4 h, and a variety of aura symptoms. The attacks were provoked not by sudden action but by emotional stress, caffeine, fatigue, heavy exercise and sleep deprivation. Sleep could abolish or diminish the attack and the attacks responded well to clonazepam. Sequencing the whole coding region of PNKD/MR-1 gene identified a heterozygous c.20C>T (p.Ala7Val) mutation which was clearly segregated in the five affected patients. Comparing our patients with previously reported 18 families with PNKD/MR-1 mutations, the majority of the patients exhibited quite similar manifestations in attack patterns and precipitating factors. The recurrent conservative mutations in different ethnicities indicate importance in the pathogenesis of PNKD. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84873719976	Genetic variants of SNCA and LRRK2 genes are associated with sporadic PD susceptibility: A replication study in a Taiwanese cohort	Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative diseases and usually refers to a complex disorder with multiple genetic and environmental factors influencing disease risk. We here performed a gene-based case-control association study to scrutinize whether genetic variants in SNCA and LRRK2 genes could predispose to sporadic, late-onset form of PD in Taiwanese population. Methods: 17 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) markers located within SNCA gene as well as the 16 SNP markers within LRRK2 gene were chosen for genotyping and evaluated their haplotype structure in a cohort of sporadic PD patients and control individuals. Results: This study showed that two SNPs near the promoter region (rs2301134 and rs2301135) of SNCA gene gave the greatest evidence for an association with PD (p ≤ 0.01) and a haplotype block with two SNPs in the 3' UTR (rs356221 and rs11931074) revealed another evidence of association (p ≤ 0.02). For the LRRK2 gene, only R1628P variants of total 16 SNPs giving a marginal significant association with PD across the whole gene (p = 0.0058) and no haplotype block was constructed. Many genetic variants (A419V, I1122V, R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C, M1869. V, M1869T, I2012T, G2019S, and I2020T) from previous reports were not detected in our cohort. Conclusions: We have replicated a population-based PD association study in a collection of 626 cases and 473 control subjects and confirm that genetic variants of both SNCA and LRRK2 genes are associated with susceptibility to sporadic PD but in a different distribution. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84881309935	Reduced postmovement cortical inhibition in patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia	Objective: To characterize movement-related neural oscillatory activity and to clarify its neurophysiologic role in paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD). Methods: We recorded neuromagnetic event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) activities in response to a self-paced finger-lifting task in 16 patients with PKD and 17 healthy controls. Results: The amplitude of a-ERD was comparable between the healthy controls and patients with PKD, whereas either the contralateral or ipsilateral b-ERS was decreased. The peak latency of contralateral b-ERS was delayed in patients with PKD. Patients with less frequent dyskinetic attacks demonstrated a larger ipsilateral b-ERS. Moreover, some patients with PKD revealed a lesser degree of contralateral preponderance of b-ERS generation. Conclusions: The present data imply a decreased postmovement inhibition of motor cortex in patients with PKD, and the inhibitory function in the contralateral hemisphere is more affected than that in the ipsilateral hemisphere. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.

Methods: Whole-head magnetoencephalography was used to record the somatosensory evoked fields elicited by paired-pulse electric stimulation of the median nerve in 15 patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia and in a control group of 18 age-matched, healthy volunteers. Twelve of the patients were studied in both the drug-off and drug-on state. Results: The paired-pulse inhibition ratios of the primary somatosensory cortical P35m responses and the secondary somatosensory cortical responses were significantly greater in drug-off patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia compared with either the drug-on patients or the control group. No significant difference in paired-pulse inhibition ratio was observed between the drug-on patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia and the control group. Conclusions: In patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, intracortical inhibition of the primary and secondary somatosensory cortical areas is impaired, and the associated hyperexcitable phenomenon is modulatable by antiepileptic drugs. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

84898059133	Reduced cortical plasticity and GABAergic modulation in essential tremor	Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder among adults. Cerebellar dysfunction is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of ET; however, imaging, electrophysiological studies, and clinical observations have suggested that the cerebral cortex also may participate. We sought to investigate the possible motor cortical contribution to ET by assessing response to continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a recognized tool that can produce transient plastic changes, in the primary motor and premotor cortex of patients with ET. We compared parameters, including motor-evoked potential amplitude, cortical silent period, and short-interval intracortical inhibition, before and after applying cTBS in healthy controls and patients with ET. We found that, although cTBS applied to either the motor or premotor cortex was capable of producing a suppressive effect on motor cortical excitability in ET patients, the effects lasted for a significantly shorter time compared with the effect produced in healthy individuals. The change seen in measures of intracortical inhibition after motor cortical or premotor cTBS in healthy controls was reduced or absent in the ET patients. Tremor amplitude was decreased significantly after applying cTBS over either the motor or premotor cortex, but the tremor frequency remained unchanged. These findings suggest that inhibitory circuits within the motor cortex are aberrant and less modifiable in ET patients. The reduced plasticity in response to motor and premotor TBS supports the theory of abnormal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulation in ET. © 2014 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

84901292510	Reduced motor cortex deactivation in individuals who suffer from writer's cramp	This study investigated the neuromagnetic activities of self-paced finger lifting task and electrical median nerve stimulation in ten writer's cramp patients and fourteen control subjects. The event-related de/synchronizations (ERD/ERS) of beta-band activity levels were evaluated and the somatosensory cortical activity levels were analyzed using equivalent-current dipole modeling. No significant difference between the patients and control subjects was found in the electrical stimulation-induced beta ERS and electrical evoked somatosensory cortical responses. Movement-related beta ERD did not differ between controls and patients. Notably, the amplitude of the beta ERS after termination of finger movement was significantly lower in the patients than in the control subjects. The reduced movement-related beta ERS might reflect an impairment of motor cortex deactivation. In conclusion, a motor dependent dysregulation of the sensorimotor network seems to be involved in the functional impairment of patients with writer's cramp. © 2014 Tseng et al.

84905393826	Comparison of activities of daily living impairments in Parkinson's disease patients as defined by the Pill Questionnaire and assessments by neurologists	Objectives: To compare the clinical judgment of experienced neurologists after interviewing Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and their caregivers with the use of the Pill Questionnaire to determine the presence of impairments on activities of daily living (ADL). Background: ADL impairment is a criterion for the diagnosis of dementia associated with PD. The Pill Questionnaire has been recommended as a screening tool to assess ADL impairment in PD patients, but its usefulness and validity have not been fully investigated. Methods: We recruited idiopathic PD patients from 12 hospitals in Taiwan, and the patients underwent clinical assessments, a neuropsychological test battery and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale evaluation. The Pill Questionnaire was administered by study assistants. Patient and caregiver interviews were performed by experienced neurologists who were blinded to the Pill Questionnaire results. Results: In total, 284 PD patients (mean age 71.8±9 years, mean education 8.7±5.3 years, mean disease duration 5.4±5.3 years) were recruited. 63 patients showed ADL impairment by the Pill Questionnaire, and 108 patients showed ADL impairment by neurologists' clinical interviews. κ Statistics showed moderate agreement between the two methods (κ=0.521, p<0.001). Of the 108 patients who were diagnosed with ADL impairment by neurologists, only 56 patients (51.9%) showed impairment according to the Pill Questionnaire. Most of the missed patients had milder cognitive impairment and lower motor disability. Conclusions: A comprehensive interview is essential to determine the presence of ADL impairment in PD patients, especially in patients with early PD.
