84940337319	Meta analysis of flexion, extension and rotation of wrist joint in the elderly with distal radius fractures after treatment	BACKGROUND: At present, it remains controversial whether open reduction plate fixation is needed for distal radius fracture in the elderly to restore anatomic reduction of imaging. OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the curative effects of operative and nonoperative treatments for distal radius fractures in the elderly. METHODS: We retrieved PubMed, Springer and Wanfang database using computer. Relevant English and Chinese journals of orthopedics were retrieved by hand. All literatures on curative effects of operative and nonoperative treatments for distal radius fractures in the elderly were collected. RevMan 5.0 software provided by Cochrane was used to statistically analyze the data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Six literatures were included, including two of randomized controlled study and four of retrospective cohort study. Meta-analysis results displayed that there were no significant differences in both groups in range of motion of wrist joint extension [mean difference (MD)=-0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-3.31, 1.58), P=0.49], range of motion of wrist joint flexion [MD=-2.79, 95%CI(-6.47, 0.88), P=0.14], range of motion of wrist pronation [MD=-0.08, 95%CI(-1.49, 1.64), P=0.92], range of motion of supination [MD=-0.7, 95% CI(-3.52, 2.12), P=0.63] and the occurrence of complication [MD=1.35, 95%CI(0.71, 2.56), P=0.36]. The length of radius in the surgery group was similar to that of normal [MD=2.46, 95%CI(1.78, 3.15), P < 0.01]. Ulnar inclination [MD=3.73, 95%CI(2.97, 4.48), P < 0.000 01] and palmar tilt angle [MD=6.81, 95%CI(3.72, 9.90), P < 0. 000 1] in the surgery group were close to that of normal. There are no significant differences in extension, flexion, pronation and supination activities of wrist and posttreatment complication between two groups. Operative treatment result is superior to that of nonoperative treatment in anatomic reduction.

16844368012	Effect of preoperative use of long-acting octreotide on growth hormone secreting pituitary adenoma and transsphenoidal surgery	Objective: To investigate whether somatostatin analog octreotide long acting release (LAR) shrinks growth hormone (GH) secreting adenomas, and improves the results of subsequent transsphenoidal surgery. Methods: Seventeen previously untreated active acromegalic patients with pituitary adenomas were treated with LAR (30 mg intramuscular injection every 28 days) for 3 months prior to transsphenoidal surgery. Clinical reaction, mean GH secretion, and tumor volume were measured under basal conditions and after LAR treatment. Results: Presurgical treatment improved acromegaly symptoms and induced a significant reduction of GH under the 5 ng/mL limit in microadenoma (P < 0.05), while only 18.2% (2/11) in macroadenoma. Meanwhile, tumor shrinkage occurred in 58.8% (10/17) patients, with 1 case in the microadenoma group. All marked shrinkage (> 25%) occurred in the macroadenoma group. Statistical analysis showed tumor shrinkage caused by LAR was greater in macroadenoma group than that in microadenoma group (P < 0.05). During operation, adenoma was soft in 15 cases, with the exception of 2 cases in which the soft tumor was divided by fibrous septa, but all tumor removal was smooth. Conclusions: A short term administration of preoperative LAR may induce a significant decrease in GH-secretion level and adenoma volume. Presurgical use of octreotide LAR improves surgical results especially in macroadenomas.

0030345811	Carotenoid Analysis of Several Dark-Green Leafy Vegetables Associated with a Lower Risk of Cancers	We have examined the carotenoid contents of several dark green vegetables found to be associated with a lower risk of various epithelial cancers in our epidemiological study and animal study. Samples of these vegetables were quantitatively examined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C-18 reversed-phase column for individual carotenoid content. Pure reference compounds (alpha-carotene, beta-carotent, lycopene, canthaxanthin, and lutein) and internal standard (beta-Apo-8′-carotenal) were employed to quantify xanthophylls and carotenes in these vegetables. The results indicated that fresh, dark-green, leafy vegetables were high in beta-carotene (0.94-9.36 mg/100 g) and oxygenated carotenoids or xanthophylls, primarily lutein (0.94-7.39 mg/100 g), whereas lycopene and alpha-carotene were not prominent and canthaxanthin was non existent in these vegetables. These analyses suggest that consumption of carotenoids such as lutein in addition to beta-carotene may be associated with a lower risk of cancers.

23844547937	Olanzapine attenuates the okadaic acid-induced spatial memory impairment and hippocampal cell death in rats	It is hypothesized that olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has beneficial effects on cognitive impairment and neuropathological changes in treating neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic administration of olanzapine on the spatial memory impairment and hippocampal cell death induced by the direct injection of okadaic acid (OA), a potent neurotoxin, into the rat hippocampus. After being pretreated with olanzapine (0.5 or 2 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 2 weeks, the rats were unilaterally microinjected with OA (100 ng) into the hippocampus, and then were continuously administrated with olanzapine for an additional week. The rats were trained on a spatial memory task in an eight-arm radial maze before OA administration, and tested on the same task 18 h after the last olanzapine injection. After the behavioral test, the rats were killed for Niss1 staining and terminal deoxynucleutidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated DTP nick end labeling staining. OA significantly induced spatial memory impairment, and caused pyramidal cell loss in the CA1 and apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus. Olanzapine significantly attenuated OA-induced spatial memory impairment and the OA-induced neuropathological changes in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that olanzapine may have therapeutic effects in treatment of cognitive impairment and neuropathological changes of schizophrenia and other neurodegenerative diseases. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

27144446397	Institutional and structural forms of HIV-related discrimination in health care: A study set in Beijing	This paper presents key findings of a situational analysis of institutional and structural levels of HIV/AIDS-related discrimination in Beijing, China, with a focus on the area of health care. Initially slow to respond to the presence of HIV, China has altered its approach and enacted strict legislative protection for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). In order to determine whether this has altered discrimination against PLWHA, this study examined existing legislation and policy, and interviewed key informants working in health care and PLWHA. The overall findings revealed that discrimination in its many forms continued to occur in practice despite China's generally strong legislative protection, and it is the actual practice that is hindering PLWHAs' access to health services. A number of legislative and policy gaps that allow discrimination to occur in practice were also identified and discussed. The paper concludes with a call to rectify specific gaps between legislation, policy and practice. An understanding of the underlying factors that drive discrimination will also be necessary for effective strategic interventions to be developed and implemented. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

2942659809	System characterization of optical ASK/DPSK orthogonal modulation for supervisory information dissemination	Recently, optical differential phase shift keying (DPSK) has attracted much interest in high-speed optical transmission systems. It features constant intensity and thus is less vulnerable to the fiber nonlinearities. In addition to high-speed data transmission, it is desirable to carry relatively low-speed supervisory information simultaneously to facilitate the system monitoring and network management. In this paper, we propose and investigate an orthogonal modulation scheme for carrying relatively low bit-rate supervisory amplitude shift keying (ASK) data on a high-speed (10-Gb/s) optical DPSK data stream. The supervisory data is amplitude-modulated onto the constant intensity optical DPSK signal, thus no dedicated time slots are needed and this eliminates the bandwidth overhead. We investigate both experimentally and numerically the optimized operation conditions for such orthogonal modulation. The results suggest the design guidelines of the proposed ASK/DPSK orthogonal modulation for supervisory information dissemination.

33745211933	Comparison between transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound and microvessel density in ovarian tumors	Objective: To study the clinical value of vascular pathology of transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography (TVCDU) in differentiating benign and malignant ovarian tumors and analyzing the relations of tumor blood supply to clinical stages. Methods: Sixty-one ovarian tumors (38 malignant, 5 borderling tumors, 18 benign) were examined preoperatively with TVCDU. The blood flow indices (RD were measured quantitatively. After operation, all the slices of tumor tissue specimens were stained immunohistochemistry with anti-34 antibody, and microvessel density (MVD) was calculated. The malignant ovarian tumors were staged. The relations between the indices (RI and MVD) and clinical stages were also done statistically. Results: RI in 38 malignant ovarian tumors (0.44±0.13) was lower than that in 18 benign tumors (0.58±0.11) (0.11).(P<0.05). Using RI≤0.5 as a cutoff, the sensitivity and specificity in detecting malignant ovarian tumors were 89.5% and 78.3% respectively. RI in stage III and IV (0.39±0.05) was lower than that in stage I and II (0.45±0.13) (P<0.05). MVD in 38 malignant ovarian tumors ([37.5±18.221]/400 magnification) was higher than that in 18 benign ovarian tumors ([14.85±8.02]/400 magnification) (P<0.05). MVD in stage III and IV ([43.29±12.20]/400 magnification) was higher than that in stage I and II ([27.86±9.901]/400 magnification) (P<0.05). There were significant negative relations between RI and MVD in malignant ovarian tumors (r,=-0.412, P<0.01). Conclusion: TVCDU can evaluate the angiogenesis in ovarian tumors before operation and provide valuable evidence for the clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis.

33746105795	Clinical evaluation of high-risk HPV detection by hybrid capture II in screening cervical intraepithelial neoplasma	Objective: To evaluate the value of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) detection by Hybrid Capture II (HC2) in screening cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN). Methods: Totally 723 patients who had received a dual screening with thinprep cytologic test (TCT) and HC2 in our department were analyzed retrospectively. Among them, 350 patients received a triple examination with TCT, HC2, and colposcopic biopsy. Results: Among the 723 patients, the incidences of hrHPV infection with atypical squamous cell (ASC), low squamous intraepithelial lesion, and high squamous intraepithelial lesion were 70.7% (94/133), 88.9% (249/280), and 90.9% (90/99), respectively, significantly higher than 55.5% (117/211), the incidence of hrHPV infection with normal cytological results (P = 0.005, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Among 350 cases who were received triple examination, the incidence of hrHPV infection with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and CIN 2 were 88.9% (72/81) and 96.3% (52/54), significantly higher than 77.7% (153 /197), the incidence of hrHPV infection with normal pathological results (P = 0.03, P = 0.002); The incidence of hrHPV infection with CIN 3 and squamous cancer were 91.7% (11/12) and 100.0% (6/6), also higher than normal cases. Among these 350 cases, the incidence of hrHPV infection with ASC was 79.3% (69/87). The incidence of CIN 2-3 with ASC and hrHPV infection was 38.0%, significantly higher than the incidence of CIN 2-3 with ASC and without hrHPV infection (5.9%) (P = 0.04). Conclusion: hrHPV infection has a close relation with CIN, and the incidence of hrHPV infection increases along with the severity of CIN.

33746172720	Factors influencing the recurrence of Cushing's disease treated by transsphenoidal surgery	Objective: To explore factors influencing the recurrence of patients with Cushing's disease after transsphenoidal surgery. Methods: We retro spectively analyzed the clinical data of 182 patients treated by transsphenoidal surgery with Cushing's disease in our department in PUMC Hospital from 1992 to 2002. Results: The recurrence rates were significantly different when patients had different radiological findings (P = 0.001), operative methods (P = 0.001), histological findings (P = 0.04), and postoperative cortisol levels (P = 0.02); however, such difference was not found in term of tumor size (P = 0.43). Conclusion: Radiological findings, operative methods, histological findings, and postoperative cortisol estimates may be the factors influencing the recurrence of patients treated by transsphenoidal surgery.

33745868380	The effects of chronic administration of quetiapine on the methamphetamine-induced recognition memory impairment and dopaminergic terminal deficit in rats	Previous studies have suggested that quetiapine, a new atypical antipsychotic drug, may have beneficial effects on cognitive impairment and be a neuroprotectant in treating neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of chronic administration of quetiapine on methamphetamine (METH)-induced recognition memory impairment and dopaminergic terminal neurotoxicity in rats. Rats were pretreated with METH (5 mg/kg; s.c.) four times at 2-h intervals while their body temperature was monitored. Fifteen minutes after the last METH injection, rats were administered quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 28 days. One day after the last quetiapine injection, rats were trained and tested on an object recognition task on days 29 and 30. Finally, on day 31, rats were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry, 1 day after the object recognition task. METH induced hyperthermia, recognition memory impairment and a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the caudate putamen (CPu) of striatum. Quetiapine attenuated the METH-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, chronic post-treatment of quetiapine reversed the METH-induced memory impairment and dopaminergic terminal deficit. These findings suggest that quetiapine may have therapeutic effects in the treatment of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration induced by METH. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33947260013	In vivo tracking of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide after cerebral ischemia in rats by magnetic resonance imaging	Objective: To explore the feasibility of in vivo tracking of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in rats after cerebral ischemia, and to analyze the influence of stem cell therapy on the volume of cerebral infarction. Methods: The samples of rat bone marrow were collected. BMSCs separated by density gradient centrifugation were cultivated and harvested until the third passage. BMSCs were labeled with SPIO, which was mixed with poly-L-lysine. The labeling efficiency was evaluated by Prussian blue staining. Transient middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) was performed successfully in 18 adult Sprague-Dawley rats that scored from 6 to 12 by the modified neurological severity test. The 18 rats were then randomly divided into group A, B, and C, with 6 rats in each group and Group C was regarded as control group. BMSCs were injected into the contralateral cortex of is chemia in group A, ipsilateral corpora striata in group B, while D-Hank's solution was injected into ipsilateral corpora striata (group C) 24 hours after MCAO. MRI was performed 1 day after MCAO, 1 day and 14 days after transplantation. The volume of infarcted brain tissue was measured and analyzed. Prussian blue staining of brain tissues was performed to identify the migration of BMSCs. Results: The labeling efficiency of BMSCs with SPIO was 96%. The transplanted BMSCs migrated to the ischemic hemisphere along the corpus callosum and to the border of the infarction, which was confirmed by MRI and Prussian blue staining. The changes of infarction volume were not significantly different among these three groups. Conclusions: MRI is feasible for in vivo tracking of BMSCs labeled with SPIO in rats. The stem cell therapy may not be able to affect the volume of cerebral infarction.

34249689633	Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β protects dopaminergic neurons from MPTP toxicity	Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is closely involved in neuronal apoptosis and pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, whether GSK-3β mediates apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease remains elusive. In this study, using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinsonism models, we investigated whether MPTP induces apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons through a GSK-3β-dependent pathway. MPTP caused a rapid activation of GSK-3β, evidenced by the decrease in level of phospho-Ser9 of GSK-3β and the increase in level of phospho-Ser396 of tau, a known GSK-3β substrate. Blockage of GSK-3β activity by its two specific inhibitors, indirubin-3′-oxime and AR-A014418, prevented dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced apoptosis. Additionally, inhibition of GSK-3β activity restored the depletion of striatal dopamine and ameliorated behavioral impairments caused by MPTP. These results indicate that GSK-3β is a critical intermediate of MPTP neurotoxicity, and inhibition of GSK-3β may provide a novel strategy to treat Parkinson's disease. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

35348830412	p38 and JNK MAPK, but not ERK1/2 MAPK, play important role in colchicine-induced cortical neurons apoptosis	Colchicine is a microtubule interfering agent and is able to induce neural apoptosis. However, the intracellular pathway involved in its neurotoxicity is still unclear. In the present study, three of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were investigated in colchicine-induced apoptosis on cortical neurons for the first time. Our results showed that 1 μM colchicine administration in primarily cultured cortical neurons led to typical neuronal apoptosis, and the apoptosis was attenuated by taxol, a microtubule stabilizer. Moreover, activation of p38 MAPK was found for the first time, as well as that of JNK MAPK, but not of ERK1/2 MAPK, after colchicine exposure. Apoptosis was inhibited by p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole), SB239063 (trans-1-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-(fluorophenyl)-5-(2-methoxypyrimidin-4-yl) imidazole), and JNK MAPK pathway inhibitors, CEP11004 (9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3′,2′,1′-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid, 2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-5,16-bis[[(1-methylethyl)thio]methyl]-1-oxo-, methyl ester, (9S,10R,12R)-), SP600125 (anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one). However, PD98059 (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) and U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1, 4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene), ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitors, did not work. Furthermore, better neuronal protective effects were achieved by using JNK and the p38 MAPK inhibitors together as compared to that by using either alone. The results suggested that p38 MAPK, JNK MAPK, but not ERK1/2 MAPK may play pivotal role in colchicine's neurotoxicity in primarily cultured cortical neurons, and the protective effects of the inhibition of p38 or JNK MPAK on cortical neurons were synergistically. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

38049103591	Disentangling the stigma of HIV/AIDS from the stigmas of drugs use, commercial sex and commercial blood donation - A factorial survey of medical students in China	Background. HIV/AIDS related stigma interferes with the provision of appropriate care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS. Currently, programs to address the stigma approach it as if it occurs in isolation, separate from the co-stigmas related to the various modes of disease transmission including injection drug use (IDU) and commercial sex (CS). In order to develop better programs to address HIV/AIDS related stigma, the inter-relationship (or 'layering') between HIV/AIDS stigma and the co-stigmas needs to be better understood. This paper describes an experimental study for disentangling the layering of HIV/AIDS related stigmas. Methods. The study used a factorial survey design. 352 medical students from Guangzhou were presented with four random vignettes each describing a hypothetical male. The vignettes were identical except for the presence of a disease diagnosis (AIDS, leukaemia, or no disease) and a co-characteristic (IDU, CS, commercial blood donation (CBD), blood transfusion or no co-characteristic). After reading each vignette, participants completed a measure of social distance that assessed the level of stigmatising attitudes. Results. Bivariate and multivariable analyses revealed statistically significant levels of stigma associated with AIDS, IDU, CS and CBD. The layering of stigma was explored using a recently developed technique. Strong interactions between the stigmas of AIDS and the co-characteristics were also found. AIDS was significantly less stigmatising than IDU or CS. Critically, the stigma of AIDS in combination with either the stigmas of IDU or CS was significantly less than the stigma of IDU alone or CS alone. Conclusion. The findings pose several surprising challenges to conventional beliefs about HIV/AIDS related stigma and stigma interventions that have focused exclusively on the disease stigma. Contrary to the belief that having a co-stigma would add to the intensity of stigma attached to people with HIV/AIDS, the findings indicate the presence of an illness might have a moderating effect on the stigma of certain co-characteristics like IDU. The strong interdependence between the stigmas of HIV/AIDS and the co-stigmas of IDU and CS suggest that reducing the co-stigmas should be an integral part of HIV/AIDS stigma intervention within this context. © 2007 Chan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

38149028282	Transsphenoidal surgery in a patient with acromegaly and McCune-Albright syndrome: Application of neuronavigation. Case report	√The McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is characterized by a clinical triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, café-aulait hyperpigmented macules, and hypersecretory endocrinopathies. Acromegaly is an uncommon manifestation of the endocrine disturbance associated with MAS, and the role of surgery in managing these cases has been a topic of debate. The authors present the case of a 35-year-old man with MAS who was also diagnosed with acromegaly, hyperprolactinemia, and pituitary macroadenoma. The patient had an 18-year history of fibrous dysplasia involving the right frontal bone and ribs as well as multiple endocrinopathies, but no cutaneous hyperpigmented macules. An oral glucose tolerance test demonstrated partial suppression of plasma levels of growth hormone (GH). The patient underwent transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary tumor, performed with assistance of neuronavigation, and tolerated the procedure well. After the surgery, both prolactin and GH levels returned to normal. These results suggest that neuronavigation-assisted transsphenoidal surgery can safely remove pituitary adenomas associated with MAS and successfully treat the underlying endocrine abnormalities.

0033613088	Soluble member(s) of the mesothelin/megakaryocyte potentiating factor family are detectable in sera from patients with ovarian carcinoma	mAb OV569 was made by immunizing mice with ovarian carcinoma cells. It binds to cells from ovarian carcinomas and, to a lesser extent, to cells from certain other carcinomas whereas the binding to normal tissues is low to nondetectable. It also binds to soluble molecule(s) in culture supernatants from antigen-positive carcinomas. OV569 recognizes a protein(s) of 42-45 kDa with the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as the membrane-bound portion of mesothelin and megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF). Binding assays with fusion proteins comprising either the N-terminal part of mesothelin/MPF (D1Ig), reported to be easily cleaved off, or a noncleavable, membrane- associated part (D2Ig) showed that OV569 only binds to D2hIg. A new member of the mesothelin/MPF family was discovered, which has an 82-bp insert in the membrane-associated part, leading to a frameshift of 212 bp, and whose predicted molecular structure indicates that it is soluble. To test patient sera for soluble tumor antigen, antigen was isolated from cell-free tumor culture supernatants via immunoadsorption with OV569 and used to generate murine mAbs to an epitope different from the one to which OV569 binds, after which mAbs to two different epitopes were used to develop a 'sandwich ELISA.' Using this assay, the level of circulating antigen was elevated significantly in 23 of 30 sera from patients with ovarian carcinoma, as compared with 0 of 68 sera from healthy controls, 0 of 3 sera from patients with nonneoplastic diseases, and 25 of 75 sera from patients with other tumors. Soluble molecules of the mesothelin/MPF family may provide useful new marker(s) for diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma and/or monitoring its response to therapy.

32044451085	The effects of chronic administration of quetiapine on the phencyclidine-induced reference memory impairment and decrease of Bcl-X L/Bax ratio in the posterior cingulate cortex in rats	Quetiapine, a new atypical antipsychotic drug, effectively alleviates positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive impairment that may be caused by neurodegeneration, in schizophrenia patients. Earlier in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that quetiapine may be a neuroprotectant. The present study was designed to examine the beneficial effects of quetiapine on the possible cognitive impairment and changes of brain apoptotic regulation proteins induced by phencyclidine (PCP) in rats. Rats were treated with quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) or vehicle for 16 days. On day 14, 1 h after the administration of quetiapine, the rats were given PCP (50 mg/kg; subcutaneous (s.c.)) or vehicle. Then quetiapine was administrated for an additional 2 days. One day after the last quetiapine injection (3 days after the PCP injection), the rats were trained on a spatial memory task in a radial arm maze. After the behavioural test, the rats were decapitated for Western blot analysis. PCP induced reference memory impairment, and a decrease of the ratio of an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (Bcl-X

58149347052	Neuroprotective effects of (±)-catechin against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice	The neuroprotective effects of (±)-catechin against toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were investigated in mice. MPTP caused the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and decreased the level of striatal dopamine. Additionally, MPTP increased the level of phospho-c-Jun, a known substrate of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caused a rapid activation of GSK-3β, evidenced by the decrease in the level of phospho-Ser9 of GSK-3β. However, pretreatment with (±)-catechin was found to protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra against MPTP toxicity, and restore the depletion of striatal dopamine in mice. (±)-Catechin attenuated the phosphorylation of c-Jun and recovered the phosphorylation of GSK-3β (Ser9). These results suggested that the suppression of JNK and GSK-3β signaling cascades might contribute to the neuroprotective effect of (±)-catechin against toxicity of MPTP. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77954717711	Management of pulmonary thromboembolism in post-operative neurosurgical patients	Objective: To summarize the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in post-operative neurosurgical patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 7 patients who experienced pulmonary thromboembolism after neurosurgical operations in our department from October 2009 to March 2010. Results: Of these 7 patients, 6 were confirmed with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and 1 was diagnosed according to the clinical manifestations and other diagnostic examinations. All the patients were treated initially with low-dose heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin and then with warfarin. Two patients were implanted with permanent inferior vena cava filters before anticoagulation. One received anticoagulant therapy and died of respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism on the fourth post-operative day. Six patients were discharged after significant improvement Conclusions: Many risk factors may cause PTE peri-operatively. Post-operative CTPA may be indicated. Anticoagulation and other management strategies may be applied to improve the outcome.

42249104240	Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics and surgical results of adrenocorticotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas	Objective: To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics and surgical results of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. Methods: MRI characteristics and relationship between MRI positive rate and surgical results of 266 patients with pathologically confirmed Cushing's disease were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent thin-section sagittal and coronal scans of the pituitary gland before and after administration of gadolinium-diethylene diamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) on a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner, and dynamic enhanced MRI was performed in 39 patients. All patients underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Endocrinological examinations and assessments were performed. Results: Preoperative MRI revealed normal results in 41 (15.4%) cases, microadenoma in 179 (67.3%), macroadenoma in 42 (15.8%), and huge adenoma in 4 (1.5%). Pituitary apoplexy was found in 13 (4.9%) cases. Positive rate of ACTH-secreting adenomas was 84.6% (225/266) on MRI scans, and that of small microadenomas was 87.2% (34/39) on dynamic enhanced MRI scans. Preoperative endocrinological tests of 199 cases supported the diagnosis of typical Cushing's disease, while the other 67 cases had atypical endocrinological results. The endocrinological cure rate, remission rate, and inefficacy rate were 85.7%, 7.9%, and 6.4%, respectively. There was no difference in the initial endocrinological cure rate between the patients with positive and normal MRI results (90% vs. 87.8%, P =0.904). Conclusions: Enhanced coronal pituitary MRI is helpful for preoperative localization of ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenoma. Dynamic enhanced MRI may improve detection rate of microadenoma. There is no marked difference in the surgical results for patients with preoperative MRI results indicating presence or absence of microadenoma.

44649091365	Effect of ovariectomy on the expression of estrogen recepter subtype in the adrenal glands of the rats	Objective: The mechanism of the influence on adrenal glands of the ovariectomy rats was studied by observing the expression of estrogen receptor subtype in adrenal glands of the rats. Methods: Twenty adult female Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups:the sham-operated group(10 rats) and the model group(10 rats). After 6 weeks all rats were killed and the adrenal glands were excised, and the tissues in each group were studied with the method of immunohistochemistry. The level of estrogen (E2) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in blood serum was measured by radiation immunohistology. Results: 1.Staining for ERα and ERβ were the densest in zona fasciculats and zona reticularis with lesser staining in the zona glomerulosa. ERα expressed weaker than ERβ. 2.ERβ expressed in the sham-operated groups and less intensity than in the model groups, it had statistically significant. 3.The level of FSH in the serum of the ovariectomy rats was increasing and the E2 was decreasing, there was great difference between the sham-operated groups and the model group. Conclusion: The expression of either ERα or ERβ on the rat adrenal gland was obviously influenced by ovariectomy, especially the expression of ERβ. Ovariectomy could decrease E2 in serum and increase FSH which excretes from pituitary through feedback.

52049097763	Transplantation of neural stem cells modified by human neurotrophin-3 promotes functional recovery after transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats	The study tested the hypothesis that transplantation of human neurotrophin-3 (hNT-3) over-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) into rat striatum after a severe focal ischemia would promote functional recovery. Rat NSCs, transduced by Flag-tagged hNT-3 gene mediated by lentiviral vector (LV), were transplanted into the striatum ipsilateral to the injury of adult rats 7 days after 2-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO). From 3 days to 2 weeks after transplantation, the modified cells (NSCs-hNT3, as defined by Flag immunofluorencence staining) that survived the transplantation procedures could secrete significantly higher levels of neurotrophin-3 protein in the graft sites than controls (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the rats that accepted NSCs-hNT3 exhibited enhanced functional recovery on neurological and behavioral tests, compared with controlled animals transplanted with saline or untransduced NSCs. This study suggests: (1) LV is an ideal vector to transduce foreign gene into the NSCs; (2) modified NSCs could carry therapeutic genes to disease tissues and express effectively; (3) modified cells could survive in the ischemic brains and continue to secrete neurotrophin-3 abundantly for over 2 weeks, which might have values for enhancing functional recovery after stroke. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

55049130131	Expression of neuroglobin after focal cerebral ischemia and its neuroprotective effect	Objective: To study the expression of neuroglobin (Ngb) in rat cerebral ischemia model and the neuroprotective effect of Ngb after ischemia and hypoxia. Methods: Totally 113 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, hemorrhagic infarction (HI) group and hemin treatment group. The brain water content, infarcted tissue volume, neuropathologic changes (H-E staining) and expression of Ngb (immunocytochemical staining) were examined 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after model establishment. Results: The brain water contents and the infarcted tissue volumes in the hemin treatment group were significantly different from those of the MCAO group and HI group (P<0.01). The brain edema was obviously increased in HI group at 12 h. Neuropathologic examination showed that there were fewer necrotic neurons, milder edema and stronger Ngb expression in the Hemin treatment group than in the MCAO group and HI group. Immunocytochemical staining showed that the Ngb positive neurons in Hemin treatment group were more than those in the MCAO and HI groups. Conclusion: Earlier peak of brain edema may lead to aggravation of disease. Hemin-induced Ngb expression may relieve brain damage during focal cerebral ischemia.

57649159443	Anti-tumor effect of sodium-induced thermochemical ablation therapy	Purpose: We have recently proposed utilizing alkali metal as powerful self heating seeds to thermally ablate tumor tissues. This study is dedicated to disclosing some fundamental mechanisms related to the anti-tumor effects of sodium and its controllability as an economic, safe and efficient thermochemical agent in targeted tumor treatment. Materials and methods: EMT6 cell line was incubated under four situations: No treatment, NaOH solution treatment, hyperthermia treatment and a combined NaOH solution and hyperthermia treatment. Cell cytotoxicity was measured by a CASY cell counter and analyzer system. Breast EMT6 tumors in mice were subjected to treatment by NaOH solution, hyperthermia and encapsulated sodium. The changes of tumor volumes were continuously measured for 12 days after treatment. Tumors of another four mice were harvested immediately after treatment to assess viability. Results: In vitro cell experiments suggested that thermal effect combined with chemical treatment produced a more significant cell cytotoxicity compared to thermal or chemical treatment alone. Encapsulated sodium demonstrated a slower and more continuous heat release than bare sodium. The sodium treatment produced a dramatic regression of tumors that lasted throughout the 12 days of the study. Histological sections showed complete necrosis in sodium-treated tumors, whereas control tumors and heat-treated tumors remained viable, and NaOH-treated tumors showed partial destruction. Conclusions: The results suggest that sodium allows a minimally invasive treatment which could produce both thermal and chemical lethal injury to tumors. Using sodium to ablate target tumors is potentially an effective, safe and low cost way to treat malignant tumors.

62549084764	Quetiapine regulates neurogenesis in ischemic mice by inhibiting NF-κB p65/p50 expression	Objectives: Previously, we showed that quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, significantly attenuated neurodegeneration induced by global cerebral ischemia (GCI). The present work investigates the effects of quetiapine on neurogenesis. Methods: Mice were treated with quetiapine (10 or 20 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal injection) for 2 weeks and then subjected to GCI on day 15. Seven days after GCI, the mice were killed. Neuronal injury and neurogenesis were analysed using hematoxylin-eosin and 5-bromo-20- deoxyuridine stainings. Levels of nuclear factor kB (NF-κB) p65/p50 expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Results: Global cerebral ischemia resulted in neuronal injury, neurogenesis and NF-κB p65/p50 expressions in hippocampus, especially in the dentate gyrus. Pre-administration of quetiapine significantly alleviated neuronal injury, while inhibiting neurogenesis and down-regulating NF- κB p65/p50 expression. Discussion: NF-κB plays a key role in regulating neuron damage and neurogenesis. This work suggests that down-regulation of NF-κB expression may be one of the mechanisms by which quetiapine inhibits neurogenesis. © 2009 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd.

67449091387	Inhibition of TGFβ1 makes nonimmunogenic tumor cells effective for therapeutic vaccination	We have previously demonstrated that transplanted cells from the SW1 clone of the K1735 melanoma and the Ag104 sarcoma grow progressively in syngeneic C3H mice even after transfection to engage CD137, a procedure that increases the immunogenicity of many other tumors. We now show that SW1 and Ag104 cells produce high levels of transforming growth factor (TGF) β1, and that they can induce an antitumor response if they are transfected with a nonreplicating lentivirus vector to "silence" the TGFβ1 gene via short hairpin RNA. Importantly, vaccination with SW1 or Ag104 cells, which do not make TGFβ1, is therapeutically efficacious against small wild type tumors, including SW1 micrometastases in the lung. An analogous approach may be applicable to human tumors that produce TGFβ1 or other immunosuppressive molecules to improve the efficacy of tumor cell-based therapeutic vaccines. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

67650762456	The role of the PI3K-Akt signal transduction pathway in Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells	Many viruses activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, thereby modulating diverse downstream signaling pathways associated with antiapoptosis, proliferation, cell cycling, protein synthesis and glucose metabolism, in order to augment their replication. To date, the role of the PI3K-Akt pathway in Baculovirus replication has not been defined. In the present study, we demonstrate that infection of Sf9 cells with Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) elevated cellular Akt phosphorylation at 1 h post-infection. The maximum Akt phosphorylation occurred at 6 h post-infection and remained unchanged until 18 h post-infection. The PI3K-specifi{ligature}c inhibitor, LY294002, suppressed Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that AcMNPV-induced Akt phosphorylation is PI3K-dependent. The inhibition of PI3K-Akt activation by LY294002 significantly reduced the viral yield, including a reduction in budded viruses and occlusion bodies. The virus production was reduced only when the inhibitor was added within 24 h of infection, implying that activation of PI3K occurred early in infection. Correspondingly, both viral DNA replication and late (VP39) and very late (POLH) viral protein expression were impaired by LY294002 treatment; LY294002 had no effect on immediate-early (IE1) and early-late (GP64) protein expression. These results demonstrate that the PI3K-Akt pathway is required for efficient Baculovirus replication. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

71849113134	Increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the progressive stage of Alzheimer's disease phenotype in an APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse model	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with senile β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and cognitive decline. Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus is implicated in regulating learning and memory, and is increased in human postmortem brain of AD patients. However, little is currently known about the changes of hippocampal neurogenesis in the progression of AD. As brain tissues from patients during the progression of AD are generally not available, an amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin1 (PS1) double transgenic mouse model of AD was studied. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling supported by doublecortin staining was used to detect proliferating hippocampal cells in the mice. Compared with age-matched wild-type controls, 9-month-old transgenic mice with memory impairment and numerous brain Ab deposits showed increased numbers of proliferating hippocampal cells. However, 3-month-old transgenic mice with normal memory and subtle brain Ab deposits showed normal hippocampal proliferation. Double immunofluorescent labeling with BrdU and either NeuN or glial fibrillary acidic protein was conducted in mice at 10 months (28 days after the last BrdU injection) to determine the differentiation of proliferating cells. The number of hippocampal BrdU-positive cells and BrdU-positive cells differentiating into neurons (neurogenesis) in 10-month-old mice was greater in transgenic mice compared with age-matched controls, but the ratio of hippocampal BrdU-positive cells differentiating into neurons and astroglia was comparable. These results suggest hippocampal neurogenesis may increase during the progression of AD. Targeting this change in neurogenesis and understanding the underlying mechanism could lead to the development of a new treatment to control the progression of AD. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

73949102359	Interrelationships between HIV/AIDS and risk behavior prejudice among medical students in Southern China	Stigma within health care settings poses a considerable barrier to the provision of treatment and care for patients with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Southern China is located in a region with one of the world's fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics. Attitudes towards PLWHA amongst health workers are currently under-researched in this region. This paper examines the inter-relationships between prejudicial attitudes among Chinese medical students towards HIV/AIDS and attitudes towards three risk behaviors: injecting drug use (IDU), commercial sex (CS) and commercial blood donation (CBD). Medical students (N = 352) in Guangzhou were presented with two random vignettes; each describing a hypothetical male that was identical, except for the disease diagnosis (AIDS/leukemia) and the co-characteristic (IDU/CS/CBD/blood transfusion/no co-characteristic). After reading each vignette, participants completed a standard prejudicial scale. Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed significant levels of prejudice associated with AIDS, IDU and CS. Regardless of the disease, patients with IDU or CS were judged significantly worse than patients who had received a blood transfusion. No significant interactions were found between AIDS and the stigmatized co-characteristics. The findings suggest that prejudice towards PLWHA needs to be understood within the larger context of the stigma towards risk behaviors. Although non-significant interactions were found between AIDS and the stigmatized risk behaviors, the overlap between the local HIV/AIDS, IDU and CS populations suggests that addressing risk behavior-related prejudices could be critical for improving care and treatment for PLWHA. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

75749127891	Extended transsphenoidal approach for pituitary adenomas invading the anterior cranial base, cavernous sinus, and clivus: A single-center experience with 126 consecutive cases	Object. The standard transsphenoidal approach has been successfully used to resect most pituitary adenomas. However, as a result of the limited exposure provided by this procedure, complete surgical removal of pituitary adenomas with parasellar or retrosellar extension remains problematic. By additional bone removal of the cranial base, the extended transsphenoidal approach provides better exposure to the parasellar and clival region compared with the standard approach. The authors describe their surgical experience with the extended transsphenoidal approach to remove pituitary adenomas invading the anterior cranial base, cavernous sinus (CS), and clivus. Methods. Retrospective analysis was performed in 126 patients with pituitary adenomas that were surgically treated via the extended transsphenoidal approach between September 1999 and March 2008. There were 55 male and 71 female patients with a mean age of 43.4 years (range 12-75 years). There were 82 cases of macroadenoma and 44 cases of giant adenoma. Results. Gross-total resection was achieved in 78 patients (61.9%), subtotal resection in 43 (34.1%), and partial resection in 5 (4%). Postoperative complications included transient cerebrospinal rhinorrhea (7 cases), incomplete cranial nerve palsy (5), panhypopituitarism (5), internal carotid artery injury (2), monocular blindness (2), permanent diabetes insipidus (1), and perforation of the nasal septum (2). No intraoperative or postoperative death was observed. Conclusions. The extended transsphenoidal approach provides excellent exposure to pituitary adenomas invading the anterior cranial base, CS, and clivus. This approach enhances the degree of tumor resection and keeps postoperative complications relatively low. However, radical resection of tumors that are firm, highly invasive to the CS, or invading multidirectionally remains a big challenge. This procedure not only allows better visualization of the tumor and the neurovascular structures but also provides significant working space under the microscope, which facilitates intraoperative manipulation. Preoperative imaging studies and new techniques such as the neuronavigation system and the endoscope improve the efficacy and safety of tumor resection.

76849100003	Microarray analysis of p-anisaldehyde-induced transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae	p-Anisaldehyde (4-methoxybenzaldehyde), an extract from Pimpinella anisum L. seeds, is a potential novel preservative. To reveal the possible action mechanism of p-anisaldehyde against microorganisms, yeast-based commercial oligonucleotide microarrays were used to analyze the genome-wide transcriptional changes in response to p-anisaldehyde. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed for selected genes to verify the microarray results. We interpreted our microarray data with the clustering tool, T-profiler. Analysis of microarray data revealed that p-anisaldehyde induced the expression of genes related to sulphur assimilation, aromatic aldehydes metabolism, and secondary metabolism, which demonstrated that the addition of p-anisaldehyde may influence the normal metabolism of aromatic aldehydes. This genome-wide transcriptomics approach revealed first insights into the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) to p-anisaldehyde challenge. © 2009 Society for Industrial Microbiology.

77949293053	Oxymatrine Downregulates TLR4, TLR2, MyD88, and NF- B and protects rat brains against focal ischemia	Inflammatory damage plays an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment. Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF- B) have been linked to inflammatory reactions. Our previous studies have proved that oxymatrine (OMT) protected ischemic brain injury and this effect may be through the decreasing of NF- B expression. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of OMT in the acute phase of ischemic stroke. We therefore investigated the OMTs potential neuroprotective role and the underlying mechanisms. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, saline and OMT treatment groups. We used a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and administered OMT intraperitoneally immediately after cerebral ischemia and once daily on the following days. At time points after MCAO, brain water content and infarct size were measured. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were used to analyse the expression of TLR4, TLR2, MyD88, and NF- B at gene and protein level in ischemic brain tissue. The result indicated that OMT protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO; this effect may be through downregulation of the TLR4, TLR2, MyD88, and NF- B. © 2009 Hongguang Fan et al.

77953500307	Down-expression of PGC-1α partially mediated by JNK/c-Jun through binding to CRE site during apoptotic procedure in cerebellar granule neurons	In eukaryotes, mitochondria are critical for cellular bioenergetics and mediating apoptosis. The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1α) is an important regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. However, the role of PGC-1α in neuronal apoptosis and its regulation by apoptotic pathway are still unknown. We demonstrated that PGC-1α expression was down-regulated in cerebellar granule neurons(CGNs) after activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway by potassium deprivation. Overexpression of PGC-1α partially protected CGNs from potassium deprivation-induced apoptosis. JNK-specific inhibitors, SP600125 and CEP11004, partially blocked the inhibitory effects of JNK on PGC-1α expression and its promoter activity. Furthermore, ChIP assays revealed that c-Jun was able to bind to the CRE site (-188 to -180) in the PGC-1α promoter. In conclusion, these results suggest that down-expression of PGC-1α partially mediated by activation of JNK/c-Jun may be through the binding of c-Jun to the CRE site in the PGC-1α promoter, and it might be involved in potassium deprivation-induced apoptosis in CGNs. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The safety of the new combination material was studied. The best parameters of the combination material of PRB were optimized. The treatment effect of the groundwater contaminated with nitrobenzene was studied preliminary in simulation tank. The results show that the combination material was safe, and no secondary pollution was produced when the waste water was treated by the combination material. The best reaction conditions was that the ratio of Fe:C was 5:1, the pH was 4 to 5, the iron filling diameter was between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm, the reaction time was 60 min, and the removing rate of nitrobenzene was reached to 94.2% in the optimized column conditions. The removing rate of nitrobenzene was 93.26% under the best simulation tank conditions. © 2010 Peking University.

77958453976	Reversion of multidrug resistance using self-organized nanoparticles holding both doxorubicin and targeting moiety	Doxorubicin and galactose were chemically conjugated to dextran by the carboxypropyl spacers and the conjugate was formulated into nanoparticle with free doxorubicin. The content of doxorubicin was as high as 17.2% in the nanoscale drug delivery systems (nano-DDSs) and the nanoparticle size was less than 190 nm. In an in vitro cytotoxicity experiment, the nano-DDSs had higher cytotoxicity than free DOX against the drug resistant HepG2 cells. In a human tumor xenograft nude mouse model, the nano-DDSs generated higher therapeutic effect than free doxorubicin. These promising data show a better anti-tumor efficacy on drug resistant HepG2 cells of nano-DDSs versus free doxorubicin, and warrant further studies in both animals and humans. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

78649453101	Use of genetically modified allograft to deliver local immunomodulatory molecule with minimal systemic toxicity in a rat model of allogeneic skin flap transplantation	The effects of OX40-OX40 ligand (OX40L) costimulatory pathway blockade to prevent T-cell-mediated acute rejection were investigated in a rat model of allogeneic superficial inferior epigastric artery flap transplantation. An ex vivo gene transfer technique was used to modify allografts to locally deliver an immunomodulatory molecule. The flaps were separated from donors, perfused with an adenoviral vector expressing the OX40 immunoglobulin (AdOX40Ig) for 1 hour, and incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Before transplantation, the flaps were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline solution to remove unincorporated viral particles. Recipients were randomly divided into 5 groups, and treated with topical OX40Ig gene transfer, a single low dose of rapamycin alone, or a combination of agents. Graft survival was assessed using histopathologic classification of skin rejection. All animals in the untreated group (n = 9) or the group treated with adenovirus expressing green fluorescence protein (n = 9) developed grade 3 clinical rejection by postoperative day 7. No significant difference was observed in graft survival between the locally treated AdOX40Ig groups (mean [SD], 8.1 [0.7] days) and the untreated groups (7.7 [1.2] days) could be observed (P > .05, t test). Graft survival in the locally treated AdOX40Ig groups was extended to 18.7 (1.2) days when transduction was combined with a low dose of rapamycin, a significant improvement over survival with rapamycin treatment alone (13.2 [0.6] days) (P < .01). These results demonstrated that local immunomodulation by the allograft itself and low-dose rapamycin treatment promote graft acceptance. This protocol may enable reduction of the dosage of immunosuppressive drugs needed for successful inhibition of acute rejection in the early postoperative period. © 2010 by Elsevier Inc.

78650369778	Diagnosis and management of pituitary abscess: Experiences from 33 cases	Objective Pituitary abscess is a rare disorder with nonspecific presenting manifestations, often making a correct preoperative diagnosis difficult. To better determine the salient signs and symptoms of pituitary abscess and to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and antibiotic therapies, we conducted a review of patients treated for pituitary abscess at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). Methods A total of 33 consecutive patients referred to PUMCH between 1991 and 2007 were included. While 30 patients underwent surgery and antibiotic therapy, three patients accepted only antibiotic therapy. A complete history, a thorough record of signs and symptoms, pituitary imaging and biochemical panels were obtained for each patient. Results Most of the patients presented with complaints and symptoms consistent with a sellar mass, generally in the absence of any evidence of infection. Diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism and headache were the most common clinical indicators. Typical magnetic resonance (MR) images after gadolinium injection demonstrated a sellar cystic mass with an enhanced rim. Although there were several recurrences, the abscess resolved in nearly all cases. Hypopituitarism generally did not recover, and hormone replacement therapy was usually necessary. Conclusions Presentation of diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism and a sellar cystic mass with an enhanced rim may be suggestive of a pituitary abscess. For most patients, a transsphenoidal evacuation, followed by antibiotic therapy, is recommended. However, antibiotic therapy alone may be useful for acute cases. In our experience, pituitary abscesses can usually be treated, though the accompanying hypopituitarism is difficult to cure, and requiring lifelong hormonal replacement. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

79951827524	Postacute ischemia vascular endothelial growth factor transfer by transferrin-targeted liposomes attenuates ischemic brain injury after experimental stroke in rats	Our objective was to achieve the enhanced delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to ischemically disordered brain through transferrin-coupled liposomes (Tf-PLs) via intravenous administration, and to observe the effect of Tf-VEGF-PLs on ischemic brain neuroprotection and angiogenesis. Cerebral VEGF overexpression was achieved with Tf-PLs by intravenous injection 48hr after an acute stroke. β-Galactosidase expression was monitored; saline was injected as a control. The success of postischemic gene transduction was confirmed by β-galactosidase staining and by increased VEGF mRNA and protein in ischemic brain. Vascular density, neurological recovery, and ischemic area calculation were performed to evaluate the effect of Tf-VEGF-PLs. The positive expression of β-galactosidase indirectly indicated that VEGF was successfully delivered into brain by Tf-VEGF-PLs. VEGF mRNA in the Tf-VEGF-PL group 24hr after injection was significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that postischemic Tf-VEGF-PLs resulted in increased VEGF protein levels compared with VEGF-PLs and saline-administered rats (p<0.05) 48hr after administration. At 21 days after drug injection, we observed a significant decrease in infarct volume and better neurological function in the Tf-VEGF-PL-treated group, compared with the VEGF-PL group. FITC-dextran marking showed increased vascular density in the penumbra of Tf-VEGF-PL-treated hemispheres (245,873.9, number of microvessels per field) compared with that in VEGF-PL-treated hemispheres (139,801.3) or saline-treated hemispheres (102,175.5) (p<0.05). The remainder of the cerebral blood flow after ischemia in the Tf-VEGF-PL group was significantly more than in the control groups (0.35 vs. 0.29, 0.21; p<0.05). We conclude that the VEGF gene can be delivered noninvasively into the brain by Tf-VEGF-PLs. Postischemic treatment with Tf-VEGF-PLs effectively promoted neuroprotection and vascular regeneration in the chronic stage of cerebral infarction. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

Methods: Thirty-nine guinea pigs were randomly divided into 3 groups. The first group (control group) received physiologic saline by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection for 5 days. The second group (cisplatin group) was treated with cisplatin (2 mg/kg per day, i.p. injection) for 5 days. The third group (SM group) was given SM (8 g/kg per day, i.p. injection) for 2 days and then was given SM (8 g/kg per day, i.p. injection) and cisplatin (2 mg/kg per day, i.p. injection) for 5 days. Auditory brain stem response (ABR) and cochlea blood flow measurement were used to evaluate cochlea function. The structures of cochlea were observed by light microscope, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and immunohistochemical examination. Results: Cisplatin could cause severe acoustic damages including significant elevation of ABR threshold, substantial losses of outer hair cells and inner hair cells, and severe damage on the stria vascularis and spiral ganglion cells (SGCs). Although in SM group, the increased tendency of threshold was milder than that in cisplatin group. The damages in cochlea and stria vascularis were also less severe than those in cisplatin group. The expression of induced nitric oxide synthase in the cochlea and SGC in SM group was lower than that in cisplatin group. Conclusions: Salvia miltiorrhiza can significantly reduce the cisplatin-induced side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79959412143	A case of McCune-Albright syndrome associated with pituitary GH adenoma: Therapeutic process and autopsy	Background: McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a clinical syndrome with low incidence, and its concurrence with pituitary GH adenoma is rare. Little of the history, treatment and outcome has been studied. Method: Follow-up of a 37-year-old male patient of MAS associated with pituitary GH adenoma was performed continuously recording the disease development and the treatment process until death, after which an autopsy was performed. Results: Radiation therapy (RT) efficaciously controlled GH hypersecretion, however, it may have been the cause of the malignant transformation of the dysplastic bone tissue, which eventually caused brain hernia and death; autopsy demonstrated that the cranium had significant thickening (as much as 10 cm), the pathological diagnosis was fibrous dysplasia of bone associated with chondrosarcoma; and undifferentiated chondrosarcoma with malignant fibrous histocytoma subtype in the sellar region; nodular goiter with the thyroid gland, one nodus was pathologically demonstrated as papillary carcinoma. Conclusion: GH adenoma, present in a patient with MAS, might be cured by RT; but the risk of malignant transformation of the dysplastic bone tissue in the field of irradiation make it controversial. Lessons from the case reported here told us that we should take great caution when recommending RT for patients like this. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

79959789422	Screening for inhibitors of plant protease D1 using novel monoclonal antibodies directed against its carboxyl terminal	Carboxyl terminal processing protease of D1 protein (CtpA) catalyzes carboxyl terminal processing of D1 protein, which is predicted to be an excellent target for a general broad-spectrum herbicide. In this study, the CtpA gene from spinach cDNA was cloned and overexpressed and the recombinant CtpA fusion protein (rCtpA) was used as antigen to immunize BALB/c mice for the production of monoclonal antibody (MAb). Western blot and ELISA results indicated that both rCtpA and the PDZ domain protein of CtpA had specific binding abilities to MAbs, while the specificity and sensitivity of rCtpA were much higher than that of the PDZ domain. These results suggest that parts of the antigen determinant of CtpA were located in the PDZ domain. The MAbs and related results obtained in this study proved the feasibility of high-throughput screening of lead compounds for protease as inhibitors and mechanism analysis of CtpA enzyme. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

79960672283	Hemorrhagic transformation induced by acute hyperglycemia in a rat model of transient focal ischemia	Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a major factor limiting the use of tissue plasminogen activator for stroke. HT has been found in animals undergoing transient focal cerebral ischemia with hyperglycemia. This study examined the incidence rate, location and content of HT. Rats were divided into two groups: the hyperglycemic group and normoglycemic group. Rats received an injection of 50% glucose (6 ml/kg, i.p.) or an equivalent volume of saline 15 min before 2-h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) with reperfusion. Rats were killed 4, 8 or 24 h later and used for blood-brain barrier permeability, hemoglobin content, brain edema, and infarct volume measurements. Mortality and HT incidence rates were also evaluated. We found that all hyperglycemic rats had HT, and two out of six normoglycemic rats had HT 24 h after tMCAO. Hyperglycemic rats had more severe Evans blue leakage (p < 0.05) and brain edema (p < 0.05) in the ipsilateral hemisphere. However, infarct volumes were the same in hyperglycemic and normoglycemic rats. In conclusion, acute hyperglycemia reliably and consistently resulted in hemorrhagic transformation in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. The model is useful for experimental assessment of new therapies for HT. © 2011 Springer-Verlag/Wien.

80055075116	Global and threshold-free transcriptional regulatory networks reconstruction through integrating chip-chip and expression data	Inferring transcriptional regulatory networks from high-throughput biological data is a major challenge to bioinformatics today. To address this challenge, we developed TReNGO (Transcriptional Regulatory Networks reconstruction based on Global Optimization), a global and threshold-free algorithm with simulated annealing for inferring regulatory networks by the integration of ChIP-chip and expression data. Superior to existing methods, TReNGO was expected to find the optimal structure of transcriptional regulatory networks without any arbitrary thresholds or predetermined number of transcriptional modules (TMs). TReNGO was applied to both synthetic data and real yeast data in the rapamycin response. In these applications, we demonstrated an improved functional coherence of TMs and TF (transcription factor)-target predictions by TReNGO when compared to GRAM, COGRIM or to analyzing ChIP-chip data alone. We also demonstrated the ability of TReNGO to discover unexpected biological processes that TFs may be involved in and to also identify interesting novel combinations of TFs. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.

83355162695	Neuronal regeneration and protection by collagen-binding BDNF in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model	It has been well confirmed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has therapeutic effects following stroke. However, it is difficult to be maintained at a sufficient concentration of BDNF in the infarcted hemisphere. We have shown in our previous work that BDNF fused with a collagen-binding domain (CBD-BDNF) could specifically bind to collagen. The ventricular ependyma of the brain is rich in collagen. Therefore, we have speculated that in the infarcted hemisphere, CBD-BDNF will bind to the collagen of the ventricular ependyma and stimulate the cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Using a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO), we injected CBD-BDNF into the lateral ventricle of MCAO rats. The results demonstrated that CBD-BDNF was retained at high levels in the infarcted hemisphere, promoted neural regeneration and angiogenesis, reduced cell loss, decreased apoptosis, and improved functional recovery. In addition, brain perfusion and metabolism, as evaluated by SPECT and PET, were improved in the CBD-BDNF treated group. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

82555187422	PCR-based sequencing for detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus in 325 cervical cell specimens from Beijing area	To evaluate PCR-sequencing for clinical detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in cervical cell specimens, we applied PCR-sequencing to HPV detection and genotyping by general primer PGMY09/11, which targets the HPV most conserved L1 gene. Samples with multiple infections were subjected to HPV type-specific PCR. Among the 325 cervical samples, 228 were HPV positive, of which 66 showed multiple infections. In all, 27 different HPV genotypes were identified, with HPV 16 being the most prevalent, followed by HPV 58 and 52. The prevalence of high-risk HPV infection increased with the severity of cervical lesions (P < 0.05), whereas the proportion of multiple infections declined significantly from LSIL to SCC (P < 0.05). Both rates of overall and high-risk HPV infection were the highest in 21-30 age groups. There was substantial agreement between the HC2 and PCR-sequencing assay for detection of high-risk HPV (kappa=0.675). PCR-sequencing was effective in HPV detection and genotyping, and it could be potentially applied to large scale HPV screening. © 2011 CJB, All rights reserved.

Methods: Totally 122 patients underwent TRUS with TRTE and MR with MRS. Seventy-three patients with Pca were divided into low risk group (n=21), moderate risk group (n=24) and high risk group (n=28) according to Gleason sores. The rest 49 patients were found with benign prostatic hyperplasia (PHB group). The results of each method were compared with pathological diagnosis from surgery or biopsy. Results: Peak systolic velocity and resistance index of Pca in high risk group were higher than that in PHB group (P<0.05). The strain ratio of elastography of moderate risk group and high risk group were higher than that in PHB group (P<0.05). The diagnostic accordance rate of TRUS with TRTE was lower than that of MR with MRS, but there was no significant difference (P>0.05). Conclusion: TRTE and MRS can help to diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Pca, but need to combine with TRUS and MR.

84861140856	Effect of pulsed electric fields on the activity of neutral trehalase from beer yeast and RSM analysis	The trehalase activity plays an important role in extraction of trehalose from beer yeast. In this study, the effect of pulsed electric field processing on neutral trehalase activity in beer yeast was investigated. In order to develop and optimize a pulsed electric field (PEF) mathematical model for activating the neutral trehalase, we have investigated three variables, including electric field intensity (10-50. kV/cm), pulse duration (2-10 μs) and liquid-solid ratio (20-50. ml/g) and subsequently optimized them by response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental data were fitted to a second-order polynomial equation and profiled into the corresponding contour plots. Optimal condition obtained by RSM is as follows: electric field intensity 42.13. kV/cm, liquid-solid ratio 30.12. ml/g and pulse duration 5.46 μs. Under these conditions, with the trehalose decreased 8.879. mg/L, the PEF treatment had great effect on activating neutral trehalase in beer yeast cells. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84861395432	Identification of sare0718 as an Alanine-Activating adenylation domain in marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola CNS-205	Background: Amino acid adenylation domains (A domains) are critical enzymes that dictate the identity of the amino acid building blocks to be incorporated during nonribosomal peptide (NRP) biosynthesis. NRPs represent a large group of valuable natural products that are widely applied in medicine, agriculture, and biochemical research. Salinispora arenicola CNS-205 is a representative strain of the first discovered obligate marine actinomycete genus, whose genome harbors a large number of cryptic secondary metabolite gene clusters. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to investigate cryptic NRP-related metabolites in S. arenicola CNS-205, we cloned and identified the putative gene sare0718 annotated "amino acid adenylation domain". Firstly, the general features and possible functions of sare0718 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, which suggested that Sare0718 is a soluble protein with an AMP-binding domain contained in the sequence and its cognate substrate is L-Val. Then, a GST-tagged fusion protein was expressed and purified to further explore the exact adenylation activity of Sare0718 in vitro. By a newly mentioned nonradioactive malachite green colorimetric assay, we found that L-Ala but not L-Val is the actual activated amino acid substrate and the basic kinetic parameters of Sare0718 for it are K

Methodology: The images of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), DSC and ASL in 36 cases of TIA patients with unilateral MCA stenosis and 35 healthy volunteers were analyzed retrospectively to assess collateral flow in the circle of Willis, and to analyze the perfusion differences between ASL and DSC. Results: The perfusion differences between lesion side and contralateral side were significant in both DSC (P < 0.01) and ASL (P < 0.05). Whereas, the differences of CBF between DSC and ASL in the perfusion evaluation of unilateral MCA stenosis were not significant, P > 0.05. Conclusion: ASL can provide valuable information on the quality of brain perfusion in patients with unilateral middle cereral artery stenosis. Therefore, ASL may be an alternative method in the assessment of perfusion in ischemic cerebral vascular diseases.

84863659370	Multiple sclerosis and sexual dysfunction	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system characterized by episodic and progressive neurologic dysfunction resulting from inflammatory and autoimmune reactions. The underlying pathogenesis of MS remains largely unclear. However, it is currently accepted as a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Among other clinical manifestations, sexual dysfunction (SD) is a painful but still underreported and underdiagnosed symptom of the disorder. SD in MS patients may result from a complex set of conditions and may be associated with multiple anatomic, physiologic, biologic, medical and psychological factors. SD arises primarily from lesions affecting the neural pathways involved in physiologic function. In addition, psychological factors, the side effects of medications and physical symptoms such as fatigue, muscular weakness, menstrual changes, pain and concerns about bladder and bowel incontinence may also be involved. Since MS primarily affects young people, SD secondary to MS may have a great impact on quality of life. Thus, maintaining a healthy sexual life with MS is an important priority. The treatment of SD requires multidisciplinary teamwork and cooperation among specialists, individual patients, partners and the society. © 2012 AJA, SIMM & SJTU. All rights reserved.

84865959307	Bmi-1 promotes the aggressiveness of glioma via activating the NF-kappaB/MMP-9 signaling pathway	Background: The prognosis of human glioma is poor, and the highly invasive nature of the disease represents a major impediment to current therapeutic modalities. The oncoprotein B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 protein (Bmi-1) has been linked to the development and progression of glioma; however, the biological role of Bmi-1 in the invasion of glioma remains unclear.Methods: A172 and LN229 glioma cells were engineered to overexpress Bmi-1 via stable transfection or to be silenced for Bmi-1 expression using RNA interfering method. Migration and invasiveness of the engineered cells were assessed using wound healing assay, Transwell migration assay, Transwell matrix penetration assay and 3-D spheroid invasion assay. MMP-9 expression and activity were measured using real-time PCR, ELISA and the gelatin zymography methods. Expression of NF-kappaB target genes was quantified using real-time PCR. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was assessed using an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter system. Expression of Bmi-1 and MMP-9 in clinical specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemical assay.Results: Ectopic overexpression of Bmi-1 dramatically increased, whereas knockdown of endogenous Bmi-1 reduced, the invasiveness and migration of glioma cells. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and MMP-9 expression and activity were significantly increased in Bmi-1-overexpressing but reduced in Bmi-1-silenced cells. The reporter luciferase activity driven by MMP-9 promoter in Bmi-1-overexpressing cells was dependent on the presence of a functional NF-kappaB binding site, and blockade of NF-kappaB signaling inhibited the upregulation of MMP-9 in Bmi-1 overexpressing cells. Furthermore, expression of Bmi-1 correlated with NF-kappaB nuclear translocation as well as MMP-9 expression in clinical glioma samples.Conclusions: Bmi-1 may play an important role in the development of aggressive phenotype of glioma via activating the NF-kappaB/MMP-9 pathway and therefore might represent a novel therapeutic target for glioma. © 2012 Jiang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84865719242	Parallel gene loss and acquisition among strains of different Brucella species and biovars	The genus Brucella is divided into six species; of these, B. melitensis and B. abortus are pathogenic to humans, and B. ovis and B. neotomae are nonpathogenic to humans. The definition of gene loss and acquisition is essential for understanding Brucella's ecology, evolutionary history, and host relationships. A DNA microarray containing unique genes of B. melitensis Type strain 16MT and B. abortus 9-941 was constructed and used to determine the gene contents of the representative strains of Brucella. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from sequences of housekeeping genes. Gene loss and acquisition of different Brucella species were inferred. A total of 214 genes were found to be differentially distributed, and 173 of them were clustered into 15 genomic islands (GIs). Evidence of horizontal gene transfer was observed for 10 GIs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 19 strains formed five clades, and some of the GIs had been lost or acquired independently among the different lineages. The derivation of Brucella lineages is concomitant with the parallel loss or acquisition of GIs, indicating a complex interaction between various Brucella species and hosts. © 2012 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84866280718	Prevalence and extent of right-to-left shunt in migraine: A survey of 217 Chinese patients	Background: Recently, contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (cTCD) studies have shown that right-to-left shunt (RLS) may be a risk factor for migraine in Westerners; however, limited data in the literature describes the prevalence of RLS in Chinese patients with migraine. Objective: To assess the prevalence of RLS in patients with migraine in China and to evaluate the relationship between the extent of RLS and migraine. Methods: A total of 217 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of migraine and 100 volunteers were recruited. cTCD was used to assess the prevalence and the extent of RLS in all subjects. Results: In the migraine group, the rate of positive RLS was 44.2% (96/217), with 23.5% (51/217) of these being large. In the healthy group, 28.0% (28/100) were positive for RLS overall, and 5.0% (5/100) were large (P = 0.006; P < 0.001). In patients having migraines with aura (MwA), 66.1% (39/59) were positive for RLS overall, and 37.3% (22/59) were large, which was significantly higher when compared with the healthy group (P < 0.001; P < 0.001); in patients having migraines without aura (MwoA), 36.1% (57/158) were positive for RLS overall, and 18.4% (29/158) were large, which was against significantly higher (P < 0.001; P = 0.003). In the MwoA group, the large RLS rate was also higher than in the healthy group (P = 0.002). Conclusions: A close correlation has been documented between RLS and migraine, especially MwA, but these relationships exist only when the shunts were large. © 2012 EFNS.

Methods: According to the designed sequence, the target fragments of TRX1, TRX2 and ABAD-DP were created by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and then inserted into the multiple clone site of acleno-associated virus shuttle plasmid pSSHG-CMV with gene cloning technique. The corresponding fusion gene TRX1-ABAD-DP-TRX2 was identified by restriction enzymes digestion with EcoR I and BamH I. The recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV/T-A-T) was produced in HeLa cells with linear polyethylenimine. The expression of T-A-T fusion gene and co-localization between T-A-T and Aβ peptide in NIH 3T3 cells were examined by fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Results: The size of fusogenic fragment TRX1-ABAD-DP-TRX2 was approximately 435 bp. And it was consistent with our design. T-A-T fusion gene was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Through co-expression, T-A-T aptamer and intracellular Aβ peptide were co-localized. It indicated that T-A-T aptamer could bind Aβ within NIH 3T3 cells. Conclusion: The TRX1-ABAD-DP-TRX2 fusion gene is successfully cloned and expressed. And it may provide rationales for further applications in the gene therapy of Alzheimer's disease.

84867572569	MiR-136 promotes apoptosis of glioma cells by targeting AEG-1 and Bcl-2	MicroRNAs have the capacity to coordinately repress multiple target genes and interfere with biological functions of the cell, such as proliferation and apoptosis. Here we report that miR-136 is downregulated in human glioma, and that the miRNA promotes apoptosis of glioma cells induced by chemotherapy. Two anti-apoptotic genes, AEG-1 and Bcl-2, are identified as targets of miR-136, and restoration of AEG-1 or Bcl-2 expression suppresses miR-136-enhanced apoptosis. Therefore, miR-136 might play a tumor-suppressive role in human glioma and thereby might represent a potential therapeutic strategy. © 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

84868671535	Compromised cerebrovascular modulation in chronic anxiety: evidence from cerebral blood flow velocity measured by transcranial Doppler sonography	Objective: Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the mechanism by which constant cerebral blood flow is maintained despite changes in cerebral perfusion pressure. CA can be evaluated by dynamic monitoring of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). The present study aimed to explore CA in chronic anxiety. Methods: Subjects with Hamilton anxiety scale scores ≥14 were enrolled and the dynamic changes of CBFV in response to an orthostatic challenge were investigated using TCD. Results: In both the anxious and the healthy subjects, the mean CBFV was significantly lower in the upright position than when supine. However, the CBFV changes from supine to upright differed between the anxious and the healthy groups. Anxious subjects showed more pronounced decreases in CBFV with abrupt standing. Conclusion: Our results indicate that cerebrovascular modulation is compromised in chronic anxiety; anxious subjects have some insufficiency in maintaining cerebral perfusion after postural change. Given the fact that anxiety and impaired CA are associated with cardiovascular disease, early ascertainment of compromised cerebrovascular modulation using TCD might suggest interventional therapies in the anxious population, and improve the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. © 2012 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Methods: Forty cases of HPV16 single infection were selected from 337 cervical scrape samples by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification and DNA sequencing. The copy numbers of E2, E6 and β-actin were quantified to evaluate the viral load and integration status by real-time PCR. Results: (1) The median number of adjusted viral load of normal group, LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) group, HSIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) group and squamous cervical cancer group were 0.11, 18.55, 44.63 and 7.6 copies per cell respectively. The viral load was higher in LSIL-HSIL group than that in normal group while lower in squamous cervical cancer group than that in HSIL group. (2) The median number of E2/E6 was 0.93 in normal group, 0.84 in precancerous group (LSIL-HSIL) and 0.64 in squamous cervical cancer group respectively. It showed a descending trend with the progression of cervical disease. (3) With the disease development, the proportion of episomal form decreased (normal group 4/5, LSIL group 4/6, HSIL group 10/16, cervical squamous cancer group 5/13) whereas that of integrated form (mixed and totally integrated) increased (normal group 1/5, LSIL group 2/6, HSIL group 6/16, cervical squamous cancer group 8/13). Both totally integrated cases were cervical squamous cancer. Conclusion: (1) HPV 16 viral load may not be an ideal marker to predict cervical carcinogenesis. (2) Due to a positive correlation between HPV16 genomic integration frequency and cervical neoplastic progression, HPV 16 integration frequency may be a potential marker of early diagnosis for cervical lesion progression.

84870452428	Effects of cerebellar fastigial nucleus electrical stimulation on telomerase reverse transcriptase expression and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in rats with focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion	Objective: To study the effects of cerebellar fastigial nucleus (FN) electrical stimulation on telomerase reverse transcriptase expression and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in rats with focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Methods: A total of 100 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups; sham operation group, modeling group (2-hour cerebral ischemia, followed by 24, 48 & 72-hour reperfusion) and FN-stimulating group (electrical stimulation of FN for 1-hour one day before 2-hour cerebral ischemia, followed by 24, 48 & 72 -hour reperfusion). HE (hematoxylin and eosin) and TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) staining were used to observe the morphological changes in rat brain and measure the ischemic lesion volumes. The expressions of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) and Bax were detected by immunohistochemical methods and apoptotic cells by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling). The co-expression of TERT and Bax was detected by immunofluorescence double-labeling plus laser confocal microscopy. Results: The morphological changes in rat brain were less greater in the FN-stimulating group than those in the modeling group. And the size of the cerebral infarct was significantly smaller in the FN-stimulating group (78.1 ± 2.9, 83.1 ± 4.5, 83.7 ± 4.8) than that in the modeling group (120.9 ± 8.2, 137.0 ± 4.2, 141.1 ± 3.3) (P < 0.05) at all reperfusion time points. As compared with the modeling group (16.1 ± 2.7, 16.9 ± 2.4, 11.6 ± 3.5), the FN-stimulating group (31.1 ± 3.5, 30.0 ± 3.4, 18.9 ± 3.3) had a significantly larger number of TERT-positive cells (P < 0.05) and a significantly reduced number of TUNEL-positive cells (49.6 ± 2.8, 67.0 ± 3.7, 46.8 ± 3.2 vs 40.2 ± 3.1, 54.8 ± 2.8, 37.3 ± 2.4) (P < 0.05). The number of Bax-positive cells at different reperfusion time points in the FN-stimulating group was not significantly different from those in the modeling group (P > 0.05). TERT partially co-localized with Bax in the cytoplasm. The number of double-labeled cells was significantly higher in the FN-stimulating group than that in the modeling group (14.1 ± 1.3, 12.9 ± 2.4, 9.0 ± 2.0 vs 8.2 ± 1.1, 6.3 ± 2.4, 6.0 ± 2.9) (P < 0.05). Conclusion The expression of TERT significantly increases after a stimulation of FN. TERT may bind to Bax and inhibit Bax-mediated apoptosis by suppressing the mitochondrial relocalization of Bax from cytosol. Copyright © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

Methods: The Q192R genotype was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction in 131 young adults with ischemic stroke and 135 age-and gender-matched controls. The plasma lipids were also determined in patients and controls respectively. Furthermore, carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) in patients were measured by carotid ultrasonography. Results: The distributions of Q192R genotype frequency were significantly different between patients with ischemic stroke and control individuals. And the patients had more RR genotypes than control individuals (P < 0.05). Odds ratio (OR) for stroke were 1.743 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032-2.943) in subjects with RR genotype. We also studied the relationship between the polymorphisms and the lipid concentration in patients and control individuals. However, no significant association was detected between Q/R192 genotype and any of lipid measurements. Further, the prevalence of cigarette smoking, hypertension and diabetes showed no significant difference between RR and non-RR genotypes in patients. Body mass index (BMI) in two groups did not differ significantly. But IMT of patients with RR genotype obviously increased in comparison to those without RR genotype (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The PON1 gene Q192R polymorphism may be associated with the susceptibility of ischemic stroke in young adults. RR genotype is a genetic risk for young adults with ischemic stroke through an increased carotid artery intima-media thickness and an accelerated atherosclerotic process.

84872530278	MiR-186 downregulation correlates with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma, where it interferes with cell-cycle regulation	Deeper mechanistic understanding of lung adenocarcinoma (non-small cell lung carcinoma, or NSCLC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths overall, may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies. In analyzing NSCLC clinical specimens and cell lines, we discovered a uniform decrease in miR-186 (MIR186) expression in comparison with normal lung tissue or epithelial cell lines.miR-186 expression correlated with patient survival, with median overall survival time of 63.0 or 21.5 months in cases exhibiting high or low levels of miR-186, respectively. Enforced overexpression of miR-186 in NSCLC cells inhibited proliferation by inducing G

84872580192	Loss of miR-204 expression enhances glioma migration and stem cell-like phenotype	Phenotypic similarities have long been recognized between subpopulations of glioma and neural stem cells. Many of these similar properties, including the robust abilities to self-renew, migrate, and invade, are hallmarks of glioma cells that render them extremely aggressive. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this character, particularly in glioma stem-like cells that drive this disease, remain poorly understood. Here, we report the results of a differential miRNA expression screen that compared glioma and neural stem cells, where we found that miR-204 was markedly downregulated in both types of cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-204 simultaneously suppressed self-renewal, stem cell-associated phenotype, and migration of glioma cells by targeting the stemness-governing transcriptional factor SOX4 and the migration-promoting receptor EphB2. Restoring miR-204 expression in glioma cells suppressed tumorigenesis and invasiveness in vivo and increased overall host survival. Further evaluation revealed that the miR-204 promoter was hypermethylated and that attenuating promoter methylation was sufficient to upregulate miR-204 in glioma cells. Together, our findings reveal miR-204 as a pivotal regulator of the development of stem cell-like phenotypes and cell motility in malignant glioma cells. © 2012 AACR.

84873257567	Determination of integrated HPV58 sequences in cervical lesions	Integration of high-risk HPV in host genome is an important event in cervical cancer development. This study was aimed to analyze the integration of HPV58, a high-risk type that is prevalent in cervical lesions from southeastern Asia. Detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing revealed 8 integrations in 5 samples, and virus integration was found present in 2 samples with early lesion. Sequence analysis of the viral-cellular junctions showed that E1 disruption in virus genome was an early and common event during HPV58 infection. In 6 integrations, DNA fragments of HPV58 genome integrated into the repetitive element sequences of host genome. Copyright © 2012 by IGCS and ESGO.

84873802341	Inhibition of GSK3β-mediated BACE1 expression reduces Alzheimer-associated phenotypes	Deposition of amyloid β protein (Aβ) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is generated from sequential cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β- and γ-secretases, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the β-secretase essential for Aβ generation. Previous studies have indicated that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) may play a role in APP processing by modulating γ-secretase activity, thereby facilitating Aβ production. There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3α and GSK3β. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3β, but not GSK3α, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3β was dependent on NF-κB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced Aβ deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3β and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce Aβ neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the β-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD.

84873365269	MicroRNA-374a activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote breast cancer metastasis	Tumor metastasis involves a series of biological steps during which the tumor cells acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissues and survive outside the original tumor site. During the early stages, the cancer cells undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Wnt/β-catenin signaling is known to drive EMT and metastasis. Here we report that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is hyperactivated in metastatic breast cancer cells that express microRNA 374a (miR-374a). In breast cancer cell lines, ectopic overexpression of miR-374a promoted EMT and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, miR-374a directly targeted and suppressed multiple negative regulators of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, including WIF1, PTEN, and WNT5A. Notably, miR-374a was markedly upregulated in primary tumor samples from patients with distant metastases and was associated with poor metastasis-free survival. These results demonstrate that miR-374a maintains constitutively activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling and may represent a therapeutic target for early metastatic breast cancer.

84873101131	Bmi-1 Promotes Glioma Angiogenesis by Activating NF-κB Signaling	Angiogenesis in glioma is associated with the poor prognosis of the disease and closely correlates with the highly invasive phenotype of glioma cells, which represents the most challenging impediment against the currently glioma treatments. Bmi-1, an onco-protein, has been implicated in the progression of various human cancers, including gliomas, whereas its role in glioma angiogenesis remains unclear. Our current study examined the effects of Bmi-1 on glioma angiogenesis in vitro as well as in vivo. We found that overexpression of Bmi-1 enhanced, whereas knockdown of Bmi-1 diminished, the capability of glioma cells to induce tubule formation and migration of endothelial cells and neovascularization in chicken chorioallantoic membrane. In vivo, Bmi-1 overexpression and knockdown, respectively, promoted and inhibited angiogenesis in orthotopically transplanted human gliomas. Furthermore, NF-κB activity and VEGF-C expression was induced by Bmi-1 overexpression, whereas Bmi-1 knockdown attenuated NF-κB signaling and decreased VEGF-C expression. Additionally suppression of NF-κB activity using a specific chemical inhibitor abrogated the NF-κB activation and the pro-angiogenic activities of glioma cells. Together, our data suggest that Bmi-1 plays an important role in glioma angiogenesis and therefore could represent a potential target for anti-angiogenic therapy against the disease. © 2013 Jiang et al.

84874423671	Comparison of Human Papillomavirus detection and genotyping with four different prime sets by PCR-sequencing	Objective: To assess and compare the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) detection efficiency and the potential clinical utility of PCR sequencing-based technology. Methods: Four HPV consensus primer sets (GP5+/6+, MGP, MY09/11, and PGMY09/11) were used in order to amplify a broad spectrum of HPV types for HPV infection in 325 cervical samples and the PCR products were sequenced afterwards for the HPV genotyping. Results: The HPV-positive rate was 75.4%, of which 35.5% harbored more than one HPV genotype. A total of 36 different genotypes was found, with HPV 16 (24.1%) being the most prevalent, followed by HPV 58 (13.3%) and HPV 52 (9.6%). There were substantial to almost perfect agreements between different primer sets regarding HPV detection efficiency, with the kappa value varying from 0.751 to 0.925, MGP, and PGMY09/11 were the most effective in detecting multiple infections (P<0.001). With each of the primer sets, a board range of HPV types could be identified, though there were several differences for a few genotypes. Conclusion: The substantial agreement between PCR-sequencing and HC2 for the detection of high-risk HPV (kappa=0.761) indicated that PCR-sequencing is also suitable for routine HPV screening.

84874396207	Despite shared susceptibility loci, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma embraces more familial cancer than gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in the Taihang mountains high-risk region of northern central China	Background In China, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) share susceptibility loci, but different rates of multiple primary cancer and male/female ratio suggest the proportion of familial cancer is not equal. Methods The percent of cases with a positive family history, median onset age, rate of multiple primary cancer, and male/female ratio associated with upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA were compared to reveal the proportion of familial cancer. The 7267 subjects analyzed constituted all ESCC and GCA cases in whom the cancer was resected with cure intention between 1970 and 1994 at the 4th Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Results A positive family history for cancer was most often associated with the multiple primary ESCC and/or GCA cases, e.g. with 42% of the males and 59% of the females. For upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA, the percent of cases with a positive family history decreased by 38.5%, 26.3%, 26.5%, and 11.2% in males (P <0.000) and 25.0%, 22.3%, 23.9%, and 9.8% in females (P <0.0001). Median onset age increased from 49, 52, 55, to 56 years old in males and from 50, 53, 55, to 56 years old in females (both P <0.0001) for upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA. Male/female ratio increased from 2.2, 2.1, 2.2, to 6.2:1 for upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA (P <0.0001). For upper, middle, lower third ESCC and GCA, the percent of multiple primary cancers decreased from 21.2%, 2.3%, 2.2%, to 1.5% in males and from 14.3%, 2.4%, 3.4%, to 3.1% in females. The preponderance of males, smoking, drinking, or onset-age ≥50 years was significantly higher in GCA than in ESCC, and the difference in the rates of multiple primary cancers between the preponderant and the non-preponderant cases was significant in GCA, but not in ESCC, suggesting non-equal requirement for genetic susceptibility when environmental hazards did not exist. Conclusions The proportion of familial cancer in upper gastrointestinal carcinomas decreases by the priamry site of upper, middle, lower third esophagus and gastric cardia. Considering familial and sporadic cancers differ in preventability, screening strategy and recurrence, our findings have basic and clinical implications.

84875505278	Curative effect and safety of percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale on 23 migraineurs	Objective: To evaluate the clinical effect and safety of percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovalein treatment of migraine. Methods: We studied 23 patients with migraine who were tested positive in Contrast Transcranial Doppler (TCDc) at the Department of Neurology in Bethune First Hospital of Jilin University between 2010 May and 2011 November. Procedures of transcatheterclosure of patent foramen ovale were performed at Department of Cardiovascular Surgery. At varied time points post-surgery, the patients were re-examined by TCDc and transthoracic echocardiograph (TTE) and followed up by phone interviewed with Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire to elevate improvement of migraine. The data was analyzed statistically. Results: Percutaneous closure was successful in all patients without major long-term side-effects. At follow-ups at 48-542 days ((247 ± 145) days) post-surgery, the scores of HIT-6 were reduced to 38-70 (51 ± 9), compared to the pre-operative scores of 42-76 (61 ± 8). Disability by migraine had significantly improved (t = 4.80, P < 0.05). In 6 patients with migraine with aura, the scores of HIT-6 were reduced to 46-56 (51 ± 3), from preoperative scores of 63-76 (69 ± 4) and their disability affected by migraine had significantly improved (t = 6.80, P < 0.05). In 17 patients with migraine without aura, the scores of HIT-6 after surgery were reduced to 36-70 (52 ± 10) from the preoperative scores of 42-69 (60 ± 8) and disability affected by migraine in this group had significantly improved (t =3.77, P < 0.05). Among 18 patients having MRI or CT examination before the operation, 8 patients had neurological events (such as cerebral infarction, cerebral ischemia) with average age of (44 ± 7) years old. In this group, disability affected by migraine had significantly improved (the HIT-6 scores; 49 ± 7 vs 58 ± 10, t = 2.49, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Percutaneous closure of PFO showed significant improvement in migraine treatment and it is a safe procedure. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84875098122	Preferential sites for the integration and disruption of human papillomavirus 16 in cervical lesions	Background: Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary to cause cervical cancer, and integrating viral DNA into the host genome may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis. The underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate the distribution of HPV 16 integration in the host genome and disrupted sites in the viral genome. Study design: The physical status of HPV 16 genomes in 46 cervical precancerous and cancerous lesions was determined via ligation-mediated chain reaction (DIPS) using 15 previously published primer sets and 12 newly designed primer sets. Results: A total of 60 viral-cellular junctions were identified in 31 of 46 specimens, and over 80% of the integration sites in the human genome were located in regions of repetitive elements. The proportion of LSIL-, HSIL-, and SCC-containing integration sites near cancer-relevant genes was 10%, 18.8%, and 33.3%, respectively. The frequency of viral gene disruption was significantly higher (P<0.05) in the L2 gene than in other regions of the viral genome. Conclusion: There are sites of preferential HPV 16 integration. The integration sites tend to be located in repetitive regions of the host genome, and some sites are found near cancer-relevant genes. In addition, the HPV 16 genome is more likely to be disrupted in the L2 gene locus. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84875925590	Research on the preparation of antioxidant peptides derived from egg white with assisting of high-intensity pulsed electric field	Egg white protein powder, one of the main egg products, was hydrolysed by Alcalase, Trypsin, and Pepsin respectively to prepare antioxidant peptides. All hydrolysates were assayed by determination of reducing power (RP) ability. Three kinds of hydrolysates were prepared under optimal enzymatic parameters that were obtained from the preliminary one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and response surface methodology (RSM) experiments. The results showed that the Alcalase hydrolysates exerted the best RP ability. Thereafter, the Alcalase hydrolysates were sequentially fractionated by ultra filtration membranes in cut-off molecular weight (MW) of 30, 10, and 1 kDa, and tested their antioxidant activities in terms of RP ability, DPPH radical scavenging ability, ABTS radical scavenging ability, and FRAP assay. Effects of high intensity pulsed electric field treatment were further investigated on antioxidant peptides to improve their activities. The results showed that Alcalase hydrolysates possessed the strongest antioxidant ability compared with the other two hydrolysates, particularly for the Fraction-3 with MW <1 kDa. After PEF treatment, this fraction showed a significant improvement of RP ability within 5 h (P < 0.05). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84878920857	An extensible distributed measurement platform for analyzing quality-of-experience (QoE) of multimedia applications over wireless networks	With rapid advancement of 3G wireless network technology, mobile Internet access is becoming more and more popular in recent years, and web access by mobile phones even surpassed that by other means. Users' level of satisfaction of services based on such rapidly developing technology immediately becomes an important issue. The distributed QoS (Quality of Service) / QoE (Quality of Experience) measurement platform proposed here solves this problem by offering network engineers capability to monitor network service quality and the likely QoE as experienced by phone users while watching streaming videos, for purposes like benchmarking and tracking down problematic cells. There are three major components of the proposed system: (1) client program; (2) backend server; and (3) web interface. The client program runs on Android smartphones. Using the various equipped hardware sensors, radio information, location information and network statistics, etc., are collected. By exploiting the mobility of smartphones, data can be collected wherever the phone is located. Those data are uploaded to the backend server for data aggregation and processing. In particular, a QoE computation algorithm recommended by ITU is used to convert raw data into QoE scores. To facilitate easy access to the general network service quality, a versatile web interface is also implemented to give detailed information of individual data collection sessions. © 2012 IEEE.

84879514384	Proteomics reveals energy and glutathione metabolic dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex of a rat model of depression	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent debilitating psychiatric mood that contributes to increased rates of disability and suicide. However, the pathophysiology underlying MDD remains poorly understood. A growing number of studies have associated dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with depression, but no proteomic study has been conducted to assess PFC protein expression in a preclinical model of depression.Using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression, differential protein expression between the PFC proteomes of CUMS and control rats was assessed through two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry. Differential protein expression was analyzed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway over-representation. Four differential proteins were selected for Western blotting validation.Twenty-nine differential proteins were identified in the PFC of CUMS rats relative to control rats. Through KEGG analysis, energy and glutathione metabolic pathways were determined to be the most significantly altered biological pathways. Two of the four differential proteins selected for Western blotting validation - glyoxalase 1 and dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 - were found to be significantly downregulated in CUMS relative to control rats.In conclusion, proteomic analysis reveals that energy and glutathione metabolism are the most significantly altered biological pathways in the CUMS rat model of depression. Further investigation on these processes and proteins in the PFC is key to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of MDD. © 2013 .

84880715461	High Glucose Promotes Aβ Production by Inhibiting APP Degradation	Abnormal deposition of neuriticplaques is the uniqueneuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Amyloid β protein (Aβ), the major component of plaques, is generated from sequential cleavage of amyloidβ precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase complex. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), characterized by chronic hyperglycemia,have increased risk of AD development.However, the role of high blood glucose in APP processing and Aβ generation remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the effect of high glucose on APP metabolism and Aβ generation in cultured human cells. We found that high glucose treatment significantly increased APP protein level in both neuronal-like and non-neuronal cells, and promoted Aβ generation. Furthermore, we found that high glucose-induced increase of APP level was not due to enhancement of APP gene transcription but resulted from inhibition of APP protein degradation. Taken together, our data indicated that hyperglycemia could promote AD pathogenesis by inhibiting APP degradation and enhancing Aβ production. More importantly, the elevation of APP level and Aβ generation by high glucose was caused by reduction of APP turnover rate.Thus,our study provides a molecular mechanism of increased risk of developing AD in patients withDMand suggests thatglycemic control might be potentially beneficial for reducing the incidence of AD in diabetic patients and delaying the AD progression. © 2013 Yang et al.

84881664862	Relationship between endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke: A meta-analysis	Objectives: Previous studies examining whether polymorphisms (G894T, 4b/a, and T786C) in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene are associated with ischemic stroke have yielded conflicting results. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the potential association between these three eNOS gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk. Materials and methods: We searched databases until April 30, 2012 and used fixed or random effects models to estimate the pooled odds ratios (ORs). Results: We analyzed 34 case-control data sets from 33 publications involving 5261/5823 cases/controls for G894T, 4295/4682 for 4b/a, and 2698/3254 for T786C polymorphisms. For Asian populations, all models showed significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke for the G894T (dominant model: OR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.30-1.91; P = 0.000) and 4b/a polymorphisms (dominant model: OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.25-1.71; P = 0.000), even after Bonferroni correction (because 0.000 < 0.017). In white populations, the aa genotype seemed to be protective for ischemic stroke, as indicated by the recessive model (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.87; P = 0.019). In Asian populations, the T786C polymorphism was significantly associated with ischemic stroke, as found using the dominant (OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.34; P = 0.025) and additive models (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.33; P = 0.006). Conclusions: Our comprehensive meta-analysis ascertains that the G894T, 4b/a, and T786C polymorphisms are associated with ischemic stroke risk in Asians. A possible contrasting role of the 4b/a polymorphism in ischemic stroke was indicated in white populations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84883478160	miR-205 targets PTEN and PHLPP2 to augment AKT signaling and drive malignant phenotypes in non-small cell lung cancer	AKT signaling is constitutively activated in various cancers, due in large part to loss-of-function in the PTEN and PHLPP phosphatases that act as tumor suppressor genes. However, AKT signaling is activated widely in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) where genetic alterations in PTEN or PHLPP genes are rare, suggesting an undefined mechanism(s) for their suppression. In this study, we report upregulation of the oncomir microRNA (miR)-205 in multiple subtypes of NSCLC, which directly represses PTEN and PHLPP2 expression and activates both the AKT/FOXO3a and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. miR-205 overexpression in NSCLC cells accelerated tumor cell proliferation and promoted blood vessel formation in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated silencing of endogenous miR-205 abrogated these effects. The malignant properties induced by miR-205 in NSCLC cells were reversed by AKT inhibitors, FOXO3a overexpression, rapamycin treatment, or restoring PHLPP2 or PTEN expression. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-205 overexpression was a result of NF-κB-mediated transactivation of the miR-205 gene. Taken together, our results define a major epigenetic mechanism for suppression of PTEN and PHLPP2 in NSCLC, identifying a pivotal role for miR-205 in development and progression of this widespread disease. ©2013 AACR.

84884489459	Resveratrol Inhibits CD4	Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol compound, has broad effects on critical events, including inflammation, oxidation, cancer and aging. However, the function and molecular mechanisms of resveratrol on T cell activation are controversial. In the present study, we found that resveratrol significantly inhibits the activation and cytokine production of T cells in vitro and in vivo. Sirt1 expression was up-regulated in resveratrol-treated T cells. Once Sirt1 was down-regulated in the T cells, the resveratrol-induced inhibition of T cell activation noticeably diminished. The acetylation of c-Jun decreased and its translocation was impeded in the resveratrol-treated T cells. The incidence and severity of collagen-induced arthritis in the resveratrol-treated mice were considerably reduced. © 2013 Zou et al.

84885308389	The upper brachial plexus defect model in rhesus monkeys: A cadaveric feasibility study	To establish a model for nerve grafts and determine the anatomic characteristics of the brachial plexus in rhesus monkeys. Ten specimens of the brachial plexus were obtained from five rhesus monkey cadavers. Anatomic dissection of the brachial plexus was systemically performed. The length of each root, trunk, and each division was measured using a Vernier caliper proximodistally. The anatomic distributions of the suprascapular, axillary, and musculocutaneous nerve were documented. The brachial plexus of rhesus monkeys included the spinal nerves or roots of C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 (80%, 8/10), with a small contribution from the C4 root (20%, 2/10) occasionally. The upper trunk was not measurable because of their irregular structures. The lower trunk had a mean length of 1.62 (range, 0.96-2.1 mm) and a mean diameter of 2.29 (range, 1.9-2.94 mm). For the upper trunk, the C5 and C6 roots either divided into two very short divisions or sent out very long divisions before they joined together. For the middle trunk, the C7 root had a straight course after leaving the foramen and blended imperceptibly into the middle trunk before dividing into the anterior and posterior divisions. The lower trunk was noted in almost all the specimens (80%, 8/10), which was formed by C8 and T1. The brachial plexus in rhesus monkeys varies from that of humans, and defects can be made at the level of C5 and C6 roots and the C7 root should also be cut off and ligated. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84886730971	Significance of pseudocapsule in the excision of pituitary adenomas in transsphenoidal surgery	Objective: To explore the significance of pseudocapsule in the excision of pituitary adenomas in transsphenoidal surgery. Methods: For 22 patients with pituitary adenomas over a period of 2 years at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, resection of pseudocapsule was applied for complete tumor removal. Pituitary function test and radiological imaging were performed at pre-operation, 3 months post-operation and at subsequent 6-12 months intervals postoperatively. Results: All pituitary adenomas were totally removed under microscope. The symptoms of headache, disorder of sight and visual field disappeared postoperatively in nonfunctional pituitary adenomas. The GH levels of 2/5 growth hormone secreting adenoma patients were 4.2 and 7.7 μg/L while it was under 1 μg/L for another 3. The postoperative level of prolactin was 4.3 μg/L in prolactin secreting adenoma. The level of adrenocorticotropic hormore decreased under 5 ng/L except one was 15.7 ng/L. Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid occurred intraoperatively in 3 patients and postoperatively in 1. No leakage was found after repair. Diabetes insipidus occurred in one patient and was controlled with Minirin. Pseudocapsule was confirmed by pathological examination. Special staining revealed reticulum fibers in pseudocapsule. Conclusion: Resection of pseudocapsule may achieve a higher remission rate without deteriorating pituitary function. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84890795817	Xenon-enhanced CT assessment of cerebral blood flow in stroke-in-progress patients with unilateral internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery stenosis	Carotid or cerebral artery stenosis resulting in low perfusion is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Understanding the unique hemodynamic features in each patient undergoing a stroke-in-progress (SIP) and the correlation between progression and cerebral blood flow (CBF) status would help in the diagnosis and treatment of individual patients. We used xenon-enhanced CT (Xe-CT) to examine cerebral perfusion in patients with or without SIP (30 patients/group), recruited from October 2009 to October 2010. Only SIP patients with unilateral stenosis in the internal or middle cerebral artery were recruited. The occurrence of watershed infarction was higher in the SIP group than in the non-SIP group (P <0.05). In the SIP group, larger hypoperfused areas were found around the lesions than in the non-SIP group. In the SIP group, the CBF values in the ipsilateral areas were significantly lower than those in corresponding regions on the contralateral side. CBF values in the contralateral hemisphere were significantly lower in the SIP group than in the non-SIP group. In SIP patients, infarctions were surrounded by larger hypoperfused areas than in non-SIP patients. These larger hypoperfused areas may result in pathological damage to the brain that is responsible for the progression of stroke. © 2013 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84892579030	Effect of cilostazol in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Previous studies with small sample size have shown that cilostazol can reduce the risk of cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this study was to determine whether cilostazol is effective in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Studies investigating the effect of cilostazol in patients with aneurysmal SAH were identified using Embase.com without language or publication-type restrictions. We used the random-effect model to combine data. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Two randomized controlled trials and two quasi-randomized controlled trials with a total of 340 patients were included. The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (RR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.72; p < 0.001), severe vasospasm (RR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.82; p = 0.007), vasospasm-related new cerebral infarctions (RR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22-0.67; p = 0.001), and poor outcome (RR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.88; p = 0.011) were significantly lower in the cilostazol group. The numbers needed to treat for these outcomes were 6.4, 6.3, 5.7, and 5.4, respectively. Mortality rate differences between the two groups were insignificant. No statistical heterogeneity was found for all outcomes. These results show that cilostazol can decrease the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, severe vasospasm, vasospasm-related new cerebral infarctions, and poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we chose fibroblast cells from a highly inbred pig line called Banna mini-pig inbred line (BMI) as donor nuclei for nuclear transfer, combining with transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and successfully generated α-1,3- galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) gene biallelic knockout (KO) pigs. To validate the efficiency of TALEN vectors, in vitro-transcribed TALEN mRNAs were microinjected into one-cell stage parthenogenetically activated porcine embryos. The efficiency of indel mutations at the GGTA1-targeting loci was as high as 73.1% (19/26) among the parthenogenetic blastocysts. TALENs were co-transfected into porcine fetal fibroblasts of BMI with a plasmid containing neomycin gene. The targeting efficiency reached 89.5% (187/209) among the survived cell clones after a 10 d selection. More remarkably 27.8% (58/209) of colonies were biallelic KO. Five fibroblast cell lines with biallelic KO were chosen as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Three miniature piglets with biallelic mutations of the GGTA1 gene were achieved. Gal epitopes on the surface of cells from all the three biallelic KO piglets were completely absent. The fibroblasts from the GGTA1 null piglets were more resistant to lysis by pooled complement-preserved normal human serum than those from wild-type pigs. These results indicate that a combination of TALENs technology with SCNT can generate biallelic KO pigs directly with high efficiency. The GGTA1 null piglets with inbred features created in this study can provide a new organ source for xenotransplantation research. © 2013 Xin et al.

84894586108	Construction and in vitro evaluation of tissue-specific prostate-specific antigen promoter/enhancer-regulated vectors	To construct specific vectors and evaluate the biological feature of prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter/ enhancer, three fragments harboring PSA enhancer (PSAE) and promoter (PSAP) were amplified using the PCR method. Two PSA promoters, PSA enhancer and pTAL-Luc, were used to construct PSAP1-Luc, PSAP2-Luc, and PSAE-Luc. These recombinant plasmids were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase plasmid into the three cell lines of PC-3, Hela, and MCF-7. The expression levels of β-galactosidase luciferase were respectively measured quantitatively. The recombinant plasmids, PSAP1-Luc, PSAP2-Luc, and PSAELuc, were successfully constructed. Prostate cancer cell PC-3 expressed a higher luciferase activity than that of cervical-cancer cell Hela and breast cancer cell MCF-7 after being transfected with one of the three plasmids. Among the three plasmids in the three types of cells studied, the highest luciferase level was observed with the PSAP2-Luc transfection. The PSA promoters and enhancer possessed some tissue-specific activity in reporter gene analysis. Among them, the PSA promoter2 containing 620 bp showed the highest expression efficiency. In the three cell lines tested, the highest tissue-specific activity of luciferase over β-galactosidase was observed in the PC-3 cells. These relatively tissue-specific promoters have an impact in the gene therapy of prostate cancer. © 2014 by American Scientific Publishers.

84894244819	Genome sequence and comparative analysis of a Vibrio cholerae O139 strain E306 isolated from a cholera case in China	Background: Vibrio cholerae is a human intestinal pathogen and V. cholerae of the O139 serogroups are responsible for the current epidemic cholera in China. In this work, we reported the whole genome sequencing of a V. cholerae O139 strain E306 isolated from a cholera patient in the 306th Hospital of PLA, Beijing, China. Results: We obtained the draft genome of V. cholerae O139 strain E306 with a length of 4,161,908 bps and mean G + C content of 47.7%. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain E306 was very close to another O139 strain, V. cholerae MO10, which was isolated during the cholera outbreak in India and Bangladesh. However, unlike MO10, strain E306 harbors the El Tor-specific RS1 element with no pre-CTX prophage (VSK), very similar to those found in some V. cholerae O1 strains. In addition, strain E306 contains a SXT/R391 family integrative conjugative element (ICE) similar to ICEVchInd4 and SXT

84894250995	Variants in the 5'-upstream region of GPC5 confer risk of lung cancer in never smokers	Background: A recent genome-wide study (GWAS) has identified GPC5 as a promising susceptibility gene for Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS). However, the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this GWAS, rs2352028, has yielded controversial results. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between rs2352028 and LCINS. Considering that rs2352028 might be largely marker-SNP correlated to causative variants, two predicted functional SNPs, rs3759452 and rs7322083, were additionally investigated in this study. Methods: A hospital based case-control study including 298 cases and 599 controls in a never-smoking Chinese Han population was conducted, and then a meta-analysis combining our data and published data was performed to verify the findings. Results: The SNP rs3759452, predicted to potentially change transcription factor binding site of GPC5, was significantly associated with LCINS risk (odds ratio for dominant model. =. 1.55, 95% confidence interval. =. 1.14-2.12). Nevertheless, no significant evidence was showed for rs2352028, both in our case-control study and the meta-analysis including 13 studies of 2342 LCINS cases and 13,398 never-smoking controls. Further subgroup meta-analysis according to population ethnicity and cancer histology also reported no significant association of rs2352028. Conclusions: The association conferring rs3759452 further supports the value of GPC5 in susceptibility to LCINS. Nevertheless, comprehensive analyses are warranted to dissect the functional mechanism underpinning rs3759452. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84900395526	Prevalence and correlates of depression among college nursing students in China	This study aims to assess the prevalence of depression and examine potential risk factors correlated to depression among nursing college students in China. Between September and November 2012, a total of 763 college nursing students were randomly selected to participate in a survey, which included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The result showed that 22.9% (95% CI: 20.0%-25.9%) of participants reported high score on the CES-D (16 or above). Risk factors significantly associated with depression in the univariate analysis were academic performance, academic stress, interest in majors, occupational future, interpersonal relationship, frequency of exercise, self-reported health status, social support, educational level of father, relationship with parents and making decisions without interference by parents. Backward multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lower academic stress, and better occupational future were strongly related to lower risk of depression, followed by active use of social support, full making decision power, better relationship with father and higher self-reported health status. The findings suggested that in order to prevent depression among college nursing students, school- and family-based strategies should be developed and implemented. © 2013.

84899834863	Dynamic cerebral autoregulation is heterogeneous in different subtypes of acute ischemic stroke	Background and Purpose: Stroke of large-artery atherosclerosis and small-artery occlusion are two main subtypes of stroke according to TOAST classification. The underlying mechanisms of how these two subtypes affect dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) might be heterogeneous, resulting in varied clinical conditions and outcomes. We therefore studied the pattern of dCA in these two subtypes. Methods: Forty-one patients with acute unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory stroke (15 with ipsilateral large-artery atherosclerosis and 26 with small-artery occlusion) and 20 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Non-invasive continuous cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial blood pressure were recorded simultaneously from each subject in supine position using transcranial Doppler on MCA bilaterally and servo-controlled plethysmograph on the middle finger, respectively. Transfer function analysis was applied to derive autoregulatory parameters, gain, phase difference (PD), and slope of step response. Results: In the large-artery atherosclerosis group, PD in affected hemisphere was 42.9±18.5 degree, which is significantly lower than the unaffected hemisphere (72.4±29.9 degree, P<0.01), and the healthy group (P<0.01). However, PD is similar in the unaffected hemisphere and healthy group ( P>0.1). In the small-artery occlusion group, PD in the affected hemisphere was similar to that in the contralateral hemisphere (33.8±17.9 vs. 32.6±21.1 degree, P>0.1), both sides were significantly lower than the healthy group (all P<0.001).The results of the slope of step response agree with the findings in PD. Conclusions: DCA in different subtypes of acute ischemic stroke is heterogeneous, which might be attributed to the varied pathologic changes of cerebral blood vessels. © 2014 Guo et al.

84902312884	Increased globulin and its association with hemorrhagic transformation in patients receiving intra-arterial thrombolysis therapy	Previous studies have identified a diverse set of predisposing factors for the occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation (HT), but the independent clinical predictors of HT after intraarterial thrombolysis have not been determined. In this retrospective study, we investigated the characteristics of patients with or without HT who had received intra-arterial thrombolysis therapy, using biochemical analysis, renal function test, routine blood test, blood lipid test, coagulation blood test, liver function test, random blood glucose test, timewindow for intra-arterial thrombolysis, recanalization, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and systolic blood pressure before intra-arterial thrombolysis. The mortality rates were similar in the HT and non-HT groups (P = 0.944). In the singlefactor analysis, patients with a higher globulin level (P <0.002), prothrombin time activity percentage (PTA; P = 0.026), and NIHSS score (P = 0.002), had a significantly increased risk of developing HT. In the multifactor logistic regression model involving globulin level, PTA, white blood cell count, and NIHSS score, the globulin level (P <0.001; OR, 1.185; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.090-1.288), PTA (P = 0.018; OR, 1.016; 95% CI, 1.003-1.029), white blood cell count (P = 0.025; OR, 1.097; 95% CI, 1.012-1.190) and NIHSS score (P = 0.003; OR, 1.097; 95% CI, 1.031-1.166) were significantly increased in the HT group. The increase in globulin level is an independent risk factor for HT in patients receiving intra-arterial thrombolysis. The possible mechanisms may involve inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and positive acute-phase reactants synthesized by the liver. © 2014 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag.

84905588698	Comparison of Two Contrast Agents for Right-to-Left Shunt Diagnosis with Contrast-Enhanced Transcranial Doppler	We compared two contrast agents, agitated saline and agitated saline with blood, with respect to their efficacy in the diagnosis of right-to-left shunt with contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler. Three hundred thirty Chinese patients underwent examinations with one of four different methods in random order: (i) 9 mL agitated saline solution with 1 mL air without the Valsalva maneuver (ASwoVM); (ii) 9 mL agitated saline solution with 1 mL air with the Valsalva maneuver (ASwVM); (iii) 9 mL agitated saline solution, 1 mL air and a drop of the patient's blood without the Valsalva maneuver (ASbwoVM); and (iv) 9 mL agitated saline solution, 1 mL air and a drop of the patient's blood, with the Valsalva maneuver (ASbwVM). Rates of detection were 11.5%, 17.9%, 16.7% and 23.6% for the ASwoVM, ASwVM, ASbwoVM, and ASbwVM examinations, respectively. The embolus track numbers for these examinations were 4.0 ± 1.83, 11.5 ± 6.2, 10.5 ± 4.9 and 33.7 ± 14.9, respectively. There were significant differences between the four groups (all comparisons, p < 0.001). For contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler examinations, the agitated saline/blood agent yielded better rates of diagnosis of right to-left shunt than did the agitated saline alone. © 2014.

84905964136	Compromised dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients with a right-to-left shunt: A potential mechanism of migraine and cryptogenic stroke	Background and Purpose: The relationship between right-to-left shunts (RLS) and migraine and cryptogenic stroke is not well understood. In this study, we investigated whether RLS are associated with impairment of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), which may play a role in migraine and cryptogenic stroke. Methods: Sixty-six migraineurs were enrolled in the study, including 36 non-RLS patients and 30 RLS patients. Non-invasive continuous cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial blood pressure were recorded simultaneously from each patient by using transcranial Doppler and servo-controlled plethysmograph, respectively. Transfer function analysis was applied to derive autoregulatory parameters of gain, phase difference (PD), and autoregulation index. Results: The PD in migraineurs with RLS was 50.6±22.9 degrees, which was significantly lower than that observed in the non-RLS group (67.2±18.2 degrees, P<0.001). The PD in the large RLS group (45.4±22.6 degrees) was significantly lower than that of the small RLS group (64.9±17.1 degrees, P<0.01) and non-RLS group (P<0.001); however, the PD in the small RLS group was similar to that of the non-RLS group. The PD in the permanent group (48.8±19.9 degrees) was similar to that of the latent group (52.6±26.1 degrees), and both were significantly lower than that of the non-RLS group (P<0.05). The autoregulation index results were similar to the PD findings. Conclusions: dCA is impaired in migraineurs with large RLS, and this may represent a potential mechanism linking RLS, migraine, and cryptogenic stroke. © 2014 Guo et al.

84918496115	A probabilistic associative model for segmenting weakly supervised images	Weakly supervised image segmentation is an important yet challenging task in image processing and pattern recognition fields. It is defined as: in the training stage, semantic labels are only at the image-level, without regard to their specific object/scene location within the image. Given a test image, the goal is to predict the semantics of every pixel/superpixel. In this paper, we propose a new weakly supervised image segmentation model, focusing on learning the semantic associations between superpixel sets (graphlets in this paper). In particular, we first extract graphlets from each image, where a graphlet is a small-sized graph measures the potential of multiple spatially neighboring superpixels (i.e., the probability of these superpixels sharing a common semantic label, such as the sky or the sea). To compare different-sized graphlets and to incorporate image-level labels, a manifold embedding algorithm is designed to transform all graphlets into equal-length feature vectors. Finally, we present a hierarchical Bayesian network to capture the semantic associations between postembedding graphlets, based on which the semantics of each superpixel is inferred accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that: 1) our approach performs competitively compared with the state-of-the-art approaches on three public data sets and 2) considerable performance enhancement is achieved when using our approach on segmentation-based photo cropping and image categorization. © 2014 IEEE.

13244271954	HIV/AIDS-related discrimination in Shanxi rural areas of China	Objective: In order to explore the features of discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS in rural areas, a community-based intervention was carried out in two pilot communities of X County of Shanxi Province from September 2002 to October 2003. Methods: Data were collected using qualitative methods (in-depth interview and focus group discussion) and anonymously structured questionnaires. Results: (1) Severe discrimination against people infected with HIV/AIDS was revealed in the target communities. However, the response to HIV/AIDS was different in each community. (2) People were reluctant to disclose their HIV status or get tested for HIV, which endangered their sexual partners to contract HIV through unprotected sexual intercourses. (3) Attitudes towards people infected with HIV/AIDS varied. (4) Public education promoted a better understanding of HIV/AIDS which in turn improved community attitudes and behaviors towards people with HIV/AIDS. Conclusion: HIV/AIDS-related discrimination undermines both individuals' and communities' responses to HIV/AIDS and may be a serious obstacle towards effective HIV/AIDS prevention and control.

84924534654	Research advances in the application of methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury	Acute spinal cord injury (ASCI), mainly caused by traffic accidents and fall injuries, is a catastrophic event that can profoundly affect the trajectory of a patient's life. Debate continues over the medical management of ASCI, in particular the usefulness, dosage, and potential risks of methylprednisolone (MP). Although the results of American National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study II and II trials led to the wide adoption of a high-dose MP regimen for ASCI patients, the reliabilities of their study methods and data were still questionable. Based on the currently available literature, we conclude that high-dose MP is no longer a recommended therapy for ASCI; however, due to the lack of effective treatment, it remains a useful option for this condition.
