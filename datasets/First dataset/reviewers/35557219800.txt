15244355593	Polymer-DNA hybrid nanoparticles based on folate-polyethylenimine-block- poly(L-lactide)	The ability of amphiphilic block copolymers that consist of polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) to modulate the delivery of plasmid DNA was evaluated. Folate-polyethylenimine-block-poly(L-lactide) (folate-PEI-PLLA) was synthesized by linking folic acid and PLLA to PEI diamine. Water-soluble polycation PEI provides gene-loading capability. Additionally, PEI is considered to exhibit high transfection efficiency and endosomal disrupting capacity. Hydrophobic PLLA that is incorporated into the gene delivery vector is believed to enhance the cell interactions and tissue permeability of the delivery system. Polymeric carrier containing folic acid is expected to be able to identify tumor surface receptors and transfect cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The results of agarose retardation assay indicated that the folate-PEI-PLLA began to form polyplexes at a polymer/DNA weight ratio (P/D) of over 10, whereas branched polyethylenimine (B-PEI) formed polyplexes with DNA at a ratio of above 1. The spherical particle morphology was supplemented with a particle size of approximately 100 nm at 10 P/D ratio. The results indicated that folate-PEI-PLLA with proper PEI/PLLA ratio effectively reduced cytotoxicity and maintained acceptable transfection efficiency. Low cytotoxicity of the folate-PEI-PLLA gives an advantage to high-dose administration. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

19444376142	Preparation and characterization of intelligent core-shell nanoparticles based on poly(D,l-lactide)-g-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-methacrylic acid)	New thermo-responsive, pH-responsive, and biodegradable nanoparticles comprised of poly(d,l-lactide)-graft-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (PLA-g-P(NIPAm-co-MAA)) were developed by grafting biodegradable poly(d,l-lactide) onto N-isopropyl acrylamide and methacrylic acid. A core-shell type nano-structure was formed with a hydrophilic outer shell and a hydrophobic inner core, which exhibited a phase transition temperature above 37°C suitable for biomedical application. Upon heating above the phase transition temperature, PLA-g-P(NIPAm-co-MAA) nanoparticle showed a polarity increase of pyrene in either buffer solution or intra-hepato-carcinoma cells as determined by fluorescence measurement, indicating that the structure of nanoparticles caused leakages from outer shell copolymers aggregation and collapsed. The drug loading level of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) encapsulated in the PLA-g-P(NIPAm-co-MAA) nanoparticles can be as high as 20%. The release of 5-FU from nanoparticles was strongly controlled by the pH in the aqueous solution. Based on these results, PLA-g-P(NIPAm-co-MAA) nanoparticles can be used as a drug carrier for intracellular delivery of anti-cancer drug. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0029845466	Surface modification of silicone rubber membrane by plasma induced graft copolymerization as artificial cornea	In this study a highly biocompatible polymer membrane was prepared by surface modification. An artificial cornea was also developed for clinical applications. Silicone rubber (SR) membrane was grafted with hydrophilic monomers such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and acrylic acid by plasma induced grafted polymerization. Surface properties of the SR were characterized using secondary ions mass spectra, Fourier transform infrared/attenuated total reflection, and element spectra for chemical analysis.

0008520010	Dielectric study of ferroelectric side-chain liquid crystalline polysiloxanes with broad temperature ranges of the chiral smectic C phase 1. Structure dependence of dielectric relaxation	The dielectric behavior of a series of ferroelectric side-chain liquid crystalline polysiloxanes containing 1-3 oligooxyethylene units as spacers, and 4-(S)-2-methyl-1-butyl[[(4-hydroxybiphenyl-4′-yl)]carbonyl]oxy] benzoate or 4-(S)-2-methyl-1-butyl[[(4-hydroxy-biphenyl-4′-yl)carbonyl]oxy]-3-fluoro benzoate side groups was studied by broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The increase of the spacer length, and incorporation of a strong dipole moment fluoro-substituent into the mesogenic group, resulted in a decrease of the relaxation activation energy and an increase in the intensity of the relaxation. Moreover, the relaxation peak of the Goldstone mode has only been observed for the FLCP with a lateral fluorosubstituent. The relationship between the thermal dynamic behavior and chemical structure is discussed in detail. Furthermore, analysis of the dielectric relaxation behavior of these FLCPs showed that the molecular relaxations could be described by the Cole-Cole equation. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0030083716	Effect of casting solvents on the morphology and properties of styrene-butadiene-styrene triblock copolymer membranes	The effect of the casting solvents on the morphology and properties of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) triblock copolymer membranes has been investigated. The SBS membranes were prepared by both dry and wet processes. The stress relaxation of the membranes prepared by the dry process was studied. It was found that the stress relaxation of the membrane prepared from tetrahydrofuran (THF) proceeded faster than that of the membrane prepared from the mixed solvent of THF and heptane. This phenomenon could be ascribed to the different membrane morphologies created by the two solvent systems. Three different SBS membrane structures were obtained from three different casting solvents. The results were interpreted based on the miscibility between the solvent and the nonsolvent.

The elemental composition and different carbon bindings on the surface of SR were examined. In vitro test involving the study of the influence of various surfaces of SR on attachment and growth of rabbit cornea epithelial cells (CEC) was carried out using cell culture assay.

Synthesis, thermal, and flame-retardant properties	A new phosphorus-containing oxirane, bis-(3-glycidyloxy) phenylphosphine oxide (BGPPO), was synthesized. Further curing BGPPO with diamine curing agents, dicyanodiamide (DICY), 4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM), and 4,4′-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), respectively, resulted in several phosphorylated epoxy resins. Compared with Epon 828, Eponex 1015, and DER 732, BGPPO showed relatively high reactivity toward diamine agents via DSC studies. Furthermore, the reactivity of the three curing agents toward BGPPO were found to be in the order of DDM > DICY > DDS. Thermal stability and the weight loss behavior of the cured polymers were studied by TGA. The phosphorylated resins showed lower weight loss temperatures and higher char yields than did the Epon 828-based resins. The high char yields as well as high limited oxygen index (LOI) values of the BGPPO-based resins confirmed the effectiveness of phosphorus-containing epoxy resins as flame retardants. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0030196148	Synthesis of acrylic acid grafted silicone rubber via preirradiation graft copolymerization and its physical and dielectric properties	The hydrophilic monomer, acrylic acid (AA), has been grafted onto hydrophobic silicone rubber (SR) film via the γ-ray preirradiation graft technique. The AA percent graft in SR-g-AA film increases with increasing irradiation dose rate. The iron powder in monomer solution serves as one source of ferrous ion that is generated by the oxidation reaction with water. The swelling effect shows that the amount of chloroform taken up by an SR-g-AA membrane decreases with the increasing AA grafting, and the amount of water, alcohol, and glycerol taken up by an SR-g-AA film increases with increasing AA percent grafting. The contact angle, ultimate stress, and elongation at break of SR and SR-g-AA copolymers decrease with increasing AA percent grafting. The oxygen/nitrogen selectivity in these films can be enhanced by the graft modification. The thermal behaviors of SR-g-AA copolymers show the characteristics of SR and polyacrylic acid. Finally, the dielectric properties show that the SR-g-AA film has a superior dielectric property than the original SR and poly(AA) matrix. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Collagen (type III) was also linked with the carboxylic group of pAA grafted onto the SR surface via a carbodiimine agent to obtain a secondary structure of SR. The SR surface properties were characterized by ATR-FTIR, ESCA, contact angle, and SFM. The biocompatibility of the SR surface was evaluated by a culture of cornea epithelial (CE) cells. Experimental results reveal that the number of CE cells attached onto the controlled SR was negligible. The attachment of cells onto pAA-grafted surfaces was clearly observed and peusopoda occurred; however, cell growth was depressed. Nevertheless, both cell attachment and growth onto collagen-linked linked surfaces were significant. The morphology of the cells attached onto this surface was normal for primary cells. Collagen introduced on the Sr surface was not denatured.

0029799084	Platelet adhesion and cellular interaction with poly(ethylene oxide) immobilized onto silicone rubber membrane surfaces	Cellular interaction and platelet adsorption were investigated on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEG) immobilized silicone rubber membrane (SR) which has polyacrylic acid grafts on the surfaces. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) had been introduced to the SR surface after Ar plasma treatment of SR surfaces to introduce peroxide groups. Surface characterizations were made using ATR-FTIR, ESCA, SEM, and contact angle measurements. Experimental results obtained by ESCA high resolution curve fitting spectra indicated that the amount of bisamino PEO of different molecular weights immobilized onto SR surfaces were similar, which showed that the influence of the length of molecular chains (-C-C-O-) on the re-activity of terminal amino group is negligible. The wettability of modified SR surfaces increased with an increase in PEO molecular weight. Biological studies such as corneal epithelial cell culture and blood platelet adhesion were performed to understand the biocompatibility of modified SR surfaces. Biological studies using corneal epithelial cells showed that cell migration, attachment and proliferation onto PEO-20000 immobilized SR surface were suppressed, whereas these biological activities on PEO-600 were enhanced. Another study on platelet adhesion revealed that many platelets attached to PEO-600 immobilized SR, while platelet deposition was rarely observed on SR grafted with PEO-3350. The effects of different PEO molecular chains on biological response were discussed.

These two diamine agents showed similar reactivity toward epoxies. Their reactivities were higher than DDS and lower than DDM. High char yields in TGA evaluation were found for all the phosphorylated epoxy resins, implying their high flame retardancy.

The intensity and frequency of the Goldstone mode for the FLCP were increased remarkably after doping with azobenzene dyes. Larger fluctuation of the spontaneous polarization vector in each smectic layer under an applied electric field can be brought about with the addition of a strong dipole-moment guest molecule. This leads to a larger spontaneous polarization and shorter response time. It was found that the doping of a suitable amount of a strong dipole-moment azobenzene dye in the LC phase of the FLCP is helpful for the improvement of the electro-optical properties.

0031848078	Effect of drug-polymer interaction on the release characteristics of methacrylic acid copolymer microcapsules containing theophylline	Theophylline anhydrate microcapsules with different amounts of MA/MMA copolymer (Eudragit L) were prepared by the solvent evaporation method. Qualitative as well as quantitative investigation of the drugpolymer interaction by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with a curve fitting program was undertaken. The release mechanisms of theophylline in pH 1.2 and pH 6.8 media were also studied to elucidate the effect of drugpolymer interaction on the release characteristics of microcapsules. Direct evidence for a hydrogen bonding interaction between theophylline and Eudragit L in microcapsules was obtained. Moreover, the fraction of hydrogen bonded theophylline increased with the increase of Eudragit L. The dissolution of theophylline from microcapsules exhibited an enteric-coated release property. The drug release mechanism was found to fit the Higuchi matrix model in the simulated gastric acid condition, but drug release was much more rapid in the pH 6.8 buffer solution. The drug release rate decreased as the composition of theophylline increased, and it was proportional to the fraction of hydrogen bonded theophylline. These results suggest that the increased fraction of hydrogen bonded theophylline in microencapsulation might improve the mixing and dispersibility of theophylline in the Eudragit L matrix, thus resulting in the increase of the release rate of theophylline from microcapsules.

0031167551	Phosphorus-containing epoxy for flame retardance: IV. Kinetics and mechanism of thermal degradation	The kinetics and mechanisms of thermal degradation of a phosphorus-containing epoxy based on bis-(3-glycidyloxy)phenylphosphine oxide (BGPPO) and 4,4′-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS) were studied. Two and four stages were found for BGPPO/DDS degradation in nitrogen and air, respectively. The degradation activation energies calculated from the methods of Kissinger, Friedman and Ozawa were obtained. The first stage of degradation, which results from the decomposition of phosphorous groups, showed lower activation energy than the other stages. Furthermore, via FTIR and TG-FTIR investigations, the degradation of this phosphorus-containing epoxy was determined to begin by the breaking of P-Ph bonds, followed by dehydration reactions breaking P-O-C bonds, and elimination of propyl groups. Therefore, the degradation of the epoxy resulted in high char yields and residues with high phosphorus contents. © 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.

Dielectric results indicate that the melamines (HMM1, and HMM2) and an alkoxysilane dye based all sol-gel organic-inorganic NLO materials, especially the ones with equivalent weight ratio of melamine and ASD have a higher glass transition temperature than the cured ASD sample. Moreover, the α-relaxation temperature increases with increasing content of HMMSI for the organically modified NLO sol-gel materials. As a result of that, better temporal stability at 100°C was obtained for these melamine-based sol-gel organic-inorganic materials as compared to that for the poled/cured ASD sample.

2342638273	Multienzyme-immobilized modified polypropylene membrane for an amperometric creatinine biosensor	Creatinine has become an important clinical analyte that is used for the determination of renal and muscular dysfunction. It is essential to determine its concentration in the serum of patients suffering from renal insufficiency. Therefore, an amperometric creatinine biosensor fabricated from a covered platinum/silver electrode with a thin layer of an immobilized multienzyme membrane was studied. Poly(acrylic acid) was introduced onto an argon-plasma-treated porous polypropylene membrane surface by graft copolymerization. Subsequently, three different enzymes (sarcosine oxidase, creatinase, and creatininase) were immobilized onto this novel grafted membrane simultaneously via a carbodiimine agent to form a thin layer. The sensor performance was evaluated with a biochemistry analyzer. Moreover, attenuated total reflection/Fourier transform infrared, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to confirm the progression of these reactions. The developed sensor showed a linear detection range of 3.2-320 μM for creatinine in a pH 7.4 buffered solution with 0.1M phosphate. The immobilized multienzyme membrane could be used for at least 3 weeks. The results obtained in our study will hopefully lead to the successful application of modified polypropylene for the development of a creatinine sensor. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2442482841	Molecular dynamics simulations of a liquid crystalline molecule in the smectic A and E phases and in vacuum	Molecular dynamics simulations are performed in this work at 393 and 323 K for a mesogenic molecule (-R)-1-methylheptyl 4[4-(2-allyloxyethoxy)biphenyl-4′-carbonyloxy]benzoate in the simulated smectics A and E, respectively, and in a vacuum at 300 K, for a period of 1.0 ns. The trajectories obtained from molecular dynamics simulations allow us to investigate the dynamical behaviour of this mesogenic molecule in the simulated smectic phases. This dynamical behaviour of a single molecule is presented using the distributions of dihedral angles and rotational diffusion around the C-axis defined by the simulated cells. Simulation results indicate that, except for the bonds near the end of the spacer segment, the dihedral angles all exhibit a single Gaussian-like distribution in the smectic A and E phases. Fluctuations of a dihedral angle about its mean value are more restricted in the smectics A and E than in those simulated in a vacuum. The average value of the fluctuations of the dihedral angles at the bonds in the spacer is found to be about 2 fold larger than that of fluctuations in the tail of the same molecule in the smectic A and E phases. In the smectic A phase, the distribution of orientations of a molecule about its long axis in a 36 molecule cell in which the outer molecules are fixed is found to have three distinct peaks. This result shows that the orientational fluctuations of single molecules are limited by confinement due to neighbouring molecules, i.e. that the layers have short-range structural correlations. The orientational distributions show larger fluctuations at the ends of the molecules. ©1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

2542573387	Molecular modelling of the structures of liquid crystals based on phenyl ester mesogens in the smectic phase	In this work, an atom-based molecular modelling technique is applied to determine the structures of smectic E, A, and C phases composed of phenyl ester mesogens. These mesogenic molecules are abbreviated as MDn21B. A computer search with molecular mechanics calculations is performed to identify the possible low energy configurations of two adjacent molecules. According to these results, the isolated molecules with their optimized structures approach dimer associations, and the favourable alignments are antiparallel. Depending on the lowest energy associations, ten different initial models for each phase, to simulate X-ray diffraction patterns, are developed by packing the dimers with an antiparallel association into periodic boxes. Also, relaxed models are obtained by applying cycles of energy minimization and molecular dynamics under (NVT) conditions at 500 K to these initial models. Molecular dynamics runs under (NPT) conditions are then performed on these relaxed models at a temperature of each smectic phase chosen to approach equilibrated structures in these phases. Simulations are also performed, and detailed molecular structures analysed, on the basis of these equilibrated structures. The simulated X-ray diffraction patterns for smectics E, A, and C are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally. The distributions of the dihedral angles at the bonds in the aromatic cores indicate that more fluctuations occur in the smectic A and C phases than in the smectic E. The average values of the aromatic core overlap, as calculated between neighbouring mesogens in the smectic phases, are in the range 4.78-5.91 Å. These values are slightly higher than those found in experimental X-ray diffraction patterns at the position 20 ̃ 20 . Total pair correlation functions have a similar appearance for smectics E and A. Also, these pair correlation functions are similar to the results for amorphous polymers, i.e. the total pair correlation functions lose their order outside a spherical shell with radius γ greater than 5 Å.

The PLLA-PEOz-PLLA micelles adopt a "flower-like" arrangement with A-blocks at the core and a B-block on the shell under neutral condition. The deformation of the core-shell structure is then promoted by the aggregation of PEOzs due to the formation of inter- and intra-hydrogen bonding between protonated nitrogen and carbonyl groups. The experiments on in vitro release have confirmed that the release of doxorubicin (DOX) from micelles was successfully inhibited at pH 7.4. In contrast, an accelerated release of DOX from micelles was observed at acidic conditions. The results of growth inhibition assay indicated that the cell-killing rate of DOX-loaded micelles gradually approached that of free DOX as increasing the concentration and the incubation time. The overlay of fluorescent images on CLSM observation clearly demonstrated the colocalization of DOX with acidic compartments, suggesting that the drug release was successfully triggered in the acidic organelles by means of micelle deformation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This study described a novel human corneal endothelial cell (HCEC) therapeutic method, where cultivated adult HCEC sheet with uniform orientation was prepared and transplanted to a rabbit cornea. Having a correct morphology and intact barriers, the HCEC sheet was made by the temperature-modulated detachment of monolayered HCECs from thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-grafted surfaces and was delivered with proper polarity to the corneal posterior surface by a bioadhesive gelatin disc. Results of the in vivo studies, including the follow-up clinical observations and histological examinations, showed the laminated HCEC sheet was successfully integrated into rabbit cornea denuded with endothelial layer after the biodegradation of gelatin carrier. These data indicate the feasibility of the proposed procedure in cell therapy for corneal endothelial cell loss. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The PEOz-b-LPEI copolymers were synthesized by coupling PEOz with LPEI in a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction between the sulfhydryl and pyridyl disulfide terminal groups. A polymer/DNA weight ratio (P/D) of over 12 was required to enable PEOz-b-LPEI to condense DNA completely. The DNA-condensing capability of the diblock copolymers was increased with increasing the hydrolytic degrees of the LPEI segment. The PEOz-b-LPEI polyplexes were stable in 150 mM NaCl aqueous solution and had a mean diameter around 190 nm, whereas BPEI and LPEI polyplexes formed large aggregates in the range 300-500 nm. In addition, these polyplexes exhibited the sensitivity to solution pH and were dissociated in the acidic buffers (pH ≤ 5.5).

33744969079	Environmental-sensitive micelles based on poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-b-poly(l-lactide) diblock copolymer for application in drug delivery	Anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was physically loaded into the micelles prepared from poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-b-poly(l-lactide) diblock copolymers (PEOz-PLLA). PEOz-PLLA consists of hydrophilic segment PEOz and hydrophobic segment PLLA showed pH-sensitivity in the aqueous solution. The DOX-loaded micelle exhibited a narrow size distribution with a mean diameter around 170 nm. The micellar structure can preserve hydrophobic drug DOX under the physiological condition (pH 7.4) and selectively release DOX by sensing the intracellular pH change in late endosomes and secondary lysosomes (pH 4-5). At 37 °C, the cumulated released rate of DOX from micelles was about 65% at pH 5.0 in the initial 24 h. Additionally, polymeric micelles had low cytotoxicity in human normal fibroblast HFW cells for 72 h by using MTT assay. Moreover, DOX-loaded micelles could slowly and efficiency decrease cell viability of non-small-cell lung carcinoma CL3 cells. Taken together, PEOz-b-PLLA diblock polymeric micelles may act as useful drug carriers for cancer therapy. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33745618710	Effect of charge and molecular weight on the functionality of gelatin carriers for corneal endothelial cell therapy	Cell transplantation strategies usually involve the use of supporting carrier materials because of the soft and fragile nature of these grafts. In this work, a cell-adhesive gelatin hydrogel carrier was fabricated to deliver cultivated human corneal endothelial cell (HCEC sheets, which were harvested from thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-grafted culture surfaces. The carrier disks, consisting of gelatins with a different isoelectric point (IEP = 5.0 and 9.0) and a molecular weight (MW) ranging from 3 to 100 kDa, were subjected to 16.6 kGy gamma irradiation for sterilization. The effect of IEP and MW of the raw gelatins (i.e., before irradiation) on the functionality of sterilized disks was studied by determinations of mechanical property, water content, dissolution degree, and cytocompatibility. Irrespective of the IEP of raw gelatin, hydrogel disks prepared with high MW (100 kDa) exhibited a greater tensile strength, lower water content, and slower dissolution rate than those made of low MW gelatin (8 and 3 kDa). From the investigation of cellular responses to the disks, the negatively charged gelatin (IEP = 5.0) groups were more cytocompatible when compared with their positively charged counterparts (IEP = 9.0) at the same MW (100 kDa). Additionally, in the negatively charged gelatin groups, only a slight increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was observed with increasing MW of gelatin from 3 to 100 kDa. It is concluded that the gamma- sterilized hydrogel disks made from raw gelatins (IEP = 5.0, MW = 100 kDa) with appropriate dissolution degree and acceptable cytocompatibility are capable of providing stable mechanical support, making these carriers promising candidates for intraocular delivery of cultivated HCEC sheets. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33745749591	Microwave dielectric properties of Ba2Ti9O 20 materials prepared by reaction sintering process	Ba 2 Ti 9 O 20 materials were prepared by reacting nano-sized BaTiO 3 powders (50 nm) with TiO 2 powders (100 nm). The materials prepared by calcination and sintering 2-step processes possess high sintered density (> 96.5% T.D.) and exhibit marvelous microwave dielectric properties (K = 39.5, Q × F = 33,000), which are markedly superior to the materials prepared via the reaction of BaCO 3 and TiO 2 powders. Direct reactive-sintering of nano-BaTiO 3 and TiO 2 mixture directly leads to even better microwave dielectric properties, which is ascribed to the more completeness in converting the BaTiO 3 particulates into Ba 2 Ti 9 O 20 Hollandite-like phase.

Kinetics for crystallization process is markedly enhanced when the O 2 atmosphere was used to replace for air atmosphere in the calcinations and sintering processes. When O 2 -processed, high density Ba 2 Ti 9 O 20 materials (> 94%T.D.), possessing good microwave properties (K = 38.7 and Q × F = 30,502), can be obtained by sintering the sample at 1200°C, 4 h, which is markedly lower than the sintering temperature need when processed in air (1250°C 4 h).

33748135082	Targeted delivery system for juxtacrine signaling growth factor based on rhBMP-2-mediated carrier-protein conjugation	We propose a model of artificial juxtacrine signaling for the controlled release of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) suitable for guided bone regeneration. A porous three-dimensional scaffold of poly-(lactide-co-glycolide) was fabricated by means of gel molding and particulate leaching. Collagen immobilization onto the scaffold surface was produced by performing photo-induced graft polymerization of acrylic acid, and rhBMP-2 was tethered to the collagenous surface by covalent conjugation. On pharmacokinetic analysis, in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent and alkaline phosphatase assays revealed sustained, slow release of rhBMP-2 over 28 days, with a cumulative release of one third of the initial load diffusing out of the scaffold. Conjugation of rhBMP-2 inhibited the free lateral diffusion and internalization of the activated complex of rhBMP-2 and the bone morphogenetic protein receptor. Osteoprogenitor cells were used as bone precursors to determine the expression of biosignaling growth factor in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. To identify the phenotype of cells seeded on the rhBMP-2-conjugated scaffold, cellular activity was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy and with viability, histological, and immunohistochemical testing. The rhBMP-2-conjugated scaffold prolonged stimulation of intracellular signal proteins in cells. Enhancement of cell growth and differentiation was considered a consequence of juxtacrine signaling transduction. Animal studies of rhBMP-2-containing filling implants showed evidence of resorption and de novo bone formation. The present study revealed the potential of biomimetic constructs with co-immobilized adhesion and growth factors to induce osteoinduction and osteogenesis. Such constructs may be useful as synthetic bone-graft materials in orthopaedic tissue engineering. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33747174877	Molecular and collective relaxations of ferroelectric side chain liquid crystalline polysiloxanes	The influences of mesogenic group chemical structures on dielectric relaxation behavior were investigated for ferroelectric side chain liquid crystalline polymers (FLCPs). The relaxation time and activation energies of the Goldstone mode, α-, and β-relaxations decrease with increasing spacer length because of the plasticizer effect of the spacer. Moreover, the relaxation intensity increases with increasing spacer length for FLCPs. An FLCP with a longer spacer length exhibits a higher mesogenic group mobility, and subsequently leads to easier reorientation toward the alternating electrical field. An increase in mesogenic core rigidity results in an increase in the relaxation time and activation energies, and a decrease in the relaxation intensities for the Goldstone mode, α-, and β-relaxations. Moreover, the β-relaxation is suppressed and cannot be observed in the glassy state for FLCPs containing naphthyl biphenylcarboxylate as the mesogenic group. Shorter relaxation time, smaller activation energies, and higher intensity of the α-, and β-relaxations were obtained for FLCPs containing chiral moiety with a flexible heptyl alkyl chain. However, the relaxation intensity of the Goldstone mode for FLCPs containing this chiral moiety was smaller than that for FLCPs containing the chiral moiety with a butyl alkyl chain. For FLCPs containing a chiral moiety with two asymmetrical centers, their Goldstone mode relaxation showed larger amplitude. The α- and β-relaxations are suppressed for these FLCPs because of the dense packing and memory effect of the smectic phase. The relationship between the chemical structure of the mesogenic group and dielectric relaxations is discussed in great detail. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33750166746	Transplantation of coherent retinal sheet embedded in biodegradable materials	Purpose. To develop a reliable and reproducible technique to transplant coherent retinal sheet laminarly. Methods. We have been able to transplant neuroretina up to 1 mm wide without any supportive material, and observed laminar grafts growing on host RPE with correct polarity. However, if we want to transplant neuroretina and RPE coherently, biodegradable embedding material is quite helpful. Gelatin/Collagen mixture or poly-D,L-Lactic Acid are used as the embedding materials in this study. We remove RPE and neuroretina altogether from new born pigmented rabbits, and immerse the coherent sheets into the embedding materials, which are dissolved in L-15 medium. Then the immersed sheets are transferred to 4′C refrigerator for 5 minutes to be hardened. The retinal sheets therefore can be sliced off from the embedding material and transplanted into subretinal space of albino rabbits with a carrier through pars plana vitrectomy. Currently, 1:1 mixture of 5% Gelatin and 1% Collagen, and 2%-5% p-D, L-LA are investigated. The receipient rabbits are sacrificed three days, one week, two weeks, and four weeks after transplantation. Specimens are prepared for light and electron microscopy. Results. The 2x2 mm coherent retinal sheets can be transplanted successfully and survive well. The biodegradable materials we used disappear thoroughly in the first week after transplantation. No significant inflammation is disclosed. Conclusions. Neuroretina and RPE can be transplanted coherently using biodegradable materials as embedding agents. Manipulation of retina becomes easier if the materials are thicker, while degradation period longer. We find this approach to be a reporducible method in constructing laminar growth of transplanted retina.

33749583789	Bioengineered human corneal endothelium for transplantation	Objective: To investigate whether the bioengineered human corneal endothelial cell (HCEC) monolayers harvested from thermoresponsive culture supports could be used as biological tissue equivalents. Methods: Untransformed adult HCECs derived from eye bank corneas were cultivated on a thermoresponsive poly-N-isopropylacrylamide-grafted surface for 3 weeks at 37°C. Confluent cell cultures with a phenotype and cell density similar to HCECs in vivo were detached as a laminated sheet by lowering the culture temperature to 20°C. In vitro characteristics of theHCECsheets were determined evaluating their viability and by scanning electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and histological studies. Results: After separation from culture surfaces via a thermal stimulus, the HCEC sheets remained viable. Polygonal cell morphology and multiple cellular interconnections were observed throughout the HCEC sheets. Immunolocalization of zonula occludens-1 and Na

33751324635	Mixed micelles formed from graft and diblock copolymers for application in intracellular drug delivery	A novel mixed micelle that comprised of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid)-graft-poly(d,l-lactide) (P(NIPAAm-co-MAAc)-g-PLA) with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) (mPEG-b-PLA) was developed for application in cancer therapy. The mixed micelle had an multi-functional inner core of P(NIPAAm-co-MAAc)-g-PLA to enable intracellular drug delivery and an extended hydrophilic outer shell of mPEG to hide the inner core. Stability analysis of the mixed micelles in bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution indicates that the diblock copolymer mPEG efficiently protected the BSA adsorption on the mixed micelles because the hydrophobic groups of graft copolymer were efficiently screened by mPEG. From the drug release study, the mPEG-PLA diblock copolymer in mixed micelles slightly affected the functionalities of the P(NIPAAm-co-MAAc)-g-PLA graft copolymer; the graft copolymer still exhibited pH- and thermo-sensitivities in this core-shell structure. A change in pH deformed the structure of the inner core from that of aggregated P(NIPAAm-co-MAAc), causing the release of a significant quantity of doxorubicin (Dox) from mixed micelles. Clear differences between free Dox and Dox-mixed micelles were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This study presents not only a new micelle structure for a graft-diblock copolymer system, but also a method for overcoming some of the limitations on biomaterials used in intravenous injection. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33845872588	Self-assembly of a micelle structure from graft and diblock copolymers: An example of overcoming the limitations of polyions in drug delivery	A novel mixed micelle with a multifunctional core and shell is successfully prepared from a graft copolymer, poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-methacrylic acid)-g-poly(D,L-lactide) (P(NIPAAm-co-MAAc)-g-PLA) and two diblock copolymers, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(D,L-lactide) and poly (2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-b- poly(D,L-lactide). This nanostructure completely screens the highly negative charges of the graft copolymer and exhibits multifunctionality because it has a specialized core/shell structure. An example of this micelle structure used in intracellular drug delivery demonstrates a strong relationship between drug release and the functionality of the mixed micelle. Additionally, the efficiency of the screening feature is also displayed in the cytotoxicities; mixed micelles exhibit higher drug activity and lower material cytotoxicity than micelles from P(NIPAAm-co-MAAc)-g-PLA ([NIPAAm]/[MAAc]/[PLA] = 84:5.9:2.5 mol/mol) copolymer. This study not only presents a new micelle structure generated using a graft-diblock copolymer system, but also elucidates concepts upon which the preparation of a multifunctional micelle from a graft copolymer with a single (or many) diblock copolymer(s) can be based for applications in drug delivery. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

34147188605	Encapsula of periosteal stem cells in injectable photopolymerized hydrogel enhances tendon graft osteointegration	Photopolymerized hydrogel based on poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) was applied to periosteum-derived periosteal stem cell (PSC) encapsulation and orthopedic tissue engineering. To provide support for cell adhesion, hyaluronic acid (HA) was incorporated into the PEGDA solution prior to photopolymerization. HA can be utilized to mimic the extracellular matrix composition as well as control cell growth and differentiation. In vitro studies have demonstrated its ability to encapsulate PSCs to form bone-like tissue in a photopolymerized hydrogel. Osteointegration of a tendon graft within the bone tunnel is a primary concern when employing tendon grafts for ligament reconstruction. This study presents a novel technique for fabricating injectable hydrogel-photoencapsulated PSCs in a bone tunnel to enhance tendon-bone healing. A total of 21 adult New Zealand white rabbits were used. The long extensor digitorum tendon was transplanted into a bone tunnel of the proximal tibia. The tendon was pulled through a drill hole in the proximal tibia and attached to the medial aspect of the tibia. Hydrogel suspension containing PSCs at a concentration of 20 million/mL was injected into the bone tunnel. Histological examination of the tendon-bone interface and biomechanical testing for maximal pull-out load were evaluated at postoperative weeks 3 and 6. Histological analysis of the tendon-bone interface showed an interface fibrous layer formed by the photoencapsulation of PSCs between the tendon and the bone. This layer became progressive integrated with the tendon-bone surface during the healing process. Biomechanical testing revealed higher maximal pull-out strength in experimental groups with a statistically significant difference at 3 and 6 weeks. These results suggest that photopolymerizable PEGDA and HA hydrogels are promising for tissue-engineered stem cell therapy to enhance tendon-bone healing. © 2006 World Scientific Publishing Company.

34547396996	Molecular structure of side-chain liquid crystalline polysiloxane in the smectic C phase from X-ray diffraction and molecular modeling	The structure of a side-chain liquid crystalline polysiloxane containing two oligo(oxyethylene) units and (R)-1-methylheptyl 4-(4-hydroxybiphenyl-4′-carbonyloxy) benzoate mesogens (PS221B) has been studied using X-ray diffraction patterns and molecular modeling. Ten periodic simulated cells with equilibrated structures are generated, each containing 35 mesogenic groups and a polysiloxane backbone. The simulated X-ray diffraction patterns are in agreement with those obtained experimentally. The calculated width of the sublayers of the polysiloxane backbone is about 5.63 Å along the z-axis. The distributions of the dihedral angles of the polysiloxane backbone in the equilibrated structures indicate that the backbone has a higher probability distribution in the trans state. The distributions of the dihedral angles at the bonds in the aromatic core of the mesogenic groups reveal high probabilities of the trans and cis placements. The local order due to the interactions between the aromatic cores is in the range of 3-5 Å. The order of the radial distribution function vanishes beyond this range. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

34547891937	Novel π-electron extension system via chromophores self-polymerization to enhance the NLO efficiency	A new strategy for the self-polymerization of chromophores is investigated to develop a 2,7-carbazole-based nonlinear optical (NLO) conjugated polymer with an increasing conjugation length of chromophores. Elongation of the conjugation-path length in chromophores has established engineering guidelines to enhance optical nonlinearity. Compared with the traditional synthesis of an NLO polymer, the chromophores should be well-designed at a limited conjugation spacer, and then incorporated into a polymer matrix. In this research, the π-conjugation spacer of chromophores extended perpendicularly to the dipole of chromophores during the polymerization process. Furthermore, this study marks the first research of integrating the π-electrons of chromophores and conjugated polymers. These conjugated backbones promote a bulk-polarization response, leading to large NLO coefficients. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

35248856019	Functional biomedical polymers for corneal regenerative medicine	Recent progress in biomedical polymer science has greatly contributed to rapid development of corneal regenerative medicine. In the past decades, scientists have achieved several major breakthroughs in corneal tissue reconstruction. Studies regarding the findings of core-and-skirt keratoprostheses for visual rehabilitation, biosynthetic tissue replacements for corneal transplantation, and thermo-responsive cell-detachable substrates for corneal cell sheet engineering have been reported by several groups of investigators. This brief overview focuses on the contributions of functional polymers in the applications of corneal regenerative medicine. The keratoprosthetic devices developed by our group using heterobifunctional silicone rubber membranes grafted with different bioactive functional groups showed promising results in animal studies. In addition, the fabrication and transplantation of bioengineered human corneal endothelial cell sheets by utilizing the functional biomedical polymers such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and gelatin are discussed, especially for the significance of gelatin in the development of a potential intraocular delivery system for cell sheet grafts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Anticancer drug, free base doxorubicin (Dox) was incorporated into the inner core of multifunctional micelles by dialysis. From the drug release study, a change in pH (from pH7.4 to 5.0) deformed the structure of the inner core from that of aggregated P(NIPAAm-co-MAAc), causing the release of a significant quantity of doxorubicin (Dox) from multifunctional micelles. Multifunctional micelles target specific tumors by an asialoglycoprotein (HepG2 cells)-Gal (multifunctional micelle) receptor-mediated tumor targeting mechanism. This mechanism then causes intracellular pH changes which induce Dox release from multifunctional micelles and that micelles have strong effects on the viability of HepG2 cells and are abolished by galactose. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) reveals a clear distribution of multifunctional micelles. With careful design and sophisticated manipulation, polymeric micelles can be widely used in cancer diagnosis, cancer targeting, and cancer therapy simultaneously. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Development of alternative biomaterials to bovine-based gelatin vehicles can potentially eliminate the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In the present work, to investigate whether it was appropriate for use as cell sheet delivery vehicles, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels were studied by determinations of morphological characteristic, mechanical and thermal property, water content, in vitro degradability and cytocompatibility. Glutaraldehyde (GTA) cross-linked HA samples were used for comparison. It was found that HA discs after cross-linking significantly increased its tensile stress but reduced its tensile strain, water uptake and enzymatic degradability. The results of differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that cross-linking could lead to the alteration of polymer structure. In addition, the EDC-cross-linked HA discs had a smoother surface structure, a faster degradation rate and a relatively lower cytotoxicity as compared to the GTA cross-linked counterparts. It is concluded that EDC can be successfully applied for HA cross-linking to fabricate structurally stable, mechanically reinforced, readily deformable, transparent and cytocompatible HA hydrogel discs with the potential to be applied as delivery vehicles for corneal endothelial cell therapy. © 2008 VSP.

0032683529	Synthesis, characterization, thermal and flame-retardant properties of silicon-based epoxy resins	A new silicon-containing oxirane triglycidyl phenyl silane oxide (TGPSO) and its corresponding silicon-containing epoxy resins are synthesized and characterized. The activation energies of TGPSO curing reaction with various curing agents, including 4,4-diaminodiphenylmethane, 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulfone, and dicyanodiaminde, are found to be 180, 196.5, and 154 kJ/mol. The curing reaction of TGPSO with diamines is determined to be a first-order reaction through means of Arrhenius plots. The introduction of the silicon-containing group results in higher curing reactivity. This silicon-containing resin possesses higher char yield as well as higher limiting oxygen index (LOI = 35) than the commercial epoxy resins, confirming the usefulness of these silicon-containing epoxy resins as flame retardants. Char yields and LOI measurements demonstrate that incorporating silicon into epoxy resins is able to improve their flame retardancy.

0032903666	Synthesis and characterization of pH-sensitive dextran hydrogels as a potential colon-specific drug delivery system	pH-Sensitive dextran hydrogels were prepared by activation of dextran (T-70) with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, followed by conjugation of the activated dextran with 4-aminobutyric acid and cross-linking with 1,10-diaminodecane. The cross-linking efficiencies determined by mechanical measurements were in the range of 52-63%. Incorporation of carboxylpropyl groups in dextran hydrogels led to a higher equilibrium and faster swelling under high pH conditions. The swelling reversibility of hydrogels was also observed after repeated changes in buffers between pH 2.0 and 7.4. The slow rates of swelling and deswelling in response to changes in pH were attributed to the hydrophilic nature of dextran and formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of dextran with water molecules. The pronounced effect of carboxylic acid content on degradation of hydrogels was observed after 1 h of incubation with dextranase and the influence significantly decreased after exposure to the enzyme for 8 h. The mechanism of bulk degradation of hydrogels under high swelling extent was substantiated using Coomassie blue protein assay. The release rate of bovine serum albumin from hydrogels was primarily determined by the swelling extent. The release rate was further enhanced by addition of dextranase in buffer solutions.

0034232823	Synthesis of Dextran-(5-FU)-Galactosamine conjugate through a tripeptide spacer group and its in vitro properties	In this study, conjugation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and galactosamine with dextran via Glycyl-L-Leucyl-Glycine (Gly-Leu-Gly) tripeptidyl spacer was performed first by activation of dextran with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, followed by aminolysis of Glycyl-L-Leucyl-Glycyl-5flurouracil (Gly-Leu-Gly-5-FU) and galactosamine with activated dextrans. Preparation of Gly-Leu-Gly-5-FU was carried out by sequential reactions of peptide synthesis in solution phases and coupling with 5-FU in the presence of diethylphosphoric cyanide. The release of 5-FU from the conjugates upon the exposure of polymeric prodrugs to papain implied that the attachment of 5-FU with the tripeptidyl spacer, Gly-Leu-Gly, was capable of being liberated by cathepsin B in lysosomes of targeted cells. The observation that the cytoxicity in vitro from the incubation of dextran-5-FU conjugate containing galactosamine residues with Hep-3B cells is higher than that in the void of galactosamine indicated the occurrence of specific binding of the targeting moieties with its receptors on cell membrane, leading to an enhanced cellular uptake of the conjugate via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

39149117700	Photoencapsulation of bone morphogenetic protein-2 and periosteal progenitor cells improve tendon graft healing in a bone tunnel	Background: Tissue-engineered solutions for promoting the tendon graft incorporation within the bone tunnel appear to be promising. Hypothesis: To determine the feasibility that conjugation of hyaluronic acid-tethered bone morphogenetic protein-2 can be used to stimulate periosteal progenitor cells direct fibrocartilagenous attachment and new bone formation in an extra-articular tendon-bone healing model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 42 mature New Zealand White rabbits were used. The long digitorum extensor tendon was transplanted into a bone tunnel of the proximal tibia. The tendon was pulled through a drill hole in the proximal tibia and attached to the medial aspect of the tibia. Photopolymerizable hydrogel based on poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate with hyaluronic acid-tethered bone morphogenetic protein-2 was injected and photogelated in a bone tunnel. Histological and biomechanical examination of the tendon-bone interface was evaluated at postoperative weeks 3 and 6. Results: Histological analysis showed an interface fibrocartilage and new bone formed by photoencapsulation of bone morphogenetic protein-2 and periosteal progenitor cells at 6 weeks. Biomechanical testing revealed higher maximum pullout strength and stiffness in experimental groups with a statistically significant difference at 3 and 6 weeks after tendon transplantation. Conclusion: The healing tendon-bone interface undergoes a gradual remodeling process; it appears that photoencapsulation of bone morphogenetic protein-2 and periosteal progenitor cells possesses a powerful inductive ability between the tendon and the bone to incorporate the healing in a rabbit model. Clinical Relevance: Novel technologies, such as those described in this study, including photopolymerization and tissue engineering, may provide minimally invasive therapeutic procedures via arthroscopy to enhance biological healing after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. © 2008 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.

38449086497	Tissue-engineered human corneal endothelial cell sheet transplantation in a rabbit model using functional biomaterials	BACKGROUND. This study was performed to investigate whether transplantation of bioengineered human corneal endothelial cell (HCEC) sheet grafts into corneas denuded of endothelium could restore corneal function and clarity in a rabbit model. METHODS. After being labeled with PKH26 fluorescent dye, the adult HCECs derived from eye bank corneas were cultivated on the thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm)-grafted surfaces for 3 weeks at 37°C, and were harvested as transplantable cell sheets after incubation for 45 min at 20°C. Attached by gelatin hydrogel discs, the bioengineered cell monolayers were transplanted to rabbit corneas denuded of endothelium (HCEC sheet group). Traumatized rabbit corneas were served as controls. Postsurgical corneas underwent clinical observations and histological examinations for 6 months. RESULTS. By transmission electron microscopy and Western blot analysis of zonula occludens-1 and Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase proteins, the structure and function of HCEC sheets resembled those of native corneal endothelium. After endothelial cells were removed, corneas of each group turned severe edematous and opaque. In the HCEC sheet groups, corneal clarity was gradually restored and corneal thickness was significantly less than that in the control groups (P<0.05). The attached PKH26-positive HCECs spread on rabbit Descemet's membrane after receiving cell sheet grafts. Intraocular delivery of HCEC sheets by means of a minimally invasive technique (i.e., small-incision surgery using biodegradable hydrogels) demonstrated long-term graft integration with damaged corneas. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that using cultured HCECs and functional biomaterials, PNIPAAm and gelatin, an effective cell sheet-based therapy can be developed for the treatment of corneal endothelium deficiency. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34249894420	Heterobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol)-tethered bone morphogenetic protein-2-stimulated bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation and osteogenesis	We describe a biomimetic mode of insoluble signaling stimulation to provide target delivery of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), with the aim of prolonging the retention of BMP-2 use in bone tissue engineering and to enable its localized release in response to cellular activity. In our novel localization process, we used heterobifunctional acrylate-N-hydroxysuccinimide poly(ethylcne glycol) (PEG) as a spacer to tether BMP-2 onto a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) scaffold. Use of PEG-tethered BMP-2 was feasible because BMP-2 retained its activity after covalent conjugation. The PEG-tethered BMP-2 conjugate sustained stimulation and retained its mitogenic activity, notably affecting pluripotent stem cell proliferation and differentiation. We seeded the scaffolds with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells as progenitor cells to evaluate their morphology and phenotypic expression. We also created bilateral, full-thickness cranial defects in rabbits to investigate the osteogenic effect of cultured mesenchymal stromal cells on bone regeneration in vivo. Histomorphometry and histology demonstrated that the PEG-tethered BMP-2 conjugate enhanced de novo bone formation after surgery. Our work revealed the potential for biomimetic surface engineering by entrapping signaling growth factor to stimulate osteogenesis. Our technique may provide a new platform for bone-engineered stem cell therapies. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

The critical dimensional uniformity of wet-etched thick insulator holes was enhanced by changing the wet etching mechanism from vertical dipetching to horizontal spray-etching. The profile of the insulator holes fabricated using the new etcher was similar to anisotropic. After optimizing the operation conditions of the new etcher, the dimensional uniformity of the insulator holes increased to 97.7%. The optimal concentration of etchant was 2.2 wt% for achieving the least side etching of the insulator holes. The carbon nanotube paste was pattern-printed into the insulator holes. The uniform size of the insulator holes implied that the carbon nanotube distribution was similarly among the insulator holes.

0034301467	Phosphorus-containing epoxy resins for flame retardancy. V: Synergistic effect of phosphorus-silicon on flame retardancy	Epoxy resins containing phosphorus and/or silicon are prepared from phosphorus/silicon-containing epoxides and diamine curing agents. The flame-retardant properties of the phosphorus/silicon-containing epoxy were studied. Furthermore, the phosphorus-silicon synergistic effect on LOI enhancement and increasing flame retardancy of the epoxy materials were demonstrated. While under flame, phosphorus provides the tendency of char formation, and silicon provides the enhancement on thermal stability of the char, to show their individual benefit on flame retardancy. Introducing both phosphorus and silicon together in the epoxy resin composition brings the success of combining these two factors in a flame retardation mechanism. An LOI enhancement from 26 to 36 is observed for epoxy resins containing both phosphorus and silicon. Moreover, the synergistic effect of phosphorus-silicon on fire resistance can be further leveled up by using siloxane reagents to replace silanes. Epoxy resins with a composition of phosphorus epoxides and siloxane diamines exhibit a high LOI value of 41, to demonstrate the high synergistic efficiency of phosphorus and silicon on flame retardation. ©2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0034960766	Chemical modification of dicyclopentadiene-based epoxy resins to improve compatibility and thermal properties	A series of siloxane-containing epoxy resins was obtained by curing dicyclopentadiene-containing epoxy DG with the silicon-containing curing agents TS, DS, and AS. Curing behavior was studied using DSC, and the activation energies of the DG curing reaction with curing agents TA, DS, and AS were found to be 59, 80, and 157 KJ/mol. Meanwhile, the curing reaction of DG with diamines was found to be a first-order reaction using Arrhenius plots. In addition, thermal stability and the weight loss behavior of the cured polymers were studied via TGA. The silicon-containing resins displayed higher weight loss temperatures and higher char yields than the silicon-free resin. The activation energies of degradation ranged from 108 to 206 KJ/mol. The morphology of the cured pieces were investigated using SEM. The DG/TS and DG/DS are more compatible between the epoxy and the curing agents than DG/AS. The limited oxygen index (LOI) values of 31 to 34 for the DG-based resin confirmed the effectiveness of silicon-containing epoxy resins as flame retardants. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0034984764	Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) film as a drug delivery system for pilocarpine	This work investigates pilocarpine trapped in a matrix diffusion-controlled drug delivery system using hydrophilic inserts of Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) to ensure an increased bioavailability of pilocarpine and prolong the length of time in which the medication remains in the eyes of the test subjects. The physical and chemical properties of pilocarpine were investigated to elucidate the mechanism of drug-polymer interaction and the effect on drug release behavior of controlled release polymeric devices. In vitro release studies indicated that pilocarpine continued to be released from the inserts for a 24h period. The results of intraocular pressure tests performed on albino rabbits were consistent with the observed in vitro behavior. The pressure decrease was significant for a period longer than 48h. It confirms that the inserts, as sustainable releasing devices, are promising carriers for ophthalmic drug delivery systems. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

80052552129	In vitro evaluation of hexagonal polymeric micelles in macrophage phagocytosis	This paper develops a non-spherical polymeric micelle using an amphiphilic block copolymer and a porphyrin crystalline structure. The nanoscale polymer micelles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing particle sizes of approximately 150 nm with a particular shape in the hexagonal lattice. The shape shows the selective uptake efficacy for the HeLa and macrophage cells, and inhibits phagocytosis against the macrophage. A hexagonal lattice in nanoscale was constructed by an amphiphilic block copolymer and a porphyrin crystalline structure developed in this study. The shape shows selective uptake efficacy for the HeLa and macrophage cells after 24h incubation. We expect that targeting efficiency of drug could be improved by modified the shaped with hexagonal lattice. Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

44849134764	A methodology based on the "anterior chamber of rabbit eyes" model for noninvasively determining the biocompatibility of biomaterials in an immune privileged site	In this study, a novel methodology based on the anterior chamber of rabbit eyes model was developed to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility of biomaterials in an immune privileged site. The 7-mm-diameter membrane implants made from either a biological tissue material (amniotic membrane, AM group) or a biomedical polymeric material (gelatin, GM group) were inserted in rabbit anterior chamber for 36 months and characterized by biomicroscopic examinations, intraocular pressure measurements, and corneal thickness measurements. The noninvasive ophthalmic parameters were scored to provide a quantitative grading system. In this animal model, both AM and GM implants were visible in an ocular immune privileged site during clinical observations. The implants of the AM group appeared as soft tissue patches and have undergone a slow dissolution process resulting in a partial reduction of their size. Additionally, the AM implants did not induce any foreign body reaction or change in ocular tissue response for the studied period. By contrast, in the GM groups, significant corneal edema, elevated intraocular pressure, and increased corneal thickness were noted in the early postoperative phase (within 3 days), but resolved rapidly with in vivo dissolution of the gelatin. The results from the ocular grading system showed that both implants had good long-term biocompatibility in an ocular immune privileged site for up to 3 years. It is concluded that the anterior chamber of rabbit eyes model is an efficient method for noninvasively determining the immune privileged tissue/biomaterial interactions. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

64149100882	Low bloom strength gelatin as a carrier for potential use in retinal sheet encapsulation and transplantation	Retinal transplantation aims to restore vision for patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Because the retinal sheets are fragile in nature, it is difficult to maintain graft integrity during surgical manipulation and after transplantation. In the present work, we report the feasibility of applying sandwichlike gelatin membranes as encapsulating carriers for retinal sheet transplantation applications. The relationship between the Bloom index of gelatin and the functionality of carrier membranes was studied by determinations of mechanical property, dissolution degree, melting point, cytocompatibility, biocompatibility, and transplant transfer and encapsulation efficiency. Irrespective of their Bloom strength, the gelatin membranes had a thickness sufficient to provide mechanical support for retinal sheets and would be beneficial to overcome the fragility of transplants during intraocular delivery. It was found that the lower the Bloom value of gelatin, the lower melting point of membranes. This allowed for easy fabrication of a stable sandwich-like encapsulating structure at 37 °C. The gelatins with lower Bloom strengths could possibly be dissolved to an extent required for the establishment of close contact between the retinal grafts and defective tissues. In addition, the carrier membranes made from the gelatins with low Bloom values showed a relatively higher cytocompatibility and biocompatibility as well as a higher transfer and encapsulation efficiency as compared to those with high Bloom values. It is concluded that the effect of Bloom index of gelatin plays a significant role in the membrane functionality and the gelatins with low Bloom values have substantial potential to be further developed as effective encapsulating carriers for the intraocular delivery of retinal sheets. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

Experimental results showed that this type of mixed micellar systems possessed complementary effects in adjusting external temperature shift (storage vs. body temperature) and concentration change (dilution after intravenous injection). Therefore, they provided excellent stability as drug carriers. Further results obtained from physicochemical property and drug release kinetics studies demonstrated such systems could also be applied to physiological conditions, in compliance with varied pH environments. We concluded that the newly developed mixed micelles can serve as a potential injectable drug delivery system for anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin and many others. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Polyion complex (PIC) micelles with clear core-shell structures were identified by TEM, which revealed that the PAsp segment became hydrophobic after it interacted with AmB. PEOz-b-PAsp increased not only the solubility of AmB but also simultaneously the drug potency. The prolonged release of AmB from micelles effectively inhibited the growth of Candida albicans even after three days of administration. Moreover, the in vitro cytotoxicity of AmB-loaded micelles was less than that of Fungizone

Chemical structures were analysed by NMR. Liquid crystal phases were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, optical polarizing microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry. The behaviour of the liquid crystalline phases was investigated as a function of spacer units and differing terminal asymmetric moieties. It was found that phase transition temperatures decreased with increasing length of the oligooxyethylene spacer unit. Differing terminal asymmetric moieties led to differing mesophase phenomena. Furthermore, a wide temperature range (including room temperature) of a chiral smectic C phase was achieved.

The mixed micelles had well defined core shell structure which was evaluated by TEM. The functional inner core of poly(HEMA-co-histidine)-g-PLA exhibited pH stimulate to enable intracellular drug delivery and outer shell of PEG-b-PLA with functional moiety Cy5.5 for biodistribution diagnosis and folate for cancer specific targeting were synthesized at the end of the polymer chain. The graft and diblock copolymer self assembled to nanospheres against water with an average diameter below 120 nm without doxorubicin, and an average diameter of around 200 nm when loaded with drug. From drug released study, a change in pH destroy the inner core to lead a significant doxorubicin(Dox) release from mixed micelles. Cellular uptake of folate-micelles was found to be higher than that of non-folate-micelles due to the folate-binding effect on the cell membrane, thereby providing a similar cytotoxic effect to drug only against the HeLa cell line. In vivo study revealed that specific targeting of folate-micelles exhibited cancer targeting and efficiency expression on tumor growth, indicating that multifunctional micelles prepared from poly(HEA-co-histidine)-g-PLA and folate-PEG-PLA have great potential in cancer chemotherapy and diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77749258340	Ocular biocompatibility of carbodiimide cross-linked hyaluronic acid hydrogels for cell sheet delivery carriers	Due to its innocuous nature, hyaluronic acid (HA) is one of the most commonly used biopolymers for ophthalmic applications. We recently developed a cell sheet delivery system using carbodiimide cross-linked HA carriers. Chemical cross-linking provides an improvement in stability of polymer gels, but probably causes toxic side-effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the ocular biocompatibility of HA hydrogels cross-linked by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). HA discs without cross-linking and glutaraldehyde (GTA) cross-linked HA samples were used for comparison. The disc implants were inserted in the anterior chamber of rabbit eyes for 24 weeks and characterized by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, histology and scanning electron microscopy. The ophthalmic parameters obtained from biomicroscopic examinations were also scored to provide a quantitative grading system. Results of this study showed that the HA discs cross-linked with EDC had better ocular biocompatibility than those with GTA. The continued residence of GTA cross-linked HA implants in the intraocular cavity elicited severe tissue responses and significant foreign body reactions, whereas no adverse inflammatory reaction was observed after contact with non-cross-linked HA or EDC cross-linked HA samples. It is concluded that the cross-linking agent type gives influence on ocular biocompatibility of cell carriers and the EDC-HA hydrogel is an ideal candidate for use as an implantable material in cell sheet delivery applications. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

78651443581	Multifunctional hollow nanoparticles based on graft-diblock copolymers for doxorubicin delivery	This article reports a flexible hollow nanoparticles, self-assembling from poly(N-vinylimidazole-co-N-vinylpyrrolidone)-g-poly(d,l-lactide) graft copolymers and methoxyl/functionalized-PEG-PLA diblock copolymers, as an anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) carrier for cancer targeting, imaging, and cancer therapy. This multifunctional hollow nanoparticle exhibited a specific on-off switch drug release behavior, owning to the pH-sensitive structure of imidazole, to release Dox in acidic surroundings (intracellular endosomes) and to capsulate Dox in neutral surroundings (blood circulation or extracellular matrix). Imaging by SPECT/CT shows that nanoparticle conjugated with folic acids ensures a high intratumoral accumulation due to the folate-binding protein (FBP)-binding effect. In vivo tumor growth inhibition shows that nanoparticles exhibited excellent antitumor activity and a high rate of apoptosis in cancer cells. After 80-day treatment course of nanoparticles, it did not appreciably cause heart, liver and kidney damage by inactive Dox or polymeric materials. The results indicate that the flexible carriers with an on-off switched drug release may be allowed to accurately deliver to targeted tumors for cancer therapy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The clear solution of PNIPAAm was known to undergo phase transition when the temperature was raised from the room temperature to about 32°C. The drug was entrapped in the tangled polymer chains or encapsulated within the crosslinked polymer hydrogel at room temperature, and released progressively after topical application (i.e., at a higher temperature). Linear PNIPAAm and crosslinked PNIAAm nanoparticles containing epinephrine were prepared. The drug release rate and cytotoxicity were investigated in vitro. Ophthalmic formulations based on either linear PNIPAAm or the mixture of linear PNIPAAm and crosslinked PNIPAAm nanoparticles were administered to rabbits and the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect was evaluated. The decreased pressure response of the formulation based on linear PNIPAAm lasted six-fold longer than that of the conventional eye drop. Furthermore, for formulation based on the mixture of linear PNIPAAm and crosslinked nanoparticles, the pressure-lowering effect lasted eight times longer. These results suggest the use of thermosensitive polymer solutions or hydrogels is potential in controlled release antiglaucoma ophthalmic drugs. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035998353	Absorbable sandwich-like membrane for retinal-sheet transplantation	Neural retinal transplantation has great potential for the alleviation of different degenerative and hereditary retinal disorders. However, because of the fragile and soft nature of retina, retinal-sheet transplantation is relatively difficult to achieve. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a technique for lamellar tissue transplantation. Biodegradable gelatin membranes were fabricated into a sandwich and encapsulated retinal grafts for transplantation. Before transplantation, we characterized the in vivo and in vitro properties of such membranes to determine the optimal sterilization procedure, that is, a sterile membrane with suitable degradability and good mechanical properties and without cytotoxicity. Three sterilization methods were conducted, with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), ethylene oxide (EO), and γ-ray irradiation (γ). The results were compared with those of a control (no disinfection). Initial studies revealed that the gelatin membranes sterilized with HPGP or EO exhibited retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cytotoxicity, whereas the membrane sterilized by 16.6-kGy γ ray irradiation had no RPE cytotoxicity and had enhanced mechanical properties. In the in vivo rabbit study, implanted gelatin membranes demonstrated satisfactory biocompatibility without any inflammation. Transplanted retinal sheets survived well and developed laminar structures. Such a method using gelatin membranes for tissue transportation has great potential for future routine retinal-sheet transplantation. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79961003030	Zwitterionic sulfobetaine-grafted poly(VINYLIDENE FLUORIDE) membrane with highly effective blood compatibility via atmospheric plasma-induced surface copolymerization	Development of nonfouling membranes to prevent nonspecific protein adsorption and platelet adhesion is critical for many biomedical applications. It is always a challenge to control the surface graft copolymerization of a highly polar monomer from the highly hydrophobic surface of a fluoropolymer membrane. In this work, the blood compatibility of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes with surface-grafted electrically neutral zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), from atmospheric plasma-induced surface copolymerization, was studied. The effect of surface composition and graft morphology, electrical neutrality, hydrophilicity and hydration capability on blood compatibility of the membranes were determined. Blood compatibility of the zwitterionic PVDF membranes was systematically evaluated by plasma protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, plasma-clotting time, and blood cell hemolysis. It was found that the nonfouling nature and hydration capability of grafted PSBMA polymers can be effectively controlled by regulating the grafting coverage and charge balance of the PSBMA layer on the PVDF membrane surface. Even a slight charge bias in the grafted zwitterionic PSBMA layer can induce electrostatic interactions between proteins and the membrane surfaces, leading to surface protein adsorption, platelet activation, plasma clotting and blood cell hemolysis. Thus, the optimized PSBMA surface graft layer in overall charge neutrality has a high hydration capability and the best antifouling, anticoagulant, and antihemolytic activities when comes into contact with human blood. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

83555176255	Stimulated release of photosensitizers from graft and diblock micelles for photodynamic therapy	To understand the effect of photosensitizer (PS) release from graft copolymer based micelles in photodynamic therapy (PDT), the two pH-sensitive and non-pH-sensitive graft copolymers, (poly(N-vinyly caprolactam)-g-poly(d,. l-lactide) and poly(N-vinyly caprolactam-co-N-vinyl imidazole)-g-poly(d,. l-lactide)), were synthesized and utilized for the encapsulation of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) for in vitro and in vivo PDT studies. Photochemical internalization (PCI) was utilized to study the localization of pH- and non-pH-sensitive micelles uptake in the lysosome. After non-toxic light treatment, PPIX was found in the nucleus with pH-sensitive micelles, while PPIX was still localized in the lysosomal organism with the non-pH-sensitive micelles, as observed by confocal microscopy. Because the formation of singlet oxygen was observed for the block and graft micelles, dramatic differences in the cell viability could be ascribed to the damage occurring at the region where the PPIX was located. An in vivo study revealed that PPIX-loaded graft and diblock micelles presented prolonged blood circulation and enhanced tumor targeting ability. The PPIX released from g-CIM micelles on tumor site was further proved by ex vivo confocal image. In addition, non-pH-sensitive micelle-treated mice showed a better repression of tumor growth than PPIX-treated mice, which was likely due to the larger amount of PS localized in the tumor region still exhibiting therapeutic effects. Finally, effective PDT-induced inhibition of tumor growth was found in pH-sensitive micelle-treated mice. This work provides insight into PS-loaded graft and diblock micelles for the PDT of tumors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Two new feasible media, periosteum progenitor cell sheet (PPCS) and acellular collagen sheet (ACS), were utilized to promote tendon-bone healing. This study aimed to compare the effects of these two media on tendon-bone healing in a rabbit model. Methods: Periosteum progenitor cells were harvested from rabbit tibial periosteum, cultivated on polymerized fibrin-coated dishes, and obtained as PPCS. ACS was prepared from rabbit small intestinal submucosa. Twenty rabbits were used in this study. Tendon grafts wrapped in cell sheet were pulled into a bone tunnel in a model of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Rabbits were sacrificed at 8 weeks postoperatively for histological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical assay. Results: The monolayer PPCS that had been wrapped around the tendon before surgery was analysed. Histological staining revealed that PPCS gave rise to higher collagen and glycosaminoglycan deposition with fibrocartilage formation than ACS at the tendon-bone junction at 8 weeks. In addition, PPCS produced significantly better mechanical results compared with ACS, including increased maximum load, stiffness, and maximum load per length of bone tunnel. Conclusions: Single-layer PPCS significantly enhanced tendon-bone healing compared with ACS, with fibrocartilage formation at the tendon interface and superior biomechanical strength. © 2012.

Thermosensitive ophthalmic drop was prepared by mixing linear poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-g-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PNIPAAm-g-PHEMA), PNIPAAm-g-PHEMA gel particles and antiglaucoma drug. This produced polymeric eyedrop containing the drug epinephrine was a clear solution at room temperature which became a soft film after contacting the surface of cornea. The drug entrapped within the tangled polymer chains was therefore released progressively after topical application. Evaluation of the drug release responded as a function of crosslinking density and PHEMA macromer contents. The in vivo studies indicated that the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect for a polymeric eyedrop lasted for 26h, which is significantly better than the effect of traditional eyedrop (8h). Hence our investigations successfully prove that the thermosensitive polymeric eyedrop with ability of controlled drug release exhibits a greater potential for glaucoma therapy. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

84870337265	Rapamycin encapsulated in dual-responsive micelles for cancer therapy	Rapamycin has been developed as a potential anticancer drug for treatment in rapamycin-sensitive cancer models, but its poor water solubility greatly hampers the application to cancer therapy. This study investigated the preparation, release profiles, uptake and in vitro/. in vivo study of a dual-responsive micellar formulation of rapamycin. Rapamycin-loaded micelles (rapa-micelles) measured approximately ca. 150 nm with narrow size distribution and high stability in bovine serum albumin solution. It was shown that rapamycin could be loaded efficiently in mixed micelles up to a concentration of 1.8 mg/mL by a hot shock protocol. Rapamycin release kinetic studies demonstrated that this type of micellar system could be applied in physiological conditions under varied pH environments. Confocal and pH-topography imaging revealed a clear distribution of rapa-micelles, and visible intracellular pH changes which induced encapsulated rapamycin to be released and then induced autophagolysosome formation. In vivo tumor growth inhibition showed that rapa-micelles exhibited excellent antitumor activity and a high rate of apoptosis in HCT116 cancer cells.

84876109235	Transplantation of human corneal endothelial cells using functional biomaterials: Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and gelatin	Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of human corneal endothelial cell (HCEC) transplantation by harvesting the HCEC sheet on a thermoresponsive surface, delivering it with a gelatin disc, and testing it in a rabbit model. Methods: Cultivated human adult HCECs labeled with a red fluorescent dye (PKH26) were seeded on a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM)-grafted surface culture dish at 37°C. After reaching confluence, the HCEC monolayer was detached by reducing the incubation temperature to 20°C and immediately delivered by means of a 7-mm gelatin disc to the rabbit's cornea denuded with endothelial cells (HCEC group, n = 8). The morphology, viability, pump, and barrier functions of the harvested HCEC were evaluated. Traumatized rabbit corneas with only the gelatin disc graft (gelatin disc group, n = 4) and without any transplantation (wound group, n = 4) were the sham controls. Surgical corneas of each group underwent histological and clinical evaluations including corneal thickness, intraocular pressure (IOP), and corneal clarity at different time points during a follow-up period of 12 weeks. Results: Cell morphology, viability, densities, Na

84877065542	Directing neural differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells bycarboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes	The use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to promote neural differentiation is well known. However, most studies have focused on the effect of CNT-derived composites or CNT-based nanopattern substrates on differentiation. Whether or not the intrinsic properties of CNTs themselves can affect neural differentiation and the differentiation mechanism have not been fully investigated. We demonstrated that carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can induce and maintain neural differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) without any exogenous differentiating factors, as evidenced by the protein expression. The low cytotoxicity of carboxylated MWCNTs was also shown by a proliferation assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) data revealed that neural-associated genes, including growth and transcription factors, were promoted while bone-associated genes were inhibited when the cells were cultured on carboxylated MWCNTs. These up-regulated neural growth factors can also adsorb onto carboxylated MWCNTs. The data suggest that carboxylated MWCNTs play dual roles: promoting hBMMSC neural differentiation, including up-regulating the neural growth factors; and trapping these neural growth factors to create a suitable environment for long-term neural differentiation. Carboxylated MWCNT substrates may provide a method of post-transplantational spontaneous neural differentiation with low cytotoxicity for neuron injury repair. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84879718965	Study In Vivo Intraocular Biocompatibility of In Situ Gelation Hydrogels: Poly(2-Ethyl Oxazoline)-Block-Poly(ε-Caprolactone)-Block-Poly(2-Ethyl Oxazoline) Copolymer, Matrigel and Pluronic F127	The long term in vivo biocompatibility is an essential feature for the design and development of sustained drug release carriers. In the recent intraocular drug delivery studies, hydrogels were suggested as sustained release carriers. The biocompatibility test for these hydrogels, however, was commonly performed only through in vitro cell culture examination, which is insufficient before the clinical applications. We compared three thermosensitive hydrogels that have been suggested as the carriers for drugs by their gel-solution phase-change properties. A new block terpolymer (PEOz-PCL-PEOz, ECE) and two commercial products (Matrigel® and Pluronic F127) were studied. The results demonstrated that the ocular media remained translucent for ECE and Pluronic F127 in the first 2 weeks, but cataract formation for Matrigel occurred in 2 weeks and for Pluronic F127 in 1 month, while turbid media was observed for both Matrigel and Pluronic F127 in 2 months. The electrophysiology examinations showed significant neuroretinal toxicity of Matrigel and Pluronic F127 but good biocompatibility of ECE. The neuroretinal toxicity of Matrigel and Pluronic F127 and superior biocompatibility of ECE hydrogel suggests ECE as more appropriate biomaterial for use in research and potentially in intraocular application. © 2013 Hwang et al.

84880513205	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels with interpenetrating multiwalled carbon nanotubes for cell sheet engineering	Hydrogels have been developed as artificial extracellular matrixes (ECMs) to mimic native tissue microenvironments for various applications. Unfortunately, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM)-based hydrogels are not suitable for cell culturing and cell sheet preparation. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with their mechanical strength and electrical conductivity, have been considered as additives to increase the applicability of hydrogels to cell encapsulation and advance cardiac electrophysiological functions. A simple method for fabrication of PNIPAAM hydrogels interpenetrated with multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) as substrates for cell sheet preparation is reported. The results demonstrate that PNIPAAM hydrogels with interpenetrating MWCNTs still exhibit thermosensitive behavior. It is also found that epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells can only attach and proliferate on MWCNT-interpenetrated PNIPAAM hydrogels. Furthermore, the PNIPAAM hydrogels with MWCNTs possess higher elastic moduli and hydrophobicities than those without MWCNTs, suggesting these two characteristics are necessary for the cells to attach to the hydrogel surfaces. Moreover, cell sheets can only be harvested from PNIPAAM hydrogels with MWCNTs because of their high ratio of cell attachment. Thus, this simple method provides sufficient mechanical strength to PNIPAAM hydrogels so that anchorage-dependent cells can be cultivated and provides a superior system for preparing cell sheets. © 2013.

84883254061	Bioengineered periosteal progenitor cell sheets to enhance tendon-bone healing in a bone tunnel	Background: Tendon-bone tunnel healing is crucial for long term success in anterior cruciate liga-ment (ACL) reconstruction. The periosteum contains osteochondral progenitor cells that can differenti-ate into osteoblasts and chondroblasts during tendon-bone healing. We developed a scaf-fold-free method using polymerized fibrin-coated dishes to make functional periosteal progenitor cell (PPC) sheets. Bioengineered PPC sheets for enhancing tendon-bone healing were evaluated in an extra-articular bone tunnel model in rabbit. Methods: PPC derived from rabbit tibia periosteum, cultivated on polymerized fi-brin-coated dishes and harvested as PPC sheet. A confocal microscopy assay was used to evaluate the morphology of PPC sheets. PPC sheets as a periosteum to wrap around hamstring tendon grafts were pulled into a 3-mm diameter bone tunnel of tibia, and compared with a tendon graft without PPC sheets treatment. Rabbits were sacrificed at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively for biochemical as-say and histological assay to demonstrate the enhancement of PPC sheets in tendon-bone healing. Results: PPC spread deposit on fibrin on the dish surface with continuous monolayer PPC was ob-served. Histological staining revealed that PPC sheets enhance collagen and glycosaminoglycans deposi-tion with fibrocartilage formation in the tendon-bone junction at 4 weeks. Collagen fiber with fibrocartilage formation at tendon-bone junction was also found at 8 weeks. Matured fibrocartilage and dense collagen fiber were formed at the tendon-bone interface at 8 weeks by Masson trichrome and Safranin-O staining Conclusions: Periosteal progenitor cell monolayer maintains the differentiated capacity and osteochon-dral potential in order to promote fibrocartilage formation in tendon-bone junction. Bioengi-neered PPC sheets can offer a new feasible therapeutic strategy of a novel approach to en-hance tendon-bone junction healing.

84884378832	A releasable cell separation platform using temperature-responsive polymers	This paper to demonstrate temperature-controlled hydrophobic interaction as a method for capturing and releasing cells. Protein-based cell microarray is a powerful tool used in both clinical diagnostics and fundamental researches. However, the cell of interest after screening could not be released from cell microarray chip for further studies. This research presents the idea of combining antibody-antigen interaction and cell sorting system to improve the specificity. The surface was fabricated by grafting thermo-responsive polymer to PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane), and the concept of capture and release cell were proved by polystyrene beads. The platform can be optimized and applied to provide further collection of cells of interest from protein-based cell microarray.

84886729059	The effect of PEG-5K grafting level and particle size on tumor accumulation and cellular uptake	PEG-modified gold nanoparticles (PEG-modified GNs) with diameters of 40 nm and 70 nm were prepared to elucidate the effect of extent of PEG (M.W. 5000) grafting and particle size on tumor accumulation and cellular uptake. Flow cytometry reveals that cellular uptake is strongly related to the size of PEG-modified GNs, rather than the extent of PEG-5K grafting level. Cytotoxicity analysis based on the intracellular release of drugs showed that the 70 nm PEG-modified GNs have the higher cytotoxicity, beccause of their greater cellular uptake. Also, particle size, rather than PEG-5K grafting level affects tumor accumulation. However, PEG-5K grafting level significantly affects the accumulation of particles in the liver and spleen. This finding is important in determining the proper PEG-5K grafting level and particle size for designing nano-medicines. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0041411198	Dielectric and electro-optical properties of a ferroelectric side-chain liquid crystalline polysiloxane containing azobenzene dyes as guest molecules	Guest-host systems of a ferroelectric side-chain liquid crystalline polysiloxane (PS121A) containing azobenzene dyes have been investigated. Disperse orange 3 (DO3) with a strong dipole moment, and a liquid crystal 4′-(5-hexenyloxy)-4-methoxyazobenzene (HMAB) with a relatively weak dipole moment were used as the guest molecules. The intensity and frequency of the Goldstone mode were increased remarkably for the PS121A/DO3. due to the doping of the DO3 (5 wt. %). The guest molecule with a strong dipole moment results in larger fluctuation of the spontaneous polarization vector in each smectic layer under an applied electric field. As a result, large spontaneous polarization and short response time were obtained for this system. On the other hand, the doping effect of HMAB on dielectric and electro-optical properties was not significant for this system compared to that of the PS121A/DO3. The intensity and frequency of Goldstone mode were slightly increased even with a higher doping level (15 wt. %) of HMAB. PS121A/HMAB exhibited a smaller spontaneous polarization and longer response time than PS121A/DO3 sample. The doping of a suitable amount of the azobenzene dye in the LC phase of the FLCP was helpful for the improvement of the electro-optical properties of such guest-host system.

0344825941	New amphiphilic poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)/ poly(L-lactide) triblock copolymers	A new series of cationic, thermo-sensitive, and biodegradable poly(L-lactide)-poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-poly(L-lactide) (PLLA-PEOz-PLLA) triblock copolymers were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization. With increasing molecular weight and crystallinity of hydrophobic PLLA blocks, the critical micellization concentrations (CMC) occurred at lower concentration. The PLLA-PEOz-PLLA aqueous solution was transparent at room temperature. Heating the solution resulted in precipitations, which were caused by the combination of dehydration of water around PEOz and the aggregations of PLLA segments. Acid/base titration profiles indicated that PLLA-PEOz-PLLA were protonated at neutral and acidic conditions. Considerable buffering capacity was found over the entire pH range. The specific PLLA-PEOz-PLLA triblock copolymers with thermal- and pH-sensitive properties can be tailored by varying the compositions and can be applied as controlled release carries for biomedical applications.

84896139121	A thermally triggered in situ hydrogel from poly(acrylic acid-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) for controlled release of anti-glaucoma drugs	The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate thermally responsive copolymers, which contain temperature- and pH-sensitive segments that are either alternating in or grafted onto the main chain, and to exploit their temperature-sensitive properties for ophthalmic drug delivery. Accordingly, two types of thermoresponsive copolymers - a linear poly(acrylic acid-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) random copolymer (PAAc-co-PNIPAAm) and a poly(acrylic acid-g-N-isopropylacrylamide) graft copolymer (PAAc-g-PNIPAAm) - were investigated for their thermosensitive in situ gel formation and potential applications for ophthalmic drug delivery. All the PAAc-g-PNIPAAm graft copolymers, and the linear PAAc-co-PNIPAAm copolymer with low acrylic acid contents, have an LCST of 34 °C; this is close to the surface temperature of the eye and can therefore be utilized for ophthalmic drug delivery. In addition, the PAAc-g-PNIPAAm graft copolymers showed a higher water content than the linear random copolymer; this is due to the high water adsorption ability of PAAc.

84899443763	Multifunctional nanomicellar systems for delivering anticancer drugs	Most anticancer drugs cause severe side effect due to the lack of selectivity for cancer cells. In recent years, new strategies of micellar systems, which design for specifically target anticancer drugs to tumors, are developed at the forefront of polymeric science. To improve efficiency of delivery and cancer specificity, considerable emphasis has been placed on the development of micellar systems with passive and active targeting. In this review article, we summarized various strategies of designing multifunctional micellar systems in the purpose of improving delivery efficiency. Micellar systems compose of a multifunctional copolymer or a mixture of two or more copolymers with different properties is a plausible approach to tuning the resulting properties and satisfied various requirements for anticancer drug delivery. It appears that multifunctional micellar systems hold great potential in cancer therapy. © 2013 Society of Plastics Engineers.

84905695290	Adjustable bioadhesive control of PEGylated hyperbranch brushes on polystyrene microplate interface for the improved sensitivity of human blood typing	A PEGylated 96-well polystyrene (PS) microplate was first introduced for applications in high-throughput screening for selective blood typing to minimize the risks in blood transfusions. Herein, we present a hemocompatible PS 96-well microplate with adjustable PEGylated hyperbranch brush coverage prepared by ozone pretreated activation and thermally induced surface PEGylation. The grafting properties, hydration capacity, and blood compatibility of the PEGylated hyperbrush immobilized PS surfaces in human blood were illustrated by the combined chemical and physical properties of the surface, and the dependence of the specific absorption of human plasma fibrinogen onto the PEGylated surfaces on the grafting density was analyzed by monoclonal antibodies. The surface coverage of PEGylated brushes plays a major role in the bioadhesive properties of modified PS microplates, which in turn control the level of agglutination sensitivity in blood typing. The bioadhesive resistance toward proteins, platelets, and erythrocytes in human whole blood showed a correlation to the controlled hydration properties of the PEGylated hyperbrush-modified surfaces. Therefore, we suggested that the surface coverage of PEGylated hyperbrushes on PS surfaces can increase the sensitivity of cross-matching blood agglutination by up to 16-fold compared to that of the conventional 96-well virgin PS due to the regulated biorecognition of hematocrit and antibodies of the PEGylated hyperbrush-modified surfaces. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

10644295693	Enzymatic degradation of PLLA-PEOz-PLLA triblock copolymers	The enzymatic degradation of poly(L-lactide)-block- poly(2-ethyl-2- oxazoline)-block-poly(L-lactide) triblock copolymer (PLLA-PEOz-PLLA) was investigated using efficient enzyme proteinase K. PLLA-PEOz-PLLA solution-cast film lost a considerable amount of hydrophilic copolymers in the first 2 h, and the degradation after 2 h proceeded predominantly by surface erosion. The two faces of the hydrolyzed film exhibited different morphologies following enzymatic degradation. The lower face showed many spherulites, which are the superstructural morphology of polymer crystals. Porous spheres based on crystalline PLLA were observed on the upper face, because they were more resistant to enzymatic attack. The crystallinity of the films increased monotonously with the hydrolysis time, thus, the absorption of water gradually decreased. The analysis of degradation residues revealed that many colloids of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)-co-polyethylenimine (PEOz-co-PEI) copolymers were dispersed in the buffer solution. The average diameter, 1 μm, of the colloids was reduced to 200 nm by advanced degradation. The proteinase K exhibited remarkable hydrolysis not only at the ester bond but also the amide bond. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was found that by controlling the composition of PLLA and PEOz, triblock copolymers with different chemical and physical properties can be obtained. The enzymatic degradation of square samples cut from the solution cast films was analyzed at 37 °C in a pH = 8.6 Tris buffer which contain proteinase K. The results show that the particles composed of PEOz/poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) copolymers were dispersed in solution.
