21244450743	Construction and characterization of chromosome 1B specific DNA library of wheat	Chromosome 1B was microdissected and collected from chromosome spreads of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Jing 411'), using a glass needle. DNA of the isolated chromosome was amplified in vitro by Sau3A linker adaptor-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR). The second-round PCR products were verified by Southern hybridization using DIG-labeled genomic DNA of wheat. The results initially showed the DNA was from wheat genome. A pair of SSR primers specific to chromosome 1B was used to verify the origin of the PCR products from the isolated chromosome. The results confirmed that the PCR products originated from chromosome 1B. The second round of PCR products from chromosome 1B were cloned into plasmid pUCm-T vectors to create a chromosome-specific library, which included approximately 248 000 recombinant clones. Characterization of 100 randomly selected clones of the library showed that the insert size ranged between 0.5 and 2.0 kb, with an average of 1 kb. Randomly selected 288 clones were characterized with dot blot hybridization, of which 57.2% were medium/high copy clones and 42.8% low/single copy clones. The application of this technique to establish high-density molecular maps for chromosome 1B is discussed.

0032447544	Discrimination between some Chinese and Yugoslav winter wheat cultivars by capillary electrophoresis of gliadins	Gliadin proteins extracted from seventeen China and Yugoslav winter wheat cultivars were separated by capillary electrophoresis (CE). In order to optimise resolution and reproducibility of gliadin separations, different CE conditions, including capillary length, internal diameter, temperature and voltage, were investigated. Excellent resolution and high reproducibility of gliadin CE patterns were obtained by using a 47 cm length, 50 μm i.d. capillary at 15 kV and 30°C in 0.06 M sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0), containing 20% acetonitrile (ACN) and 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Using these conditions, gliadin electrophoregrams of all cultivars studied showed clear qualitative and quantitative differences, including peak numbers, heights and positions. In particular, some closely related cultivars that were not differentiated by acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE, pH 3.1) were readily differentiated by CE. These results demonstrate the great potential of CE as a new technique for crop varietal identification and seed purity testing.

33644784000	Genetic diversity of European spelt wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta L. em. Thell.) revealed by glutenin subunit variations at the Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci	High and low molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS and LMW-GS) compositions of 270 European spelts, 15 Iranian spelts and 25 bread wheat cultivars were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results revealed a total of 22 HMW-GS alleles (4 at Glu-A1, 11 at Glu-B1 and 7 at Glu-D1) and 32 allele combinations among the three Glu-1 loci. Two major genotypes of HMW-GS: 1, 13+16, 2+12 and 1, 6.1+22.1, 2+12 were found to occur in Central European spelt wheat cultivars and landraces at higher frequencies of 35 and 28%, respectively. The Glu-B1 locus displayed the greatest variation and genetic diversity index (H) was 0.69 whereas Glu-A1 and Glu-D1 showed H index values of 0.26 and 0.19, respectively. The dendrogram constructed by HMW and LMW glutenin subunit bands revealed that European spelts form a separated cluster from common wheat suggesting that spelt and common wheat form distinct groups. In addition, all 15 Iranian spelt land variety accessions differed from European spelts and possessed similar HMW-GS alleles to common wheat. Because of a wider polymorphism Central European spelt wheats are an important genetic reserviour for improving common wheat quality. © Springer 2005.

33645227134	Detection of HMW glutenin subunit variations among 205 cultivated emmer accessions (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum)	The high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) encoded by Glu-1 loci among 205 accessions of cultivated emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum Schrank) collected from different regions of Europe and China were separated and characterized by SDS-PAGE in combination with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE × SDS-PAGE) and acidic capillary electrophoresis. High genetic polymorphisms in HMW-GS compositions were found. A total of 40 alleles (6 for Glu-A1 and 34 for Glu-B1) and 62 subunit combinations (genotypes) were detected, some of which were not previously described. At Glu-A1 locus, two novel alleles, designated Glu-A1x coding for the subunit 1A × 1.1 and Glu-A1y coding for the subunit 1A × 2.1′ were found while seven new subunits (1B × 17*, 1B × 6′, 1B × 13′, 1B × 20*, 1By9*, 1By14.1 and 1By8.1) and 20 novel alleles at Glu-B1 locus were detected. In particular, some additional protein components were detected, which probably were 1Ay subunits encoded by Glu-A1 locus. The introduction of both Ax and Ay subunits from tetraploid wheats into hexaploid wheats may increase the genetic variability of gluten genes and consequently improve flour technological properties. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.

34347342756	Characterization and comparative analysis of three low molecular weight glutenin C-subunit genes isolated from Aegilops tauschii	Three low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes from T121, T128 and T132 accessions of Aegilops tauschii (DD, 2n = 2x = 14) were amplified using allelic-specific PCR primers. The amplified products with a size of about 900 bp were cloned and sequenced. Three complete coding sequences of LMW-GS with 918 bp, 921 bp and 918 bp were obtained and named as LMW-T121, LMW-T128, LMW-T132, respectively. Each gene contained a complete open reading frame and had no introns. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that all belonged to LMW-m type subunit with a predicted molecular weight of about 32 kDa, corresponding to the size of LMW C-subunits. All three subunits possessed eight cysteine residues and had greater homology with previously characterized LMW-m subunits from bread wheat and related species than LMW-s or LMW-i sequences. Some amino acid substitutions and insertion/deletion variations among the sequences were detected. The corresponding three C-subunits in seed endosperm encoded by LMW-T121, LMW-T128, LMW-T132, respectively, were identified and confirmed by SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF-MS and direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that LMW-m and LMW-s type subunit genes possessed higher identity and they were obviously separated from LMW-i type subunit genes. The LMW-m type might be the primitive form while the LMW-s and LMW-i types are variant forms.

34548164835	Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight based wheat gliadin protein peaks are useful molecular markers for wheat genetic study	Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) instrumentation has been used to analyze wheat seed gliadins as an alternative to other established methods, including sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), capillary electrophoresis (CE), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), etc. The MALDI-TOF approach has shown to have many advantages such as high resolution, cost effectiveness and high throughput. MALDI-TOF-based gliadin profiles have been used for fast wheat cultivar identification. However, the genetic information represented by individual gliadin peaks has not been utilized. In this study a wheat doubled haploid population with a genetic linkage map of good coverage was used to assay individual gliadin peaks from MALDI-TOF profiles as molecular markers. Eight segregating peaks in the population were scored as polymorphic across the population. The 1 to 1 segregating ratios validated the scoring of the peaks and all peaks were mapped to the expected chromosomes or linkage groups on the available linkage map: 1 peak on chromosome 1A, 1 on 6A, 4 on 6B and 2 on 6D.

36749028345	Cloning and characterization of a novel low molecular weight glutenin subunit gene at the Glu-A3 locus from wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. dicoccoides)	Amplification of the coding region, and upstream and downstream sequences of a low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) gene from wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. dicoccoides, 2n = 4x = 28, AABB) accession TD22 was carried out using designed allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) primers. The complete 1,176 bp sequence of a novel LMW-i type subunit gene at the Glu-A3 locus, named LMW-TD22, is described. Analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed that this gene possessed striking characteristics although its molecular structure was generally similar to those of previously reported i-type LMW-GS genes that were isolated from common wheat and related species. The deduced amino acid sequence of LMW-TD22 gene contained 390 amino acid residues with the predicted molecular weight being 43,009.3 Da, which appeared to be the longest gene among the cloned LMW-i type genes from bread wheat and related species. The distinct feature of LMW-TD22 was two long polyglutamine stretches of 12 and 17 glutamines occurring in the repetitive and C-terminal domains as well as a cysteine residue present in the seventh amino acid residue of the signal peptide. These polyglutamine repeats are believed to improve the structure of gluten polymer and increase the strength of dough formed from the polymer. In addition, the putative 44 k subunit encoded by LMW-TD22 was verified by N-terminal microsequencing, gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis. Certain types of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, may be associated with this LMW-i type subunit. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

0033011408	Capillary zone electrophoresis analysis of gliadin proteins from Chinese and Yugoslav winter wheat cultivars	Gliadin proteins extracted from fifteen Chinese and Yugoslav winter wheat cultivars were fractionated using a new separation technique - Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE). Different CZE conditions were defined to optimize resolution and reproducibility of gliadin separations. Excellent resolution and high reproducibility of gliadin CZE patterns were obtained by using 47 cm length, 50 μm i.d. capillaries at 15 kV and 30°C in sodium borate buffer system with acetonitrile (ACN) and sodium dodecyl sulfate. By using these CZE conditions, gliadin proteins from each cultivar were easily separated into more than 35 components. This resolution is generally superior to that of one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and RP-HPLC. Analysis of reproducibility of gliadin CZE patterns from Chinese cultivar 'Lumai 6' showed that the average relative standard deviation (RSD) for peak migration times and heights was 0.21% and 4.06%, respectively. Gliadin electrophoregrams of all cultivars studied showed clear qualitative and quantitative differences, including presence or absence of some major peak, migration times and heights of peaks. Specifically, some closely related cultivars that were not differentiable by A-PAGE, were readily differentiated by CZE. In addition, winter wheat cultivars from China and Yugoslavia showed greater differences in gliadin compositions revealed by CZE.

39749106624	Polyclonal antibodies to grain gliadins and their application in wheat quality prediction	Gliadins were extracted from three wheat varieties, viz. Nongda 99260037 (good quality), Henan 9023 (media quality) and Nongda 98123 (poor quality), and α-, β-, γ-, ψ-gliadins were purified from Nongda 99260037 using preparative SDS-PAGE. The total gliadins and α-, β-, γ-, ω-gliadins were used as antigens to immunise BALB/C mice, and the corresponding polyclonal antibodies were prepared, designated as Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-C, Anti-Aα, Anti-Aβ, Anti-Aγ and Anti-Aω, respectively. Binding of the polyclonal antibodies with 8 varieties, that varied in quality properties, showed correlations with some wheat quality parameters. Correlation coefficients between antibodies against total gliadins or γ-, and ω-gliadin of Nongda 99260037 and quality parameters were higher than other antibodies. Of seven polyclonal antibodies tested, three (Anti-Aγ, Anti-Aω and Anti-A) displayed significant positive or negative associations between antibody binding and dough development time, strength, valorimenter value and stability time, but no significant correlations were observed with water absorption. These results suggest that polyclonal antibodies could be used for rapid prediction and screening of wheat quality parameters. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.

40949112423	Molecular cloning, heterologous expression, and phylogenetic analysis of a novel y-type HMW glutenin subunit gene from the G genome of Triticum timopheevi	A novel y-type high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunit gene from the G genome of Triticum timopheevi (2n = 4x = 28, AAGG) was isolated and characterized. Genomic DNA from accession CWI17006 was amplified and a 2200 bp fragment was obtained. Sequence analysis revealed a complete open reading frame including N-and C-terminal ends and a central repetitive domain encoding 565 amino acid residues. The molecular weight of the deduced subunit was 77 031, close to that of the x-type glutenin subunits. Its mature protein structure, however, demonstrated that it was a typical y-type HMW subunit. To our knowledge, this is the largest y-type subunit gene among Triticum genomes. The molecular structure and phylogenetic analysis assigned it to the G genome and it is the first characterized y-type HMW glutenin subunit gene from T. timopheevi. Comparative analysis and secondary structure prediction showed that the subunit possessed some unique characters, especially 2 large insertions of 45 (6 hexapeptides and a nonapeptide) and 12 (2 hexapeptides) amino acid residues that mainly contributed to its higher molecular weight and allowed more coils to be formed in its tertiary structure. Additionally, more α-helixes in the repeat domain of the subunit were found when compared with 3 other y-type subunits. We speculate that these structural characteristics improve the formation of gluten polymer. The novel subunit, expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli, moved more slowly in SDS-PAGE than the subunit Bx7, so it was designated Gy7*. As indicated in previous studies, increased size and more numerous coils and α-helixes of the repetitive domain might enhance the functional properties of HMW glutenins. Consequently, the novel Gy7* gene could have greater potential for improving wheat quality. © 2007 NRC Canada.

84867452358	Molecular characterization and dynamic expression patterns of two types of γ-gliadin genes from Aegilops and Triticum species	Gliadins were the major components of wheat storage proteins and determine the extensibility properties of gluten dough. In this work, 19 new full-length γ-gliadin genes were isolated from various Aegilops and Triticum species. Sequence characterization showed that a specific octapeptide and celiac disease (CD)-toxic epitope Gliγ-3 (VQGQGIIQPQQPAQL) were present in the rich glutamine domain and C-terminal non-repetitive domain, respectively. Based on the sequence features of both peptides, a new classification system for γ-gliadin gene family was established, in which γ-gliadins were classified into two types (types I and II) with each consisting of two groups. An uneven distribution of different types and groups of γ-gliadin genes was exhibited among 11 Aegilops and Triticum genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that types I and II genes diverged at about 14 MYA while the divergence of 4 γ-gliadin group genes occurred at around 10 MYA almost simultaneously.

84877123626	Fast separation and characterization of water-soluble proteins in wheat grains by reversed-phase ultra performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC)	Water-soluble proteins account for about 10% of total grain proteins in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and have specific functions in plant growth and development. In this study, a reversed-phase ultra performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method was trialed and the experimental conditions were optimized for rapidly separating and characterizing water-soluble proteins in wheat grains, and a comparative analysis with traditional RP-HPLC was performed. Under optimized separation conditions, fast, high resolution and reproducible RP-UPLC separation for water-soluble proteins could be obtained by gradually increasing eluting gradient from 21% to 47% in 30 min at 0.6 ml/min and 60 °C. Using this method, separation and characterization of water-soluble protein in wheat grains could be completed in less than 20 min for one sample, and the resolution and efficiency were significantly higher than those obtained with RP-HPLC. In addition, RP-UPLC consumed smaller amounts of samples and reagents as well. The optimized RP-UPLC could be used as an effective and alternative method for rapid separation and characterization of water-soluble proteins in wheat cultivar and germplasm evaluation, genetic and biochemical studies on grain proteins, and environmental influence analysis of water-soluble proteins. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84908116652	Molecular cloning, phylogenetic analysis, and expression profiling of endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperone BiP genes from bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)	Background: The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone binding protein (BiP) is an important functional protein, which is involved in protein synthesis, folding assembly, and secretion. In order to study the role of BiP in the process of wheat seed development, we cloned three BiP homologous cDNA sequences in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), completed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), and examined the expression of wheat BiP in wheat tissues, particularly the relationship between BiP expression and the subunit types of HMW-GS using near-isogenic lines (NILs) of HMW-GS silencing, and under abiotic stress. Results: Sequence analysis demonstrated that all BiPs contained three highly conserved domains present in plants, animals, and microorganisms, indicating their evolutionary conservation among different biological species. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that TaBiP (Triticum aestivum BiP) expression was not organ-specific, but was predominantly localized to seed endosperm. Furthermore, immunolocalization confirmed that TaBiP was primarily located within the protein bodies (PBs) in wheat endosperm. Three TaBiP genes exhibited significantly down-regulated expression following high molecular weight-glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) silencing. Drought stress induced significantly up-regulated expression of TaBiPs in wheat roots, leaves, and developing grains. Conclusions: The high conservation of BiP sequences suggests that BiP plays the same role, or has common mechanisms, in the folding and assembly of nascent polypeptides and protein synthesis across species. The expression of TaBiPs in different wheat tissue and under abiotic stress indicated that TaBiP is most abundant in tissues with high secretory activity and with high proportions of cells undergoing division, and that the expression level of BiP is associated with the subunit types of HMW-GS and synthesis. The expression of TaBiPs is developmentally regulated during seed development and early seedling growth, and under various abiotic stresses.

41949085227	Characterization of two 1D-encoded ω-gliadin subunits closely related to dough strength and pan bread-making quality in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)	Gliadin proteins of 113 common or bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars and advanced lines from China and other countries, were analyzed by high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). A major protein peak migrating at 3 min by HPCE and eluting at about 20 min by RP-HPLC was identified in the ω-gliadin region. It was present in cultivars with good pan bread-making quality, whereas most cultivars with poor bread-making quality lacked this protein peak. Quality testing and statistical analysis showed that this ω-gliadin peak was significantly related to dough strength, loaf volume and loaf score. It was separated into two apparent protein components by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). According to their relative mobilities on the gels, the proteins were designated ω-15 and ω-16, and their accurate molecular masses (42590.5 Da for ω-15 and 41684.1 Da for ω-16) were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. The ω-15 and ω-16 gliadins possessed the N-terminal amino acid sequences of ARELNPSNKELQQQQ and KELQSPQQQF, and therefore they belonged to 1D-encoded ω-2 type and ω-1 type gliadins, respectively. Both gliadin subunits were always present together among the 86 cultivars analyzed, suggesting that they were encoded by two closely linked genes at Gli-D1 locus. The accumulative characteristics of gliadins during grain development indicated possible additive quantitative effects of ω-15+16 on dough strength. The ω-15 and ω-16 gliadins could be used as valuable genetic markers for wheat quality improvement. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

43849084353	Molecular cloning and characterization of four novel LMW glutenin subunit genes from Aegilops longissima, Triticum dicoccoides and T. zhukovskyi	This paper reports cloning and characterisation of four novel low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes (designated as TzLMW-m2, TzLMW-m1, TdLMW-m1 and AlLMW-m2) from the genomic DNA of Triticum dicoccoides, T. zhukovskyi and Aegilops longissima. The coding regions of TzLMW-m2, TzLMW-m1, TdLMW-m1 and AlLMW-m2 were 1056 bp, 903 bp, 1056 bp and 1050 bp in length, encoding 350, 300, 350 and 348 amino acid residues, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences showed that the four novel genes were classified as LMW-m types and the comparison results indicated that the four genes had a more similar structure and a higher level of homology with the LMW-m genes than the LMW-s and -i types genes. However, the first cysteine residue's positions of TzLMW-m2, TdLMW-m1 and AlLMW-m2 were different from the others. Moreover, AlLMW-m2, TdLMW-m1 and TzLMW-m2 all possessed a longer repetitive domain, which was considered to be associated with good quality of wheat. The secondary structure prediction revealed that the content of β-strand in AlLMW-m2 and TdLMW-m1 exceeded the positive control, suggesting that AlLMW-m2 and TdLMW-m1 should be considered as candidate genes that may have positive effect on dough quality. In order to investigate the evolutionary relationship of the novel genes with the other LMW-GSs, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The results lead to a speculation that AlLMW-m2, TdLMW-m1 and TzLMW-m2 may be the middle types during the evolution of LMW-m and LMW-s. © Journal compilation © 2008 Hereditas.

Cultivated emmer (Triticum dicoccum, 2n = 4x = 28, AABB) is closely related to bread wheat and possesses extensive allelic variations in high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) composition. These alleles may be an important genetic resource for wheat quality improvement. To isolate and clone HMW-GS genes from cultivated emmer, two pairs of allele-specific (AS) PCR primers were designed to amplify the coding sequence of y-type HMW-GS genes and their upstream sequences, respectively. The results showed that single bands of strong amplification were obtained through AS-PCR of genomic DNA from emmer. After cloning and sequencing the complete sequence of coding and 5′-flanking regions of a y-type subunit gene at Glu-A1 locus was obtained. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences analysis showed that this gene possessed a similar structure as the previously reported Ay gene from common wheat, and is hence designated as Ay1

The rapid separations (<15 min) of HMW-GS with good repeatability (RSD < 2%) were obtained using a fast capillary rising protocol. All 17 HMW-GS analyzed could be well separated and their relative migration orders were ranked. In particular, the good quality subunit pair 5+10 could be differentiated from poor quality subunit pair 2+12. In addition, the other three allelic pairs of 13+16, 17+18, and 7+8 subunits that were considered to have positive effects on dough properties, as well as three pairs of novel subunits 13+22*, 13*+19*, and 6.1+22.1 detected from spelt and club wheat, can also be readily separated and identified.

Sequence structures showed that the 4 LMW-m-type genes, assigned to the M genome of Ae. neglecta, displayed a high homology with those from hexaploid common wheat. The novel chimeric gene, designed as AjkLMW-i, was isolated from both Ae. kotschyi and Ae. juvenalis and shown to be located on the U genome. Phylogentic analysis demonstrated that it had higher identity to the LMW-m-type than the LMW-i-type genes. A total of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected among the 4 LMW-m genes, with 13 of these being nonsynonymous SNPs that resulted in amino acid substitutions in the deduced mature proteins. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that it had higher identity to the LMW-m-type than the LMW-i-type genes. The divergence time estimation showed that the M and D genomes were closely related and diverged at 5.42 million years ago (MYA) while the differentiation between the U and A genomes was 6.82 MYA. We propose that, in addition to homologous recombination, an illegitimate recombination event on the U genome may have occurred 6.38 MYA and resulted in the generation of the chimeric gene AjkLMW-i, which may be an important genetic mechanism for the origin and evolution of LMW-GS Glu-3 alleles as well as other prolamin genes.

56849108576	Rapid separation and characterization of grain water-soluble proteins in bread wheat cultivars ( Triticum aestivum L.) by capillary electrophoresis	Water-soluble (WS) proteins in wheat grain are considered to represent the suite of biologically active enzymes and enzyme inhibitors in the grain. In this study, a rapid capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for WS protein separations was developed using untreated fused-silica columns and an acidic phosphate-glycine buffer system. In order to optimize the resolution and reproducibility of CE separation, different protein extraction methods, organic modifiers in phosphate-glycine buffer and capillary electrophoresis conditions, including capillary length and inner diameter (ID), operating temperature, performance voltages, sample injection times, etc., were investigated. High resolution and reproducibility of WS proteins were achieved using 20% ethanol as the extracting buffer. The optimal condition to separate these proteins was 50 μm ID x 31.5 cm (26.5 cm to the detector) capillary at 11.0 kV and 35°C. The optimum buffer was 0.1 M phosphate-glycine (pH 2.5) containing 20% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.05% hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose. Using this method, the WS proteins were well separated in less than 10 min. A total of 120 Chinese bread wheat cultivars were analyzed. The CE patterns of most bread wheat cultivars showed a higher level of polymorphisms compared with SDS-PAGE patterns. All cultivars analyzed could be readily differentiated based on their WS protein profiles. Results indicate that the WS proteins are useful biochemical markers for wheat genetics and breeding research and CE is expected to become a new and powerful tool for the separation and characterization of grain WS proteins in bread wheat.

61849122758	Characterization of HMW glutenin subunits in bread and tetraploid wheats by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography	The wheat storage proteins, especially the high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS), play important roles in the determination of flour processing and bread-making quality. Compared with the traditional SDS-PAGE method, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was shown to have many advantages for the separation and characterization of HMW-GS because of its high resolving power, repeatability and automation. In this work, HMW-GS from bread and tetraploid wheats were separated and characterized by RP-HPLC. The elution time ranking of different HMW-GS was: 1Ax > 1Bx > 1Dx > 1By > 1Dy. Several subunit pairs associated with good quality properties and those with similar mobilities on SDS-PAGE, such as 1Bx7 and 1Bx7*, 1By8 and 1By8*, 1Dx2 and 1Ax2*, 1Bx6 and 1Bx6.1, were well separated and readily identified through RP-HPLC. However, other subunit pairs, such as 1Dy10 - 1Dy12, 1Dx5 - 1By18 and 1Dx2 - 1By16, could not be adequately separated and identified by RP-HPLC, whereas they displayed different mobilities on SDS-PAGE gels. Because 1Dx5 and 1Dx2 showed different hydrophobicities, RP-HPLC could distinguish 1Dx5 + 1Dy10 and 1Dx2 + 1Dy12. A comparative analysis between RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE showed that a combination of both methods provided more effective identification of HMW-GS in wheat quality improvement and germplasm screening. © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó.

Results of Western blot showed that mAbs 24231 and 24245 prepared against 1BX13 bound only to LMW-GS. The mAb 14588 prepared against 1By16 bound strongly to LMW-GS, but weakly to 1By and some 1Dy type HMW-GS. The mAb 14587 prepared against 1By16 bound only to 1Dx HMW-GS. The results of indirect ELISA and statistical analysis showed that correlations between mAb 24231 and development time and stability were significantly (P <0.05) and highly significantly (P <0.01) negative, respectively, whereas those of mAb 24245 with development time and extensibility were highly significantly (P <0.01) and significantly (P <0.05) negative, respectively. Significantly (P <0.05) and highly significantly (P <0.01) positive correlations were observed between mAb 14588 and stability and development time. Mean differential binding of mAb 14587 with 1DX5

70449523440	Wheat quality related differential expressions of albumins and globulins revealed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE)	Comparative proteomics analysis offers a new approach to identify differential proteins among different wheat genotypes and developmental stages. In this study, the non-prolamin expression profiles during grain development of two common or bread wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.), Jing 411 and Sunstate, with different quality properties were analyzed using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE). Five grain developmental stages during the post-anthesis period were sampled corresponding to the cumulative averages of daily temperatures (°C: 156 °C, 250 °C, 354 °C, 447 °C and 749.5 °C). More than 400 differential protein spots detected at one or more of the developmental stages of the two cultivars were monitored, among which 230 proteins were identified by MS. Of the identified proteins, more than 85% were enzymes possessing different physiological functions. A total of 36 differential proteins were characterized between the two varieties, which are likely to be related to wheat quality attributes. About one quarter of the proteins identified expressed in multiple spots with different pIs and molecular masses, implying certain post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins such as phosphorylations and glycosylations. The results provide new insights into biochemical mechanisms for grain development and quality. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

70749149337	Cloning, expression and functional analysis of HMW glutenin subunit 1By8 gene from Italy pasta wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum)	Cloning and functional analysis of high molecular weight wheat glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) 1By8 from Italy durum cultivar Simeto was carried out in this study. All HMW-GS from Simeto were separated and characterized by appropriate electrophoresis methods, reversed-phased high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The complete gene encoding 1By8 subunit was amplified by allele-specific PCR primers, including an upstream sequence of 857 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2166 bp encoding a mature protein of 720 amino acid residues. The promoter sequence, containing -300 element (cereal glutenin gene control element) and enhancer was highly conserved among HMW-GS genes. Comparison with the sequence of subunit 1By9 from bread wheat demonstrated 99% identity with the main difference being that the 1By8 subunit possesses an additional insertion of 15 amino acid residues (QYPASQQQPA QGQQG) at position 342 and two residue substitutions at position 78 (leucine/proline) and 442 (arginine/glutamine). The molecular weight differences between MALDI-TOF-MS and deduced amino acid sequence of the coding gene revealed the possibility of some kinds of post-translational modifications present in 1By8 subunit. The protein subunit expressed in Escherichia coli showed a very similar mobility to the endogenous 1By8 of Simeto on SDS-PAGE. The function of the isolated protein on wheat processing quality was determined by 10 g Mixgraph analysis. Results demonstrated that addition of y-type HMW glutenin subunits into the base flour had significant positive effects on main mixing parameters and significant difference in effects were observed among different y-type subunits. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77949385165	Characterization and comparative analysis of wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunits by sds-page, rp-hplc, hpce, and maldi-tof-ms	High molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) from 60 germplasms including 30 common wheat cultivars and 30 related species were separated and characterized by a suite of separation methods including sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Comparative analysis demonstrated that each methodology has its own advantages and disadvantages. The main drawback of SDS-PAGE was its overestimation of molecular mass and incorrect identification of HMW-GS due to its low resolution. However, it had the advantages of technical simplicity and low requirements of equipment; thus, it is suitable for large-scale and high-throughput HMW-GS screening for breeding programs, especially when the glutenin composition is clear in the breeding material. MALDI-TOF-MS clearly expressed many technical advantages among the four methods evaluated, including high throughput, high resolution, and accuracy; it was, however, associated with high equipment cost, thus preventing many breeding companies from accessing the technology. RP-HPLC and HPCE were found to be intermediate between SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. Both RP-HPLC and HPCE demonstrated higher resolution and reproducibility over SDS-PAGE but lower detection power than MALDI-TOF-MS. Results demonstrated that MALDI-TOF-MS is suitable for analyzing HMW-GS for routine breeding line screening and for identifying new genotypes. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77955507345	Comparison of low molecular weight glutenin subunits identified by SDS-PAGE, 2-DE, MALDI-TOF-MS and PCR in common wheat	Background: Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) play a crucial role in determining end-use quality of common wheat by influencing the viscoelastic properties of dough. Four different methods - sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE, IEF × SDS-PAGE), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were used to characterize the LMW-GS composition in 103 cultivars from 12 countries.Results: At the Glu-A3 locus, all seven alleles could be reliably identified by 2-DE and PCR. However, the alleles Glu-A3e and Glu-A3d could not be routinely distinguished from Glu-A3f and Glu-A3g, respectively, based on SDS-PAGE, and the allele Glu-A3a could not be differentiated from Glu-A3c by MALDI-TOF-MS. At the Glu-B3 locus, alleles Glu-B3a, Glu-B3b, Glu-B3c, Glu-B3g, Glu-B3h and Glu-B3j could be clearly identified by all four methods, whereas Glu-B3ab, Glu-B3ac, Glu-B3ad could only be identified by the 2-DE method. At the Glu-D3 locus, allelic identification was problematic for the electrophoresis based methods and PCR. MALDI-TOF-MS has the potential to reliably identify the Glu-D3 alleles.Conclusions: PCR is the simplest, most accurate, lowest cost, and therefore recommended method for identification of Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 alleles in breeding programs. A combination of methods was required to identify certain alleles, and would be especially useful when characterizing new alleles. A standard set of 30 cultivars for use in future studies was chosen to represent all LMW-GS allelic variants in the collection. Among them, Chinese Spring, Opata 85, Seri 82 and Pavon 76 were recommended as a core set for use in SDS-PAGE gels. Glu-D3c and Glu-D3e are the same allele. Two new alleles, namely, Glu-D3m in cultivar Darius, and Glu-D3n in Fengmai 27, were identified by 2-DE. Utilization of the suggested standard cultivar set, seed of which is available from the CIMMYT and INRA Clermont-Ferrand germplasm collections, should also promote information sharing in the identification of individual LMW-GS and thus provide useful information for quality improvement in common wheat. © 2010 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77956437921	Characterization of seed proteome in Brachypodium distachyon	Brachypodium distachyon, an emerging model plant system for some economically important temperate grasses such as wheat, barley and switchgrass, has recently caught wide attention in modern biological research. In the current study, the glutenin, albumin and globulin components of 13 B. distachyon accessions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) followed by peptide mass finger printing (PMF) and MS/MS protein identification. Abundant wheat low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) like proteins and a few high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) with low expression level were detected in B. distachyon. A total of 18 storage proteins and 15 albumin proteins were identified through PMF and MS/MS. The results demonstrated that the major seed storage proteins in B. distachyon are wheat LMW-GS like proteins and globulins. The identified albumins and globulins were mostly various enzymes that were classified into five groups according to their functions. The 2-DE spot distribution and MS results suggested that post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylations and glycosylations are common phenomena in B. distachyon seed proteome. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77957329096	Cloning and Localization of α-Gliadin Genes from Common Wheat and Aegilops tauschii and Their Molecular Evolution	Gliadins are in high polymorphism and stable inheritance in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). It not only has a close relationship with wheat quality but also acts as an index in researches on genetic diversity and evolution of wheat. In this study, 7 novel α-gliadin genes were cloned from common wheat (cv. Yumai 34 and Yannong 19) and Aegilops tauschii (T9, T197, T48, T176, and T17) using a PCR-based strategy, which were designated Gli-YM34, Gli-YN19, Gli-T9, Gli-T197, Gli-T48, Gli-T176, and Gli-T17. The open reading frames of these genes ranged from 846 to 891 bp in length, which encoded 282-297 amino acid residues. Comparative analysis showed that all the genes isolated had typical structural characters of α-gliadin genes reported previously. Particularly, Gli-YM34 and Gli-YN19 from common wheat might have a positive effect on dough quality for the presence of an additional cysteine residue. Both of them were located on the Gli-D2 locus on the chromosome 6D based on analyses of the 4 T-cell epitopes, average length of polyglutamine domain, and the nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of Chinese Spring, and they were highly homologous to the α-gliadin genes from Ae. tauschii. The sequences of 4 typical α-gliadin genes were compared with those of 10 published α-gliadin genes, and 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a 9 bp deletion were detected. Based on the neighbor-jointing unrooted phylogene tree of 39 storage protein genes from different Triticum species, the α-gliadin genes showed a close relationship with LMW-GS genes, and their divergence occurred 43.69 million years ago. There was little homology between α-gliadin genes and HMW-GS genes/ω-gliadin genes, and their divergence occurred 73.72 million years ago. © 2010.

78049312233	Molecular characterization of the celiac disease epitope domains in α-gliadin genes in Aegilops tauschii and hexaploid wheats (Triticum aestivum L.)	Nineteen novel full-ORF α-gliadin genes and 32 pseudogenes containing at least one stop codon were cloned and sequenced from three Aegilopstauschii accessions (T15, T43 and T26) and two bread wheat cultivars (Gaocheng 8901 and Zhongyou 9507). Analysis of three typical α-gliadin genes (Gli-At4, Gli-G1 and Gli-Z4) revealed some InDels and a considerable number of SNPs among them. Most of the pseudogenes were resulted from C to T change, leading to the generation of TAG or TAA in-frame stop codon. The putative proteins of both Gli-At3 and Gli-Z7 genes contained an extra cysteine residue in the unique domain II. Analysis of toxic epitodes among 19 deduced α-gliadins demonstrated that 14 of these contained 1-5 T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes while the other 5 did not contain any toxic epitopes. The glutamine residues in two specific ployglutamine domains ranged from 7 to 27, indicating a high variation in length. According to the numbers of 4 T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes and glutamine residues in the two ployglutamine domains among the 19 α-gliadin genes, 2 were assigned to chromosome 6A, 5 to chromosome 6B and 12 to chromosome 6D. These results were consistent with those from wheat cv. Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and phylogenetic analysis. Secondary structure prediction showed that all α-gliadins had high content of β-strands and most of the α-helixes and β-strands were present in two unique domains. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that α-gliadin genes had a high homology with γ-gliadin, B-hordein, and LMW-GS genes and they diverged at approximate 39 MYA. Finally, the five α-gliadin genes were successfully expressed in E. coli, and their expression amount reached to the maximum after 4 h induced by IPTG, indicating that the α-gliadin genes can express in a high level under the control of T

78649615122	Molecular cloning, function prediction and phylogenetic analysis of LMW glutenin subunit genes in Triticum timopheevii (Zhuk.)	With 4 figures and 3 tables Two new low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) genes from Triticum timopheevii (Zhuk.) were cloned by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The complete open reading frames of 897 and 894 bp, corresponding to the size of LMW-GS genes were designated as TTLMW-m1 and TTLMW-m2, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment analysis indicated that these two genes showed high similarity with known LMW-m type genes, albeit possessing distinct sequence variations. A total of 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TTLMW-m1 and TTLMW-m2 genes were identified, including five non-synonymous mutations. The predicted secondary structure of the deduced mature glutenin subunits of TTLMW-m1 and TTLMW-m2 genes showed that both subunits possessed more α-helixes and β-strands than the control subunit AY263369, suggesting a more viscoelastic dough structure and a positive effect on quality. The homology tree and phylogenetic analysis showed that the two LMW-m type genes were most likely located at the Glu-G3 locus and that they diverged from the LMW-i type genes about 13 million years ago (MYA). The G genome in T. timopheevii appears to be closely related to the D and B genomes of Triticum aestivum. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

78649633748	Molecular characterization and comparative transcriptional analysis of LMW-m-type genes from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Aegilops species	Twelve new LMW-GS genes were characterized from bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Zhongyou 9507 and five Aegilops species by AS-PCR. These genes belong to the LMW-m type and can be classified into two subclasses designated as 1 and 2, with the latter predominant in both wheat and related wild species. Genes in the two subclasses were significantly different from each other in SNPs and InDels variations. In comparison to subclass 1, the structural features of subclass 2 differs in possessing 21 amino acid residue substitutions, two fragment deletions (each with 7 amino acid residues), and a double-residue deletion and two fragment insertions (12 and 2-5 residues).

79952987484	Gene networks in the synthesis and deposition of protein polymers during grain development of wheat	As the amino acid storing organelle, the protein bodies provide nutrients for embryo development, seed germination and early seedling growth through storage proteolysis in cereal plants, such as wheat and rice. In protein bodies, the monomeric and polymeric prolamins, i.e. gliadins and glutenins, form gluten and play a key role in determining dough functionality and end-product quality of wheat. The formation of intra- and intermolecular bonds, including disulphide and tyrosine bonds, in and between prolamins confers cohesivity, viscosity, elasticity and extensibility to wheat dough during mixing and processing. In this review, we summarize recent progress in wheat gluten research with a focus on the fundamental molecular biological aspects, including transcriptional regulation on genes coding for prolamin components, biosynthesis, deposition and secretion of protein polymers, formation of protein bodies, genetic control of seed storage proteins, the transportation of the protein bodies and key enzymes for determining the formation of disulphide bonds of prolamin polymers. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79958730518	Phylogenetic relationship of a new class of LMW-GS genes in the M genome of aegilops comosa	A new class of low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes was isolated and characterized from Aegilops comosa (2n = 2x = 14, MM). Although their DNA structure displayed high similarity to LMW-itype genes, there are some key differences. The deduced amino acid sequences of their mature proteins showed that the first amino acid residue of each gene was leucine and therefore they were designated as LMW-l type subunits. An extra cysteine residue was present in the signal peptide and the first cysteine residue of mature proteins located at the end of repetitive domain. Additionally, a long insertion of 10-22 residues (LGQQPQ5-17) occurred in the end of the C-terminal II. Comparative analysis demonstrated that LMW-l type glutenin genes possessed a great number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions. A new classification system was proposed according to the gene structure and phylogenetic analysis. In this new system, LMW-GS is classified into two major classes, LMWM and LMW-I, with each including two subclasses. The former included LMW-m and LMW-s types while the latter contained LMW-l and LMW-i types. Analysis of their evolutionary origin showed that the LMW-l genes diverged from the group 2 of LMW-m type genes at about 12-14 million years ago (MYA) while LMW-i type evolved from LMW-l type at approximately 8-12 MYA. The LMW-s type was a variant form of group 1 of LMW-m type and their divergence occurred about 4-6 MYA. In addition to homologous recombination, non-homologous illegitimate recombination could be an important molecular mechanism for the origin and evolution of LMW-GS gene family. The secondary structure prediction suggested that the novel LMW-l type subunits, such as AcLMW-L1 and AcLMW-L2, may have positive effects on dough properties. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

79958172233	Proteome analysis of wheat leaf under salt stress by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)	Salt stress is a major abiotic stress that limits agricultural productivity in many regions of the world. To understand the molecular basis of the salt stress response in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a proteomic approach was used to identify the salt stress-responsive proteins in an elite Chinese wheat cultivar, Zhengmai 9023, which exhibits a high yield, superior gluten quality and better biotic resistance. Three-week-old seedlings were treated with NaCl of four different concentrations (1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.5%). The total proteins from the leaves of untreated and NaCl-treated plants were extracted and separated by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). A total of 2358 protein spots were detected on the gels, among which 125 spots showed a significant change in protein abundance, and 83 differentially expressed spots were localised on preparative gels. Using Q-TOF mass spectrometry, 52 salt-responsive spots were identified, which were classified into six functional categories that included transport-associated proteins, detoxifying enzymes, ATP synthase, carbon metabolism, protein folding, and proteins with unknown biological functions. Of the 52 differentially expressed proteins, 26 were up-regulated, 21 were down-regulated, and five spots showed multi-expression patterns. In particular, some important proteins for salt tolerance were found to be up-regulated in Zhengmai 9023 under salt stress, such as H

79961005856	Phylogenetic analysis of C, M, N, and U genomes nd their relationships with Triticum and other related genomes as revealed by LMW-GS genes at Glu-3 loci	Phylogenetic relationships between the C, U, N, and M genomes of Aegilops species and the genomes of common wheat and other related species were investigated by using three types of low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes at Glu-3 loci. A total of 20 LMW-GS genes from Aegilops and Triticum species were isolated, including 11 LMW-m type and 9 LMW-i type genes. Particularly, four LMW-m type and three LMW-i type subunits encoded by the genes on the C, N, and U genomes possessed an extra cysteine residue at conserved positions, which could provide useful information for understanding phylogenetic relationships among Aegilops and Triticum genomes. Phylogenetic trees constructed by using either LMW-i or the combination of LMW-m and LMW-s, as well as analysis of all the three types of LMW-GS genes together, demonstrated that the C and U genomes were closely related to the A genome, whereas the N and M genomes were closely related to the Dgenome. Our results support previous findings that the A genome was derived from Triticum uratu, the B genome was from Aegilops speltoides, and the D genome was from Aegilops tauschii. In addition, phylogenetic relationships among different genomes analysed in this study support the concept that Aegilops is not monophyletic. © 2011 Published by NRC Research Press.

80054060447	Screening and identification of seed-specific genes using digital differential display tools combined with microarray data from common wheat	Background: Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops for human beings, with seeds being the tissue of highly economic value. Various morphogenetic and metabolic processes are exclusively associated with seed maturation. The goal of this study was to screen and identify genes specifically expressed in the developing seed of wheat with an integrative utilization of digital differential display (DDD) and available online microarray databases.Results: A total of 201 unigenes were identified as the results of DDD screening and microarray database searching. The expressions of 6 of these were shown to be seed-specific by qRT-PCR analysis. Further GO enrichment analysis indicated that seed-specific genes were mainly associated with defense response, response to stress, multi-organism process, pathogenesis, extracellular region, nutrient reservoir activity, enzyme inhibitor activity, antioxidant activity and oxidoreductase activity. A comparison of this set of genes with the rice (Oryza sativa) genome was also performed and approximately three-fifths of them have rice counterparts. Between the counterparts, around 63% showed similar expression patterns according to the microarray data.Conclusions: In conclusion, the DDD screening combined with microarray data analysis is an effective strategy for the identification of seed-specific expressed genes in wheat. These seed-specific genes screened during this study will provide valuable information for further studies about the functions of these genes in wheat. © 2011 Yang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84856212219	Comparative proteomic analysis of grain development in two spring wheat varieties under drought stress	Two spring wheat varieties Ningchun 4 and Chinese Spring with good and poor resistance to abiotic stress, respectively, were used to investigate proteomic changes in the developing grains under drought stress by a comparative proteomics approach. A total of 152 protein spots showed at least twofold differences in abundance on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) maps, of which 28 and 68 protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, respectively. Of the 96 identified protein spots, six different expression patterns were found and they were involved in stress/defense/detoxification, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, storage proteins and some other important functions. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed that under the drought conditions the decreased degree of ascorbate peroxidases was more significant in Chinese Spring than in Ningchun 4 during grain development whereas translationally controlled tumor protein, which was significantly upregulated at 14 DAF, was present in Ningchun 4 and absent in Chinese Spring. The Rubisco large subunit displayed an upregulated expression pattern in Ningchun 4. In addition, two drought-tolerant proteins, triosephosphate isomerase and oxygen-evolving complex showed B and F type expression patterns in Chinese Spring, but D and B types in Ningchun 4, respectively. These differentially expressed proteins might be responsible for the stronger drought resistance of Ningchun 4 compared to Chinese Spring. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

One hundred and ninety eight differentially expressed protein spots (DEPs) were located with at least two-fold differences in abundance on 2-DE maps, of which 144 were identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. These proteins were involved primarily in carbon metabolism (31.9%), detoxification and defense (12.5%), chaperones (5.6%) and signal transduction (4.9%). Comparative analysis showed that 41 DEPs were salt responsive with significant expression changes in both varieties under salt stress, and 99 (52 in Jing-411 and 47 in Chinese Spring) were variety specific. Only 15 and 9 DEPs in Jing-411 and Chinese Spring, respectively, were up-regulated in abundance under all three salt concentrations. All dynamics of the DEPs were analyzed across all treatments. Some salt responsive DEPs, such as guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-like protein, RuBisCO large subunit-binding protein subunit alpha and pathogenesis related protein 10, were up-regulated significantly in Jing-411 under all salt concentrations, whereas they were down-regulated in salinity-stressed Chinese Spring. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84863910087	Variations and classification of toxic epitopes related to celiac disease among α-gliadin genes from four Aegilops genomes	The α-gliadins are associated with human celiac disease. A total of 23 noninterrupted full open reading frame α-gliadin genes and 19 pseudogenes were cloned and sequenced from C, M, N, and U genomes of four diploid Aegilops species. Sequence comparison of α-gliadin genes from Aegilops and Triticum species demonstrated an existence of extensive allelic variations in Gli-2 loci of the four Aegilops genomes. Specific structural features were found including the compositions and variations of two polyglutamine domains (QI and QII) and four T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes. The mean numbers of glutamine residues in the QI domain in C and N genomes and the QII domain in C, N, and U genomes were much higher than those in Triticum genomes, and the QI domain in C and N genomes and the QII domain in C, M, N, and U genomes displayed greater length variations. Interestingly, the types and numbers of four T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes in α-gliadins from the four Aegilops genomes were significantly less than those from Triticum A, B, D, and their progenitor genomes. Relationships between the structural variations of the two polyglutamine domains and the distributions of four T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes were found, resulting in the α-gliadin genes from the Aegilops and Triticum genomes to be classified into three groups. © 2012 Published by NRC Research Press.

84865060826	Proteome characterization of developing grains in bread wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.)	Background: The analyses of protein synthesis, accumulation and regulation during grain development in wheat are more complex because of its larger genome size compared to model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, grains from two wheat cultivars Jimai 20 and Zhoumai 16 with different gluten quality properties were harvested at five development stages, and were used to displayed variable expression patterns of grain proteins.Results: Proteome characterization during grain development in Chinese bread wheat cultivars Jimai 20 and Zhoumai 16 with different quality properties was investigated by 2-DE and tandem MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Identification of 117 differentially accumulated protein spots representing 82 unique proteins and five main expression patterns enabled a chronological description of wheat grain formation. Significant proteome expression differences between the two cultivars were found; these included 14 protein spots that accumulated in both cultivars but with different patterns and 27 cultivar-different spots. Among the cultivar-different protein spots, 14 accumulated in higher abundance in Jimai 20 than in Zhoumai 16, and included NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, triticin precursor, LMW-s glutenin subunit and replication factor C-like protein. These proteins are likely to be associated with superior gluten quality. In addition, some proteins such as class II chitinase and peroxidase 1 with isoforms in developing grains were shown to be phosphorylated by Pro-Q Diamond staining and phosphorprotein site prediction. Phosphorylation could have important roles in wheat grain development. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that transcriptional and translational expression patterns of many genes were significantly different.Conclusions: Wheat grain proteins displayed variable expression patterns at different developmental stages and a considerable number of protein spots showed differential accumulation between two cultivars. Differences in seed storage proteins were considered to be related to different quality performance of the flour from these wheat cultivars. Some proteins with isoforms were phosphorylated, and this may reflect their importance in grain development. Our results provide new insights into proteome characterization during grain development in different wheat genotypes. © 2012 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84864384759	Identification and molecular characterisation of HMW glutenin subunit 1By16* in wild emmer	In this study, a novel y-type high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) in wild emmer wheat Triticum turgidum L. var. dicoccoides (Körn.) accession KU1952 was identified by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), capillary electrophoresis (CE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation/time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Its electrophoretic mobility and molecular weight were similar to those of 1By16 and was designated as 1By16*. The complete coding sequence of the 1By16* gene isolated by allelic-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) consists of 2,157 bp, encoding 729 amino acid residues. The real presence and authenticity of the 1By16* gene in KU1952 were further confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), heterologous expression and Western blotting. The molecular structure as well as phylogenetic analysis revealed that 1By16* had 21 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variations and possessed greater similarity with superior quality subunits 1By15 and 1By16 of common wheat. Secondary structure prediction displayed higher α-helix and β-strand contents in the 1By16* subunit, which could form a superior gluten structure and, consequently, might have positive effects on dough quality. Our results suggest that 1By16* is expected to be a new potential gene for wheat quality improvement. © 2012 Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan.

A total of 210 differentially expressed protein spots were recognized by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and 146 of these that represented 89 unique proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Four protein expression patterns were observed across five grain developmental stages. Among the identified proteins, more than 80% were enzymes in eight functional categories, including carbohydrate metabolism (27%), protein metabolism (27%), stress/defense/detoxification (11%), cell metabolism (6%), transcription/translation (4%), nitrogen metabolism (4%), photosynthesis (4%), and signal transduction (1%). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of 18 representative genes demonstrated that about two thirds of the genes displayed different expression profiles between the transcriptional and translational stages. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869238948	Molecular characterization of LMW-GS genes in Brachypodium distachyon L. reveals highly conserved Glu-3 loci in Triticum and related species	Background: Brachypodium distachyon L. is a newly emerging model plant system for temperate cereal crop species. However, its grain protein compositions are still not clear. In the current study, we carried out a detailed proteomics and molecular genetics study on grain glutenin proteins in B. distachyon.Results: SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC analysis of grain proteins showed that Brachypodium has few gliadins and high molecular weight glutenin subunits. In contrast the electrophoretic patterns for the albumin, globulin and low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) fractions of the grain protein were similar to those in wheat. In particular, the LMW-C type subunits in Brachypodium were more abundant than the equivalent proteins in common wheat. Southern blotting analysis confirmed that Brachypodium has 4-5 copies of LMW-GS genes. A total of 18 LMW-GS genes were cloned from Brachypodium by allele specific PCR. LMW-GS and 4 deduced amino acid sequences were further confirmed by using Western-blotting and MALDI-TOF-MS. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Brachypodium was closer to Ae. markgrafii and Ae. umbellulata than to T. aestivum.Conclusions: Brachypodium possessed a highly conserved Glu-3 locus that is closely related to Triticum and related species. The presence of LMW-GS in B. distachyon grains indicates that B. distachyon may be used as a model system for studying wheat quality attributes. © 2012 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84870582053	Molecular characterization of LMW-GS genes from C, N, U and Ss genomes among Aegilops species	In this work, 9 novel LMW-GS genes (6 LMW-m and 3 LMW-i type) from 4 diploid and 1 tetraploid Aegilops species were amplified and cloned by allelic-specific PCR. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that 7 and 2 LMW-GS had 9 and 7 cysteines, respectively. Four LMW-m type subunits genes had an extra cysteine at the C-terminal III, which could form intermolecular disulphide bonds to extend the chains, and therefore would facilitate to form larger gluten polymers. This suggested that these genes are expected to be used as candidate genes for wheat quality improvement. The correlation between specific N-terminal sequences and a decapeptide deletion in the C-terminal II in LMW-GS encoded by D genome was found. Particularly, if LMW-GS possessed a METRCIPG-N-terminal beginning sequences and a decapeptide (LGQCSFQQPQ) deletion in the C-terminal II, they could be encoded by D genome.

84870676971	Proteomic analysis of albumins and globulins from wheat variety Chinese spring and its fine deletion line 3BS-8	The relationship between chromosome deletion in wheat and protein expression were investigated using Chinese Spring and fine deletion line 3BS-8. Through 2-DE (2-D electrophoresis) analysis, no differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found in leaf samples; however, 47 DEPs showed at least two-fold abundance variation (p < 0.05) in matured wheat grains and 21 spots were identified by tandem MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Among the identified spots, four were cultivar-specific, including three (spots B15, B16, and B21) in Chinese Spring and one in 3BS-8 (spot B10). Among variety-different DEPs between Chinese Spring and 3BS-8, most spots showed a higher express profile in CS; only four spots showed up-regulated expression tendency in 3BS-8. An interesting observation was that more than half of the identified protein spots were involved in storage proteins, of which 11 spots were identified as globulins. According to these results, we can presume that the encoded genes of protein spots B15, B16, and B21 were located on the chromosome segment deleted in 3BS-8. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84871673426	Wheat drought-responsive grain proteome analysis by linear and nonlinear 2-DE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry	A comparative proteomic analysis of drought-responsive proteins during grain development of two wheat varieties Kauz (strong resistance to drought stress) and Janz (sensitive to drought stress) was performed by using linear and nonlinear 2-DE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technologies. Results revealed that the nonlinear 2-DE had much higher resolution than the linear 2-DE. A total of 153 differentially expressed protein spots were detected by both 2-DE maps, of which 122 protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The identified differential proteins were mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism (26%), detoxification and defense (23%), and storage proteins (17%). Some key proteins demonstrated significantly different expression patterns between the two varieties. In particular, catalase isozyme 1, WD40 repeat protein, LEA and alpha-amylase inhibitors displayed an upregulated expression pattern in Kauz, whereas they were downregulated or unchanged in Janz. Small and large subunit ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase, ascorbate peroxidase and G beta-like protein were all downregulated under drought stress in Janz, but had no expression changes in Kauz. Sucrose synthase and triticin precursor showed an upregulated expression pattern under water deficits in both varieties, but their upregulation levels were much higher in Kauz than in Janz. These differentially expressed proteins could be related to the biochemical pathways for stronger drought resistance of Kauz. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84876433493	Development, identification, and genetic analysis of a quantitative dwarfing somatic variation line in wheat	Dwarfing germplasms are crucial to the development of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties with ideal plant height and combinations of agronomic traits. A novel dwarfing wheat line, AS34, was developed in this study by somatic variation. This new wheat germplasm was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, twodimensional gel electrophoresis, genomic in situ hybridization, and genomic scanning with 44 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and our analysis showed that AS34 was clearly derived from the somatic variation of Yumai66 (YM66), its tissue culture parent, but not from natural hybridization. Molecular tests using known primers specific to Rht8 and Rht-B1b genes indicated that AS34 and its parent contained Rht8 but not Rht-B1b in their genomes, which was not consistent with previous reports. Similar to YM66, AS34 was sensitive to gibberellic acid, and this characteristic might be induced only by Rht8 or by Rht8 and the new dwarfing genes simultaneously. Genetic analysis revealed that the new dwarfing trait in AS34 was controlled by multiple quantitative genes, and data from the F

84877068618	Rapid characterization of wheat low molecular weight glutenin subunits by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)	Low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), as important seed storage proteins, together with HMW-GS significantly define unique dough viscoelastic properties. In this study, a rapid ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method for the separation and characterization of LMW-GS in wheat was optimized and established. The fast, reproducible, and high-resolution UPLC separation of LMW-GS could be obtained by gradually increasing eluting gradient from 21 to 47% in 30 min at flow rate of 0.55 mL/min and 60 C for separation temperature. By this method, analysis of one sample could be completed in <20 min, significantly less time than the traditional reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method. Under the optimized conditions, the genetic features of LMW-GS and genotype × environmental interaction were successfully analyzed, leading to a fast identification of 17 main LMW-GS alleles that were related to different quality properties in wheat. The results demonstrated that UPLC could be a powerful and alternative tool for genetic and proteomic studies of wheat grain proteins and fast identification or screening of desirable LMW-GS alleles in wheat quality improvement. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84878996070	molecular cloning and characterization of six novel HMW-GS genes from aegilops speltoides and aegilops kotschyi	Six novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) from Aegilops speltoides (SS, 2n = 2x = 14) and Aegilops kotschyi (UUSS, 2n = 4x = 28) were identified by SDS-PAGE and designated as ASy15*, AKx1*, AKx3*, AKx2.3, AKy20* and AKy8*, respectively. Their complete open reading frames (ORFs) were cloned and sequenced by allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). Sequence comparison demonstrated that these novel genes displayed high single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and InDel variations. In particular, AKy8* had an extra cysteine residue at position 140 in the central repetitive domain, while AKx2.3 had an unusually long repetitive domain (816 aa), which might have positive effects on gluten quality. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AKx1* and AKx3* belonged to the 1S genome, AKx2.3 to the 1U genome, and AKy20* and AKy8* most likely to the 1S genome. The divergence between the 6 HMW-GS genes from the two Aegilops species and those from Triticum species occurred 4.77-23.54 MYA. The authenticity of these isolated endogenous HMW-GS genes was confirmed through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and Western blotting. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

84884891017	The large soybean (Glycine max) WRKY TF family expanded by segmental duplication events and subsequent divergent selection among subgroups	Background: WRKY genes encode one of the most abundant groups of transcription factors in higher plants, and its members regulate important biological process such as growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Although the soybean genome sequence has been published, functional studies on soybean genes still lag behind those of other species.Results: We identified a total of 133 WRKY members in the soybean genome. According to structural features of their encoded proteins and to the phylogenetic tree, the soybean WRKY family could be classified into three groups (groups I, II, and III). A majority of WRKY genes (76.7%; 102 of 133) were segmentally duplicated and 13.5% (18 of 133) of the genes were tandemly duplicated. This pattern was not apparent in Arabidopsis or rice. The transcriptome atlas revealed notable differential expression in either transcript abundance or in expression patterns under normal growth conditions, which indicated wide functional divergence in this family. Furthermore, some critical amino acids were detected using DIVERGE v2.0 in specific comparisons, suggesting that these sites have contributed to functional divergence among groups or subgroups. In addition, site model and branch-site model analyses of positive Darwinian selection (PDS) showed that different selection regimes could have affected the evolution of these groups. Sites with high probabilities of having been under PDS were found in groups I, II c, II e, and III. Together, these results contribute to a detailed understanding of the molecular evolution of the WRKY gene family in soybean.Conclusions: In this work, all the WRKY genes, which were generated mainly through segmental duplication, were identified in the soybean genome. Moreover, differential expression and functional divergence of the duplicated WRKY genes were two major features of this family throughout their evolutionary history. Positive selection analysis revealed that the different groups have different evolutionary rates. Together, these results contribute to a detailed understanding of the molecular evolution of the WRKY gene family in soybean. © 2013 Yin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84886941423	Applications of capillary electrophoresis for rapidly separating and characterizing water-soluble proteins of wheat grains	Separation and analysis of water-soluble proteins (WSP) are important in understanding wheat grain proteome fundamentals. However, due to their high degree of heterogeneity and complexity in the compositions, separating WSP is generally difficult and relevant methodologies are not efficiently developed yet. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is one of the analytical methods currently used for protein separation and characterization. In the present study, a CE method is established for rapidly separating and characterizing WSP of wheat grains. The established method was tested in various applications including wheat variety and germplasm identification as well as protein synthesis and accumulation studies during different grain development stages subject to genotypic and environmental variations. As results, the characteristic CE patterns of a range of bread wheat cultivars and related species were readily identified. The synthesis and accumulation patterns of wheat WSP during developing grains as well as their stabilities in different environments were also investigated. The technical advancements present in this article appear to be useful for wheat cultivar and germplasm identification as well as genetics and breeding research.

0242457360	HMW and LMW glutenin alleles among putative tetraploid and hexaploid European spelt wheat (Triticum spelta L.) progenitors	The allelic compositions of high- and low-molecular-weight subunits of glutenins (HMW-GS and LMW-GS) among European spelt (Triticum spelta L.) and related hexaploid and tetraploid Triticum species were investigated by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). A total of seven novel glutenin alleles (designated A1a*, B1d*, B1g*, B1f*, B1j*, D1a* at Glu-1 and A3h at the Glu-3 loci, respectively) in European spelt wheat were detected by SDS-PAGE, which were confirmed further by employing A-PAGE and CE methods. Particularly, two HMW-GS alleles, Glu-B1d* coding the subunits 6.1 and 22.1, and Glu-B1f* coding the subunits 13 and 22*, were found to occur in European spelt with frequencies of 32.34% and 5.11%, respectively. These two alleles were present in cultivated emmer (Triticum dicoccum), but they were not observed in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The allele Glu-B1g* coding for 13* and 19* subunits found in spelt wheat was also detected in club wheat (Triticum compactum L.). Additionally, two alleles coding for LMW-GS, Glu-A3h and Glu-B3d, occurred with high frequencies in spelt, club and cultivated emmer wheat, whereas these were not found or present with very low frequencies in bread wheat. Our results strongly support the secondary origin hypothesis, namely European spelt wheat originated from hybridization between cultivated emmer and club wheat. This is also confirmed experimentally by the artificial synthesis of spelt through crossing between old European emmer wheat, T. dicoccum and club wheat, T. compactum.

84888586156	Fast identification of wheat 1BL.1RS translocation by reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC)	The 1BL.1RS chromosomal translocation in wheat is the result of replacement of the short arm of chromosome 1B of wheat by the short arm of chromosome 1R of rye, which had been widely used as a parental line in worldwide wheat breeding, resulting in a high percentage of wheat cultivars containing this translocation. A fast and reliable approach to identify this translocation is highly desirable in modern wheat breeding. This study compared reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC), acidic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE), liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), allelic-specific PCR, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) approaches to identify the 1BL.1RS translocation in 76 bread wheat cultivars. Two gliadin bands in the Gli-B1 region of A-PAGE separation were confirmed by LC-MS/MS to be omega secalins from the 1BL.1RS translocation, and they can be used as reliable protein markers for identifying the translocation. A few specific minor peaks eluted at 12-13min on the RP-UPLC patterns can readily differentiate the 1BL.1RS translocation. Of the 76 wheat cultivars tested, 40 were identified as carrying the 1BL.1RS translocation by RP-UPLC, which was consistent with the results of A-PAGE, HPLC, and PCR. Compared with other established methods, RP-UPLC showed a clear advantage in fast identification of the 1BL.1RS translocation with higher reliability and lower costs, and it is therefore ideal for large-scale screening of the 1BL.1RS translocation in wheat breeding. © CSIRO 2013.

84891399952	Rapid separation and identification of wheat HMW glutenin subunits by UPLC and comparative analysis with HPLC	High molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are among the major determinant on wheat bread-making quality. Rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) methods with high resolution and reproducibility for HMW-GS separation were established in this work. A sample could be completely analyzed in less than 12 min by using the optimized UPLC conditions: gradually increasing elution gradient from 21% to 47% in 30 min at flow rate 0.55 ml/min and separation temperature 55°C. The results from 15 consecutive runs showed that UPLC patterns of HMW-GS including peak migration time, height and peak area displayed high reproducibility. In addition, the analysis consumes small amounts of reagent. A total of 34 subunits from 111 wheat cultivars and gene bank accessions were well separated and showed clearly different UPLC patterns. Thus all subunits could be readily identified, especially for 1Dx and 1By subunits that were not separable by traditional HPLC. The results from different growing environments demonstrated that the subunit elution times were highly stable, displaying significant changes in the subunit peak heights and areas, reflecting their expression amounts. In comparison with the state-of-the-art HPLC method, UPLC has obvious advantages in separation time, resolution and reagent consuming, which provides an alternative powerful technique for wheat storage protein studies and quality improvement.

84892387509	Transcriptome analysis during seed germination of elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar Jimai 20	Background: Wheat seed germination directly affects wheat yield and quality. Although transcriptome and proteome analyses during seed germination have been reported in some crop plant species, dynamic transcriptome characterization during wheat seed germination has not been conducted. We performed the first comprehensive dynamic transcriptome analysis during different seed germination stages of elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar Jimai 20 using the Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array. Results: A total of 61,703 probe sets representing 51,411 transcripts were identified during the five seed germination stages of Jimai 20, of which 2,825 differential expression probe sets corresponding to 2,646 transcripts with different functions were declared by ANOVA and a randomized variance model. The seed germination process included a rapid initial uptake phase (0-12 hours after imbibition [HAI]), a plateau phase (12-24 HAI), and a further water uptake phase (24-48 HAI), corresponding to switches from the degradation of small-molecule sucrose to the metabolism of three major nutrients and to photosynthesis. Hierarchical cluster and MapMan analyses revealed changes in several significant metabolism pathways during seed germination as well as related functional groups. The signal pathway networks constructed with KEGG showed three important genes encoding the phosphofructokinase family protein, with fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase located at the center, indicating their pivotal roles in the glycolytic pathway, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenesis, respectively. Several significant pathways were selected to establish a metabolic pathway network according to their degree value, which allowed us to find the pathways vital to seed germination. Furthermore, 51 genes involved in transport, signaling pathway, development, lipid metabolism, defense response, nitrogen metabolism, and transcription regulation were analyzed by gene co-expression network with a k-core algorithm to determine which play pivotal roles in germination. Twenty-three meaningful genes were found, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis validated the expression patterns of 12 significant genes.Conclusions: Wheat seed germination comprises three distinct phases and includes complicated regulation networks involving a large number of genes. These genes belong to many functional groups, and their co-regulations guarantee regular germination. Our results provide new insight into metabolic changes during seed germination and interactions between some significant genes. © 2014 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84892393270	Global analysis of differentially expressed genes and proteins in the wheat callus infected by Agrobacterium tumefaciens	Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is an extremely complex and evolved process involving genetic determinants of both the bacteria and the host plant cells. However, the mechanism of the determinants remains obscure, especially in some cereal crops such as wheat, which is recalcitrant for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed in wheat callus cells cocultured with Agrobacterium by using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS). A set of 4,889 DEGs and 90 DEPs were identified, respectively. Most of them are related to metabolism, chromatin assembly or disassembly and immune defense. After comparative analysis, 24 of the 90 DEPs were detected in RNA-seq and proteomics datasets simultaneously. In addition, real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed to check the differential expression of the 24 genes, and the results were consistent with the RNA-seq data. According to gene ontology (GO) analysis, we found that a big part of these differentially expressed genes were related to the process of stress or immunity response. Several putative determinants and candidate effectors responsive to Agrobacterium mediated transformation of wheat cells were discussed. We speculate that some of these genes are possibly related to Agrobacterium infection. Our results will help to understand the interaction between Agrobacterium and host cells, and may facilitate developing efficient transformation strategies in cereal crops. © 2013 Zhou et al.

84893237066	Proteome and phosphoproteome characterization reveals new response and defense mechanisms of brachypodium distachyon leaves under salt stress	Salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting plant growth and development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of salt response and defense in plants will help in efforts to improve the salt tolerance of crops. Brachypodium distachyon is a new model plant for wheat, barley, and several potential biofuel grasses. In the current study, proteome and phosphoproteome changes induced by salt stress were the focus. The Bd21 leaves were initially treated with salt in concentrations ranging from 80 to 320 mM and then underwent a recovery process prior to proteome analysis. A total of 80 differentially expressed protein spots corresponding to 60 unique proteins were identified. The sample treated with a median salt level of 240 mM and the control were selected for phosphopeptide purification using TiO2 microcolumns and LC-MS/MS for phosphoproteome analysis to identify the phosphorylation sites and phosphoproteins. A total of 1509 phosphoproteins and 2839 phosphorylation sites were identified. Among them, 468 phosphoproteins containing 496 phosphorylation sites demonstrated significant changes at the phosphorylation level. Nine phosphorylation motifs were extracted from the 496 phosphorylation sites. Of the 60 unique differentially expressed proteins, 14 were also identified as phosphoproteins. Many proteins and phosphoproteins, as well as potential signal pathways associated with salt response and defense, were found, including three 14-3-3s (GF14A, GF14B, and 14-3-3A) for signal transduction and several ABA signal-associated proteins such as ABF2, TRAB1, and SAPK8. Finally, a schematic salt response and defense mechanism in B. distachyon was proposed. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84893635479	Molecular characterisation and evolution of HMW glutenin subunit genes in Brachypodium distachyon L	Brachypodium distachyon, a small wild grass within the Pooideae family, is a new model organism for exploring the functional genomics of cereal crops. It was shown to have close relationships to wheat, barley and rice. Here, we describe the molecular characterisation and evolutionary relationships of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) genes from B. distachyon. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), high performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses demonstrated that there was no HMW-GS expression in the Brachypodium grains due to the silencing of their encoding genes. Through allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) amplification and cloning, a total of 13 HMW-GS encoding genes from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid Brachypodium species were obtained, and all of them had typical structural features of y-type HMW-GS genes from common wheat and related species, particularly more similar to the 1Dy12 gene. However, the presence of an in-frame premature stop codon (TAG) at position 1521 in the coding region resulted in the conversion of all the genes to pseudogenes. Further, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that HMW-GS genes in B. distachyon displayed a similar trend, but with a low transcriptional expression profile during grain development due to the occurrence of the stop codon. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the highly conserved Glu-1-2 loci were presented in B. distachyon, which displayed close phylogenetic evolutionary relationships with Triticum and related species. © 2013 Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan.

Proteins were extracted, quantified, and resolved by 2-DE at pH. 4-7. Statistical analysis of spot intensity was performed by using principal component analysis and samples were clustered by using Euclidean distance. In total, 136 differentially accumulated protein spots representing 88 unique proteins were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Under normal conditions, stress-related proteins were abundant in unfertilized ovaries while proteins involved in the metabolism of energy and matter were enriched in fertilized ovaries just 48. h after fertilization. Similar trends were observed in unfertilized and fertilized wheat ovaries under water deficit conditions, except for increased accumulation of stress-related proteins in fertilized ovaries. Some proteins required for normal development were not present in ovaries subjected to water deficit. Our comprehensive results provide new insights into the biochemical mechanisms involved in ovary development before and after fertilization and in tolerance to water deficit. Biological Significance: Fertilization initiates the most dramatic changes that occur in the life cycle of higher plants; research into differences in gene expression before and after ovary pollination can make a substantial contribution to understanding the physiological and biochemical processes associated with fertilization. To date, a small number of studies have examined changes in transcriptional activity of the developing plant embryo sac before and after fertilization. However, comparative proteomic analysis of wheat ovary development before and after fertilization, and in response to water deficit, has not yet been reported. Our comprehensive results provide new insights into the biochemical mechanisms involved in ovary development before and after fertilization and in tolerance to water deficit. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84898056842	The α-gliadin genes from Brachypodium distachyon L. Provide evidence for a significant gap in the current genome assembly	Brachypodium distachyon, is a new model plant for most cereal crops while gliadin is a class of wheat storage proteins related with wheat quality attributes. In the published B. distachyon genome sequence databases, no gliadin gene is found. In the current study, a number of gliadin genes in B. distachyon were isolated, which is contradictory to the results of genome sequencing projects. In our study, the B. distachyon seeds were found to have no gliadin protein expression by gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and Western blotting analysis. However, Southern blotting revealed a presence of more than ten copies of α-gliadin coding genes in B. distachyon. By means of AS-PCR amplification, four novel full-ORF α-gliadin genes, and 26 pseudogenes with at least one stop codon as well as their promoter regions were cloned and sequenced from different Brachypodium accessions. Sequence analysis revealed a few of single-nucleotide polymorphisms among these genes. Most pseudogenes were resulted from a C to T change, leading to the generation of TAG or TAA in-frame stop codon. To compare both the full-ORFs and the pseudogenes among Triticum and Triticum-related species, their structural characteristics were analyzed. Based on the four T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes and two ployglutamine domains, Aegilops, Triticum, and Brachypodium species were found to be more closely related. The phylogenetic analysis further revealed that B. distachyon was more closely related to Aegilops tauschii, Aegilops umbellulata, and the A or D genome of Triticum aestivum.

84898641013	Molecular characterisation of high molecular weight glutenin allele Glu-B1h encoding 1Bx14+1By15 subunits in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)	In this study, the authentic high molecular weight glutenin (HMW-GS) allele Glu-B1h encoding for subunits 1Bx14 and 1By15 from German bread wheat cultivars Hanno and Imbros was identified and cross-verified by a suite of established protein analysis technologies, including sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The complete encoding sequences were isolated by allele-specific PCR, and consist of 2367bp for 1Bx14 and 2151bp for 1By15 and encode 789 and 717 amino acid residues, respectively. The deduced molecular masses of two subunit genes were 82340.13Da and 74736.13Da, corresponding well to those determined by MALDI-TOF-MS. The presence and authenticity of 1Bx14 and 1By15 subunits were further confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and heterologous expression in E. coli. Comparative analysis demonstrated that 1Bx14 possessed one deletion and 20 single-nucleotide polymorphism variations compared with seven other Glu-B1 x-type HMW-GS genes that mainly resulted from C-T substitutions, whereas compared with five other Glu-B1 y-type HMW-GS genes, 1By15 displayed few variations. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete coding sequences of the published HMW-GS genes showed that 1Bx14 had a high divergence with other 1Bx subunit genes, whereas 1By15 displayed greater similarity with 1By20. A possible evolutionary route for 1Bx14 gene formation is proposed, which might have resulted from an intra-strand illegitimate recombination event that occurred ∼1.32million years ago. © CSIRO 2014.

Protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) are involved in catalyzing protein disulfide bonding and isomerization in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a chaperone to inhibit the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Brachypodium distachyon is a widely used model plant for temperate grass species such as wheat and barley. In this work, we report the first molecular characterization, phylogenies, and expression profiles of PDI and PDI-like (PDIL) genes in B. distachyon in different tissues under various abiotic stresses. Eleven PDI and PDIL genes in the B. distachyon genome by in silico identification were evenly distributed across all five chromosomes. The plant PDI family has three conserved motifs that are involved in catalyzing protein disulfide bonding and isomerization, but a different exon/intron structural organization showed a high degree of structural differentiation. Two pairs of genes (BdPDIL4-1 and BdPDIL4-2; BdPDIL7-1 and BdPDIL7-2) contained segmental duplications, indicating each pair originated from one progenitor. Promoter analysis showed that Brachypodium PDI family members contained important cis-acting regulatory elements involved in seed storage protein synthesis and diverse stress response. All Brachypodium PDI genes investigated were ubiquitously expressed in different organs, but differentiation in expression levels among different genes and organs was clear. BdPDIL1-1 and BdPDIL5-1 were expressed abundantly in developing grains, suggesting that they have important roles in synthesis and accumulation of seed storage proteins. Diverse treatments (drought, salt, ABA, and H

84899806935	Integrative network analysis of the signaling cascades in seedling leaves of bread wheat by large-scale phosphoproteomic profiling	Here, we conducted the first large-scale leaf phosphoproteome analysis of two bread wheat cultivars by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Altogether, 1802 unambiguous phosphorylation sites representing 1175 phosphoproteins implicated in various molecular functions and cellular processes were identified by gene ontology enrichment analysis. Among the 1175 phosphoproteins, 141 contained 3-10 phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation sites were located more frequently in the N- and C-terminal regions than in internal regions, and ∼70% were located outside the conserved regions. Conservation analysis showed that 90.5% of the phosphoproteins had phosphorylated orthologs in other plant species. Eighteen significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs, of which six were new wheat phosphorylation motifs, were identified. In particular, 52 phosphorylated transcription factors (TFs), 85 protein kinases (PKs), and 16 protein phosphatases (PPs) were classified and analyzed in depth. All the Tyr phosphorylation sites were in PKs such as mitogen-activated PKs (MAPKs) and SHAGGY-like kinases. A complicated cross-talk phosphorylation regulatory network based on PKs such as Snf1-related kinases (SnRKs), calcium-dependent PKs (CDPKs), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and PPs including PP2C, PP2A, and BRI1 suppressor 1 (BSU1)-like protein (BSL) was constructed and was found to be potentially involved in rapid leaf growth. Our results provide a series of phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites in addition to a potential network of phosphorylation signaling cascades in wheat seedling leaves. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84899645988	Soybean (Glycine max) expansin gene superfamily origins: Segmental and tandem duplication events followed by divergent selection among subfamilies	Background: Expansins are plant cell wall loosening proteins that are involved in cell enlargement and a variety of other developmental processes. The expansin superfamily contains four subfamilies; namely, α-expansin (EXPA), β-expansin (EXPB), expansin-like A (EXLA), and expansin-like B (EXLB). Although the genome sequencing of soybeans is complete, our knowledge about the pattern of expansion and evolutionary history of soybean expansin genes remains limited.Results: A total of 75 expansin genes were identified in the soybean genome, and grouped into four subfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationships. Structural analysis revealed that the expansin genes are conserved in each subfamily, but are divergent among subfamilies. Furthermore, in soybean and Arabidopsis, the expansin gene family has been mainly expanded through tandem and segmental duplications; however, in rice, segmental duplication appears to be the dominant process that generates this superfamily. The transcriptome atlas revealed notable differential expression in either transcript abundance or expression patterns under normal growth conditions. This finding was consistent with the differential distribution of the cis-elements in the promoter region, and indicated wide functional divergence in this superfamily. Moreover, some critical amino acids that contribute to functional divergence and positive selection were detected. Finally, site model and branch-site model analysis of positive selection indicated that the soybean expansin gene superfamily is under strong positive selection, and that divergent selection constraints might have influenced the evolution of the four subfamilies.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the soybean expansin gene superfamily has expanded through tandem and segmental duplication. Differential expression indicated wide functional divergence in this superfamily. Furthermore, positive selection analysis revealed that divergent selection constraints might have influenced the evolution of the four subfamilies. In conclusion, the results of this study contribute novel detailed information about the molecular evolution of the expansin gene superfamily in soybean. © 2014 Zhu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84901915081	Wheat seed storage proteins: Advances in molecular genetics, diversity and breeding applications	Wheat seed storage proteins, especially glutenins and gliadins, have unique functional properties giving rise to a wide array of food products for human consumption. The wheat seed storage proteins, however, are also the most common cause of food-related allergies and intolerances, and it has become crucially important to understand their composition, variation and functional properties and interface this knowledge with the grain handling industry as well as the breeders. This review focuses on advances in understanding the genetics and function of storage proteins and their application in wheat breeding programs. These include: (1) The development and validation of high-throughput molecular marker systems for defining the composition and variation of low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) genes and a summary of the more than 30 gene-specific markers for rapid screening in wheat breeding programs; (2) The identification of more than 100 alleles of storage proteins in wild species provide candidate genes for future quality improvement; (3) The documentation of quality effects of individual LMW-GS and HMW-GS for improving end-use quality; and (4) The analysis of α-gliadin genes on chromosomes 6A and 6D with non-toxic epitopes as potential targets to develop less toxic cultivars for people with celiac disease. Genomic and proteomic technologies that will continue to provide new tools for understanding variation and function of seed storage proteins in wheat are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84903550944	Screening and identification of soybean seed-specific genes by using integrated bioinformatics of digital differential display, microarray, and RNA-seq data	Soybean is one of the most economically important crops in the world. Soybean seeds have abundant protein and lipid content and very high economic value. In this study, a total of 184 seed-specific genes were obtained using online microarray databases, DDD, and RNA-seq data. The reported seed-specific genes in soybean and the 184 seed-specific genes analyzed in this paper were compared. Of the screened genes, 26 were common to both previous reports and the current screening. Meanwhile, 90 of the 184 genes have homologous counterparts in Arabidopsis, among which 24 have seed-specific expression, as indicated by microarray data for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, promoter analysis showed that almost all seed-specific genes contain at least one seed specific-related element. Seed-specific element Skn-1 motif exists in most, if not all, of the seed-specific genes screened. Five genes were randomly selected from 184 soybean seed specific gene pool and their expressions were quantified using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to further confirm the specificity of the screened genes. The results indicated that all five genes showed seed-specific expression. Moreover, the identification of genes with seed-specific expression screened in this study provides information valuable to the in-depth study of soybean. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84903413669	Large-scale phosphoproteome analysis in seedling leaves of Brachypodium distachyon L.	Background: Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications involved in the regulation of plant growth and development as well as diverse stress response. As a member of the Poaceae, Brachypodium distachyon L. is a new model plant for wheat and barley as well as several potential biofuel grasses such as switchgrass. Vegetative growth is vital for biomass accumulation of plants, but knowledge regarding the role of protein phosphorylation modification during vegetative growth, especially in biofuel plants, is far from comprehensive.Results: In this study, we carried out the first large-scale phosphoproteome analysis of seedling leaves in Brachypodium accession Bd21 using TiO

84905443201	Phosphoproteome analysis reveals new drought response and defense mechanisms of seedling leaves in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)	Drought is a major form of abiotic stress that significantly affects plant growth and development. In this study, we performed the first phosphoproteome analysis of seedling leaves from two bread wheat cultivars (Hanxuan 10 and Ningchun 47) subjected to drought stress. As a result, a total of 191 and 251 unique phosphopeptides, representing 173 and 227 phosphoproteins in two cultivars, respectively, were identified as being significant changes in phosphorylation level (SCPL) under drought stress. Through the comparison of SCPL phosphoproteins between two cultivars, 31 common SCPL phosphoproteins were found in both cultivars. Function analysis showed that the SCPL phosphoproteins in the two cultivars are mainly involved in three biological processes: RNA transcription/processing, stress/detoxification/defense, and signal transduction. Further analyses revealed that some SCPL phosphoproteins may play key roles in signal transduction and the signaling cascade under drought stress. Furthermore, some phosphoproteins related to drought tolerance and osmotic regulation exhibited significant phosphorylation changes. This study used a series of bioinformatics tools to profile the phosphorylation status of wheat seedling leaves under drought stress with greater accuracy. Biological significance: Drought is of the most studied abiotic stresses, because it severely restricts the development and yield of plants. In this study, large numbers of stress-related phosphoproteins are identified from the two bread wheat cultivars. These phosphoproteins contribute to signal transduction, osmotic regulation and ROS scavenging under water stress. This work provides a detailed insight into the mechanisms of drought response and defense in bread wheat from the perspective of phosphoproteomics, and identifies some important drought-tolerant candidates for further transgenosis study and incorporation into the breeding of resistant cultivars. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84905746580	Dynamic development of starch granules and the regulation of starch biosynthesis in Brachypodium distachyon: Comparison with common wheat and Aegilops peregrina	Background: Thorough understanding of seed starch biosynthesis and accumulation mechanisms is of great importance for agriculture and crop improvement strategies. We conducted the first comprehensive study of the dynamic development of starch granules and the regulation of starch biosynthesis in Brachypodium distachyon and compared the findings with those reported for common wheat (Chinese Spring, CS) and Aegilops peregrina.Results: Only B-granules were identified in Brachypodium Bd21, and the shape variation and development of starch granules were similar in the B-granules of CS and Bd21. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the Bd21 starch synthesis-related genes were more similar to those in wheat than in rice. Early expression of key genes in Bd21 starch biosynthesis mediate starch synthesis in the pericarp; intermediate-stage expression increases the number and size of starch granules. In contrast, these enzymes in CS and Ae. peregrina were mostly expressed at intermediate stages, driving production of new B-granules and increasing the granule size, respectively. Immunogold labeling showed that granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI; related to amylose synthesis) was mainly present in starch granules: at lower levels in the B-granules of Bd21 than in CS. Furthermore, GBSSI was phosphorylated at threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 in the starch synthase catalytic domain in CS and Ae. peregrina, but neither site was phosphorylated in Bd21, suggesting GBSSI phosphorylation could improve amylose biosynthesis.Conclusions: Bd21 contains only B-granules, and the expression of key genes in the three studied genera is consistent with the dynamic development of starch granules. GBSSI is present in greater amounts in the B-granules of CS than in Bd21; two phosphorylation sites (Thr183 and Tyr185) were found in Triticum and Aegilops; these sites were not phosphorylated in Bd21. GBSSI phosphorylation may reflect its importance in amylose synthesis.

84907820818	Comparative phosphoproteome analysis of the developing grains in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under well-watered and water-deficit conditions	Wheat (Triticum aestivum), one of the most important cereal crops, is often threatened by drought. In this study, water deficit significantly reduced the height of plants and yield of grains. To explore further the effect of drought stress on the development and yield of grains, we first performed a large scale phosphoproteome analysis of developing grains in wheat. A total of 590 unique phosphopeptides, representing 471 phosphoproteins, were identified under well-watered conditions. Motif-X analysis showed that four motifs were enriched, including [sP], [Rxxs], [sDxE], and [sxD]. Through comparative phosphoproteome analysis between well-watered and water-deficit conditions, we found that 63 unique phosphopeptides, corresponding to 61 phosphoproteins, showed significant changes in phosphorylation level (≥2-fold intensities). Functional analysis suggested that some of these proteins may be involved in signal transduction, embryo and endosperm development of grains, and drought response and defense under water-deficit conditions. Moreover, we also found that some chaperones may play important roles in protein refolding or degradation when the plant is subjected to water stress. These results provide a detailed insight into the stress response and defense mechanisms of developmental grains at the phosphoproteome level. They also suggested some potential candidates for further study of transgenosis and drought stress as well as incorporation into molecular breeding for drought resistance.

0347635528	Capillary electrophoresis separation of high molecular weight glutenin subunits in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and related species with phosphate-based buffers	This study focused on optimizing phosphate-based buffers and other capillary electrophoresis (CE) parameters for separating and characterizing high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., AABBDD, 2n = 6x = 42), emmer (Triticum dicoccum, AABB, 2n = 4x = 28) and Aegilops tauschii (DD, 2n = 2x = 14). The fast and high-resolution separation of HMW-GS was achieved using 0.1 M phosphate-glycine buffer (pH 2.5, containing 20% acetonitrile and 0.05% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) at 12.5 kV and 40°C with 25 μm inside diameter (ID) × 27 cm uncoated fused-silica capillary. In general, one sample separation can be analyzed in 15 min. The good run-to-run repeatable separation of HMW-GS could be obtained with a relative standard deviation of less than 1% when capillaries were rinsed with 1 M phosphoric acid for 2 min, followed by separation buffer for 2 min after each separation. The HMW-GS from some bread wheat cultivars as well as tetraploid and diploid accessions was separated by the CE method described above, and all subunits detected were well characterized and readily identified. Some HMW-GS showed reversed mobilities and elution order compared to the methods of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and SDS-CE. Particularly, most of the HMW-GS analyzed with the CE buffer used were separated into multiple peaks, generally a high peak plus a minor peak. CE appears to be capable of separating and characterizing HMW-GS with fast and high-resolution features, therefore it is expected to be useful for specific germplasm screening and desirable HMW-GS identification in wheat quality improvement.

84921456175	An improved MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry procedure and a novel DNA marker for identifying over-expressed Bx7 glutenin protein subunit in wheat	Wheat bread-making quality is mainly determined by glutenin proteins in the grain, which exist in a wide range of variable alleles with differential influence on processing attributes. A recently identified allele, Bx7 over-expression (Bx7<sup>oe</sup>), has been showing highly significant positive effects on wheat dough strength over the normally expressed Bx7 allele. SDS-PAGE and normal RP-HPLC procedures failed to separate the two alleles. In the current study, an extensively optimised MALDI-TOF based procedure and a refined DNA based marker for efficiently differentiating Bx7<sup>oe</sup> from normal Bx7 allele were established. Results indicated that the MALDI-TOF procedure is cost effective, high throughput, and proven reliable, while the refined PCR marker only amplifies Bx7<sup>oe</sup> allele, a clear advantage over the previously developed codominant marker.
