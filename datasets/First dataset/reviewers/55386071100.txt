34249293004	Metabolic flux analysis on arachidonic acid fermentation	Analysis of flux distributions in metabolic networks has become an important approach for understanding the fermentation characteristics of the process. A model of metabolic flux analysis of arachidonic acid (AA) synthesis in Mortierella alpina ME-1 was established and carbon flux distributions were estimated in different fermentation phases with different concentrations of N-source. During exponential, decelerating and stationary phase, carbon fluxes to AA are 3.28%, 8.80%, 6.97%, respectively, with sufficient N-source broth based on the flux of glucose uptake, and those are increased to 3.95%, 19.21% and 39.29%, respectively, by regulating the shifts of carbon fluxes via fermentation with limited N-source broth and adding 0.05% NaNO

58149307952	A kinetic model of batch fermentation for fumaric acid production by rhizopus oryzae	Kinetic model has important significance for both theory and practice studies on microorganism cultivation. The process of Rhizopus oryzae fermentation in a 7 L fermentor with glucose as the carbon limiting substrate for producing fumaric acid was analyzed. Based on the Logistic and Luedeking-Piret equations, the mathematic models of mycelia growth, fumaric acid production and substrate consumption were developed to describe the fermentation process mentioned above. The kinetic parameters of the established models were determined by Runge-Kutta method. According to the models, the calculating results agree with the experimental data well and the deviations between them are within 5%, which indicates that the proposed kinetic models can well describe the kinetic mechanism of the fumaric acid production by Rhizopus oryzae, and they further provide the theoretical bases for the industrial-scale fumaric acid production by fermentation process.

79952695304	An effective and simplified fed-batch strategy for improved 2,3-butanediol production by Klebsiella oxytoca	Substrate concentration in 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) fermentation could not be controlled well in traditional feeding strategies, such as constant, impulse, and exponential feeding strategies. In the present study, fermentative 2,3-BD production by Klebsiella oxytoca was investigated under different batch and fed-batch strategies. The glucose-feedback fed-batch strategy was proved to be not effective for economical 2,3-BD production for the inability of timely feeding, leading that the bacteria reused 2,3-BD as carbon source for cell growth. Based on the phenomena that the byproducing acids caused the pH declining and the requirement of maintaining the pH at a proper level for both cell growth and 2,3-BD accumulation, an improved strategy of pH-stat fed-batch culture with glucose and sodium hydrate fed at the same time was established. Thus, the residual glucose concentration could be controlled through the adjustment of pH automatically. At last, efficient 2,3-BD production was fulfilled under this fed-batch strategy, and the highest 2,3-BD concentration, productivity, and yield were 127.9 g/l, 1.78 g/(l•h), and 0.48 g/g (2,3-BD/glucose), respectively, compared to 98.5 g/l, 1.37 g/(l•h), and 0.43 g/g obtained in glucose-feedback fed-batch strategy. This feeding strategy was simple and easy to operate and could be feasible for industrial 2,3-BD production in the future. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84861481747	Improving arachidonic acid accumulation in Mortierella alpina through B-group vitamin addition	To improve the arachidonic acid (ARA) accumulation in Mortierella alpina, a mixed B-group vitamin addition strategy was developed. The ARA titer reached up to 10.0 g/L, 1.7-fold of the control. At the same time, the highest specific activities of key enzymes involved in ARA biosynthesis, including malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP: citrate lyase, were 63.3, 38.6 and 53.7% higher than the control, respectively. The possible vitamin triggered improved ARA accumulation mechanism was thus elucidated that B-group vitamins could function as the cofactors of the key enzymes involved in ARA biosynthesis, or precursors for the formation of NADPH and acetyl-CoA which were crucial for ARA synthesis, and strengthened the related metabolic flux. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84877728822	Characterization of lignins isolated from alkali treated prehydrolysate of corn stover	Lignins were isolated and purified from alkali treated prehydrolysate of corn stover. The paper presents the structural features of lignins in a series purification processes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-vis spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to analyze the chemical structure. Ther-mogravimetric analysis was applied to follow the thermal degradation, and wet chemical method was used to determine the sugar content. The results showed that the crude lignin from the prehydrolysate of corn stover was a heterogeneous material of syringyl, guaiacyl and p-hydroxyphenyl units, containing associated polysaccharides, lipids, and melted salts. Some of the crude lignin was chemically linked to hemicelluloses (mainly xylan). The lipids in crude lignin were probably composed of saturated and/or unsaturated long carbon chains, fatty acids, triterpenols, waxes, and derivatives of aromatic. The sugar content of purified lignin was less than 2.11%, mainly composed of guaiacyl units. DTGmax of puri-fied lignin was 359 °C. The majority of the hydroxyl groups were phenolic hydroxyl groups. The main type of linkages in purified lignin was β-O-4. Other types of linkages included β-5, β-β and a-O-4. © 2013 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

84877743047	Optimization of enzymatic synthesis of L-ascorbyl palmitate by solvent engineering and statistical experimental designs	Statistical experimental designs combined with solvent engineering for optimization of enzymatic synthesis of L-ascorbyl palmitate were developed. First, the composition of the solvent for co-dissolving polar and apolar substrates was determined. The co-solvent mixture of tert-pentanol: DMSO at a ratio of 9:1 (v/v) and the optimal biocatalyst were obtained. Then, the Plackett-Burman design was implemented to screen the variables that significantly influence the conversion. The method of steepest ascent was used to approach the proximity of optimum. After determining the Plackett-Burman and steepest ascent designs, the optimum values were determined by central composite design under response surface methodology. The statistical analysis showed that the optimum reaction conditions (temperature 50 C, enzyme concentration 5.8 g/L, and substrate molar ratio 11:1, stirring rate 160 rpm, amount of molecular sieve 50 g/L, time 18 h) led to the maximum conversion (66.44%) and production concentration (20.63 g/L). A very satisfactory conversion (64.74%) and production concentration (20.13 g/L) could be achieved in short time (6 h). © 2013 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84877783736	Bioproduction of hydrogen by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cassava starch with 2-deoxyglucose-resistant mutant strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum	Laboratory mutagenesis of microorganisms offers the possibility of relating acquired mutations to improve the quality of microbial cultures. In the present study, a mutant strain, Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 DG-8, with significantly elevated α-amylase activity as well as resistant to the non-metabolizable and toxic glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) was obtained by implanting the low-energy nitrogen ion beam. DG-8 was further developed to produce hydrogen by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) directly form cassava starch in batch fermentation mode, which to our knowledge is at the first attempt in genus Clostridium. Our results demonstrated that the increased activity of α-amylase would be attributed to the hydrogen over-producing. Higher hydrogen yield (3.2 mol/mol glucose) was achieved with the volumetric productivity of 0.41 L/h/L when the initial total sugar concentration of cassava starch rise up to 100 g/L. The present work will help to decrease the cost of hydrogen fermentation process and stimulate its industrial application in the near future. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

84897934298	Screw extrude steam explosion: A promising pretreatment of corn stover to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis	A screw extrude steam explosion (SESE) apparatus was designed and introduced to pretreat corn stover continuously for its following enzymatic hydrolysis. SESE parameters temperature (100, 120, 150. °C) and residence time (1, 2, 3. min) were investigated. The enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover pretreated by SESE and steam explosion (SE) process was carried out and analyzed systematically. A serial of analysis methods were established, and the corn stover before/after the pretreatment were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Thermal Gravity/Derivative Thermal Gravity Analysis (TG/DTG). After treated by SESE pretreatment at the optimum condition (150. °C, 2. min), the pretreated corn stover exhibited highest enzymatic hydrolysis yield (89%), and rare fermentation inhibitors formed. Characterization results indicated that the highest yield could be attributed to the effective removal of lignin/hemicellulose and destruction of cellulose structure by SESE pretreatment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Agitation speed and aeration rate were adjusted from 180 to 40 rpm and from 0.6 to1 vvm, respectively, after 5 days cultivation, to decrease physical damage to the mycelia and to extend the stationary phase. Moreover, 3% (w/v) and 2% (w/v) ethanol were fed after 5 and 7 days cultivation, respectively, to enhance ARA content of total lipid. Eventually, an ARA yield of 19.8 g/l was achieved, which was 1.7 times higher than that of a one-step fed-batch cultivation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Compared with unmodified NaY catalyst, the modified catalysts with lanthanide had better catalytic performance, the optimum modified metal was lanthanum and the optimum content was 2 wt%. The structure characterization results showed that the addition of lanthanum ion had changed catalyst physical performance such as decreased surface acidity density, increased specific surface area, and enlarged pore size. Moreover, lanthanum ion located in specific position (solidate cage) had resulted in special crystal cell distortion, which might affect lactic acid adsorption and reaction path and finally contribute to higher acrylic acid selectivity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

57049171327	Dilute sulfuric acid cycle spray flow-through pretreatment of corn stover for enhancement of sugar recovery	A cycle spray flow-through reactor was designed and used to pretreat corn stover in dilute sulfuric acid medium. The dilute sulfuric acid cycle spray flow-through (DCF) process enhanced xylose sugar yields and cellulose digestibility while increasing the removal of lignin. Within the DCF system, the xylose sugar yields of 90-93% could be achieved for corn stover pretreated with 2% (w/v) dilute sulfuric acid at 95 °C during the optimal reaction time (90 min). The remaining solid residue exhibited enzymatic digestibility of 90-95% with cellulase loading of 60 FPU/g glucan that was due to the effective lignin removal (70-75%) in this process. Compared with flow-through and compress-hot water pretreatment process, the DCF method produces a higher sugar concentration and higher xylose monomer yield. The novel DCF process provides a feasible approach for lignocellulosic material pretreatment. © 2008.

59949092194	Simulation of preparation of acrylic acid from lactic acid dehydration based on BP neural network	Lactic acid (LA) is a commercial fine chemical, used in food and medicine, which is readily available by biomass fermentation. As a chemical feedstock, LA is widely used due to the renewable biomass resources. In this paper, BP neural network was applied to simulating the dehydration reaction of lactic acid. The optimal reaction conditions were determined through orthogonal design that could be used to investigate the interrelated effects of pH, feed liquid flow rate, carrier gas flow rate and temperature on the yield of acrylic acid (AA). With the training samples from experimental data of orthogonal design, a new model that could simulate the process of the dehydrated reaction was established based on BP neural network theory. Then the network system trained was used to anticipate the effects of different ingredients and their interactions on AA yield. The three-dimensional graphs produced by the network could effectively express the relationships between reaction conditions and catalytic activity. Finally, with the help of the network, the highest AA yield of 27.45% was obtained, which was very close to the experimental result with the relative error of -0.4391%.

The results showed that the addition of cycloheximide (15 mg/L) during the acid production stage after 16 h incubation greatly affected the metabolism of Rhizopus oryzae ME-M15. The activity of cytosolic isoenzyme of fumarase was decreased markedly by 48.7%, but the activity of NAD-malate dehydrogenase in the cytosol fraction did not change significantly in the presence of cycloheximide. Fumaric acid production was severely decreased in the presence of cycloheximide with 37.1% in comparison with the control mycelium. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of fumaric acid fermentation, the addition of cycloheximide caused the increase of L-malic acid accumulation to 21.7 g/L, which was 54.6% higher than that of the control. The analyses revealed that the inhibition of fumarase isoenzyme in the cytosol fraction could reduce the metabolic flux from L-malic acid to fumaric acid in the pyruvate carboxylation pathway (cytosolic pathway), promoting the L-malic acid accumulation by Rhizopus oryzae ME-M15.

62749170487	Adsorption and separation of fumaric acid and glucose by basic resin adsorbents	The strong basic resin adsorbent IRA-400 was selected from six basic resins to separate fumaric acid from mixed solution of fumaric acid and glucose. Adsorption behavior of IRA-400 was studied by using static and dynamic adsorption methods, including the fumaric acid and glucose adsorption at different pH and glucose concentrations, static equilibrium adsorption, adsorption kinetics, dynamic adsorption and elution. The results showed that IRA-400 had higher affinity for fumaric acid than glucose at higher glucose concentration. The adsorption data were well correlated with Freundlich isotherm equation with its characteristic parameter n>1. Besides, the adsorption kinetics with IRA-400 was mainly controlled by liquid film diffusion, and it fit well into the Boyd function of liquid film diffusion model. Liquid film diffusion rate coefficient (k') was less than 0.15 min-1 at different pH values. Dynamic adsorption results showed that fumaric acid and glucose were separated effectively when the resin IRA-400 was eluted by deionized water and 1 mol/L NaOH alternatively.

67650220904	Development of an industrial medium for economical 2,3-butanediol production through co-fermentation of glucose and xylose by Klebsiella oxytoca	An industrial medium containing urea as a sole nitrogen source, low levels of corn steep liquor and mineral salts as nutrition factors to retain high 2,3-butanediol production through co-fermentation of glucose and xylose (2:1, wt/wt) by Klebsiella oxytoca was developed. Urea and corn steep liquor were identified as the most significant factors by the two-level Plackett-Burman design. Steepest ascent experiments were applied to approach the optimal region of the two factors and a central composite design was employed to determine their optimal levels. Under the optimal medium, the yield of 2,3-butanediol plus acetoin relative to glucose and xylose was up to 0.428 g/g, which was 85.6% of theoretical value. The cheap nitrogen source and nutrition factors combining the co-fermentation process using lignocellulose derived glucose and xylose as the carbon source in the developed medium would be a potential solution to improve the economics of microbial 2,3-butanediol production.

Cryo Scanning Electron Microscope (CryoSEM) proved the presence of free water in the porous network structures of the swollen hydrogels. Fluorescence microscopy indicated the existence of the immobilized enzyme in the hydrogels. Compared with un-activated hydrogels, activated hydrogels could improve the amount of the immobilization of enzyme, and maximum enzyme loading is about 4.6 mg/g of support for the activated hydrogels. The porous embedding and multi-point covalent linkage between enzyme and hydrogels strengthened the secondary structure stability of enzyme and thus enhanced enzyme stability in the presence of organic solvent and at high temperature. The immobilized enzyme in the activated hydrogel with enhanced structural stability offers great potential as a method to stabilize enzyme for various applications. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In a previous study we found that offspring from guinea pigs with autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss (ASNHL) exhibited signs of SNHL. Here we studied women with autoimmune inner ear diseases (AIED) and their offspring. Our aim was to determine if autoimmune damage may be one of the causes of CSNHL. Methods: Thirty-eight pregnant women with AIED were recruited. Thirty-three had ASNHL; one with autoimmune delayed endolymphatic hydrops (ADEH) and four with autoimmune Meniere's disease (AIMD). The following were assessed in all women: audiogram, auditory brain stem response (ABR), otoacoustic emission (OAE), vestibular function test and presence of inner ear antigens. The following were assessed in offspring from these women: OAE, ABR and presence of inner ear antigens. Results: Five of the 38 children born to women with AIED had SNHL (an incidence much higher than normal). OAEs were not inducible in these children shortly after birth or within 46-100 days after birth. Abnormal ABR findings were apparent in these five children and inner ear antigens were detected in three of the five children (the mother's of these children were also positive for inner ear antigens). Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that the prevalence of congenital ASNHL may be increased in offspring born to women with AIED. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

73149104164	Efficient 1,3-propanediol production by fed-batch culture of klebsiella pneumoniae: The role of pH fluctuation	The fermentative production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) by Klebsiella pneumoniae under different fed-batch strategies was investigated. pH-stat fed-batch strategies proved to be not effective for economical 1,3-PD production for the existence of relatively high concentration of byproducts and residual glycerol at the end of the fermentation. However, in the pH-stat fed-batch strategy, an important phenomenon was observed that the yields of two main byproducts, 2,3-butanediol and lactic acid, were closely related to pH value. The dominant byproduct was 2,3-butanediol at a pH value of 5.0 to 6.5 but changed to be lactic acid at a pH value of 7.1 to 8.0. Based on the analysis of the phenomenon, a self-protection mechanism in K. pneumoniae, namely that the growing K. pneumoniae cells switch the metabolic pathways responding to environmental pH changes, was proposed. Thus a kind of feeding strategy was further applied during which the pH value was fluctuated between 6.3 and 7.3 periodically by feeding glycerol-ammonia mixture and sulphuric acid to make the metabolic pathways of 2,3-butanediol and lactic acid sub-active under the periodical low or high pH stress. At last, efficient 1,3-PD production was fulfilled under this fed-batch strategy, and the best results were achieved leading to 70 g/l 1,3-PD with a yield of 0.70 mol/mol glycerol and productivity of 0.97 g/l/h, while the two main byproducts and residual glycerol were under low concentrations.

The sphere and network CdTe NCPs were obtained at pH 4.7 for growing 15 h and 79 h respectively. As the NCPs ceased growing over pH 8 immediately, we can conveniently control their size and morphology by adjusting pH of the solution to tune the growth time. The morphology change of CdTe-PAMAM nanocomposites was characterized by TEM images. The fluorescent intensity and photostability of ordered-CdTe-PAMAM have been improved significantly. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experimental results demonstrated the lanthanum-phosphorous modified HZSM-5 offered the outstanding catalytic performance and the enhanced anti-coking ability markedly, especially for 0.5%La-2%PHZSM-5. Characterizations revealed that the improved catalytic performance and the excellent anti-coking ability of lanthanum-phosphorous modified HZSM-5 could be attributed to the harmonious acid sites and pore structure by the modification with lanthanum and phosphorous. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

76849116670	Engineering Klebsiella oxytoca for efficient 2, 3-butanediol production through insertional inactivation of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene	Ethanol was a major byproduct of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) fermentation by Klebsiella oxytoca ME-UD-3. In order to achieve a high efficiency of 2,3-BD production, K. oxytoca mutants deficient in ethanol formation were successfully constructed by replace the aldA gene coding for aldehyde dehydrogenase with a tetracycline resistance cassette. The results suggested that inactivation of aldA led to a significantly improved 2,3-BD production. The carbon flux to 2,3-BD was enhanced by eliminating the byproducing ethanol and at the same time reducing the accumulation of another byproduct acetoin. At last, by fed-batch culturing of the mutant, the final 2,3-BD titer up to 130 g/l with the productivity of 1.63 g/l.h and the 2,3-BD yield relative to glucose of 0.48 g/g was obtained. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

In this study, a novel twostage oxygen supply control strategy was applied to enhance oxygen transfer and promote the ability of arachidonic acid production by Mortierella alpina ME-1. Based on process analysis, a two-stage oxygen supply control strategy was proposed in arachidonic acid production in which n-hexadecane was added as an oxygen vector with a final concentration of 4 % at the first of cultivation, the agitation speed was controlled at 180 rpm in the first 96 h, and then switched to 100 rpm. This strategy was experimentally proven to be successful in arachidonic acid fermentation, relatively high arachidonic acid production (15.9 g/L) and dry cell weight (42.5 g/L) was achieved by applying this strategy. The arachidonic acid productivity (2.27 g/L/d) was also successfully improved by 50.3% and 28.9%, respectively, compared with fermentations in which agitation speed was kept constant at 180 rpm and under a two-stage agitation speed control strategy. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

77951539796	Production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid by recombinant Klebsiella pneumoniae based on aeration and ORP controlled strategy	A biosynthetic pathway for the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) from glycerol was established in recombinant Klebsiella pneumoniae by introducing the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene from Escherichia coli. The activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase, which oxidized 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) to 3-HP, was detected and 3-HP was produced by the recombinant strains. Three different oxygen supply strategies, associated with measuring the oxidoreduction potential (ORP) during the fermentation under these conditions, were adopted for higher production of 3-HP by the recombinant cells. About 0.8 g/l 3-HP and more 1,3-propanediol production by the recombinant Klebsiella pneumoniae were obtained under completely aerobic conditions. Under micro-aerobic conditions, 3-HP production could be increased to 2.2 g/l and 1,3-propanediol production was almost the same as in the original strain. Under the anaerobic conditions, 1,3-propanediol was the main product and about 1.3 g/l 3-HP was produced. Finally, 3-HP production of the recombinant strain was increased to 2.8 g/l under micro-aerobic condition with a further two-stage ORP controlled strategy. © 2009 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea.

77951091096	Two-stage utilization of corn straw by Rhizopus oryzae for fumaric acid production	Due to the abundant, low price characteristic, lots of efforts have been put into producing bulk chemical from lignocellulose biomass, but the low utility of xylose, which is the second main component in lignocellulose, becomes a bottleneck for efficient lignocellulose utilization. This study investigated a novel two-stage corn straw utilization strategy for fumaric acid production by Rhizopus oryzae. Fungal growth was approached in hydrolysates from acid hydrolysis of corn straw, contained 30 g/l xylose; and fumaric acid production was occurred in hydrolysates from enzymatic hydrolysis of the residue corn straw after acid hydrolysis, contained 80 g/l glucose. Under the optimal condition using this two-stage corn straw utilization strategy, the fumaric acid production, was up to 27.79 g/l, with the yield of 0.35 g/g, productivity of 0.33 g/l/h. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase of the mutant was higher than the parent strain, which indicated that the hexose monophosphate pathway of the mutant was strengthened, and more NADPH was thus produced. Also, the activities of malic enzyme and ATP-citrate lyase in the cell extract of the mutant were higher than the parent strain, which indicated that the screening method increased NADPH and acetyl-CoA supply in vivo effectively. Finally, in the batch culturing of the mutant, 34.84% higher lipid was accumulated with the cell dry weight at the same level compared with the parent strain. Moreover, the DHA percentage of the total fatty acids up to 56.22% was achieved using the mutant, which was 38.88% higher than the parent strain. When the cultures were maintained under appropriate conditions, the final DHA yield was 0.20 and 0.11 g/g dry biomass, for the mutant and parent, respectively. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77955927772	Enhancement of fumaric acid production by Rhizopus oryzae using a two-stage dissolved oxygen control strategy	Batch fermentative production of fumaric acid by Rhizopus oryzae ME-F12 was investigated in a 7-l stirred tank fermentor under different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. High fumaric acid yield on glucose (0.56 g/g) was achieved under high DO concentration (80%), but the glucose consumption rate and fumaric acid productivity were rather low (0.91 and 0.51 g/l/h). Fumaric acid productivity was enhanced under low DO concentration (30%), but the fuamric acid yield on glucose decreased to 0.52 g/g. In order to achieve the high fumaric acid yield and productivity simultaneously, a two-stage dissolved oxygen control strategy was proposed, in which the DO concentration was controlled at 80% in the first 18 h and then switched to 30%. This was experimentally proven to be successful. Relatively high fumaric acid production (56.2 g/l), high fumaric acid yield on glucose (0.54 g/g), and high glucose consumption rate (1.3 g/l/h) were achieved by applying this strategy. The productivity (0.7 g/l/h) was improved by 37%, 21%, and 9%, respectively, compared with fermentations in which DO concentrations were kept constant at 80%, 60%, and 30%. © 2009 Humana Press.

The effect of aeration on the performance of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) production by Schizochytrium sp. was investigated in a 1,500-L bioreactor using fed-batch fermentation. Six parameters, including specific growth rate, specific glucose consumption rate, specific lipid accumulation rate, cell yield coefficient, lipid yield coefficient, and DHA yield coefficient, were used to understand the relationship between aeration and the fermentation characteristics. Based on the information obtained from the parameters, a stepwise aeration control strategy was proposed. The aeration rate was controlled at 0.4 volume of air per volume of liquid per minute (vvm) for the first 24 h, then shifted to 0.6 vvm until 96 h, and then switched back to 0.4 vvm until the end of the fermentation. High cell density (71 g/L), high lipid content (35.75 g/L), and high DHA percentage (48.95%) were achieved by using this strategy, and DHA productivity reached 119 mg/L h, which was 11.21% over the best results obtained by constant aeration rate. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

The influence of fusel, main byproducts in the fermentation process of bio-ethanol production, on the bio-ethanol dehydration should not be ignored. We studied the catalytic dehydration of bio-ethanol to ethylene over parent and modified HZSM-5 at 250°C, with weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) equal to 2.0/h.

The effects of primary degradation products such as individual sugars (xylose, glucose, mannose, arabinose and galactose) and major inhibitors (furfural, acetate and formate) on the Klebsiella pneumoiae growth and 1,3-PD production were investigated in this study. Xylose and mannose could efficiently promote the 1,3-PD production and cell growth. Furfural (0.28. g/l) and sodium acetate (1.46. g/l) in low concentration were not inhibitory to Klebsiella pneumoniae, rather they have stimulatory effect on the growth and 1,3-PD biosynthesis, especially the acetate.

Protein cross-linking was evidenced in the SDS-PAGE graph. The emulsifying properties of SC depended on the cross-linked time with MTGase. The emulsifying activity and stability indexes of SC increased with the cross-linking time of 30 to 90 min (P30 to P90), and then declined with longer cross-linked time of 180 to 420 min (P180 to P420). The P30 to P90 as wall material for microencapsulation was superior to P180 to P420 and control sample. The microcapsules prepared with P30 to P90 showed more than 97% of microencapsulation efficiency in contrast to about 90% with the P180 to P420. During storage, the microcapsules prepared with P30 to P90 exhibited higher oxidative stability as compared with other microcapsules. A sustained release of microalgal oil was observed, and core release was time dependent and affected by cross-linking degree. Results showed that the powdered microalgal oil prepared with P30 to P90 demonstrated enhanced physicochemical properties and oxidative stability.Practical Application: The novel method using cross-linked proteins as wall material induced by microbial transglutaminase in food industry for sensitive ingredients could convert microcapsules into a stable form, which would lead to its more widespread utilization as a kind of food additive. © 2010 Institute of Food Technologists

79952508559	Elimination of carbon catabolite repression in Klebsiella oxytoca for efficient 2,3-butanediol production from glucose-xylose mixtures	Microbial preference for glucose implies incomplete and/or slow utilization of lignocellulose hydrolysates, which is caused by the regulatory mechanism named carbon catabolite repression (CCR). In this study, a 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) producing Klebsiella oxytoca strain was engineered to eliminate glucose repression of xylose utilization. The crp(in) gene, encoding the mutant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein CRP(in), which does not require cAMP for functioning, was characterized and overexpressed in K. oxytoca. The engineered recombinant could utilize a mixture of glucose and xylose simultaneously, without CCR. The profiles of sugar consumption and 2,3-BD production by the engineered recombinant, in glucose and xylose mixtures, were examined and showed that glucose and xylose could be consumed simultaneously to produce 2,3-BD. This study offers a metabolic engineering strategy to achieve highly efficient utilization of sugar mixtures derived from the lignocellulosic biomass for the production of bio-based chemicals using enteric bacteria. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

Effects of different nitrogen sources on cell growth, fatty acid composition, arachidonic acid (ARA), and total lipid concentration were also evaluated. It revealed that the maximum nitrogen source uptake ratio was obtained when corn steep liquor was used as nitrogen source. When yeast extract was used as the sole nitrogen source, glucose was completely exhausted at the end of fermentation. The maximum dry cell weight obtained from medium with yeast extract as nitrogen source had the highest total lipid concentration. Sodium nitrate was the favorable nitrogen source for ARA accumulation, and the highest ARA percentage in total fatty acids was obtained, 35.9%. Urea was identified as the favorable nitrogen source for ARA production, the highest ARA concentration obtained from urea was 5.8 g/l.

Simple, fast and accurate quantification of byproducts in lignocellulosic hydrolysates is critical to optimize the pretreatment procedures, but still a challenge. In this paper, a new GC-MS (SIM) method based on a Deans switch has been developed for the determination of byproducts in a corn stover hydrolysate. The Deans switch was incorporated into a hardware system that facilitated the direct aqueous injection (DAI) on GC-MS system. Simultaneous chromatographic separation and quantification of 18 byproducts including four aliphatic acids, five furan derivatives, four phenolic compounds and five others were achieved within 45. min. The detection limits of the presented method for various byproducts were in the range of 0.007-0.832. mg/L. The within-day and between-day precisions of the method were less than 6.0% (RSD, n= 6). The accuracy of the method was confirmed with recoveries of 86-128%.

The effects of various cross-linking parameters including hardening time, temperature, pH and TG concentration on the oil release rate of the complex coacervation microcapsules (CCMs) were investigated, with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as release medium. The optimum parameters were as follows: hardening for 6. h at 15 °C and pH 6.0 with TG concentration of 15. U/g gelatin. The microcapsules obtained under optimum conditions had the lowest oil release rate. By analyzing the oil release curves, it was found that the oil release rate did not exactly fit the modified first-order kinetic model but exhibited early time and late time approximations for unsteady state diffusion. A greater initial release of oil was clearly observed whatever cross-linking parameters were, while the release profile became constant indicating some sustained release after the first hour. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By combining a fibrous-bed bioreactor, we successfully developed a simple and valuable adaptive evolution strategy in repeated-batch fermentation mode with high initial substrate concentration and evolved Clostridium tyrobutyricum mutant with significantly improved butyric acid volumetric productivity up to 2.25g/(Lh), which is the highest value in batch fermentation reported so far. Further experiments were conducted to pay attention to glucose transport system in consideration of the high glucose consumption rate resulted from evolution. Complete characterization and comparison of the glucose phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) were carried out in the form of toluene-treated cells and cell-free extracts derived from both C. tyrobutyricum wide-type and mutant, while an alternative glucose transport route that requires glucokinase was confirmed by the phenomena of resistance to the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose and ATP-dependent glucose phosphorylation. Our results suggest that C. tyrobutyricum mutant is defective in PTS activity and compensates for this defect with enhanced glucokinase activity, resulting in the efficient uptake and consumption of glucose during the whole metabolism. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It was found that carboxyl functionalized ionic liquid modification of the support surface was an effective method to improve the properties of immobilized PPL. Incorporating into the functionalized SBA-15 made PPL more resistant to temperature and pH changes, compared with PPL immobilized on parent SBA-15 (PPL-SBA). Especially, after the covalent attachment to a functionalized support, the stability of PPL was improved obviously, which retained 81.25% and 52.50% of the original activity after incubation for 20. days and four times recycling, respectively, whereas PPL-SBA exhibited only 58.80% and 27.78% of the original activity under the same conditions. In addition, physical and chemical properties of the supports and immobilized PPL were characterized by small-angle X-ray powder diffraction (SAXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), nitrogen adsorption, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and thermogravimetry (TG). The images and data confirmed chemical modification in SBA-15 and PPL immobilization on the tested support. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84870016190	Efficient dehydration of bio-based 2,3-butanediol to butanone over boric acid modified HZSM-5 zeolites	The dehydration of bio-based 2,3-butanediol provides an alternative green way to produce butanone, which is mainly produced through the dehydrogenation of butanol in industry. In this research, the effect of the framework Si/Al ratio on 2,3-butanediol dehydration over HZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al = 38-360) was investigated. HZSM-5(360) was further modified with boric acid, and the influence of the loading amount of boric acid on the dehydration performance was studied. The results showed that high Si/Al ratio was beneficial to low-temperature activation of 2,3-butanediol and the methyl migration to 2-methyl propanal. 1.0%B/HZSM-5(360) not only showed best performance at 180°C but also kept stable activities between 180-300°C with a high LHSV 2.4 h

84871438847	Two-stage oxygen supply strategy for enhanced lipase production by Bacillus subtilis based on metabolic flux analysis	Lipase production by Bacillus subtilis CICC20034 was assessed by metabolic flux distribution analysis. Lipase production was tested under various oxygen supply conditions in a synthetic medium to obtain the optimal oxygen supply profile. Based on the metabolic flux analysis, a two-stage oxygen supply strategy (TOS) that maintained high oxygen supply conditions during early fermentation phase, and then step-wisely reduced aeration to keep a stable, smooth, and adequate changing dissolved oxygen (DO) level profile throughout the production phases was carried out. With the proposed control strategy, the final lipase activity in batch fermentation significantly increased and reached a high level at 0.56. U/ml, corresponding to a 51% increase. The relevant metabolic flux analysis verified the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. By applying TOS in composite medium, the final lipase activity reached 5.0. U/ml. © 2012.

By the addition of HH, the 1, 3-PDO mass concentration, glycerol conversion and productivity increased by 18.2%, 24.4% and 18.0% higher than those from glycerol alone, respectively. Xylose and mannose in HH enhanced the biomass and fermentation effi ciency, glucose inhibited the 1, 3-PDO synthesis, and galactose and arabinose have no effect on the fermentation. By the addition of 0.28 g/L furfural, the biomass increased by 12% higher than that without any inhibitors; by the addition of 0.61 g/L formate, the cell growth and 1, 3-PDO production decreased 9.8% and 1.1% respectively; by the addition of 1.46 g/L acetate, the 1, 3-PDO mass concentration increased from 8.77 g/L to 11.73 g/L. With the addition of HH in fed-batch fermentation, the 1, 3-PDO mass concentration, glycerol conversion and productivity increased to 71.58 g/L, 65% and 1.93 g/(L · h), which were 17.8%, 25.0% and 17.7% higher than those from glycerol alone respectively.

The electrospinnability of SR at three time windows was evaluated and the electrospinning process was optimized accordingly. A positive correlation was found between the fibrous morphology and the SR/PVP speed ratios. As the speed ratio increased, the composite fiber showed larger diameter and wider diameter distribution. For the fibers prepared at PVP/SR speed ratios of 1.7/2.5 and 3.5/2.5 (mL/h), the fibrous structure remained intact after immersion in water for 8 h. The pure SR microfiber could be made from the composite after immersion in water, which can be potentially used as stretchable and selectively permeable membranes for chemical protective applications and in plastics toughening.

The material functionalized by amino acid ionic liquid (AA-SBA) as a novel carrier was used to immobilize porcine pancreas lipase (PPL) through ionic bonding interaction and cross-linking method (PPL-AA-SBA). To investigate the stability changes of the lipase immobilized onto novel carrier AA-SBA via special methods, the enzymatic properties of PPL-AA-SBA were studied in the triacetin hydrolysis reaction. The results indicated that the immobilization efficiency of PPL was up to 98% and the stability of lipase immobilized onto AA-SBA was dramatically improved. Especially the leaching investigation in consecutive use showed that special immobilization method inhibited the enzyme leaching obviously, and immobilization efficiency was above 96% after five recycles. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

However, few algae found in nature have demonstrated the combination of high biomass accumulation rate, robust oil yield and tolerance to environmental stresses, all complex traits that a large-scale, economically competitive production scheme demands. Therefore, untangling the intricate sub-cellular networks underlying these complex traits, in one or a series of carefully selected algal research models, has become an urgent research mission, which can take advantage of the emerging model oleaginous microalgae that have already demonstrated small, simple and tackleable genomes and the potential for large-scale open-pond cultivation.

Oil by open column chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC	Column chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC using a Sepax BR-C18 column were applied for the analysis of glycerides in the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) oil by Schizochytrium sp. The oil was detected under UV light after isocratic elution with 20 % 2-propanol/hexane (5:4, v/v) + 80 % acetonitrile. The correlation coefficients for the calibration of HPLC for DHA glycerides were in the range of 0.9958-0.9998. The accuracy was confirmed with recoveries of 93.47-102.25 %. DHA oil samples under different aeration rates were successfully analyzed and the content of the binding of DHA on the acylglycerol backbone was very low (1.81-4.21 %). However, the content of glycerides (tri-, di-, mono-) separated by column chromatography was more than 87.22 %. The glycerides were largely composed of triacylglycerides (TAG) (82.29-89.54 %), where higher content of TAG correlated to higher contents of DHA and TAG of DHA (TriDHA).

84882793166	Synthesis of vitamin E succinate from Candida rugosa lipase in organic medium	A screening of commercially available lipases for the synthesis of vitamin E succinate showed that lipase from Candida rugosa presented the highest yield. The synthesis of vitamin E succinate in organic solvents with different lgP values ranging from -1.3 to 3.5 was investigated. Of particular interest was that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with the lowest lgP exhibited the highest yield among all the organic solvents used. It suggests that lgP is incapable of satisfactorily predicting the biocompatibility of organic solvents due to the complexity of enzymatic reaction with hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates in organic solvent. Effects of different operating conditions, such as molar ratio of substrate, enzyme concentration, reaction temperature, mass transfer, and reaction time were also studied. Under the optimum conditions of 10 g/L enzyme, a stirring rate of 100 r/min, a substrate molar ratio of 5:1 at 55 °C for 18 h, a satisfactory yield(46.95%) was obtained. The developed method has a potential to be used for efficient enzymatic production of vitamin E succinate. © 2013 Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

84885191834	Adsorptive removal of methyl orange and methylene blue from aqueous solution with finger-citron-residue-based activated carbon	Activated carbon derived from finger citron residue (FAC) was tested as a new type of adsorbent for the removal of harmful dyes, namely, the anionic dye methyl orange (MO) and the cationic dye methylene blue (MB), from contaminated water. Liquid-phase adsorption experiments were conducted, and the maximum adsorption capacity was determined. Various conditions were evaluated, including initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, contact time, solution pH, and temperature. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were used to describe the equilibrium isotherm and to calculate the isotherm constants. It was found that the adsorption capacity of FAC is much higher than those of other types of activated carbons. Maximum equilibrium adsorption capacities of 934.58 and 581.40 mg/g for MO and MB, respectively, were achieved. Three simplified kinetic models, namely, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion equations, were used to investigate the adsorption process. The pseudo-second-order equation was followed for the adsorption of MO and MB on FAC. The temperature-dependent adsorption behaviors of MO and MB indicated that the adsorption is a spontaneous and endothermic process accompanying an entropy increases (the driving force for adsorption). This work demonstrates that FAC could be employed as a low-cost alternative to commercially available activated carbons in the removal of dyes from wastewater. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

In this work, metabolic profiling of R. oryzae for fumaric acid production by fermentation using ammonia as a neutralizing agent was carried out by HPLC. Principle component analysis was employed to classify HPLC data of R. oryzae fermentation. The variations of intracellular metabolites, i.e., cAMP, ATP, NADH and alanine were measured by HPLC. The results showed fumaric acid production by fermentation with R. oryzae using ammonia as a neutralizing agent can be divided into two phases: the former fermentation phase and the latter fermentation phase. ATP, NADH, cAMP and alanine were the biomarkers. ATP, NADH, cAMP positively correlated to fumaric acid yield, whereas alanine had negative correlation to fumaric acid yield.

The PBA-AuNPs hybrid system proposed here exhibits ordered photochemistry behaviors upon the addition of glucose at different pH values. There are two linear regions of glucose concentration for the glucose sensor at different pH values, i.e., between 0.1 mmol/L and 9.8 mmol/L at pH 6 with the detection limit of 64 μmol/L and between 0 and 6.5 mmol/L with the detection limit of 48 μmol/L at pH 9, respectively.

The mixing principle was based on gravity and free fall employed with tank-rotating. The liquefaction performances using the HRR and the vertical stirred-tank reactor (VSTR) with a helical impeller were compared and analyzed by measuring rheological properties of the slurry. During the enzymatic hydrolysis, viscosity decreased dramatically in the initial phase for both bioreactors and more pronouncedly for the HRR. Rheological parameters fitted to the power law showed that shear thinning properties of the slurry weakened during the reaction. The glucose concentration was used to define the efficiency of the saccharification reaction. The HRR also proved to be more efficient for glucose release with both the constant and fed-batch substrate addition modes. Liquefaction and saccharification at 25 % w/w dry matter (DM) and enzyme loading of 7 FPU/g DM resulted in the optimal glucose concentration of 86 g/kg. Results revealed a decrease in cellulose conversion at increasing initial DM, which was slighter in the HRR compared with that in the VSTR. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

A pervaporation process was integrated with lignocellulosic fermentation to concentrate bioethanol using bare PDMS membranes. Results showed that yeasts, solid particles, and salts increased ethanol flux and selectivity through the membranes (PDMS with/without silicalite-1), whereas glucose exerted negative effects on the performance. On bare PDMS membrane, the performance was not obviously affected by the existence of aliphatic acids. However, on PDMS-silicalite-1 membrane, a remarkable decrease in ethanol selectivity and a rapid growth of total flux in the presence of aliphatic acids were observed. These phenomena were due to the interaction of acids with silanol (Si-OH) groups to break the dense membrane surface. On the PDMS membranes with/without silicalite-1, degradation products of lignocellulosic hydrolysates such as furfural and hydroxyacetone slightly influenced separation performance. These results revealed that an integrated process can effectively eliminate product inhibition, improve ethanol productivity, and enhance the glucose conversion rate. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Single cell oils (SCOs), a complex lipid system, contains neutral lipids (NLs), polar lipids (PLs) and unsaponifiable matters (UMs). To investigate the dynamic changes and the metabolic competition mechanism of different components of SCOs, changes in lipid composition of Schizochytrium sp. were monitored in lipid accumulation and turnover stages. Lipid content could reach 69.98% in biomass during the lipid accumulation stage, while, after the exhaustion of glucose, the content decreased to 45.51% and 20.6. g/L non-oil biomass was synthesis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were easier to bind with PLs. NLs were preferentially converted to PLs during lipid turnover stage, accompanied by the degradation of saturated fatty acids and the increase of UMs. Meanwhile, a positive correlation between the synthesis of PUFAs and unsaponifiable matters exited in Schizochytrium sp., and increasing the content of UMs from 45 to 100. mg/L could increase the PUFA percentage from 64% to 74% effectively. © 2014.

To overcome this, we developed a high-throughput screening method for surfactin producing mutants by applying polydiacetylene (PDA) vesicles as sensors with visible chromatic change from blue to red, detected as colorimetric response (CR%) signal, which can even semi-quantify the yields of surfactin. Bacillus subtilis 723 was used as parent strain and multiply mutated with atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP).

The process at different stages by changing the components of medium was investigated. In the first stage, mycelia were inoculated in a nutrient-rich medium for rapid propagation. In the second stage, mycelia were collected and then cultivated in glucose solution to achieve high cellular lipid contents. In the third stage, mycelia were cultured in a glucose-absent medium to obtain rapid ARA accumulation. Using this fermentation strategy, high dry cell weight, lipid, and ARA concentration reached 41.6, 26.6, and 11.4 g/L, respectively. The results demonstrated that mycelia propagation, lipid biosynthesis, and ARA accumulation process can be significantly spatially separated, allowing further optimization to improve the efficiency of each stage. This was the first report of using a three-stage fermentation strategy for ARA-rich oil production, and it could be applied to other similar oleaginous microorganisms to obtain high related polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

84901662995	Alternative respiration and fumaric acid production of Rhizopus oryzae	Under the conditions of fumaric acid fermentation, Rhizopus oryzae ME-F14 possessed at least two respiratory systems. The respiration of mycelia was partially inhibited by the cytochrome respiration inhibitor antimycin A or the alternative respiration inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid and was completely inhibited in the presence of both antimycin A and salicylhydroxamic acid. During fumaric acid fermentation process, the activity of alternative respiration had a great correlation with fumaric acid productivity; both of them reached peak at the same time. The alternative oxidase gene, which encoded the mitochondrial alternative oxidase responsible for alternative respiration in R. oryzae ME-F14, was cloned and characterized in Escherichia coli. The activity of alternative respiration, the alternative oxidase gene transcription level, as well as the fumaric acid titer were measured under different carbon sources and different carbon-nitrogen ratios. The activity of alternative respiration was found to be comparable to the transcription level of the alternative oxidase gene and the fumaric acid titer. These results indicated that the activity of the alternative oxidase was regulated at the transcription stage under the conditions tested for R. oryzae ME-F14. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

An immobilized Lipase B from Candida Antarctica (Novozym 435) was found to be an efficient biocatalyst for the enantioselective alcoholysis of 3-FGA. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and methanol were chosen as the suitable reaction medium and acyl acceptor, respectively. The optimum reaction temperature, molar ratio of methanol to 3-FGA and 3-FGA concentration were 25°C, 2:1 and 100 mM, respectively. Under these conditions, complete conversion was achieved and methyl (S)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)glutarate ((S)-MFG) was obtained in a moderate ee value of 80%. Furthermore, the reaction was performed on a gram scale and the ee value of (S)-MFG was enriched to 96% after treatment with a toluene/hexane (2/1, v/v) mixture. © 2014 The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag.

84905650703	Regulation of docosahexaenoic acid production by Schizochytrium sp.: Effect of nitrogen addition	Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) percentage in total fatty acids (TFAs) is an important index in DHA microbial production. In this study, the change of DHA percentage in response to fermentation stages and the strategies to increase DHA percentage were investigated. Two kinds of conventional nitrogen sources, monosodium glutamate (MSG) and ammonium sulfate (AS), were tested to regulate DHA synthesis. Results showed that MSG addition could accelerate the substrate consumption rate but inhibit lipid accumulation, while AS addition could increase DHA percentage in TFAs effectively but extend fermentation period slightly. Finally, the AS addition strategy was successfully applied in 7,000-L fermentor and DHA percentage in TFAs and DHA yield reached 46.06% and 18.48 g/L, which was 19.54 and 17.41% higher than that of no-addition strategy. This would provide guidance for the large-scale production of the other similar polyunsaturated fatty acid, and give insight into the nitrogen metabolism in oil-producing microorganisms. © Springer-Verlag 2013.

84905699054	Arachidonic acid-rich oil production by Mortierella alpina with different gas distributors	Arachidonic acid (ARA)-rich oil production by Mortierella alpina is a high oxygen demand and shear-sensitive process. In the aerobic fermentation process, oxygen supply is usually a limiting factor owing to the low solubility of oxygen in the fermentation broth. Two kinds of perforated ring gas distributors and a novel microporous ceramic membrane gas distributor were designed and applied to improve oxygen supply. With the decrease of the orifice diameter of perforated ring gas distributors, dry cell weight (DCW), lipids concentration, and ARA content in total fatty acid increased from 17.86 g/L, 7.08 g/L, and 28.08% to 25.67 g/L, 11.94 g/L, and 36.99%, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of different dissolved oxygen (DO) on ARA-rich oil production with membrane gas distributor was also studied. The maximum DCW, lipid concentration, and ARA content using membrane gas distributor with DO controlled at 40% reached 29.67 g/L, 16.74 g/L, and 49.53%, respectively. The ARA titer increased from 1.99 to 8.29 g/L using the membrane gas distributor to substitute the perforated ring gas distributor. In the further experiment, a novel tubular titanium metal membrane gas distributor was successfully applied in a 7,000 L bioreactor and the results demonstrated that membrane gas distributor was industrially practical. © Springer-Verlag 2013.

84906494590	Efficient arachidonic acid-rich oil production by Mortierella alpina through a repeated fed-batch fermentation strategy	Arachidonic acid (ARA)-rich oil production by Mortierella alpina is a long fermentation period needed process due to the low growth rate of the filamentous fungus used. This causes the low productivity of ARA-rich oil and hinders its industrial mass scale production. In the present study, different fed-batch strategies were conducted to shorten the fermentation period. The result showed that compared with the batch culture, the fermentation period was shortened from 7. days to 5. days with the productivity of ARA-rich oil increased from 0.9. g/(L·d) to 1.3. g/(L·d) by using the fed-batch fermentation strategy. Furthermore, repeated fed-batch fermentation strategy was adopted to achieve the purpose of continuous production. By using this strategy, the fermentation period was shortened from 40. days to 26. days in a four cycle repeated fed-batch fermentation. This strategy proved to be convenient and economical for ARA-rich oil commercial production process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
