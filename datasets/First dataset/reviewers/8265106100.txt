84940338668	Different concentrations of icariin for bone defect repair: Disputes and exploration	Background: As one of the main active ingredients in epimedium, icariin plays an important role in bone defect repair. Sustained and effective concentration of icariin in vivo is essential for bone damage repair. Objective: To recommend the research progress of epimedium glycoside for bone repair and to explore the pharmaco-active concentration of icariin. Methods: A computer-based online search of CNKI database (http://www.cnki.net/) and PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed) from January 2000 to October 2013 was performed for related articles of the effect of icariin for bone defect repair and bone damage repair. The key words were "icariin, concentration, bone" in Chinese and English. After repeated articles were excluded, 76 related articles were screened out and 44 of them met the inclusive criteria. Results And Conclusion: The icariin-released scaffold materials can induce the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, promote the viability of osteoblasts and inhibit the resorption of osteoclasts, thus repairing bone tissue. It is certain that icariin promotes cellular differentiation, however whether it can promote cellular proliferation remains unclear. The pharmaco-active concentration of icariin ranges from10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L, but clinical trial has not yet been carried out, and specific drug concentration is uncertain, which needs further exploration.

84940309018	Telomere-associated factor expression in replicative senescence of human embryonic lung fibroblasts	BACKGROUND: Telomere-associated proteins will directly affect the function of telomeres, adjust the length of telomeric DNA, which are closely related with cell senescence and carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To find the key regulatory molecules in the cell senescence process through observing the telomere-associated factor expression in normal cell replicative senescence process. METHODS: Based on established cell replicative senescence model, reverse transcription-PCR and western blot were used to detect the telomere-associated factor expression on the molecular and protein levels, including the telomere-associated factor human telomere binding protein 1, tankyrase 1, telomerase RNA, telomere protection protein 1 and P53 expressions in the human embryonic lung fibroblast replicative senescence. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results showed that with the cell senescence, transcription of human telomere binding protein 1 did not changed, while the protein expression of human telomere binding protein 1 was increased gradually and then decreased rapidly; mRNA and protein expressions of telomere protection protein 1 did not changed; with the human embryonic lung fibroblast replicative senescence, expression of telomere protection protein 1 was decreased gradually; with cell senescence, telomerase RNA component showed an increasing trend; protein expression of P53 did not changed. Human telomere binding protein 1, telomere protection protein 1 and telomerase RNA play an important role in cell senescence.

15044363784	Diagnosis of human cytomegalovirus intrauterine infection using fetal cells from maternal blood	Objective: The sensitivity and specificity for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of human cytomegalovirus intrauterine infection were estimated by using isolating single fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood. Methods: Micromanipulation techniques were employed to isolate single fetal nucleated erythroblasts from 273 maternal blood samples. SRY gene and HCMV-DNA in single fetal cells were detected by multiple primed in situ labeling (PRINS) from 76 HCMV-DNA positive samples of maternal peripheral blood. 273 samples of maternal peripheral blood were tested for SRY gene and HCMV-DNA in single fetal cells by primed extension preamplification (PEP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The detection rate of fetal cells from maternal blood was 100% with micromanipulation techniques. The sensitivity of PRINS for SRY gene detection was 97.56% and its specificity was 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of PEP and PCR for SRY gene detection were 97.39% and 99.17%, respectively. The sensitivity of PRINS for HCMV-DNA detection was 92.68% and the specificity was 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of PEP and PCR for HCMV-DNA detection were 95.12%and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: The technique for noninvasive prenatal detection of intrauterine infection of HCMV using single fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood by using PRINS and PEP and PCR is more reliable than the CMV-DNA detection in peripheral maternal blood, amniocentesis or percutaneous umbilical blood sampling. © 2005 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

1842529097	Fetal origin of single nucleated erythroblasts and free DNA in the peripheral blood of pregnant women	Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of using single fetal nucleated erythroblasts (FNRBCs) and free DNA in maternal blood for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Methods: Single FNRBCs were isolated from 51 of 116 samples of maternal blood analyzed by micromanipulation after density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to amplify the SRY gene of single FNRBCs. Primer extension pre-amplification and nested PCR were used to amplify the SRY gene of the plasma DNA extracted from 65 samples of maternal blood. Results: The detection rate of single FNRBCs was 90.20% (46/51). The concordance rates between real fetal sex and sex determined by amplification of the SRY gene from single cells and from free DNA analysis were 82.61% (38/46) and 90.77% (59/65), respectively. Conclusions: Single nucleated erythroblasts and free DNA in maternal blood are of fetal origin and can be valuable fetal material sources for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. © 2003 International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics.

20444470284	Curative efficacy of conductive education combined with massage on the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy	Aim: To study the effect of conductive education, which is also called Petö method's combined with the Chinese medical massage in ameliorating the rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: Totally 119 children with CP, aged 3 to14 years old, were involved in the study, 58 CP children were trained only with conductive education, while the other 61 cases were treated with conductive education combined with the Chinese medical massage, and the results after 1-year follow-up were compared and studied. Results: There were significant differences in the effective rate between the simple conductive education group (67%) and comprehensive treatment group (85%) (P < 0.05). No significant difference in the ratio of development quotient (DQ) to intelligence quotient (IQ) was observed between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The conductive education combined with Chinese medical massage can improve the effect of rehabilitation of children with CP more significantly than simple conductive education, but it has insignificant effect on DO/IQ of CP children.

2342635141	Comparison of three methods for gene analysis of fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood	Background. Although great advances in techniques for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis using fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood have achieved, current technology does not meet the demands required for clinical use. In this study, we aimed to establish reliable methods for the gene analysis of fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood. Methods. Primed extension preamplification (PEP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), multiple primed in situ labeling (PRINS), and nested PCR were individually applied to detect the sex determining region Y (SRY) gene in single fetal cells collected from maternal peripheral blood. Results. The sensitivity and specificity of the detection of the SRY gene by PEP-PCR were 97.39% (149/153) and 99.17% (119/120), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of PRINS were 97.56% (40/41) and 100% (35/35), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of nested-PCR were 80.00% (24/30) and 87.50% (14/16), respectively. Conclusions. PEP-PCR and PRINS are reliable techniques for the gene analysis of single fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood because of their high sensitivity and specificity. PEP-PCR and PRINS can be used as standard methods of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis using single fetal cells from maternal peripheral blood.

27144538869	Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in HOXC gene cluster within susceptible region 12q13 of simple congenital heart disease	Objective: In the candidate region 12q13 of simple congenital heart disease(CHD), four single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) in HOXC4 gene were chosen in order to investigate the distribution of SNP and haplotypes in simple CHD patients and normal people. Methods: The genotype of 4 SNPs in 108 simple CHD patients and 200 normal people were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography(DHPLC) . The statistical contingency table method was used to analyze SNP genotype frequency and gene frequency in patients and control group; then, the haplotypes were established and their frequencies in the two groups were assessed by PHASE software. Results: C16476T polymorphism was not detected; A17860G located in 3′ flanking sequence of HOXC5 gene displayed significant difference between the two groups. The G allele frequency in simple CHD patients was higher than that in healthy controls(P < 0.05); the distribution of frequencies of 4 haplotypes showed significant difference(P < 0.01). Conclusion: The A17860G located in 3′ flanking sequence of HOXC5 gene is associated with simple CHD; the risk of CHD in the persons with G17860 is higher than that in those with A17860. the haplotype of 3 SNPs may be linked with the susceptible gene of simple CHD.

3142534430	The expression of PLF in placenta in pregnancy-induced hypertension and the relationship between the PLF and serum VCAM-1	To study the expression of placental isoferritin (PLF) in placental tissue of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and the relationship between the level of expression of PLF and the amount of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in serum, immunohistochemical technique was used to detect the expression of PLF in placenta tissue in 45 PIH patients (PIH group) and 15 normal pregnant women (normal group). High resolution pathological image analysis system (HPIAS-100) was employed to determine the quantity of PLF. The VCAM-1 in serum was examined by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that the levels of PLF expressions in moderate and severe PIH patients were significantly lower than that of normal group (P<0.01). The serum VCAM-1 was significantly decreased in PIH group (1310±177 p/ng/ml) than that of normal group (609±72 p/ng/ml, P<0.01). The significant negative correlation existed between the expression of PLF in placental tissue and the serum VACM-1 (r=-0.58, P<0.01). It was concluded that the level of PLF expression in PIH decreases and is negatively correlated with the amount of serum VCAM-1, indicating that these may be involved in the pathogenesis of PIH.

33645112319	Cloning of TBX5, a key gene during heart formation and its expression in rat embryonic heart	To study the expression of TBX5, a key gene during heart formation, full-length TBX5 cDNA was cloned from Wistar rat embryonic heart (GenBank Accession No. AY859491). The cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences were different from those previously reported in GenBank. The expression profile of TBX5 in rat tissues was studied by RT-PCR and Northern blot. TBX5 was expressed in many rat tissues as a single transcript, and the highest level of expression was found in the heart. For subcellular localization, TBX5 was expressed as an EGFP fusion protein in rat hepatocarcinoma cells. Results showed that TBX5 was nuclear. In addition, TBX5-GST fusion protein was obtained by prokaryotic expression. These findings provide a good basis for further identification of TBX5-related transcription factors and protein-protein interaction studies among each other.

33645506661	Inhibitory effects of polymyxin B on NF-κB activation and expression of procollagen I, III in pre-eclamptic umbilical artery smooth muscle cells	Background: It has been identified that in patients with pre-eclampsia, several factors were released into the serum, which can regulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and stimulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the signal transduction pathway of the growth factors and cytokines synthesized by endothelial cells leading to the proliferation and ECM synthesis of human umbilical arterial smooth muscle cell (HUASMC) is unknown. The aim of this study was to research the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, polymyxin B (PMB), on the proliferation, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, and expression of procollagen I and III mRNA in HUASMC cultured with pre-eclamptic umbilical sera. Methods: Normal HUASMCs were treated with pre-eclamptic umbilical serum (pre-eclamptic group), pre-eclamptic umbilical serum plus PMB (PMB group), or normal umbilical serum (normal group). The expression of I-κB, NF-κB was detected by Western blotting after the HUASMC was incubated for 2 hours. The proliferation of HUASMC was evaluated by MTT, the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytomerty, and the expression of procollagen I, III mRNA was measured by RT-PCR assay after HUASMC was incubated for 48 hours.

34347208687	Evaluation of models that predict short-term outcome after traumatic brain injury	Primary objective: This study aimed to identify models that predicted the short-term outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) from the literature and to evaluate their clinical significance. Methods: Literatures from PubMED were reviewed. Regression coefficients and intercepts were extracted. A group of 229 cases was used for validation and the unfavourable rate was calculated to assess the validity of these models by the area under receiver operating. Characteristic curve (AUC), C-statistic and Brier score. Main Results: In total, 13 studies of 18 different models were included. Data from the validation group were in accordance with the indicators of the studies reviewed. All models got an AUC value ranging from 0.644-0.890 except two (AUC value <0.6) and their Brier scores were near zero. However, the calibration of most studies was insufficient (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Most of the models included in this study have a good discriminatory power while lacking sufficient calibration. However, they all predict with relative accuracy at the level of individuals. Therefore, current models can be used to predict the survival rate of individual patients and may be useful to inform patients and relatives about the likelihood of a beneficial outcome.

35848940699	Polo-like kinase 1 may regulate G2/M transition of mouse fertilized eggs by means of inhibiting the phosphorylation of Tyr 15 of Cdc2	Polo-like kinase 1(Plk1) has been reported to be a multifunctional kinase that plays pivotal regulatory roles in microtubule assembly during mammalian early embryonic mitosis. In the present study, we examined the expression of Plk1 at protein and mRNA level in mouse fertilized eggs by Western blot and RT-PCR. We also examined the kinase activity of Plk1. At various developmental phases of mouse one-cell stage embryos, both the protein and the mRNA of Plk1 were uniformly distributed; but the kinase activity of Plk1 increased at G2/M phase and decreased at the end of M phase. At the meantime, the phosphorylation of Tyr15 of Cdc2 was inhibited at M phase. To investigate its function in mammalian fertilized eggs further, we used specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and scytonemin, the putative inhibitor of Plk1 to suppress the activity of Plk1 in mouse fertilized eggs. Upon blockage of the activation of with Plk1 shRNA and scytonemin in mouse one-cell stage embryos, the cleavage rate decreased and the phosphorylation level of Tyr15 of Cdc2 increased. These results imply that the Plk1 may regulate cell cycle progression of mouse fertilized eggs by means of inhibiting the phosphorylation of Tyr15 of Cdc2. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77954722335	Neurokinin B and urotensin II levels in pre-eclampsia	Objective. To verify neurokinin B (NKB) and urotensin II (UII) plasma levels in pre-eclampsia (PE) and to determine the relationship between plasma NKB and UII levels. Method.A total of 60 women in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited, 40 women with PE (study patients) and 20 age- and BMI-matched normotensive women (healthy controls). They were divided into three groups: the 20 normotensive pregnant women (Group 1); 20 women with mild PE (Group 2); 20 women with severe PE (Group 3). The plasma levels of NKB and UII were measured simultaneously by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. Compared with controls, levels of NKB were significantly higher in women with mild or severe PE (p<0.01 for both groups), levels of UII were significantly higher in women with mild or severe PE (p<0.01 for both groups). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between plasma levels of NKB and UII in pre-eclamptic women (r=0.783, p<0.01). Conclusions. These findings suggest that there was an elevation of NKB and UII in the plasma of pre-eclamptic women. NKB and UII may be involved in the pathophysiology of PE and associated with the development of severe disease. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

77954389712	Regulation of neutrophil elastase-induced muc5ac expression by nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 in human airway epithelial cells	Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is one of the main airway mucins implicated in pulmonary diseases with mucous hypersecretion. Neutrophil elastase (NE), a serine protease released by neutrophils, is known to induce MUC5AC synthesis by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), a basicregion leucine-zipper transcription factor, is believed to protect against ROS damage by activating a series of antioxidant enzymes; Nrf2 is also reported to reduce NE activity. The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between Nrf2 expression and NE-induced MUC5AC production.We used a small interfering RNA to inhibit Nrf2 expression. The Nrf2 gene and protein expressions were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting, respectively. The ROS generation was examined using a kit. The expression of MUC5AC was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that NCI-H292 epithelial cells, in which the Nrf2 gene expression repressed, were highly predisposed to NE stimulation, with marked exacerbation of ROS generation and reduced secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor production, resulting in high MUC5AC expression. Pretreatment with the potent Nrf2 activator sulforaphane had the reverse effect. These results demonstrate that Nrf2 is a novel nuclear factor involved in down-regulating MUC5AC synthesis by inhibiting ROS generation and augmenting proteinase inhibitor production.

79951581747	The nuclear to cytoplasmic shift of ING5 protein during colorectal carcinogenesis with their distinct links to pathologic behaviors of carcinomas	Inhibitor of growth 5, a tumor suppressor protein, can interact with p53, thereby inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. Inhibitor of growth 5 overexpression results in a reduction in colony-forming efficiency and cell population in S phase. To clarify the roles of inhibitor of growth 5 in tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal carcinomas, we examined inhibitor of growth 5 expression by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing colorectal carcinomas (n = 306), adenomas (n = 69), and nonneoplastic mucosa (n = 288) and compared this with clinicopathologic parameters of the carcinomas. In addition, inhibitor of growth 5 expression in colorectal carcinoma tissues and cell lines (DLD-1, HCT-15, SW480, and WiDr) was analyzed by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. It was found that the inhibitor of growth 5 protein was localized to the nuclei of colon carcinoma cells with no differences at mRNA levels. Among 18 frozen samples of colorectal carcinoma, significantly increased expression of inhibitor of growth 5 protein was observed in the carcinoma in comparison with adjacent mucosa in 14 cases (77.8%; P < .05), and 71.4% (10/14) of carcinoma cases exhibited up-regulated inhibitor of growth 5 mRNA expression. Decreased inhibitor of growth 5 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in colorectal carcinoma, compared with non-neoplastic mucosa and adenoma (P < .05). Nuclear inhibitor of growth 5 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size, depth of invasion, degree of dedifferentiation, and Union Internationale Contre le Cancer staging (P < .05). In contrast, cytoplasmic inhibitor of growth 5 expression was positively correlated with depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, and Union Internationale Contre le Cancer staging (P < .05). It was suggested that aberrant inhibitor of growth 5 expression may contribute to pathogenesis, growth, and invasion of colorectal carcinomas and could be considered as a promising marker to gauge aggressiveness of colorectal carcinomas.

42749083907	Traditional Chinese drug ShuXueTong facilitates angiogenesis during wound healing following traumatic brain injury	Ethnopharmacological relevance: ShuXueTong injection is a traditional Chinese drug designed to treat the patients of "blood stasis and stagnation (yu xue yu zhi)", including subacute brain trauma. However, the mechanism of the therapeutic effect of ShuXueTong on traumatic brain injury is unknown yet. Aim of the study: We hypothesized that ShuXueTong may promote the brain wound healing by facilitating angiogenesis. Thus this study was designed to explore this hypothesis. Materials and methods: By means of microvessel count, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and etc., the effect of ShuXueTong on the angiogenesis of brain wound was studied and then its influence on the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway were explored. Results: ShuXueTong facilitates angiogenesis in the brain wound and improves the neurological function of the traumatized rats. VEGF expression in the lesion was elevated due to ShuXueTong induction. The in vitro experiment revealed VEGFR-2 and SRF expression in the endothelial cells were enhanced when exposed to ShuXueTong for merely 1 d. Moreover, ShuXueTong promoted the endothelial cell proliferation via the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway. Conclusions: The mechanism of the therapeutic effect of ShuXueTong on traumatic brain injury lies at least partly in the enhanced angiogenesis in the lesion. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

55049099893	Involvement of insulin in early development of mouse one-cell stage embryos	Recent studies have suggested that growth factors and hormones play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation during early embryonic development. In the present study, we examined the expression and localization of insulin in the mouse oocytes and one-cell stage embryos by quantitative ELISA, RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. In the mouse oocytes and one-cell stage embryos, expression of insulin was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. We also examined the expression, activity and localization of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and p70S6K. The expression of mTOR and p70S6K was not significantly different at the cell cycle of mouse one-cell stage embryos. mTOR and S6K were distributed evenly in the cytoplasm at G1, G2 and M phase phase, but at S phase, the distribution of mTOR and S6K was around the pronucleus. At different phases, the activity of mTOR fluctuated. We also used the PI3K specific inhibitor-Wortmannin to investigate the cleavage rate of eggs. The result showed that the rate obviously decreased. When the mTOR specific inhibitor Rapamycin was used, the first mitotic division of the mouse one-cell stage embryo was delayed. These results suggested that insulin was expressed both in mouse oocytes and one-cell stage embryos, and may play functional roles in regulation of mouse early embryogenesis by activating the signal pathway of PI3K/PKB/mTOR/S6K. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

57149118858	Protein kinase A modulates Cdc25B activity during meiotic resumption of mouse oocytes	Protein kinase A (PKA) play a critical role in maintaining the meiotic arrest. However, the steps downstream of PKA remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulation of meiotic resumption by PKA/Cdc25B pathway in mouse oocytes. Injection of mRNA coding for Cdc25b-S321A had a more potent maturation-inducing ability than Cdc25b-WT. When co-injected with PKA inhibitor, Cdc25B-WT had similar activities with Cdc25B-S321A. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of Cdc25B-S321 was detected in germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes by Western blotting with a phospho-Ser321-specific antibody and the band disappeared when oocytes reenter into the meiotic cell cycle. Furthermore, Cdc25B-WT translocated to the nucleus shortly before GV breakdown (GVBD), whereas phosphorylated Cdc25B-S321 expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm and the signal could not be detected in GVBD oocytes. Taken together, these data indicate that Cdc25B-Serine321 is the potential PKA target and Cdc25B subcellular localization determines its function during the process of maintaining GV arrest in mouse oocytes. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

65449123905	Involvement of the p110a isoform of PI3K in early development of mouse embryos	Class I of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) is characterized as a group of intracellular signal proteins possessing both protein and lipid kinase activities. Recent studies implicate class I of PI3Ks acts as indispensable mediators in early development of mouse embryos, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. In this paper, mouse one-cell embryos were used to investigate a possible contribution of the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110a, to cell cycle progression. The expression level of p110a was determined in four phases of one-cell embryos. Silencing of p110a by microinjection of p110a shRNA into one-cell embryos resulted in a G2/M arrest and prevented the activation of Akt and M-phase promoting factor (MPF). Further, microinjection of the synthesized mRNA coding for a constitutively active p110a into one-cell embryos induced cell cleavage more effectively than microinjection of wild-type p110a mRNA, whereas microinjection of mRNA of kinase-deficient p110a delayed the first mitotic cleavage. Taken together, this study demonstrates that p110a is significant for G2/M transition of mouse one-cell embryos and further emphasizes the importance of Akt in PI3K pathway. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

70949102015	Characterization of p70 S6 kinase 1 in early development of mouse embryos	The mTOR kinase controls cell growth, proliferation, and survival through two distinct multiprotein complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. p70 S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) is characterized as downstream effector of mTOR. Until recently, the connection between S6K1 and mTORC1 /mTORC2 during the early development of mouse embryos has not been well elucidated. Here, the expression level of total S6K1 and its phosphorylation at Thr389 was determined in four phases of one-cell embryos. S6K1 was active throughout the cell cycle especially with higher activity in G2 and M phases. Rapamycin decreased the activity of M-phase promoting factor (MPF) and delayed the first mitotic cleavage. Down-regulating mTOR and raptor reduced S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr389 in one-cell embryos. Furthermore, rapamycin and microinjection of raptor shRNA decreased the immunofluorescent staining of Thr389 phospho-S6K1. It is proposed that mTORC1 may be involved in the control of MPF by regulating S6K1 during the early development of mouse embryos. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

71049144451	The role of Reg IV gene and its encoding product in gastric carcinogenesis	Although the biologic function of Reg IV is poorly understood, it has been reported that Reg IV is a potent activator of the epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway in colon cancer cells and closely linked with the inhibition of apoptosis. To clarify the role of Reg IV in gastric carcinogenesis and subsequent progression, we examined its expression by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on tissue microarray containing gastric carcinoma, adjacent nonneoplastic mucosa, adenoma, intestinal metaplasia, or gastritis. Gastric carcinoma cell lines (MKN28, AGS, MKN45, KATO-III, and HGC-27) were studied for Reg IV expression by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing. Frozen samples of gastric carcinoma and adjacent nonneoplastic mucosa were subjected to Western blot, and patient serum, to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Reg IV. Gastric carcinoma cell lines showed different levels of Reg IV mRNA and its encoding protein. The Reg IV protein expression was gradually decreased from intestinal metaplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma to gastritis (P < .05). The positive rate of its mRNA was higher in intestinal metaplasia than carcinoma or nonneoplastic mucosa (P < .05). Elevated serum Reg IV level in gastric carcinoma patients was detected in comparison with that in health individuals (P < .05). Reg IV expression was significantly correlated with the MUC-2 and MUC-5AC expression (P < .05). Among histologic subtypes of the World Health Organization, signet ring cell carcinoma more frequently expressed Reg IV than the others (P < .05), whereas it is the converse for the poorly differentiated group (P < .05). Our study indicated that Reg IV expression experienced up-regulation in gastric intestinal metaplasia and adenoma and then down-regulation with malignant transformation of gastric epithelial cells. It was suggested that Reg IV expression should be considered as a good biomarker for gastric precancerous lesions and was especially related to the histogenic pathway of signet ring cell carcinoma. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77950594362	Nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of Bag-1 distinctly correlates with pathologic behavior and outcome of gastric carcinomas	Bag-1 is an antiapoptotic protein with its altered expression and localization in malignancies. To clarify the role of Bag-1 in gastric carcinogenesis, its expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray containing gastric carcinomas, adjacent nonneoplastic mucosa (NNM), adenomas, intestinal metaplasia (IM), or gastritis. Gastric carcinoma tissue and cell lines were studied for Bag-1 expression by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results demonstrated that Bag-1 proteins were differentially expressed in the nucleus or cytosol of MKN28, AGS, MKN45, KATO-III, or HGC-27 cell lines, despite similar levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. The Bag-1 mRNA overexpression was detectable in 73.3% of 15 gastric carcinomas without significant difference in its encoding products' levels. The nuclear Bag-1 expression gradually decreased from gastritis, IM, adenoma to carcinoma (P < .05), and negatively correlated with lymphatic invasion or lymph node metastasis, cytoplasmic Bag-1 expression, negative parafibromin expression, and poor prognosis (P < .05). Cytoplasmic Bag-1 was weakly immunoreactive in carcinomas, compared with gastritis (P < .05), and positively associated with invasive depth and poor prognosis of the carcinoma (P < .05). The positive rate of Bag-1 mRNA expression was higher in adjacent IMs than carcinomas or adjacent NNM (P < .05). Bag-1 mRNA was expressed more in carcinomas from female patients than the male counterparts (P < .05). There was a positive correlation of Bag-1 mRNA expression with invasive depth and venous invasion (P < .05). Our study indicated that aberrant expression and subcellular distribution of Bag-1 might play an important role in the malignant transformation of gastric epithelial cells and should be considered as a biomarker for gastric carcinogenesis, subsequent progression, and prognosis.

77953867366	A study on population-based prenatal screening and diagnosis of Down's syndrome in Jiangsu province	Objective: To screen and diagnose Down's syndrome during mid-term pregnancy to reduce the number of babies with Down's syndrome. Methods: With the multi-level of stratified cluster sampling, twenty thousand and eight hundred and three women at 15-20 weeks gestation were screened by maternal serum AFP and β-hCG using the time resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA). Then the screened high-risk women were diagnosed by amniocentesis, cell culture and chromosome analyses. The born children were diagnosed by follow-up and peripheral blood chromosome analyses. Results: Six fetuses were diagnosed by serum screening and amniotic fluid chromosome analyses, and 3 born children were diagnosed by follow-up and peripheral blood chromosome analyses. Nine cases of Down's syndrome were detected in total, with the positive prenatal screen rate being 67% (6/9). Conclusion: The prenatal screening and diagnosis can reduce the birth of Down's syndrome patients and improve the population quality. However, the diagnosis accuracy still needs to be improved to further reduce the false negative rate and prevent misdiagnosis.

77955665055	Recombinant human elafin protects airway epithelium integrity during inflammation	Elafin, an antiprotease, is likely to protect pulmonary epithelial cells from inflammatory damages. We aimed to explore the molecule mechanisms of recombinant human elafin on protecting A549 cells integrity against inflammatory assault. We transfected A549 airway epithelial cells with eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1-Elafin and negative control vector pEGFP-N1, respectively. Cells were co-incubated with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and then were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results revealed that, in pEGFP-N1-Elafin transfected cells, neutrophil elastase (NE) activity significantly decreased after LPS stimulation, accompanied with elevated elafin mRNA level and protein production, whereas in cells transfected with pEGFP-N1, NE activity was higher and elafin expression was lower, compared with pEGFP-N1-Elafin transfected group (P < 0.05). In pEGFP-N1 transfected cells, LPS suppressed tight junctions protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) production, while in recombinant pEGFP-N1-Elafin cells, LPS did not cause significantly decrease of ZO-1, compared with normal control cells. LPS stimulation also significantly weakened the collagen adhesion capability of pEGFP-N1 transfected cells (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference in recombinant pEGFP-N1-Elafin cells (P > 0.05). These results suggest that elafin can maintain airway epithelium integrity by protecting airway epithelial cells and enhancing the anti-inflammatory capability of airway. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77957342049	Roles of ROS/TACE in neutrophil elastase-induced mucus hypersecretion in NCI-H292 airway epithelial cells	Complications arise in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) with excessive mucus production, especially during the exacerbation period, which contributes to airway blockage and bacterial infection. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is detected at high levels in airway secretions, and is the primary inducer of mucin production. Understanding the mechanism of NE-induced overproduction of mucin may lead to new therapies for COPD. It is known that activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream signaling cascade are involved in mucin production. However, the mechanism of NE-induced EGFR activation remains unclear. Tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) cleaves pro-transforming growth factor (TGF)-α in airway epithelial cells to release the mature, soluble TGF-α form, which subsequently binds to and activates EGFR. In this investigation, we demonstrate that NE-induced mucin production requires reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which activates TACE, resulting in TGF-α shedding, and EGFR phosphorylation in NCI-H292 epithelial cells.

78650014980	The altered expression of ING5 protein is involved in gastric carcinogenesis and subsequent progression	ING5 can interact with p53, thereby inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. To clarify the roles of ING5 in gastric tumorigenesis and progression, its expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing gastric nonneoplastic mucosa (n = 119), dysplasia (n = 50), and carcinomas (n = 429), with its comparison with clinicopathologic parameters of the carcinomas. ING5 expression was analyzed in gastric carcinoma tissues and cell lines (MKN28, MKN45, AGS, GT-3 TKB, and KATO-III) by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. ING5 protein was found to distribute to the nuclei of gastric carcinoma cells with similar messenger RNA levels. An increased expression of ING5 messenger RNA was observed in gastric carcinoma in comparison with paired mucosa (P < .05). Lower expression of nuclear ING5 was detected in gastric dysplasia and carcinoma than that in nonneoplastic mucosa (P < .05). Gastric nonneoplastic mucosa and metastatic carcinoma showed more expression of cytoplasmic ING5 than did gastric carcinoma and dysplasia (P < .05). Nuclear ING5 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, and clinicopathologic staging (P < .05), whereas cytoplasmic ING5 was positively associated with depth of invasion, venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, and clinicopathologic staging (P < .05). Nuclear ING5 was more expressed in older than younger carcinoma patients (P < .05). There was a higher expression of nuclear ING5 in intestinal-type than diffuse-type carcinoma (P < .05), whereas it was the converse for cytoplasmic ING5 (P < .05). Survival analysis indicated that nuclear ING5 was closely linked to favorable prognosis of carcinoma patients (P < .05), albeit not independent. It was suggested that aberrant ING5 expression may contribute to pathogenesis, growth, and invasion of gastric carcinomas and could be considered as a promising marker to gauge aggressiveness and prognosis of gastric carcinoma. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

79551508888	The association of genetic polymorphisms with cerebral palsy: A meta-analysis	Aim The aim of our meta-analysis was to summarize quantitatively the association of genetic polymorphisms with cerebral palsy (CP). Method We identified 16 studies on the association of genetic polymorphisms with CP in Pubmed, Elsevier Science Direct, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang. Eleven of these studies (involving a total of 2533 cases and 4432 controls) were used in the current meta-analysis. A study was included if (1) it was published up to September 2010 and (2) it was a case-control study. We excluded one study of family members because the analysis was based on linkage considerations. Meta odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals based on fixed-effects models or random-effects models were dependent on Cochran's Q statistic. We examined the relationship between alleles, as well as genotypes and susceptibility to CP. Results Meta-analysis was performed for 17 genetic polymorphisms: apolipoprotein E (ε2,ε3,ε4), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (rs1801133), coagulation factor II (rs1799963]), coagulation factor V (rs6025), coagulation factor VII (rs5742910/rs6046), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (rs1800795), endothelial nitric oxide (rs1800779/rs1799983/rs3918226), fibrinogen β-polypeptide (rs1800790), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (rs1799768/rs7242), TNF-β lymphotoxin α precursor (rs1041981), adducin 1 (α) (rs4961), ADRB2 (rs1042714), and tumour necrosis factor α (rs1800629). We found a significant association between CP and IL-6 (rs1800795) [C vs G: odds ratio (OR) 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-2.22, p<0.001; CC+GC vs GG: OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.29-2.29, p=0.002; CC vs GG+GC: OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.52-3.09, p<0.001], but no other genetic polymorphisms. Interpretation This meta-analysis demonstrated that CP is associated with the genetic polymorphism IL-6 (rs1800795). © The Authors. Journal compilation © Mac Keith Press 2011.

79951702067	Relationship between adiponectin and testosterone in patients with type 2 diabetes	Introduction: This study was designed to investigate the relationship between serum adiponectin and testosterone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Materials and methods: Serum level of adiponectin and testosterone were prospectively measured in 65 patients with type 2 diabetes and in 20 healthy subjects. Testosterone was determined by the radio-immunoassay, whereas adiponectin levels weredetermined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results:The average serum testosterone did not differ between the diabetes and the control group, but the average adiponectin in the diabetes group was lower (14.6 (14.2-15.0) vs. 24.3 (24.05-24.55) ng/mL, P = 0.001). In the diabetes group, the serum adiponectin level in patients with renal dysfunction (22.3 (21.5-23.1) ng/mL) was higher than in patients with no complications (12.1 (11.45-12.75) ng/mL) and than in patients with coronary artery disease (11.2 (10.25-12.15) ng/mL) (P = 0.009). Univariate correlation analysis showed an inverse weak correlation between adiponectin and testosterone concentrations in male diabetic patients (r = -0.27, P = 0.009). There was no significant correlation between adiponectin and testosterone in female patients (r = -0.05,P = 0.167). Conclusions: We conclude that patients with type 2 diabetes have lower serum adiponectin concentration than healthy individuals, and that there is a weak inverse correlation between adiponectin and testosterone serum concentrations in male diabetics.

79954434632	Up-regulated EMMPRIN/CD147 protein expression might play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis and its subsequent progression without an alteration of its glycosylation and mRNA level	Purpose: Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) was reported to involve in the invasion and metastasis of malignancies by regulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in stromal and cancer cells. The study aimed to clarify the role of EMMPRIN expression in tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal carcinomas (CRC). Methods: EMMPRIN expression was examined on tissue microarray containing colorectal carcinomas, adenoma and non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM) by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH). Colorectal carcinoma cell lines (DLD-1, HCT-15, SW480 and WiDr) and tissues were studied for EMMPRIN expression by Western blot or RT-PCR, followed by sequencing. Results: All carcinoma cell lines showed EMMPRIN expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Two synonymous mutations were found in carcinoma cell lines at codon109 (GCT → GCC: Ala) or 179 (GAT → GAC: Asp). Frozen CRC tissues displayed higher EMMPRIN expression than paired NNM (P < 0.05). EMMPRIN expression was immunohistochemically stronger in colorectal high-grade adenoma, adenocarcinoma and metastatic carcinoma than non-neoplastic superficial epithelium and low-grade adenoma (P < 0.05). In contrast, its mRNA level was similar from colorectal NNM, adenoma to adenocarcinoma by ISH, in line with the findings of RT-PCR (P > 0.05). Immunohistochemically, EMMPRIN expression was positively correlated with tumor size, depth of invasion, vascular or lymphatic invasion, grade of infiltration (INF), ki-67 and VEGF expression of CRCs (P < 0.05). Among them, depth of invasion was an independent associated factor for EMMPRIN expression in CRCs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Up-regulated EMMPRIN protein expression might contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis without the alteration of its glycosylation and mRNA level. Aberrant EMMPRIN protein expression might promote growth or invasion of CRCs possibly through increased ki-67 expression and inducible angiogenesis via up-regulating VEGF expression. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79953328054	Molecular cloning, characterization and expression analysis of the complement component C6 gene in grass carp	The complement system, as a representative of innate immunity, plays a key role in the host defense against infections. C6 is the member of complement components creating the membrane attack complex (MAC). In this study, we cloned and characterized the grass carp complement component C6 (gcC6) gene. Our data showed that gcC6 gene contained a 2724. bp open reading frame (ORF), a 237. bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and a 219. bp 3'-UTR. The deduced amino acid sequence of gcC6 showed 77.6% and 58.9% identity to zebrafish C6 and rainbow trout C6, respectively. GcC6 gene was expressed in a wide range of grass carp tissues, and the highest expression level of gcC6 was detected in the spleen and liver. Upon challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila, its expression was significantly up-regulated in muscle, trunk kidney, liver, head kidney, spleen, heart and intestine, whereas it was down-regulated in the brain and skin. The expression level of gcC6 was high at the unfertilized egg stage. It was significantly increased at 1 day post-hatching, but it was decreased at 10 days post-hatching. This result suggested that the complement C6 transcripts in early embryos were of maternal origin. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79953649753	Cloning and characterization of TIMP-2b gene in grass carp	Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are the primary inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in tissues. In this study, a TIMP-2 gene was isolated from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella (CiTIMP-2b) and characterized. This cDNA sequence encoded a signal peptide, N- and C-terminal domains. CiTIMP-2b is highly homologous to the orthologous in zebrafish and other teleosts, suggesting TIMP-2b is highly conserved during teleost evolution. CiTIMP-2b gene is expressed in a wide range of tissues including blood, brain, muscle, trunk kidney, liver, head kidney, skin, spleen, heart, gill, intestine and fin, with the highest level of transcripts in spleen. Upon challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila, its expression was significantly up-regulated in all tissues. The CiTIMP-2b transcript is present at unfertilized eggs, which suggests that CiTIMP-2b transcript is maternally inherited. These results suggest that the CiTIMP-2b would play an important role in the A. hydrophila-related diseases and early embryonic development stages in grass carp. © 2011.

79960394757	Parafibromin expression is an independent prognostic factor for colorectal carcinomas	Parafibromin is a protein encoded by hyperparathyroidism 2, and its down-regulated expression is involved in the pathogenesis of parathyroid, breast, and gastric carcinomas. This study aimed to clarify the roles of parafibromin expression in tumorigenesis, progression, and prognosis of colorectal carcinomas. Parafibromin-expressing plasmid was transfected into DLD-1 cells with the phenotypes, and related molecules were examined. Parafibromin expression was examined in colorectal samples by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, Western blot, or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. It was found that parafibromin overexpression could cause G1 arrest and enhance differentiation of DLD-1 cells. There was a high expression of p21, p27, and cyclin E, but low expression of cyclin D1 messenger RNA, phospho-cdc2, and phospho-cdc25c proteins. Parafibromin could inhibit c-myc messenger RNA expression by binding to c-myc promoter. Expression levels of nuclear parafibromin and parafibromin messenger RNA were decreased from colorectal nonneoplastic mucosa and adenomas to carcinomas (P <.05). Immunohistochemically, parafibromin expression was inversely correlated with tumor size, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, clinicopathologic staging, and poor prognosis of carcinomas (P <.05). It was suggested that parafibromin overexpression might suppress cell cycle progression and promote differentiation of DLD-1 cells. Aberrant parafibromin expression possibly contributes to the pathogenesis, growth, invasion, and metastasis of colorectal carcinomas and could be regarded as an independent factor to indicate a favorable prognosis for patients with colorectal carcinomas. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

80053201275	Parafibromin expression in lung normal tissue and carcinoma: Its comparison with clinicopathological parameters of carcinoma	Parafibromin is a protein encoded by the hyperparathyroidism 2 oncosuppressor gene and its down-regulated expression is involved in the pathogenesis of parathyroid, gastric and colorectal carcinomas. To clarify the roles of parafibromin expression in lung carcinomas, it was examined by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on tissue microarray containing lung carcinomas (n=144) and normal lung tissue (n=20), with a comparison to clinicopathological parameters of carcinomas. Lung carcinoma cell lines and tissues were studied for parafibromin expression by Western blot and RT-PCR. Down-regulated expression of parafibromin mRNA was found in lung carcinoma in comparison with matched normal tissue (p<0.05). Parafibromin protein was found in the cilia and nuclei of pseudo-stratified columnar epithelium, and the nuclei of lung carcinoma. According to immunostaining and in situ hybridization, there was no difference in parafibromin expression between histological subtypes of lung carcinoma (p>0.05). The Kaplan-Meier method indicated that nuclear parafibromin expression was positively correlated with adenocarcinoma patients (p<0.05). Down-regulated parafibromin mRNA expression might play an important role in lung carcinogenesis, but not in its histogenesis. Strong parafibromin expression in cilia of the pseudostratified columnar epithelium indicated its possible involvement in cell mobility. Parafibromin expression could be employed to indicate the favorable prognosis of patients with adenocarcinoma.

80155187430	mTOR-rictor is the Ser	Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls cell growth and proliferation via the raptor-mTOR (TORC1) and rictor-mTOR (TORC2) protein complexes. The mTORC2 containing mTOR and rictor is thought to be rapamycin insensitive and it is recently shown that both rictor and mTORC2 are essential for the development of both embryonic and extra embryonic tissues. To explore rictor function in the early development of mouse embryos, we disrupted the expression of rictor, a specific component of mTORC2, in mouse fertilized eggs by using rictor shRNA. Our results showed that one-cell stage eggs that were lack of rictor could not enter into the two-cell stage normally. Recent biochemical studies suggests that TORC2 is the elusive PDK2 (3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 2) for AKT/PKB Ser473 phosphorylation, which is deemed necessary for AKT function, so we microinjected AKT-S473A into mouse fertilized eggs to investigate whether AKT-S473A is downstream effector of mTOR.rictor to regulate the mitotic division. Our findings revealed that the rictor induced phosphorylation of AKT in Ser473 is required for TORC2 function in early development of mouse embryos. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

81255178712	Prokaryotic expression and purification of Borna disease virus phosphoprotein	Objective: To construct the recombinant plasmid carrying the gene encoding Borna disease virus (BDV) phosphoprotein (p24), express in prokaryotic cells and purify the expressed product. Methods: The p24 gene was amplified by RT-PCR from oligodendrocytes(OL) infected with BDV and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-41a(+). The constructed recombinant plasmid pET-41a-p24 was transformed to E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression under induction of IPTG. The expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Results: Both restriction analysis and sequencing proved that recombinant plasmid pET-41a-p24 was constructed correctly. The expressed p24, with a relative molecular mass of about 24 000, contained more than 30% of total somatic protein and mainly existed in a soluble form. The purified recombinant protein reached a purity of about 85% and showed specific binding to mouse anti-BDV p24 McAb. Conclusion: Recombinant BDV p24 protein was successfully expressed in prokaryotic cells, which laid a foundation of further development of the relevant methods for immunoassay.

81255199333	Two novel homologs of simple C-type lectin in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus): Potential role in immune response to bacteria	C-type lectins play important roles in glycoprotein metabolism, multicellular integration and immunity. Based on their overall domain structure, they can be classified as different groups which possess different physiological functions. In this study, two novel simple C-type lectins were identified from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), an important cultured fish in China. GcCL1 and gcCL2 share an essentially identical gene structure, a conserved promoter region shorter than 300 bp and an amino acid identity of 81.2%. Phylogenetic analysis indicated they may be products of gene duplication and could be classified as a new clade of group VII C-type lectins. Both of them were expressed in the eleven tissues examined, with the spleen having the highest abundance of transcript. The gcCL1 transcript was more abundant than gcCL2 in the majority of tissue samples from 2-yr-old grass carps, and was lower than those of gcCL2 before 15 days post-hatching. The expression of both genes was significantly up-regulated in spleen, muscle, skin, gills and hepatopancreas after induction by Aeromonas hydrophila. This is the first report that the expression of group VII C-type lectins could be induced by a pathogen, and indicates these lectins may be involved in the immune response to bacteria in fish. © 2011.

84855354473	The Treg/Th17 Imbalance in Toxoplasma gondii-Infected Pregnant Mice	Aim To evaluate whether impaired Treg/Th17 balance exists in the pregnant mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Method of Study Regulatory T (Treg) and T-helper type 17 (Th17) cells were measured in both placenta and spleens of the pregnant mice infected with and without T. gondii by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were analyzed using real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression levels of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), and IL-6 were also analyzed using real-time PCR. The correlations of the ratio of Treg/Th17 to the mRNA or protein expression level of those factors were analyzed by Spearman's correlation analysis. Data were analyzed by unpaired t-test and paired t-test. Results The proportion of Tregs or Th17 cells in the placenta and spleens of the T. gondii-infected pregnant mice was significantly lower or higher than in those of non-infected mice, respectively. Upregulation of TGF-β and downregulation of IL-17A were found in the placenta of T. gondii-infected pregnant mice. The ratio of Treg to Th17 was significantly lower in the infected mice than that in the non-infected mice (P<0.01).The ratio of Treg to Th17 positively or negatively correlated with the protein expression level of TGF-β (r=0.6204, P<0.05) or IL-17A (r=-0.6296, P<0.05), respectively. The ratio also positively correlated with the mRNA expression level of Foxp3 (r=0.7985, P<0.01), but negatively correlated with the mRNA expression level of RORγt (r=-0.6153, P<0.05), and IL-6 (r=-0.7492, P<0.01). Conclusion TheTreg/Th17 imbalance exists in the pregnant mice infected with T. gondii, which is associated with the expression of related cytokine and key transcription factors. This result suggests that the embryo loss caused by this parasite may be associated with a reduced ratio of Treg to Th17 cell number. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84857914297	Nitric oxide exacerbates Al-induced inhibition of root elongation in rice bean by affecting cell wall and plasma membrane properties	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is one of the most widespread problems for crop production on acid soils, and nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule involved in the mediation of various biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Here we found that exogenous application of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) exacerbated the inhibition of Al-induced root growth in rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi & Ohashi 'Jiangnan', Fabaceae]. This was accompanied by an increased accumulation of Al in the root apex. However, Al treatments had no effect on endogenous NO concentrations in root apices. These results indicate that a change in NO concentration is not the cause of Al-induced root growth inhibition and the adverse effect of SNP on Al-induced root growth inhibition should result from increased Al accumulation. Al could significantly induce citrate efflux but SNP had no effects on citrate efflux either in the absence or presence of Al. On the other hand, SNP pretreatment significantly increased Al-induced malondialdehyde accumulation and Evans Blue staining, indicating an intensification of the disruption of plasma membrane integrity. Furthermore, SNP pretreatment also caused greater induction of pectin methylesterase activity by Al, which could be the cause of the increased Al accumulation. Taken together, it is concluded that NO exacerbates Al-induced root growth inhibition by affecting cell wall and plasma membrane properties. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84859304138	The clinicopathological significance of REIC expression in colorectal carcinomas	REIC is down-regulated in immortalized cell lines compared with the parental normal counterparts, and could inhibit colony formation, tumor growth and induce apoptosis. Here, its expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray containing colorectal non-neoplastic mucosa (NNM), adenoma and adenocarcinoma. Colorectal carcinoma tissue and cell lines were studied for REIC expression or its secretory level by Western blot, RT-PCR or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results demonstrated that REIC was differentially expressed in Colo201, Colo205, DLD-1, HCT-15, HCT-116, HT-29, KM-12, SW480, SW620, and WiDr with its secretion concentration less than 300 pg/mL. Carcinomas showed statistically lower REIC expression than matched NNM with no difference for protein content. Immunohistochemically, REIC expression was significantly decreased from NNM, adenoma to adenocarcinoma (p<0.05). REIC expression was negatively correlated with depth of invasion, TNM staging, dedifferentiation, Capase-3 and nuclear inhibitor of growth 5 (ING5) expression (p<0.05), while not with age, sex, tumor size, lymphatic or venous invasion, or lymph node metastasis (p>0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that REIC expression was not associated with the prognosis of colorectal carcinomas (p>0.05). Cox's analysis demonstrated that lymphatic and venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, and UICC staging were independent prognostic factors for carcinoma (p<0.05). Our study indicated that downregulated REIC expression might play an important role in colorectal adenoma- adenocarcinoma sequence and subsequent progression. Aberrant REIC expression might be employed as a good marker of pathogenesis and development of colorectal carcinomas.

84859791469	Association of HAb18G with clinicopathologic features and prognosis in non-small cell carcinoma of lung	Objective To study the association between HAbI8G expression, tumor parameters, metastatic potential and prognosis in non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . Methods Itnmunohistochemical study for HAb18G protein using SP methods was carried out in 144 cases of NSCLC. Nineteen cases of benign lung lesions and 41 cases of normal lung tissue were used as controls. The intensity (positive unit/PU) of HAb18G expression was assessed quantitatively by image analysis software. The results were correlated with tumor parameters, metastatic potential and follow-up data. Results The intensity of HAb18G protein expression was significantly higher in NSCLC than that in controls (P=0-000). In squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, the expression of HAb18G protein in well-differentiated tumors was lower than that in moderately to poorly differentiated tumors (P =0.001 ). Tumors of TNM stage IV had stronger expression than tumors of lower stages (P=0. 000). HAb18G PU was greater in tumors with lymph node metastasis than those without nodal metastasis (P=0. 045 ). The PU value of tumors with maximal diameter greater than 5 cm was higher than that of the smaller tumors (P = 0.000). It was also higher in male than in female patients (P =0.046). There was no association between HAb18G protein expression and age of patients, history of smoking, tumor types and gross morphology (P >0. 05). The five-year survival rate in cases with low HAb18G protein expression was higher than that in cases with high expression (P = 0. 006). Univariate analysis indicated that patients with high HAbl8G protein expression carried a poor prognosis (P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that expression of HAbl8G protein was an independent prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC (P =0.032, relative risk 3.962). Conclusions HAb18G protein expression is associated with tumor progression and prognosis. It may represent a useful biomarker for prognostic evaluation.

84861032071	Silencing of a novel tumor metastasis suppressor gene LASS2/TMSG1 promotes invasion of prostate cancer cell in vitro through increase of vacuolar ATPase activity	Homo sapiens longevity assurance homologue 2 of yeast LAG1 (LASS2), also known as tumor metastasis suppressor gene 1 (TMSG1), is a newly found tumor metastasis suppressor gene in 1999. Preliminary studies showed that it not only suppressed tumor growth but also closely related to tumor metastasis, however, its molecular mechanisms is still unclear. There have been reported that protein encoded by LASS2/TMSG-1 could directly interact with the C subunit of Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which suggested that LASS2/TMSG1 might inhibit the invasion and metastasis through regulating the function of V-ATPase. Thus, in this study, we explored the effect of small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting LASS2/TMSG1 on the invasion of human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3M-2B4 and its molecular mechanisms associated with the V-ATPase. Real-time fluorogentic quantitative PCR (RFQ-PCR) and Western blot revealed dramatic reduction of 84.5% and 60% in the levels of LASS2/TMSG1 mRNA and protein after transfection of siRNA in PC-3M-2B4 cells. The V-ATPase activity and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration were significantly increased in 2B4 cells transfected with the LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA compared with the controls. The activity of secreted MMP-2 was up-regulated in LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA treated cells compared with the controls; and the capacity for migration and invasion in LASS2/TMSG1-siRNA treated cells was significantly higher than the controls. Thus, we concluded that silencing of LASS2/TMSG1 may promote invasion of prostate cancer cell in vitro through increase of V-ATPase activity and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration and in turn the activation of secreted MMP-2. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84860342063	The immunoprotective role of interleukin-10 in abnormal pregnancy outcome induced by toxoplasma gondii infection	Aims: To investigate the immunoprotective effect of IL-10 on pregnancy in Toxoplasma gondii-infected C57BL/6 mice. Methods: Twenty-four pregnant mice were randomly divided into 3 equal groups, i.e. a control group (CG), an infected group (IG) and an infected group treated with IL-10 (IPTG). Each IPTG and IG mouse was infected with 400 T. gondii trophozoites on gestational day (GD) 8. Each IPTG mouse was injected with 1 μg recombinant mouse IL-10 via a tail vein on GD 10 and 12. The mice were sacrificed on day 7 postinfection. Qa-1 and NKG2A were analyzed in the placenta by flow cytometry and real-time PCR. IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ in the placenta supernatant were analyzed by ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA. Results: IPTG mice showed a better mental state, had larger fetuses and placentas with a better blood supply and a lower resorption ratio compared to IG mice. NKG2A and Qa-1 were significantly increased in IPTG mice compared to IG mice (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-10 in IPTG placenta supernatant were increased (p < 0.05), but IFN-γ was decreased (p < 0.05) compared to IG placenta supernatant. The ratios of IFN-γ/IL-4 and IFN-γ/IL-10 were decreased in IPTG mice compared to IG mice (p < 0.05, p < 0.05). Conclusion: IL-10 plays an immunoprotective role and improves the pregnancy outcome of T. gondii-infected mice. © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84860391597	Molecular cloning, characterization and expression patterns of HSP60 in the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)	HSP60 is a highly immunogenic molecule, which is able to activate a large number of T cell types and is implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases. The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), a freshwater fish species of the family Cyprinidae, accounts for the third biggest value (USD 4.8 billion) at single species level of major cultured fish species in the world. Here, we isolated and characterized the HSP60 cDNA from grass carp (designated as CiHSP60). Its cDNA was 2434 bp in length and encoded a putative protein of 575 amino acids. BLAST analysis revealed that the CiHSP60 gene shared a high similarity with other known HSP60 sequences. CiHSP60 contained all three classical HSP60 family signatures. The mRNA of CiHSP60 was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues of untreated grass carp, including brain, muscle, trunk kidney, liver, head kidney, skin, spleen, heart, gill, intestine, and fin, with the highest expression level in the blood. CiHSP60 transcript was present in unfertilized eggs, which suggests that CiHSP60 transcription is maternally inherited. Fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of the CiHSP60 gene in grass carp after the challenge with the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila. A clear time-dependent expression pattern of CiHSP60 was found after the bacterial challenge, and the mRNA expression reached a maximum level at three days post challenge, and returned to control levels after seven days. The upregulated mRNA expression of CiHSP60 in grass carp after bacterial challenge indicates that the HSP60 gene is inducible and involved in immune responses. These results suggest that CiHSP60 plays an important role in A. hydrophila-related diseases and in early embryonic development stages in grass carp. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84862787833	Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of the complement component Bf/C2 gene in grass carp	The complement system is an integral part of the host immune system and plays an immunoregulatory role at the interface between the innate and acquired immune responses. Factor B (Bf) serves as the catalytic subunit of complement C3 convertase in the alternative pathway (AP), while in the classical pathway (CP), this function is subjected to C2. In this study, we cloned and characterized the two Bf/C2 genes of grass carp, gcBf/C2A and gcBf/C2B. The gcBf/C2A and gcBf/C2B cDNA sequences are 2259 and 3004 bp in length, and the open reading frames (ORFs) of gcBf/C2A and gcBf/C2B were found to encode peptides of 752 and 837 amino acids, respectively. The genes share 30.7% amino acid identity with each other and 32.4-38.3% and 31.4-33% with the Bf and C2 genes in humans and mice. GcBf/C2A and gcBf/C2B were expressed in a wide range of grass carp tissues, with the highest level of expression of both genes detected in the liver. After a challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila, gcBf/C2A was significantly upregulated, especially at 4 h after infection, and the significantly higher expression of gcBf/C2B (27.3-fold) was found in the head kidney at 24 h post-challenge. The expression of gcBf/C2A was quickly upregulated at 1 day post-hatching and peaked at 5 days post-hatching. The maximum expression of gcBf/C2B was found at 1 day post-hatching. In conclusion, our data enables a better understanding of the physiological function of the Bf/C2 complement genes in vertebrates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863270281	Effects on HepG2 cells growth of the different domains of genotype 1b hepatitis C virus core proteins	Objective: To study the function of core protein (CORE) of genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV) of different strains (T: derived from tumor tissues; NT: derived from non-tumor tissues; C191: HCV-J6) and different domains (1-172, 1-126, 1-58, 59-126, 127-172 AA) of T CORE in the pathogenesis of HCV infection and to find the therapy target. Methods: Different truncated genotype 1b HCV CORE eukaryotic expression plasmids (T, NT, C191) and different domains of T CORE were constructed and transfected to HepG2 cells. Cell apoptosis and necrosis were quantified by flow cytometry. Cell growth curves were observed with real time cell growth instrument. Results: COREs from different strains of genotype 1b and different domains of CORE induced cell apoptosis and necrosis, and inhibited HepG2 cell growth at different levels. CORE derived from T induced apoptosis and necrosis and inhibited cell growth higher than that derived NT and C191. N terminal 1-58 AA of CORE derived from T induced cell apoptosis and necrosis and inhibited cell growth higher than any other domains. Conclusion: COREs from different strains of genotype 1b HCV and different domains of CORE from the same HCV strain play different roles in their molecular pathogenesis of HCV. Among different domains of CORE, N terminal 1-58 AA might play an important role in its pathogenesis and be one target of gene therapy.

84863205894	Matrix metalloproteinase 2 of grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella (CiMMP2) is involved in the immune response against bacterial infection	The gene encoding matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was cloned from grass carp (. Ctenopharyngodon idella), and its expression levels during Aeromonas hydrophila infection and embryonic development stages were evaluated. The complete open reading frame of CiMMP2 was 1974 bp in length, encoding a 658-amino acid polypeptide. The deduced MMP2 protein contained four conserved domain structures, including an N-terminal signal sequence, a propeptide domain, three repeats of fibronectin-type II domain inserted in the catalytic domain and a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain. Phylogenetic analysis of MMP2s grouped grass carp with other teleosts. Detected in all fish tissues examined, CiMMP2 expression increased in the spleen and head kidney at 4 h and was significantly downregulated at 1 d after A. hydrophila infection. CiMMP2 transcripts were present in unfertilized eggs, suggesting its maternal origin. These findings implicate an important role for CiMMP2 in A. hydrophila-related diseases and early embryonic developmental stages of grass carp. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863212189	Expression of complement component C7 and involvement in innate immune responses to bacteria in grass carp	Activation of the complement system, which forms a major part of the innate immune system, results in the formation of the terminal complement complex. The complement component, C7, plays an integral role in the assembly of this complex within target cell membranes. In this study, C7 was isolated and characterized from grass carp, an important cultured fish in China. The predicted amino acid sequence of C7 cDNA (2644 bp) exhibited 55.4 and 48.3% homology with trout C7-1 and zebrafish C7, respectively. The grass carp C7 gene was consisted of 18 exons and 17 introns. C7 gene expression was detected in the trunk kidney, liver, head kidney, skin, spleen, heart and intestine. Significant changes in C7 transcript expression (>20-fold) were detected following Aeromonas hydrophila infection, indicating C7 involvement in innate immune responses to bacteria in teleost fish. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863141435	Correlation of Cyr61 and CTGF in placentas from the late pre-eclamptic pregnancy	It is thought that a shallow invasion of the maternal decidua by extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) is associated with the development of pre-eclampsia. Here, we focus on the expression of the proangiogenic proteins Cyr61 and CTGF in the human placenta during normal pregnancy compared with that in the late pre-eclamptic placenta. Cyr61 and CTGF are expressed in the extravillous trophoblast and in endothelial cells. We found the expression of Cyr61 was significantly decreased in pre-eclamptic placentas compared with matched controls. In contrast, the CTGF expression level was upregulated in pre-eclamptic placentas. There was a negative correlation between Cyr61 and CTGF. These results suggest that decreased Cyr61 and overexpressed CTGF may play a part in the development of pre-eclampsia. Copyright © by Walter de Gruyter · Berlin · Boston.

84869493232	Role and clinicopathologic significance of CXC chemokine ligand 16 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 6 expression in gastric carcinomas	The chemokine ligand CXC chemokine ligand 16 and its receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 6 are up-regulated in many types of cancer and give rise to more aggressive behavior by regulating proliferation and angiogenesis. To clarify the role and clinicopathologic significance of CXC chemokine ligand 16 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 6 expression in gastric carcinoma, their expression was examined by immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays containing gastric carcinoma and nonneoplastic mucosa, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the CXC chemokine ligand 16 concentration in serum. Expression was compared with the clinicopathologic features of the carcinomas. All carcinoma and epithelial cells showed CXC chemokine ligand 16 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 6 messenger RNA expression to various degrees. Among 28 pairs of gastric carcinoma and normal tissues, there was higher CXC chemokine ligand 16 expression in carcinoma than in adjacent mucosa (P <.05), whereas the converse was true for chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 6 (P <.05). Nuclear CXC chemokine ligand 16 expression correlated inversely with the depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, Union Internationale Contre le Cancer stage, and favorable prognosis. The serum CXC chemokine ligand 16 concentration was lower in male patients or patients 55 years or older than in female or younger patients, respectively (P <.05). Patients with lymphatic invasion or mixed-type carcinoma showed lower CXC chemokine ligand 16 concentrations than those with no lymphatic invasion or with diffuse-type carcinoma (P <.05). Aberrant expression of CXC chemokine ligand 16 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 6 might be involved in gastric carcinogenesis. The expression and serum concentration of CXC chemokine ligand 16 could indicate the aggressiveness and prognosis of gastric carcinomas. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84869826192	Effects of recombinant human Elafin gene transfection on lipopolysaccharide-induced airway mucous hypersecretion	Objective: To explore the effects of recombinant human Elafin gene transfection on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced airway mucous hypersecretion. Methods: An eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-Cl-Elafin was first constructed and then transfected into NCI-H292 cell. After co-incubation with polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) plus LPS stimulation for 24 hour, the vital force unit of neutrophil elastase (NE) and the content of mucin (MUC) protein in culture media and the level of MUC 5AC mRNA in culture cells were detected with substrate detection technique, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively. Results: All parameters in control group showed a low level(0.13 ± 0.03, 0.28 ± 0.06, 0.29 ± 0.04 respectively). And transfectiing NCI-H292 cell with pEGFP-Cl at different levels of LPS, all parameters were obviously different (all P <0.01) and they all showed a dose-dependent relationship. After LPS stimulation (0.5, 5 mg/L), as compared with the transfection of NCI-H292 cell with pEGFP-Cl-Elafin, the vital force unit of NE and the content of MUC5AC protein in culture media and the level of MUC 5AC mRNA in transfecting pEGFP-Cl NCI-H292 cell decreased obviously (all P < 0.05). But after LPS stimulation (25 mg/L), as compared with the transfection of NCI-H292 cell with pEGFP-Cl-Elafin, no parameter of transfecting pEGFP-Cl NCI-H292 cell had any obvious alteration (0.67 ± 0.06, 0.64 ± 0.08, 0.67 ± 0.07 respectively, all P >0.05). Conclusion: The transfection of recombinant human elafin gene into NCI-H292 cell may inhibit the force of inflammatory telo-effective factor NE induced by a certain level of LPS and airway mucous hypersecretion. But it can not inhibit the effects induced by a high level of LPS. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84870686852	COL4A3 expression correlates with pathogenesis, pathologic behaviors, and prognosis of gastric carcinomas	COL4A3 protein belongs to type IV collagen family and is closely linked to kidney diseases and cancer. To clarify the roles of COL4A3 in gastric carcinogenesis and subsequent progression, its expression was examined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing gastric carcinomas, adjacent intestinal metaplasia, pure intestinal metaplasia, and gastritis. Gastric carcinoma tissue and cell lines were studied for COL4A3 expression by Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found that COL4A3 was differentially expressed in GES-1, AGS, BGC-823, GT-3 TKB, HGC-27, KATO-III, MGC-803, MKN28, MKN45, SCH, SGC-7901, and STKM-2 at both messenger RNA and protein levels. Carcinomas showed statistically lower COL4A3 expression than matched nonneoplastic mucosa (P <.05). Expression was strong in intestinal metaplasia in comparison with gastritis and carcinoma (P <.05). There was greater COL4A3 expression in carcinoma than gastritis (P <.05). Expression of COL4A3 protein was positively correlated with tumor size, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, and TNM stage (P <.05). There was more COL4A3 expression in diffuse than in intestinal-type carcinomas regardless of invasion into the muscularis propria (P <.05). Histologically, all signet ring cell (n = 43) and mucinous (n = 12) carcinomas showed COL4A3 expression. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that COL4A3 expression was negatively associated with a favorable prognosis of overall, advanced, and intestinal-type gastric carcinomas (P <.05). Aberrant COL4A3 expression might play an important role in the pathogenesis and subsequent progression of gastric carcinoma. COL4A3 overexpression might be used as a marker of gastric intestinal metaplasia and mucinous and signet ring cell carcinoma. Copyright © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84871547316	Pathological and computed tomography findings of lymphoepithelioma-like gastric carcinoma with epithelioid granulomas: A case report	Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is a distinct entity among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinomas, characterized by the presence of a lymphoid stroma with small nests of cancer cells uniformly distributed throughout. Epithelioid granulomas with multinucleated giant cells are extremely rare in the tumor tissue. The presence of epithelioid granulomas with prominent lymphocyte infiltration is associated with a favorable prognosis. This lesion tends to form a bulging mass in the submucosa. In the present study, we report a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the stomach with epithelioid granulomas which appeared as a bulging mass in CT scanning and correlate it with the pathology. Clinicians and radiologists should recognize the features of such tumors.

84871889975	XTH31, encoding an in vitro XEH/XET-active enzyme, regulates aluminum sensitivity by modulating in vivo XET action, cell wall xyloglucan content, and aluminum binding capacity in arabidopsisw	Xyloglucan endohydrolase (XEH) and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET) activities, encoded by xyloglucan endotransglucosylase-hydrolase (XTH) genes, are involved in cell wall extension by cutting or cutting and rejoining xyloglucan chains, respectively. However, the physiological significance of this biochemical activity remains incompletely understood. Here, we find that an XTH31 T-DNA insertion mutant, xth31, is more Al resistant than the wild type. XTH31 is bound to the plasma membrane and the encoding gene is expressed in the root elongation zone and in nascent leaves, suggesting a role in cell expansion. XTH31 transcript accumulation is strongly downregulated by Al treatment. XTH31 expression in yeast yields a protein with an in vitro XEH:XET activity ratio of >5000:1. xth31 accumulates significantly less Al in the root apex and cell wall, shows remarkably lower in vivo XET action and extractable XET activity, has a lower xyloglucan content, and exhibits slower elongation. An exogenous supply of xyloglucan significantly ameliorates Al toxicity by reducing Al accumulation in the roots, owing to the formation of an Al-xyloglucan complex in the medium, as verified by an obvious change in chemical shift of

84872816373	A novel tumor metastasis suppressor gene LASS2/TMSG1 interacts with vacuolar ATPase through its homeodomain	LASS2/TMSG1 was a novel tumor metastasis suppressor gene, which was first cloned by our laboratory from non-metastatic and metastatic cancer cell variants of human prostate carcinoma PC-3M using mRNA differential display in 1999. LASS2/TMSG1 could interact with the C subunit of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase, ATP6V0C) and regulate V-ATPase activity. In an attempt to provide molecular mechanism of the interaction between LASS2/TMSG1 and V-ATPase, we constructed four variant transfectants containing different functional domain of LASS2/TMSG1 and stably transfected the variants to human prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-1E8 cell with high metastatic potential. Results showed that there were no obvious differences of V-ATPase expression among different transfected cells and the control. However, V-ATPase activity and intracellular pH was significantly higher in the variant transfectants with Homeodomain of LASS2/TMSG1 than that in the control using the pH-dependent fluorescence probe BECEF/AM. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscope alone or in combination demonstrated the direct interaction of Homeodomain of LASS2/TMSG1 and ATP6V0C. Loss of Homeodomain markedly enhanced the proliferation ability but weakened the apoptotic effect of LASS2/TMSG1 in PC-3M-1E8 cells. These lines of results for the first time contribute to the conclusion that LASS2/TMSG1 could regulate V-ATPase activity and intracellular pH through the direct interaction of its Homeodomain and the C subunit of V-ATPase. Their interaction could play important roles in the apoptosis of tumor cells. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 570-583, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84873698010	Decreased adiponectin level is associated with aggressive phenotype of tongue squamous cell carcinoma	Circulating adiponectin levels are inversely associated with risk of various obesity-related cancers. However, the effect of adiponectin on carcinogenesis and progression of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) remains unknown. We measured serum adiponectin levels in 59 patients with TSCC and 50 healthy controls. Expression of adiponectin and its receptors in paired tumor and paracancerous specimens were determined by immunohistochemical staining (n = 37) and western blot (n = 30), respectively. Serum adiponectin level was lower in patients than in controls (5.0 ± 2.4 vs 8.4 ± 3.5 μg/mL, P < 0.01), and was inversely associated with histological grade and lymph node metastasis but not tumor size. Local adiponectin levels in tumor tissue gradually decreased as tumor-node-metastasis stage increased, while the expression of adiponectin receptors was unchanged. In addition, serum adiponectin levels in the TSCC patients without metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, or without smoking and drinking habits, were still lower than in controls. Furthermore, adiponectin inhibited the migration, but not proliferation, of SCC15 cells in vitro. These results indicate that a decreased adiponectin level is associated with risk of TSCC. Hypoadiponectinemia might be used as a biomarker to predict an aggressive phenotype of TSCC. © 2012 Japanese Cancer Association.

84873918557	IL-10 Reduces Levels of Apoptosis in Toxoplasma gondii-Infected Trophoblasts	Background: To analyze the effects of IL-10 on the HLA-G expression and the apoptosis of trophoblasts infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Methods: T. gondii-infected or uninfected human trophoblasts and immortalized human placental BeWo cells were cultured with or without human IL-10. Uninfected and infected cells without IL-10 cells served as controls. HLA-G expression was measured by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Cells apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis associated moleculars were measured by real-time PCR and Western bolt. Results: HLA-G expression was increased in the infected trophoblasts and BeWo cells compared to uninfected cells. Treatment of infected cells with IL-10 decreased HLA-G expression compared to infected cells while no change in treatment of uninfected cells compared with uninfected cells. Levels of apoptosis and apoptosis associated caspase-3 and caspase-8 decreased and c-FLIP levels increased in treated infected cells with IL-10 compared to infected cells and no difference in IL-10 treated uninfected cells compared to uninfected cells. Conclusions: IL-10 regulates HLA-G expression in T. gondii-infected trophoblasts. IL-10 treatment of infected trophoblasts reduced levels of apoptosis. This may contribute to the improvement in pregnancy outcomes when women infected with T. gondii treated with IL-10. © 2013 Zhao et al.

84873495391	Toxoplasma gondii Infection Regulates the Balance of Activating and Inhibitory Receptors on Decidual Natural Killer Cells	Inhibitory receptors and activating receptor expressed on decidual natural killer (dNK) cells are generally believed to be important in abnormal pregnancy outcomes and induced adverse pregnancy. However, if Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection induced abnormal pregnancy was related to dNK cells changes is not clear. In this study, we used human dNK cells co-cultured with human extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVT) cells following YFP-Toxoplasma gondii (YFP-T. gondii) infection in vitro and established animal pregnant infection model. Levels of inhibitory receptors KIR2DL4 and ILT-2, their ligand HLA-G, and activating receptor NKG2D in human decidua, and NKG2A and its ligand Qa-1 and NKG2D in mice uterine were analyzed by real-time PCR and flow cytometry with levels of NKG2D significantly higher than those of KIR2DL4 and ILT-2 in vitro and in invo. The level of NKG2D was positively correlated with cytotoxic activity of dNK cells in vitro. Numbers of abnormal pregnancies were significantly greater in the infected group than in the control group. This result demonstrated that the increased NKG2D expression and imbalance between inhibitory receptors of dNK cells and HLA-G may contribute to abnormal pregnancy outcomes observed upon maternal infection with T. gondii. © 2013 Xu et al.

84875727802	Gene therapy with HSV1-sr39TK/GCV exhibits a stronger therapeutic efficacy than HSV1-TK/GCV in rat C6 glioma cells	Although the combination of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase (TK) with ganciclovir (GCV) has been shown as a promising suicide gene treatment strategy for glioma, the almost immunodepressive dose of GCV required for its adequate in vivo efficacy has hampered its further clinical application. Therefore, In order to reduce the GCV dose required, we aim to compare the therapeutic efficacy of HSV1-sr39TK, an HSV1-TK mutant with increased GCV prodrug catalytic activity, with wildtype TK in C6 glioma cells. Accordingly, rat C6 glioma cells were first transfected with pCDNA-TK and pCDNA-sr39TK, respectively, and the gene transfection efficacy was verified by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. Then the in vivo sensitivity of these transfected C6-TK and C6-sr39TK cells to GCV was determined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo-(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) colorimetric assay and Hoechst-propidium iodide (PI) staining. Finally, a subcutaneously C6 xenograft tumor model was established in the nude mice to test the in vitro efficacy of TK/GCV gene therapy. Our results showed that, as compared with wildtype TK, HSV1-sr39TK/GCV demonstrated a stronger therapeutic efficacy against C6 glioma both in vitro and in vivo, which, by reducing the required GCV dose, might warrant its future use in the treatment of glioma under clinical setting. © 2013 Lei-qing Li et al.

Methods: Twenty-four pregnant C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups equally. The infection group was intraperitoneally injected with 200 of living T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites on the 8th day of gestation, and the normal group of mice was injected with physiological saline. All mice were killed on day 14 after gestation and placentas were collected. The expression levels of Crry, GPI-DAF and CD59a mRNA were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, and the positive rates of Crry and GPI-DAF were measured with flow cytometry. Results: The died fetus rates of infected group and control were 80.95% and 4.41%, respectively. The infected group was significantly higher than of that the control group (P ≤ 0.01). The expression levels of Crry, GPI-DAF and CD59a mRNA in the infected and control group were 0.786 ± 0.199, 0.594 ± 0.096, 0.880 ± 0.179 and 0.550 ± 0.077, 0.221 ± 0.074, 0.591 ± 0.075, respectively, and the difference of three kind of complement regulation proteins between two groups was all significant (P ≤ 0.01). The positive percentages of Crry and GPI-DAF cells of infected and control group were (10.03 ± 2.11)%, (2.95 ± 1.04)% and (3.15 ± 1.32)%, (0.66 ± 0.26)%, respectively, and the difference of the two kind complement regulation proteins between two groups was also significant (P ≤ 0.01). Conclusion: The expression level of mouse placental complement regulatory proteins was increased after infection with T. gondii, and then immunological microenvironment at the fetomaternal interface was destroyed.

84875814903	A new haplotype variability in complement C6 is marginally associated with resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila in grass carp	Aeromonas hydrophila, a widespread bacterium in the aquatic environment, causes haemorrhagic septicemia in fish. In the last decade, the disease has caused mass mortality and tremendous economic loss in cultured grass carp in the mainland China. The complement component C6 is a constituent of a biochemical cascade that serves as a major effector of the human innate and adaptor immunity, and eliminates infected cells. The objective of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the C6 gene and to assess their association with A. hydrophila resistance in grass carp. A resource population consisting of 186 susceptible and 191 resistant grass carp was constructed. The gcC6 genomic sequence is composed of 9292 bp, containing 18 exons and 17 introns. The promoter sequence of gcC6 gene contained several consensus sequences for hepatic-specific transcription factors. We sequenced a total of 9744 bp of the C6 gene from a diverse population of grass carp and identified 8 SNPs that were genotyped in the resource population.

Two hundred and eight (208) specimens of surgically resected NSCLC were stained by immunohistochemistry utilizing mouse anti-human HAb18G/CD147 monoclonal antibody. High levels of HAb18G/CD147 expression were associated with male gender, smoking history, tumor position, distant metastasis status, and clinical stage (p<0.05) in squamous cell carcinoma. In adenocarcinomas, HAb18G/CD147 expression was associated with male gender, tumor diameter, differentiation, lymph node status, distant metastasis status, and clinical stage (p<0.05). HAb18G/CD147 expression with higher PU was predominantly localized in the tumor cell membranes rather than in cytoplasms. In squamous cell carcinomas, membranous localization of HAb18G/CD147 was linked to distant metastasis status and TNM stage (p<0.05). Cytoplasmic localization of HAb18G/CD147 was associated with male gender and smoking history. In adenocarcinomas, membranous localization of HAb18G/CD147 correlated with tumor diameter, differentiation and distant metastasis (p<0.05). Univariate analysis indicated that patients with high HAb18G/CD147 expression and membranous localization predicted poor prognosis in both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node status (HR = 1.762, 95%CI 1.105-2.811, p=0.017), distant metastasis status (HR = 3.789, 95%CI 2.196-6.539, p=0.000), expression (HR = 6.632, 95%CI 2.457-17.904, p=0.000), and localization (HR = 0.520, 95%CI 0.341-0.794, p=0.002) were good or excellent independent predictors of patient survival. HAb18G/CD147 is a biomarker characterizing progression and survival of NSCLC. More importantly, its cellular localizations should be considered in the analysis of clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors in NSCLC. © 2013.

84882815515	Characterization of MMP-9 gene from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella): An Aeromonas hydrophila-inducible factor in grass carp immune system	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) belongs to a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases and is associated with vital inflammatory processes. Here, we isolated and characterized MMP-9 cDNA from grass carp. (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (designated as CiMMP-9). The cDNA was 2880 bp long and encoded a putative protein of 675 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 75.816kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.25. CiMMP-9 contained all three classical MMP-9 family signatures. The mRNA of CiMMP-9 was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues of untreated grass carp, with the highest expression levels in the blood, trunk kidney, head kidney and spleen. CiMMP9 transcript was present in unfertilized eggs, which suggests that CiMMP9 transcription is maternally inherited. Fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of the CiMMP-9 gene in C.idella after being challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila. A clear time-dependent expression pattern of CiMMP-9 was found after the bacterial challenge, and mRNA expression reached a maximum level at 7 days post challenge. This indicates that MMP-9 is inducible and is involved in immune responses, thus suggesting that CiMMP-9 plays an important role in A.hydrophila-related diseases and in early embryonic development stages in C.idella. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84883453979	Expression of HAb18G in non-small lung cancer and characterization of activation, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis in A549 cells following siRNA-induced downregulation of HAb18G	HAb18G, a novel cancer biomarker, has been shown to be involved in the progression of malignancy by regulating expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs). The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of HAb18G in the biology of NSCLC and to determine its potential as a therapeutic target. HAb18G protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 150 NSCLC tissues. The results showed that HAb18G protein expression was associated with tumor diameter, lymph node status, tumor stage, and poor prognosis (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that HAb18G overexpression was an independent prognostic factor (HR, 3.713; 95 % CI, 1.114-12.373; P = 0.033). Transient infection of A549 lung cancer cells with small interfering RNA (SiRNA) against HAb18G efficiently inhibited the expression of HAb18G in A549 lung cancer cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Downregulation of HAb18G not only reduced MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF at mRNA and protein levels in A549 cells, but also inhibited fibroblasts to secrete MMP-2 and MMP-9 at mRNA level. Additionally, downregulation of HAb18G mRNA resulted in decreased migration, proliferation, and increased apoptosis of A549 in vitro. Our findings suggest that HAb18G overexpression plays an important role in progression of NSCLC and HAb18G may be a potential target of NSCLC therapy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84885426537	PBK/TOPK expression in non-small-cell lung cancer: Its correlation and prognostic significance with Ki67 and p53 expression	Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PBK/TOPK (PDZ-binding kinase/T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase) expression, and explore the prognostic significance of PBK/TOPK expression alone and in combination with Ki67 and p53 expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods and results: We detected PBK/TOPK expression in 30 samples of normal lung tissue, 32 lymph node metastases and 279 primary non-small-cell lung cancers by immunohistochemistry, and analysed the correlation of PBK/TOPK expression with Ki67 and p53 expression in primary tumour tissues. The results showed that PBK/TOPK expression was higher in lymph node metastases (75%) than in primary tumours (44.8%) and normal lung tissues (0%). PBK/TOPK expression was associated with histological type, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage, and was positively correlated with Ki67 and p53 expression in NSCLC. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses showed that PBK/TOPK expression was significantly associated with an unfavourable prognosis in NSCLC. The prognosis of patients with tumours positive for both PBK/TOPK expression and Ki67 or p53 expression was also significantly unfavourable. Conclusions: PBK/TOPK expression is positively correlated with Ki67 and p53 expression, and can be used as an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84886751203	Multiplex microsatellite PCR sets for parentage assignment of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)	Pedigree information is essential for the genetic improvement of traits of interests in breeding programs. In this study, twelve microsatellite loci were selected to optimize three multiplex PCR protocols for parentage assignment in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). One hundred and fifty adult fish and 252 progenies produced from three pilot groups (P1, P2, and P3) were used to examine the power of the three multiplex microsatellite PCR sets for parentage analysis. The average number of alleles (Na) per locus, observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He), and polymorphism (PIC) were 21.83, 0.883, 0.882, and 0.869, respectively. The combined exclusion power using all loci was greater than 99.99 %. Simulation analysis revealed a high assignment success rate (100 %). Parentage analysis of real offspring demonstrated that 99.6 % of all offspring were unambiguously allocated to single pairs of parents. Our results indicate that these three multiplex PCR sets could be used in pedigree reconstruction for grass carp breeding. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84888200660	Changes of inhibitory receptors on NK-92 cells and HLA-G on BeWo cells with toxoplasma gondii infection	The aim of this study were to demonstrate the effects of Yellow fluorescent protein-Toxoplasma gondii infection on the NK-92 cells co-cultured with BeWo cells in vitro and to verify the implications upon adverse pregnancy outcome. There are four groups including NK-92 cells infected or uninfected with T. gondii, and NK-92 cells co-cultured with BeWo cells in the presence or absent of T. gondii infection. Cells were observed by fluorescence microscope at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h after infection. Levels of inhibitory receptors killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)2DL4 and ILT-2 expressed on NK-92 cells, and their common ligand HLA-G expressed on BeWo cells were measured by real-time PCR and flow cytometry in all groups. Levels of KIR2DL4, ILT-2 and HLA-G increased at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, while decreased at 60 h in all T. gondii-infected groups compared with their parallel control groups, respectively. KIR2DL4 and ILT-2 expression in co-culture groups with infection were higher than those in infected NK-92 groups at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, while there were no significant differences at 60 h. The expression of the two inhibitory receptors was correlated with HLA-G expression in infected co-culture groups. The changes of inhibitory receptors on NK-92 cells and their common ligand HLA-G on BeWo cells with T. gondii infection might contribute to the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcome. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84889084561	WRKY46 functions as a transcriptional repressor of ALMT1, regulating aluminum-induced malate secretion in Arabidopsis	Aluminum (Al) toxicity is the major limiting factor for crop production on acid soils, but the transcriptional regulation of Al tolerance genes is largely unknown. Here, we found that the expression of a WRKY domain-containing transcription factor WRKY46 is inhibited by Al and expressed in root stele, whereas the expression of ALMT1, which encodes a malate efflux transporter, is induced by Al stress and spatially co-localized with WRKY46 in root stele, indicating the possible interaction between WRKY46 and ALMT1 in Arabidopsis. Mutation of WRKY46 by T-DNA insertion leads to better root growth under Al stress, and lower root Al content compared with the wild-type Col-0. The wrky46 mutant shows increased root malate secretion, which is consistent with the higher ALMT1 expression in the mutant. Transient expression analysis using truncated promoter of ALMT1 showed that ALMT1 expression can be inhibited by WRKY46 in tobacco leaves. The yeast one-hybrid assay and ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that WRKY46 directly binds to ALMT1 promoter through specific W-boxes. Taken together, we demonstrated that WRKY46 is a negative regulator of ALMT1, mutation of WRKY46 leads to increased malate secretion and reduced Al accumulation in root apices, and thus confers higher Al resistance. © 2013 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84893159790	Determination of reference microRNAs for relative quantification in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)	Relative quantification is the strategy of choice for processing real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data in microRNA (miRNA) expression studies. Normalization of relative quantification data is performed by comparison to reference genes. In teleost species, such as grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), the determination of reference miRNAs and the optimal numbers of these that should be used has not been widely studied. In the present study, the stability of seven miRNAs (miR-126-3p, miR-101a, miR-451, miR-22a, miR-146, miR-142a-5p and miR-192) was investigated by RT-qPCR in different tissues and in different development stages of grass carp. Stability values were calculated with geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and Delta CT algorithms. The results showed that tissue type is an important variability factor for miRNA expression stability. All seven miRNAs had good stability values and, therefore, could be used as reference miRNAs. When all tissues and developmental stages were considered, miR-101a was the most stable miRNA. When each tissue type was considered separately, the most stable miRNAs were 126-3p in blood and liver, 101a in the gills, 192 in the kidney, 451 in the intestine and 22a in the brain, head kidney, spleen, heart, muscle, skin and fin. 126-3p was the most stable reference miRNA gene during developmental stages 1-5, while 22a was the most stable during developmental stages 6-18. Overall, this study provides valuable information about the reference miRNAs that can be used to perform appropriate normalizations when undertaking relative quantification in RT-qPCR studies of grass carp. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84896818424	Saikosaponin-d affects the differentiation, maturation and function of monocyte-derived dendritic cells	Saikosaponin-d (Ssd) is a triterpenoid saponin derived from Bupleurum falcatum L., which has been shown to exhibit a variety of pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antiviral properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Ssd on the differentiation, maturation and function of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from condylomata acuminata patients. The results of the present study demonstrated that Ssd reduced the differentiation of DCs, as evidenced by decreased expression levels of cluster of differentiation (CD)1a, CD80 and CD86 molecules and increased CD14 expression. Expression levels of the mannose receptor and CD32 were also significantly elevated, which was associated with enhanced fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran endocytic activity. Furthermore, Ssd treatment promoted DC maturation by increasing the expression levels of CD40, CD83, CD80 and CD86. In addition, the function of mature DCs, including the secretion of IL-12 and the stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation, was significantly increased following Ssd administration. In conclusion, the present study indicated that Ssd exhibited immunomodulatory effects and may be a novel potent chemopreventive drug candidate for the treatment of condylomata acuminata.

84898731758	LASS2/TMSG1 gene silencing promotes the invasiveness and metastatic of human prostatic carcinoma cells through increase in vacuolar ATPase activity	Objective To explore the effects of LASS2/TMSG 1 silencing on the growth, invasion and metastasis of prostate carcinoma cells and to investigate the related molecular mechanisms. Methods LASS2/TMSGI expression of human prostate carcinoma cell line with low metastatic potenlality (PC-3M-284 cells) was knocked down using DNA vector-based small interfering RNA (shRNA), followed by evaluations of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Results A stable PC-3M-2B4 cell line with expression of LASS2/TMSG1-shRNA was successfully established. Mn assay showed PC-3M-2B4 cells exhibited a strong proliferation after transfection of LASS2/TMSGI -shRNA. LASS2/TMSGI -shRNA transfected clones demonstrated an increased clonogenicity by soft agar colony forniation assay and a ignificant increase of tumor cell invasion by matrigel invasion study. Flow cytometry showed that after LASS2/TMSGI gene silencing, the apoptotic rate of PC-3M-2B4 cell significantly decreased (P <0. 01) without significant cell cycle change (P > 0. 05). Eight weeks after implantation into subcutaneous tissues in HAL B/c (nu mice, the size and weight of sh-LASS2/TMSGI xenografts were significantly larger than those of the control group (P <0. 05). Nuclear proliferation index of the subcutaneous tumor was also higher in the LASS2/TMSGI shRNA group than those in the control group. Lymph node metastasis was observed in 5 of 6 mice of LASS2/TMSG1 shRNA group and only 1 of 6 of the control group. V-ATPase activity, activities of secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 and extracellular hydrogen ion concentration were significantly increased in LASS2/ TMSGI-shRNA group compared with the control group (P <0.05). Conclusion Silencing of LASS2/ TMSGI promotes the growth, invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells through up-regulation of V-ATPase activity, indicating that LASS2/TMSG1 is a tumor metastasis suppressor gene.

84899064118	PDGF mediates derivation of human embryonic germ cells	Human embryonic germ cells (hEGCs) are a valuable and underutilized source of pluripotent stem cells. Unlike embryonic stem cells, which have been extensively studied, little is known about the factors that regulate hEGC derivation and maintenance. This study demonstrates for the first time a central role for selective activation of PDGFR signaling in the derivation and maintenance of pluripotency in hEGCs. In the study, hEGCs were found to express PDGF receptor α at high levels compared to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). PDGF significantly improved formation of alkaline phosphatase (AP) positive hEGC colonies. We subsequently determined that PDGF activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway as phosphorylation of AKT was up-regulated in response to PDGF. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K signaling using small molecular inhibitor LY294002 led to significantly decreased AP positive hEGC colony formation whereas inhibition of MAPK pathway using U0126 had a negligible effect. We established a primary mechanism for PDGF mediated derivation and maintenance of hEGCs by demonstrating that OCT4 was upregulated and PTEN was suppressed in a dose dependent manner in response to PDGF. © 2014 International Society of Differentiation.

84899128146	Association between IL-4 -589C>T polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk	In order to make a comprehensive assessment of the potential association between interleukin-4 (IL-4) -589C>T and colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility, we conducted a meta-analysis of six epidemiological studies, which included 1,317 CRC patients and 1,659 controls. The data showed that IL-4 -589C>T was not associated with increased CRC risk in the overall population. In the subgroup analysis of IL-4 -589C>T, the results did not change when the analyses were restricted to race. Based on this meta-analysis, we conclude that IL-4 -589C>T may be not a risk factor for CRC development. Further research is needed to assess possible gene-gene or gene-environment-lifestyle interactions on CRC. © 2013 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

84900901737	Down-regulated MAC30 expression inhibits proliferation and mobility of human gastric cancer cells	Background: Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. MAC30/Transmembrane protein 97 (TMEM97) is aberrantly up-regulated in many human carcinoma cells. However, the function of MAC30 in gastric carcinoma cells is not studied. Material and Methods: To investigate the function of MAC30 in gastric carcinoma, we used RNA silencing technology to knock down the expression of MAC30 in gastric cancer cells BGC-823 and AGS. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the mRNA level and the related protein expression. The localization of MAC30 and lamellipodia was observed by immunofluorescence. The biological phenotypes of gastric cells were examined by cell proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay, cell migration and invasion assay. Results: We found that down-regulation of MAC30 expression efficiently inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, the mobility of gastric cancer cells was also inhibited by down-regulation of MAC30. Moreover, we found that MAC30 knockdown inhibited AKT phosphorylation and reduced the expression of cyclinB1 and WAVE2. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report investigating the effect of MAC30 on growth, cell cycle, migration, and invasion in gastric carcinoma cells via suppressing AKT signaling pathway. MAC30 may be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of gastric carcinoma. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Methods: From January 2002 to January 2004, 74 and 79 infants with cerebral palsy who were less than three years old received the treatment of CE and CE + Cerebrolysin + Salvin Miltiorrbiza respectively in the Departments of Pediatric and Rehabilitation Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. One-year follow-up was conducted in all the infants. Results: The total effective rate was 68.92% for the single CE group and 87.34% for the combination group. And there was a significant difference between the two groups(P < 0.01). After one-year treatment, the mean developmental quotients(DQ) were 58.36 ± 16.34 in the single CE group and 69.38 ± 17.32 in the combination group, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (F = 12.38, P < 0.01). Conclusion: CE is effective to treat infants with cerebral palsy, and CE combined with drugs for nourishing brain cells and removing blood stasis is more effective, and also has great effect on the DQ of infants with cerebral palsy.
