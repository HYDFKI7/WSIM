84927124450	Wave reflections, arterial stiffness, heart rate variability and orthostatic hypotension	Increased arterial stiffness and wave reflections are independently associated with orthostatic hypotension (OH). This study investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) is also involved in the modulation of orthostatic blood pressure (BP) change. A total of 429 subjects (65.1±16.4 years, 77.4% men) were enrolled in this study. OH was defined as a ≥20 mm Hg decrease in brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a ≥10 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease upon standing. Measurements of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) and the amplitude of the reflected pressure wave from a decomposed carotid pressure wave (Pb) were obtained by carotid tonometry in the supine position. The power spectrum from a 5-min recording of an electrocardiogram at rest was analyzed to provide components in the high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) ranges. Subjects with OH (n=59, 13.8%) had significantly higher cf-PWV and Pb and significantly lower LogHF and LogLF than those without OH (n=370). The cf-PWV, Pb, LogHF and LogLF were significantly associated with postural SBP and DBP changes. Furthermore, cf-PWV but not Pb was significantly associated with LogHF and LogLF. Multivariate analysis showed that Pb (odds ratio (OR) per 1 s.d. 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.282-2.137; P=0.003) and LogHF (OR 0.628, 95% CI 0.459-0.860, P=0.004), but not cf-PWV (OR 1.279, 95% CI 0.932-1.755, P=0.128), were significant independent determinants of OH. Increased wave reflections may predispose OH independently of arterial stiffness and HRV. In contrast, increased arterial stiffness may cause OH through the modulation of HRV.

14244260498	Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in a large health check-up population in Taiwan	Background. Metabolic syndrome is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the development of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in a large health check-up population in Taiwan. Methods. During the period of 2000-2001, about 120,000 adults aged 20 years and above received health check-ups at the MJ Health Screening Centers. Among these, 24,329 participants with complete data on waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting levels of glucose, triglyceride, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were randomly selected for analysis. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was estimated according to the criteria proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP III), with adoption of the Asian criteria for abdominal obesity. Results. Based on the strict NCEP III criteria, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 9.5% (10.6% in men and 8.1% in women, respectively); with Asian criteria for waist circumference, 12.9% (15.5% in men and 10.5% in women, respectively). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased with age. Prevalences of all components of metabolic syndrome increased sharply with age in women. In contrast, the prevalences of high triglyceride and low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol flattened and declined after the age of 50 years in men. Therefore, the gender difference resulted in a cross-over of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome between men and women at the age of 60 years. Conclusions. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in a physical check-up population is significantly affected by age and gender. Age- and gender-specific strategies may be useful in the control of the syndrome.

16244378206	The prevalence and risk factors of hyperuricemia in a community-based study among Kinmen Island adults ≥ 30 years old in 1991-1994	Objectives: The purpose of present study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of hyperuricemia in Kinmen Island. Methods: A total of 11,922 residents aged ≥30 years completed all examinations of the survey in Kinmen Island between 1991 and 1994. The response rate was 59.3% (11,922/20,112). The physical examination and structured questionnaire were carried out by the Yang-Ming Crusade, a group of well-trained medical students. Overnight fasting blood was collected by public health nurses. The risk factors of hyperuricemia were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Results: The crude prevalence of hyperuricemia, defined as serum uric acid ≥7.0mg/dl for men and ≥6.0mg/dl for women, was 25.4% (31.0% for men, 20.9% for women). The means and standard deviation of uric acid were 6.3±1.5mg/dl for men and 5.0±1.4mg/ dl for women. Men had higher uric acid levels than women (p<0.05). According to the age and sex spectrum, the risk factors of hyperuricemia were hyperlipidemia, high creatinine, obesity, and hypertension among young men and women, aged 30-39 years old and menopausal for women. Middle and old aged group (40-59 yrs and ≥60 yrs) had the same risk factors as young aged group except alcohol consumption of man and the use of diuretics in both sexes. Conclusions: The risk factors of hyperuricemia were changed by sex and age. Use of diuretics became more important for middle-aged and elderly subjects. Alcohol consumption for men and menopausal for women were the most important risk factors of hyperuricemia.

29544445291	Systolic time intervals revisited: Correlations with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in a community population	The usefulness of automated measurements of the systolic time intervals in community screening deserves investigation. The systolic time intervals, including pre-ejection period (PEP), the left ventricular ejection time (LVET), and PEP/LVET were automatically and rapidly determined from signals of electrocardiography, phonocardiography, and pulse volume recording in 1087 residents aged ≥40 years in a community of homogeneous Chinese. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was performed to determine the cutoff values for PEP, ET, and PEP/LVET in predicting high N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). The prevalence of high NT-proBNP was 12.3% in men and 8.3% in women. NT-proBNP was linearly related to both PEP and PEP/LVET, while there was a U-shaped relationship between NT-proBNP and LVET. In men, the sensitivity and specificity in predicting high NT-proBNP levels were 60% and 60%, respectively, for PEP ≥ 89ms; 60% and 62% for PEP/LVET ≥ 0.31; and 63% and 60% for LVET < 272ms or LVET ≥ 310ms. Various combinations of the criteria further improved either sensitivity or specificity. Women had slightly different cutoff values and performance for the various criteria of abnormal systolic time intervals and their combinations. Automated systolic time intervals appear to be useful in the screening of subjects with high NT-proBNP in a community. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.

32844469027	Effect of ramipril on left ventricular mass in normotensive hemodialysis patients	Background: Normotensive hemodialysis patients may still have left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of significant pressure or volume overload. We examined the hypothesis that treatment with an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor could be beneficial in the reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy in these patients. Methods: Forty-six normotensive patients with end-stage renal disease on regular hemodialysis therapy were randomly assigned to administration of ramipril, 2.5 mg 3 times/wk, or placebo for 1 year. Left ventricular mass index and parameters of cardiovascular structure and function were evaluated noninvasively by means of echocardiography and arterial tonometry at baseline, 6 and 12 months after treatment, and 1 month after washout. Results: In the ramipril group, blood pressure decreased significantly at 6 and 12 months after treatment. There were no significant within-group or between-group differences in left ventricular mass index at entry, 6 and 12 months after treatment, and 1 month after washout. There were no significant differences in left atrial dimension, left ventricular size and wall thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction, aortic dimension, intima-media thickness, elastic modulus and augmentation index of the common carotid artery, and aortic pulse wave velocity between the ramipril and placebo groups at entry, 6 and 12 months after treatment, and 1 month after washout. Conclusion: A 12-month treatment with ramipril did not cause significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in normotensive hemodialysis patients. Results may suggest that the renin-angiotensin system has little role in the pathogenesis of mild left ventricular hypertrophy in these patients. © 2006 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

33645562867	Screening for low bone mass with quantitative ultrasonography in a community without dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry: Population-based survey	Background: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the criterion standard to identify low bone mineral density (BMD), but access to axial DXA may be limited or cost prohibitive. We screened for low bone mass with quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) in a community without DXA, analyzed its reliability and obtained reference values and estimated the prevalence of low QUS values. Methods: We enrolled 6493 residents of Kinmen, Taiwan, and a reference group (96 men and 70 women aged 20-29 years) for this cross-sectional, community-based study. All participants completed a questionnaire and underwent ultrasonographic measurements. Reliability and validity of QUS measurements were evaluated. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) values were obtained and statistically analyzed by age, sex and weight. Annual loss of BUA was determined. Trends in the prevalence of QUS scores were evaluated. Results: Two QUS were used and had a correlation coefficient of 0.90 (p < 0.001). Calcaneal BUA was significantly correlated with BMD in the femoral neck (r = 0.67, p < 0.001) and BMD of the total lumbar spine (r = 0.59, p < 0.001). BUAs in the reference group were 92.72 ± 13.36 and 87.90 ± 10.68 dB/MHz for men and women, respectively. Estimated annual losses of calcaneal BUA were 0.83% per year for women, 0.27% per year for men, and 0.51% per year for the total population. The prevalence of severely low QUS values (T-score = -2.5) tended to increase with aging in both sexes (p < 0.001). Across age strata, moderately low QUS values (-2.5 < T-score < -1.0) were 31.6-41.0% in men and 23.7-38.1% in women; a significant trend with age was observed in men (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Age-related decreases in calcaneal ultrasonometry, which reflected the prevalence of low bone mass, were more obvious in women than in men. © 2006Yang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33745466892	A community-based epidemiologic study of gender differences in the relationship between insulin resistance/β-cell dysfunction and diabetic retinopathy among type 2 diabetic patients in Kinmen, Taiwan	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore whether there were gender differences in the relation of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction to diabetic retinopathy among type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: From 1999 to 2002, a screening regimen for diabetic retinopathy was performed by a panel of ophthalmologists using ophthalmoscopy and 45-degree color fundus photography to examine the fundus in a total of 971 type 2 diabetic patients examined between 1991 and 1993 in Kinmen, Taiwan. Seven hundred and twenty-five type 2 diabetic patients (301 males and 424 females) attended ophthalmological fundus checkup. Results: The response rate in males and females was 71.3 and 77.2%. The proportion of diabetic retinopathy at the first eye screening was 16.3% in males and 20.1% in females. From the multiple logistic regression, the type of diabetes (known cases vs. new cases) was a significant factor of diabetic retinopathy in both males (OR = 3.65, 95% CI: 1.59-8.37) and females (OR = 3.66, 95% CI: 2.01-6.70). Diabetic retinopathy was also strongly affected by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR) and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell dysfunction (HOMA β-cell) (p < 0.0001 for trend test). In males, those who were in the 2nd quartile, 3rd quartile, and 4th quartile of HOMA IR had 4.87 times (95% CI: 1.18-20.11), 6.83 times (95% CI: 1.91-24.46), and 10.15 times (95% CI: 2.42-42.56) the risk for diabetic retinopathy as compared to those in the 1st quartile. There was a reduced risk for diabetic retinopathy in relation to HOMA β-cell for the 2nd quartile, 3rd quartile, and 4th quartile of 86% (95% CI: 37-97%), 95% (95% CI: 77-99%), and 96% (95% CI: 78-99%) as compared to that in the 1st quartile. Only the 4th quartile had a significant risk (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.17-5.86) for diabetic retinopathy as compared to that in the 1st quartile in females. The reduced risk for diabetic retinopathy found in relation to HOMA β-cell for the 3rd and 4th quartiles were 66% (95% CI: 6-88%) and 66% (95% CI: 10-87%) as compared to that in the 1st quartile. Conclusions: Gender differences in the relationship between insulin resistance/β-cell dysfunction and diabetic retinopathy were demonstrated in type 2 diabetic patients. Copyright © 2006 S.

33746312418	Presence and Progression of Abdominal Obesity Are Predictors of Future High Blood Pressure and Hypertension	Background: General obesity and its progression are major predictors of future hypertension. It has not been established whether abdominal obesity contributes to the development of hypertension. Methods: A community-based study population of 2377 normotensive nondiabetic Chinese adults aged ≥30 years were re-examined 10 years after their baseline examination. Results: The 10-year cumulative incidence of hypertension was 25.9%. The standardized parameters for the prediction of follow-up systolic blood pressure (BP) for baseline body mass index (BMI), change in BMI, baseline homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), change in HOMA-IR, baseline waist circumference (WC), and change in WC were 0.19 (P < .001), 0.09 (P < .001), 0.11 (P < .001), 0.08 (P < .001), 0.16 (P < .001), and 0.07 (P < .001), respectively, when age, sex, and baseline systolic BP were accounted for. By stepwise linear regression analysis, age, baseline systolic BP, baseline BMI, change in BMI, baseline WC, and change in WC were significant predictors of the follow-up systolic BP. Both baseline WC and change in WC were significant predictors of follow-up systolic BP or incident hypertension when age, sex, baseline systolic BP, BMI, and change in BMI were accounted for. In a subgroup of younger adults with normal BMI and BP<130/85 mm Hg, baseline systolic BP, change in HOMA-IR, baseline WC, and change in WC were significantly independent predictors of follow-up systolic BP. Conclusion: Abdominal obesity and its progression are predictors of future BP and hypertension incidence, independent of the effects of general obesity. © 2006 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

33746827545	Community-based study on summer-winter differences of component of metabolic syndrome in Kinmen, Taiwan	Background.: A community-based study was conducted to investigate summer-winter differences of component of metabolic syndrome in Kinmen, Taiwan. Methods.: A total of 8251 residents aged 40 and over were enrolled in the mass survey in Kinmen. They were investigated while on summer (July and August) and winter vacation (January and February) during 2000-2003. Demographics, physical examination findings, lifestyle variables and biochemical data were collected. Results.: After controlling for age, body mass index, diet, lifestyle and other risk factors for component of metabolic syndrome, there were independent and significant relationships between summer-winter difference and component of metabolic syndrome. Winter season was positively correlated with blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose level, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and waist circumference, but was negatively associated with fasting triglycerides and metabolic syndrome. Conclusions.: Summer season is positively associated with hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C and metabolic syndrome. These findings imply that cross-sectional, experimental and cohort studies of component of metabolic syndrome or metabolic syndrome should take season into account as possible confounding effects. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33747259047	Prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension and the awareness, treatment, and control rate of hypertension in Kinmen	Background: It has been shown that isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the majority subtype of uncontrolled hypertension. The present study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of hypertension subtypes, ISH in particular, and also the rates of hypertension awareness, treatment and control in Kinmen County. Method: The fieldwork of a community-based survey was carried out in Kinmen during 1991-1992. A total of 12,396 residents aged 30 years and older were interviewed and their blood pressure measured. Results: The prevalence was 35.2% for hypertension and 12.6% for ISH in Kinmen. The most common hypertension subtype was systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH). The rates of awareness, treatment, and control of high blood pressure were 31.5%, 21.7%, and 4.0%, respectively. The prevalence of ISH in the hypertensive subjects was below 50% until seventh decade. The proportion of SDH dominated in both the untreated and inadequately treated hypertensive individuals until the age of 60 or 70 years, respectively. Sixty-one percent and 37.2% of the inadequately treated elderly (age ≥ 50 years) didn't reach treatment goals for SBP and DBP, respectively. In contrast, 34.6% and 40.9% of the inadequately treated younger individuals (age < 50 years) did not reach treatment target for SBP and DBP, respectively. Conclusions: ISH was predominant in the elderly, but SDH was the most prevalent subtype of uncontrolled hypertension in Kinmen. The distinct patterns of systolic and diastolic hypertension were probably related to the low awareness, treatment, and control rates of hypertension. More efforts would be required to improve hypertension control in Kinmen.

33751118043	Predictors of incident diabetes, metabolic syndrome in middle-aged adults: A 10-year follow-up study from Kinmen, Taiwan	Aims/hypothesis: The aim of this prospective study was to assess a population-based cohort for the predictors of incident diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which is most likely to lead to cardiovascular disease. Methods: We compared the baseline individual components of metabolic syndrome, adopted from the NCEP ATP III for Asians, in 3629 subjects who developed diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or diabetes and metabolic syndrome to those who remained free of diabetes and metabolic syndrome for 10 years. Results: The incidence rate of diabetes was 7.8% (9.8% in men and 6.3% in women, respectively), and metabolic syndrome was 24.2% (23.4% in men and 24.7% women, respectively). Eighty-five men and 99 women developed diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which yielded incidence rates of 5.7% in men and 4.7% in women. After adjustment for related covariable factors, each component of metabolic syndrome in women, higher triglyceride and greater waist circumference in men, independently predicted future incident diabetes and metabolic syndrome as compared with those who remained free of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Conclusions/interpretation: These findings suggest that several components of metabolic syndrome independently precede the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Further intervention studies are required to demonstrate the benefits of intervention with all aspects in decreasing the incidence of diabetes and metabolic syndrome in the general population. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

34347398010	A community-based study of the relationship between insulin resistance/beta-cell dysfunction and diabetic retinopathy among type II diabetics in Kinmen, Taiwan	Purpose: To explore whether insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction are both related to diabetic retinopathy (DR) in type II diabetics by using a community-based study in Kinmen, Taiwan. Methods: A screening program for DR was performed by a panel of ophthalmologists who used ophthalmoscopy and 45° color retinal photographs on dilated pupils to determine a consensus grade of diabetic retinopathy. Screening, which was conducted between 1999 and 2002, involved 971 patients diagnosed with type II diabetes. The Homeostatis Model Assessment (HOMA) method was used to determine insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Results: Seven hundred twenty-five diabetics who attended ophthalmological fundus checkups were studied. The overall response rate was 75%. After excluding 10 insulin-treated diabetics, diabetic retinopathy at first eye screening among the remaining 715 diabetics was 18.5%. Based on the multiple logistic regression, DR was found to be strongly related to both baseline insulin resistance (IR) and beta-cell dysfunction regardless of duration of diabetes. The strength of the relationships was maintained after adjustment for confounders. Those who were in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartile of HOMA IR had 1.38 times (95% CI: 0.62-3.05), 2.37 times (95% CI: 1.19-4.69), and 4.16 times (95% CI: 2.15-8.06) the risk for DR compared to that in the 1st quartile, respectively. A reduced risk for DR in relation to HOMA beta-cell dysfunction for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartile were 64% (95% CI: 27%-82%), 82% (95% CI: 58%-92%), and 82% (95% CI: 60%-92%) compared to that in the 1st quartile, respectively. Conclusions: Insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction are both associated with diabetic retinopathy in type II diabetes. Copyright © 2007 Informa Healthcare.

37249019474	Brachial-ankle vs carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity as a determinant of cardiovascular structure and function	Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) is a validated marker of arterial stiffening over the central arteries. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) integrates the mechanical properties from both the central and peripheral arteries and may be more representative than cf-PWV as arterial load for left ventricle (LV). We compared ba-PWV with cf-PWV for the association of cardiovascular structure and function in 320 subjects with various degrees of abnormality in cardiac structure and function. ba-PWV (by oscillometric technique) and cf-PWV (by tonometric technique) were measured simultaneously, and were highly correlated (r=0.79, P<0.001). Both ba-PWV and cf-PWV were significantly correlated with LV mass, but the correlation was better with ba-PWV (r=0.29 vs r=0.22, P=0.0219). While ba-PWV and cf-PWV were similarly significantly correlated with LV end-systolic elastance and mitral E/A ratio, ba-PWV had better correlation with isovolumic relaxation constant (r=0.34 vs r=0.27, P=0.0202) than cf-PWV. In addition, the correlation was also significantly stronger with ba-PWV than with cf-PWV for other indices of arterial stiffness, including carotid incremental modulus (r=0.59 vs 0.50, P=0.0013), effective arterial elastance (r=0.41 vs r=0.33, P=0.0081) and carotid augmentation index (r=0.38 vs r=0.32, P=0.0368). In conclusion, ba-PWV correlates better with LV mass and diastolic function and other indices of arterial function than cf-PWV, probably because ba-PWV encompasses a greater territory of arterial tree than cf-PWV.

39449104521	Clinical significance of the metabolic syndrome in the absence of established hypertension and diabetes: A community-based study	Aims/hypothesis: Our aim was to determine the predictive values on the all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and the future risks of hypertension and diabetes of the metabolic syndrome defined by the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel in the absence of established hypertension and diabetes (who may still have elevated blood pressure within 130-139/85-89 mmHg and/or elevated fasting blood glucose within 5.5-6.9 mmol/L (100-125 mg/dL)). Methods: A community-based population of 11,058 Chinese aged 30 years and above in Kinmen island was followed up for 10.6 years. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality and incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were determined. Results: The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with metabolic syndrome but without hypertension and diabetes versus subjects without metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and diabetes, were 0.81 (0.51-1.30) and 0.89 (0.57-1.37) in men, and 1.14 (0.45-2.92) and 0.73 (0.27-2.68) in women, respectively. In the non-diabetic non-hypertensives at baseline, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for predicting hypertension and diabetes for subjects with versus without the metabolic syndrome were 2.25 (1.80-2.82) and 3.12 (2.30-4.24), respectively. Conclusions/interpretation: In this Chinese population, metabolic syndrome in the absence of hypertension and diabetes was not associated with increased risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. In contrast, the presence of metabolic syndrome predicted future risk of hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, the intervention strategies for subjects with metabolic syndrome may be focused on the prevention of hypertension and diabetes. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

58149347204	Is ischemic stroke risk related to folate status or other nutrients correlated with folate intake?	Background and Purpose: Folate status was inversely associated with plasma homocysteine concentration, a potential risk factor of cardiovascular disease. However, it is uncertain whether folate is causally associated with risk of ischemic stroke (IS). We aimed to examine the association between IS incidence and folate intake, biochemical folate status, and folate associated nutrients. Methods: Information on baseline characteristics and food frequency questionnaire was collected in 1990 to 1993 and included for analyses data from 1772 adults over 40 years, who were free of stroke and cancer at baseline from the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtor Two-township Study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to relate baseline nutrient status with IS event. Results: Over an average of 10.6 years of follow-up, 132 incident IS events were documented. Low folate intake (1st and 2nd quartiles) was significantly and independently associated with increased IS risk (HR≤1.61; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.48 and HR≤1.82; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.76) compared with those in the 3rd and 4th quartile combined, whereas no association was observed for plasma folate concentration. On the other hand, several nutrients correlated with dietary folate: vitamin B2, potassium, iron, vitamin A of plant origin, calcium were also associated with IS risk in an inverse linear manner with HR ranging from 1.5 to 1.9 for the first quartile. Conclusions: The protective association of dietary folate on IS risk may be in part through that of other correlated nutrients or other dietary components. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

59149098812	Community-based study on summer-winter difference in insulin resistance in Kin-Chen, Kinmen, Taiwan	Background: The aim of this community-based study was to explore the summer-winter difference in insulin resistance in Kin-Chen, Kinmen. Methods: A total of 2,412 residents aged 40 and over was enrolled in a mass survey in Kin-Chen, Kinmen, by the Yang-Ming Crusade, a volunteer organization of well-trained medical students from National Yang-Ming University. All participants were investigated in winter (first phase, January and February, before Chinese New Year) and summer (secondary phase, July and August) in 2002. Structured questionnaires, demographic and physical data, lifestyle, and blood chemistry parameters were collected. Results: Higher levels of fasting insulin, HOMA-insulin resistance and triglycerides, but lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were found in summer than in winter. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in summer than in winter, with differences of 7.7% in both genders (p=0.0092 in men, p=0.0037 in women). Body mass index (BMI), age and physical activity were significantly correlated with metabolic syndrome. After controlling for BMI and other risk profiles, summer was independently and positively associated with fasting insulin and insulin resistance regardless of metabolic syndrome. Conclusion: Fasting insulin, insulin resistance and prevalence of metabolic syndrome were higher in summer than in winter. BMI and season were 2 major determinants of the variation in fasting insulin. The contextual impacts of seasonal variation in shaping metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance in populations need to be reemphasized. © 2008 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

84876589759	Measurement accuracy of a stand-alone oscillometric central blood pressure monitor: A validation report for microlife WatchBP office central	Background The superiority of prognostic value of blood pressure (BP) measured at central aorta (CBP) over conventional brachial BP measured by cuff-based BP monitors has reignited the development of new noninvasive techniques for estimating CBP. The present study validated the accuracy of CBP measured by a newly developed stand-alone CBP monitor. Methods The CBP monitor provided readings of brachial systolic BP (SBP), brachial diastolic BP (DBP), central SBP, and central pulse pressure (PP). Brachial PP and central DBP were calculated from the relevant readings. The accuracy of the brachial and central SBP, PP, and DBP was validated against the simultaneously recorded invasively measured central aortic SBP, PP, and DBP, according to the invasive standard requirements for the noninvasive brachial BP monitors from the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) in 85 subjects (255 measurements; age range, 30-93 years). Results The mean differences of cuff BP with reference to the invasively measured central SBP, PP, and DBP were-2.6±9.0,-8.6±11.2, and 6.1±7.0mm Hg, respectively, with the former two being obviously underestimated at high CBP and overestimated at low CBP. In contrast, the corresponding differences for the central SBP, PP, and DBP measured by the CBP monitor were-0.6±5.5,-0.4±7.0, and-0.2±6.5mm Hg, respectively, without obvious systematic bias. The distribution of measurement errors for central SBP, PP, and DBP surpassed the AAMI criteria.Conclusion Central SBP, PP, and DBP can be measured accurately by a stand-alone automatic BP monitor. © 2012 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

84877293465	Successful catheter ablation reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in atrial fibrillation patients with CHA	Aims It is not known if successful catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) improves the patient's long-term cardiovascular outcomes. This study investigated the long-term outcomes and mortality of AF patients at high risk who received antiarrhythmic medication and catheter ablation. Methods and results The propensity scores for AF were calculated for each patient and were used to assemble a cohort of 174 AF patients with ablation who were compared with an equal number of AF patients without ablation. Composite cardiovascular end points (major adverse cardiovascular event, MACE), including mortality and vascular events in the medically treated patients representing the control group (group 1), were compared with those in the ablation-treated patients (group 2). The rates of the total mortality (2.95% vs. 0.74% per year; P < 0.01), cardiovascular death (1.77% vs. 0% per year; P = 0.001), and ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack (2.21% vs. 0.59% per year; P = 0.02) were higher in group 1 than group 2, respectively. A multivariate Cox regression analysis of the MACE scores showed that a higher CHA

84887882606	Knowledge, attitude and practice on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection among new entrant university students in Taiwan	Objectives: By the end of 2004, there were 403 students infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reported to Taiwan's Center for Disease Control. The objective of this study was to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding HIV-1 and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among new entrant (freshman) university students in Taiwan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in September 2004. Self- Administered questionnaires from 11,847 students of nine universities were collected and analyzed. Results: The mean knowledge score was high-86.8. Regarding attitude, 42.2% of students would avoid contacts with HIV/AIDS patients; and 13.6% felt embarrassed if one of their family members had AIDS. The attitude scores of the students did not correlate with the knowledge scores (Pearson correlation: 0.182 and 0.074 for male and female students, respectively). Students identified both school and television as the main sources of information. The sexual orientations were 93.3% heterosexuals, 1.1% bisexuals and 0.5% homosexuals. The mean age of first sexual intercourse was 17.1 (SD±1.5). Among 1,179 (10%) students who had sexual experiences, only 30.9% used condoms consistently. In addition, 9.9% were alcohol consumers and 157 students (1.3%) were illicit drug users which including 10 injecting drug users. Students obtained drugs mainly from friends (58.6%), in pubs (45.2%) and at school (21.6%). This is a significant finding. Conclusions: There were knowledge gaps and many misconceptions about transmission routes of HIV-1. More AIDS education including anti-drug information should be provided to high school students in Taiwan. (Taiwan J Public Health. 2007;26(4):324-337).

43449101866	Differential effects of age on carotid augmentation index and aortic pulse wave velocity in end-stage renal disease patients	Background: In healthy, normotensive individuals, age-related changes in carotid augmentation index (AI) are more prominent in younger individuals (< 50 years), whereas changes in aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) are more marked in older individuals (> 50 years). We investigated whether the differential effects of age on Al and MAN also existed in endstage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-seven patients (50% male; mean age, 53.9 ± 15.0 years) with ESRD and 260 normal controls (52% male; mean age, 51.4 ± 17.8 years) received a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular structure and function. Results: The percent differences in PWV between the younger and older subjects were similar in both ESRD patients (+46.2%) and normal controls (+52.5%). The percent differences in PWV between normal controls and ESRD patients were also similar in both younger (+28.2%) and older (+22.9%) subjects. In contrast, the differences in AI between the younger and older subjects were small in ESRD patients (7.3%) but large in normal controls (19.7%). Furthermore, there was a large difference in AI between normal controls and ESRD patients in the younger (+13.3%) subjects, but no difference in the older subjects (+0.8%) (interaction between study groups and age: p < 0.001). Conclusion: Markedly differential effects of age on AI and PWV were observed in ESRD patients. PWV increased with age similarly in both ESRD patients and normal controls, whereas AI increased markedly in the younger but only slightly in the older ESRD patients. © 2008 Elsevier.

44649147653	Adiponectin, but not leptin or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, is associated with blood pressure independently of general and abdominal adiposity	The role of adiponectin, a marker of the metabolic syndrome, on the pathogenesis of hypertension in comparison with markers of adipose tissue mass (leptin) and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) remains to be clarified. The eligible study population consisted of 2,045 residents agede≥40 years who had participated in a community-based survey and had complete data for serum adiponectin, leptin, and hs-CRP, and for whom homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) had been calculated from insulin and plasma glucose. Among all eligible participants, as well as in the subgroup of nondiabetic normotensives (blood pressure <140/90 mmHg and without antihypertensive medication), all three markers were significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (negative correlation for adiponectin and positive correlations for leptin and hs-CRP). Among all participants, systolic blood pressure and the presence of hypertension were determined mainly by age, sex, body mass index, and waist circumference. None of the markers further contributed to the multivariate linear regression or logistic regression models. In contrast, adiponectin, but not leptin, hs-CRP, or HOMA-IR, was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure and the presence of pre-hypertension (blood pressure within 120-139/80-89 mmHg) after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and waist circumference in the nondiabetic normotensive subgroup. Similarly, adiponectin was independently associated with diastolic blood pressure in the nondiabetic normotensive subgroup but not in the whole population. In conclusion, adiponectin, but not leptin or hs-CRP, was independently associated with blood pressure in a nondiabetic normotensive subgroup.

56449108496	Usefulness of systolic time intervals in the identification of abnormal ventriculo-arterial coupling in stable heart failure patients	Background: The ratio of effective arterial elastance (Ea) to ventricular end-systolic elastance (Ees) indicates the status of ventriculo-arterial coupling. Aims: We investigated if systolic time intervals (pre-ejection period, PEP; ejection time, ET; and their ratio, PEP/ET) can be used to identify heart failure patients with abnormal ventriculo-arterial coupling. Methods: Age and sex-matched study subjects included 54 apparently healthy subjects with normal left ventricular (LV) function, and stable patients with LV diastolic (n = 54) and systolic dysfunction (n = 54). Ees and Ea were estimated non-invasively by echocardiography, and abnormal ventriculo-arterial coupling was defined as Ea/Ees > 1.2. PEP, ET, and PEP/ET were measured automatically using electrocardiography, phonocardiography, and brachial pulse volume recording. Results: Ea/Ees > 1.2 was present in 48.1% of subjects with systolic dysfunction. The PEP/ET was significantly associated with most parameters of LV structure and function, and Ea/Ees (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). Using PEP/ET ≥ 0.423 as cut point, the sensitivity and specificity to identify patients with Ea/Ees > 1.2 were 85.7% and 84.3%, respectively for the whole population, and 84.6% and 78.6%, for patients with systolic dysfunction. Conclusion: Abnormal ventriculo-arterial coupling was present in almost half of stable patients with systolic dysfunction. PEP/ET was useful in identifying such patients. © 2008 European Society of Cardiology.

62549112964	Serum uric acid level as an independent risk factor for all-cause, cardiovascular, and ischemic stroke mortality: A chinese cohort study	Objective. The association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular events has been documented in high-risk groups, but is still undetermined in general populations, especially Chinese. This study assessed the temporal association between serum uric acid level, hyperuricemia, and cardiovascular mortality. Methods. A prospective cohort study of 41,879 men and 48,514 women ages ≥35 years was conducted using data from the MJ Health Screening Centers in Taiwan. Mortality from all causes, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischemic stroke, congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease, and coronary heart disease were compared according to increasing serum uric acid levels. Results. A total of 1,151 (21.2%) events of 5,427 total deaths were ascribed to CVD (mean followup 8.2 years). Hazard ratios (HRs) for hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level >7 mg/dl) were estimated with Cox regression model after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, diabetes, hypertension, heavy cigarette smoking, and frequent alcohol consumption. In all patients, HRs were 1.16 (P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, 1.39 (P < 0.001) for total CVD, and 1.35 (P = 0.02) for ischemic stroke. In subgroup analysis, the HRs for cardiovascular risk remained significant in patients with hypertension (1.44, P < 0.001) and in patients with diabetes (1.64, P < 0.001). In addition, in a low metabolic risk subgroup, the HRs for all-cause mortality and total cardiovascular morbidity were 1.24 (P = 0.02) and 1.48 (P = 0.16), respectively. Conclusion. Hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor of mortality from all causes, total CVD, and ischemic stroke in the Taiwanese general population, in high-risk groups, and potentially in low-risk groups. © 2009, American College of Rheumatology.

65449124608	Relation of Adiponectin and High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein to Pulse-Wave Velocity and N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in the General Population	The roles of metabolic syndrome and chronic subclinical inflammation in arterial stiffening and the development of heart failure remain to be elucidated. Whether adiponectin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were independently related to brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity (ba-PWV) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) in the general population were investigated. Eligible study subjects were 445 Chinese residents aged ≥40 years who participated in a community-based survey, underwent examination of ba-PWV, and had complete data of serum adiponectin, hs-CRP (<10 mg/L), and NT-pro-BNP. Adiponectin, but not hs-CRP, was independently related to ba-PWV (standardized regression parameter -0.107, p <0.05) when age, gender, body mass index, and number of metabolic syndrome components were accounted for. On the other hand, ba-PWV, adiponectin, and hs-CRP were independently related to NT-pro-BNP (standardized regression parameters 0.116, 0.188, and 0.094, respectively; all p <0.05) when age, gender, body mass index, number of metabolic syndrome components, and renal function were accounted for. In conclusion, adiponectin, but not hs-CRP, is independently associated with both ba-PWV and NT-pro-BNP in the general population. Because adiponectin, hs-CRP, ba-PWV, and NT-pro-BNP may represent markers for metabolic syndrome, chronic subclinical inflammation, arterial stiffness, and ventricular dysfunction, respectively, our results suggest that adiponectin may directly modulate both arterial stiffening and ventricular dysfunction. In contrast, hs-CRP may independently contribute to ventricular dysfunction, but not arterial stiffening. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

65549088392	Fibrinogen independently predicts the development of ischemic stroke in a Taiwanese population: CVDFACTS study	Background and Purpose-: Of few prospective studies that have focused on the relationship between fibrinogen and ischemic stroke (IS) in Asian populations, the findings were inconsistent with those conducted in Western countries. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the temporal relationship between fibrinogen levels (plus several related parameters) and IS in a community-based study in Taiwan. Methods-: Baseline data from 3281 adults (>20 years of age) in the Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Factor Two-Township Study were linked to incidental IS status derived from insurance claims and death certificate records. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs of clotting factors (fibrinogen, factor VII, factor VIII, and antithrombin-III) for IS events were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. Results-: With 10.4 years (average) follow-up, 128 persons developed IS (3.75 per 1000 person-years). As expected, elevated blood pressure and diabetes were independent predictors of IS events. A dose-response relationship was found in univariate analysis between IS risk and tertiles of fibrinogen (hazard ratio, 3.73; 2.19 to 1.00), factor VII (hazard ratio, 1.86; 1.35 to 1.00), and factor VIII (2.97; 1.70 to 1.00), respectively, but not for antithrombin-III. After adjusting for confounding and known risk factors, fibrinogen independently predicted IS events. A 72% increase (hazard ratio, 1.72; 1.02 to 2.90) in IS risk was observed for individuals with fibrinogen >8.79 μmol/L compared with those <7.03 μmol/L. Conclusions-: In addition to hypertension and diabetes, fibrinogen independently predicted future IS risk. We suggest that fibrinogen may be considered in the risk assessment model for IS in the Taiwanese population. © 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.

67649586928	Central or peripheral systolic or pulse pressure: Which best relates to target organs and future mortality?	OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between brachial and central carotid pressures and target organ indices at baseline and their association with future mortality. METHODS: We examined, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, the relations of baseline systolic and pulse pressures in central (calibrated tonometric carotid pulse) and peripheral (brachial, mercury sphygmomanometer) arteries to baseline left ventricular mass, carotid intima-media thickness, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 10-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 1272 participants (47% women aged 30-79 years) from a community of homogeneous Chinese. RESULTS: Left ventricular mass was more strongly related to central and peripheral systolic pressures than pulse pressures. Intima-media thickness and glomerular filtration rate were more strongly related to central pressures than peripheral pressures. A total of 130 participants died, 37 from cardiovascular causes. In univariate analysis, all four blood pressure variables significantly predicted all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Each blood pressure variable was entered into the multivariate models, both individually and jointly with another blood pressure variable. After adjustment for age, sex, heart rate, BMI, current smoking, glucose, ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, left ventricular mass, intima-media thickness, and glomerular filtration rate, only central systolic pressure consistently and independently predicted cardiovascular mortality (hazards ratio, 1.30 per 10 mmHg). No significant sex interactions were observed in all analyses. CONCLUSION: Systolic and pulse pressures relate differently to different target organs. Central systolic pressure is more valuable than other blood pressure variables in predicting cardiovascular mortality. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

70349560870	Predictability and implications of anthropometric indices for metabolic abnormalities in children: Nutrition and health survey in Taiwan elementary children, 2001-2002	Background: To determine whether separate anthropometric screening tools are needed for obesity and the metabolic syndrome in children, we compared the predictability of several anthropometric indices, including waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI), with regard to metabolic disorders. Study design: The Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan Elementary School Children (2000-2001) collected data from 2,215 children. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between anthropometric indices and metabolic abnormalities, which was defined as two or more of the following conditions: high fasting triglycerides, high fasting glucose levels, high blood pressure and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to study the sensitivity and specificity of these anthropometric indices. Results: predictability was the ranked highest for WC (R

77149162035	Wave reflection and arterial stiffness in the prediction of 15-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities: A community-based study	The value of increased arterial wave reflection, usually assessed by the transit time-dependent augmentation index and augmented pressure (Pa), in the prediction of cardiovascular events may have been underestimated. We investigated whether the transit time-independent measures of reflected wave magnitude predict cardiovascular outcomes independent of arterial stiffness indexed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. A total of 1272 participants (47% women; mean age: 52±13 years; range: 30 to 79 years) from a community-based survey were studied. Carotid pressure waveforms derived by tonometry were decomposed into their forward wave amplitudes, backward wave amplitudes (Pb), and a reflection index (=[Pb/(forward wave amplitude+Pb)]), in addition to augmentation index, Pa, and reflected wave transit time. During a median follow-up of 15 years, 225 deaths occurred (17.6%), including 64 cardiovascular origins (5%). In univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, pulse wave velocity, Pa, and Pb predicted all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in both men and women, whereas augmentation index, reflected wave transit time, and reflection index were predictive only in men. In multivariate analysis accounting for age, height, and heart rate, Pb predicted cardiovascular mortality in both men and women, whereas Pa was predictive only in men. Per 1-SD increment (6 mm Hg), Pb predicted 15-year cardiovascular mortality independent of brachial but not central pressure, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, Pa, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors with hazard ratios of ≈1.60 (all P<0.05). In conclusion, Pb, a transit time-independent measure of reflected wave magnitude, predicted long-term cardiovascular mortality in men and women independent of arterial stiffness.

77949401135	Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 subtype B, CRF01-AE, and CRF07-BC infection among injection drug users in Taiwan	OBJECTIVE: An explosive outbreak of HIV-1 circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07-BC among injection drug users (IDUs) in Taiwan was first reported in 2004 and reach the peak in 2005. The objectives of this study were to investigate the molecular epidemiology of different HIV-1 subtypes and their associated risk factors among Taiwanese IDUs in 2004 and 2005. METHODS: Questionnaires and blood specimens were collected from inmates from 4 detention centers and 2 prisons. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using nested polymerase chain reactions with multiplex primers and phylogenetic analyses. A case-control study was conducted to elucidate risk factors associated with CRF07-BC infection. RESULTS: A total of 93.8%, 4%, and 2.2% of 451 inmates with IDU history were infected with CRF07-BC, subtype B, and CRF01-AE, respectively. Besides CRF07-BC, a new outbreak of CRF01-AE infection was identified among IDUs from central region. Multivariate analysis showed that sharing dissolved heroine solution [odds ratio (OR) = 17.2], sharing syringes (OR = 34), number of persons sharing syringes (2 vs. 1, OR = 3.1), and lower educational level (OR = 2.3) were risk factors associated with CRF07-BC infection. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing dissolved heroine solution is a neglected risk factor associated with HIV-1 infection and it should be emphasized in the AIDS education and harm reduction programs immediately.

77952833625	Diabetes and 15-year Cardiovascular Mortality in a Chinese Population: Differential Impact of Hypertension and Metabolic Syndrome	Background: It remains unclear if the risk for cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is equivalent to that in patients with a history of cardiac disease in Asian populations. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether or not non-heart disease (HD) DM subjects have a similar risk of CV mortality as HD patients without DM (non-DM HD), and whether or not hypertension (HT) or metabolic syndrome (MS) is a CV mortality marker for diabetic subjects identified from a community-based population. Methods: We followed 11,058 Chinese people aged ≥ 30 years on Kinmen island for a median of 15.0 years. Results: The age-, sex- and smoking-adjusted hazard ratios for CV mortality were 3.56 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.99-6.36] for DM subjects with HD, 1.64 (95% CI: 1.25-2.16) for DM without HD (non-HD DM) subjects, and 1.63 (95% CI: 1.09-2.44) for non-DM HD patients, when compared with subjects without DM and HD. Among the 827 non-HD DM subjects identified at the baseline survey, the age-, sex- and smoking-adjusted hazard ratios for CV mortality were 2.36 (95% CI: 1.30-4.28) for the presence versus absence of HT, and 1.23 (95% CI: 0.65-2.34) for the presence versus absence of MS. Conclusion: Non-HD DM subjects had a similar risk of CV mortality to non-DM HD subjects in this Chinese population. The presence of HT but not MS substantially increased CV mortality risk in the DM subjects. © 2010 Elsevier.

78650816974	Genetic variants of connexin37 are associated with carotid intima-medial thickness and future onset of ischemic stroke	Background: Carotid intima-medial thickness (IMT) is a surrogate marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of genetic variants on IMT and future development of ischemic stroke in a cohort, followed by an independent replication study. Methods: B-mode carotid ultrasound was performed among 3330 healthy adults in the CVDFACT cohort study, and the genetic effects of atherosclerosis-related genes including connexin37 (GJA4), C-reactive protein (CRP), paraoxonase (PON1), adiponectin (ACDC), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1, ADRB2), antithrombin III (SERPINC1), and kinesin family member 6 (KIF6) were evaluated by a multivariate regression model, adjusting for traditional vascular risk factors. Study subjects were prospectively followed for the development of ischemic stroke to assess the prognostic impacts of these genetic variants. An independent case-control study was performed to replicate the genetic association from the cohort study. Results: The T allele of connexin37 C1019T polymorphism significantly affected IMT (β= 0.014, p= 0.013) after adjusting for traditional risk factors. During an average follow-up period of 10.7 years, 80 patients with ischemic stroke (2.4%) were identified. The connexin37 1019. T allele was significantly associated with an increased rate of ischemic stroke under an additive model, with hazard ratios (HR) of 2.83 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.66) and 1.69 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.71), comparing TT and CT genotype with CC, respectively. After Cox analysis, age (HR, 1.78 every 10 years), diabetes mellitus (HR, 2.63), hypertension (HR, 2.08), and the T allele of C1019T polymorphism of GJA4 (HR, 1.69) were identified as independent predictors of ischemic stroke. The relationship between T allele of C1019T polymorphism of GJA4 gene and ischemic stroke was also confirmed by an independent association study. Conclusion: Connexin 37 genetic variants significantly affect carotid IMT and contribute to future development of ischemic stroke. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79951683478	Central versus ambulatory blood pressure in the prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities	Objectives: Central systolic (SBP-C) and/or pulse pressure (PP-C) better predicts cardiovascular events than does peripheral blood pressure. The present study compared the prognostic significance of office central blood pressure with multiple measurements of out-of-office ambulatory peripheral blood pressure, with reference to office peripheral systolic (SBP-B) or pulse pressure (PP-B). Methods: In a community-based population of 1014 healthy participants, SBP-C and PP-C were estimated using carotid tonometry, and 24-h systolic (SBP-24 h) and pulse pressure (PP-24 h) were obtained from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Associations of SBP-B, PP-B, SBP-C, PP-C, SBP-24 h, and PP-24 h with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities over a median follow-up of 15 years were examined by Cox regression analysis. Results: In multivariate analyses accounting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, fasting plasma glucose, and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, only PP-C (hazard ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.32, per one standard deviation increment) was significantly predictive of all-cause mortality, whereas all but PP-B were significantly predictive of cardiovascular mortality. When SBP-B was simultaneously included in the models, SBP-24 h (2.01, 1.42-2.85) and SBP-C (1.71, 1.21-2.40) remained significantly predictive of cardiovascular mortality. When SBP-C was simultaneously included in the models, SBP-24 h (1.71, 1.16-2.52) remained significantly predictive of cardiovascular mortality. Conclusion: Office central blood pressure is more valuable than office peripheral blood pressure in the prediction of all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. Out-of-office ambulatory peripheral blood pressure (SBP-24 h) may be superior to central blood pressure in the prediction of cardiovascular mortality, but PP-C may better predict all-cause mortality than SBP-24 h or PP-24 h. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

79955464282	Common carotid end-diastolic velocity and intima-media thickness jointly predict ischemic stroke in Taiwan	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE-In Asian populations, few studies investigated the association between stroke and common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT). Our previous case-control studies showed that low end-diastolic velocity (EDV) in common carotid artery, a potential hemodynamic marker of intracranial resistance, was associated with ischemic stroke. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between both EDV and IMT and incident ischemic stroke in an Asian population. METHODS-Baseline data from 3175 adults (30 years or older) in the Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Factor Two-Township Study were linked to incidental ischemic stroke status derived from insurance claims and death certificate records. Hazard ratios for risk of ischemic stroke for high IMT and low EDV values measured in common carotid artery were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS-With 9.85 years (median) of follow-up, 184 persons had ischemic stroke develop. Compared with the first tertile of IMT, hazard ratios were 2.03 (95% confidence intervals, 1.27-3.25) for the second tertile and 3.87 (95% confidence intervals, 2.36-5.69) for the third tertile. Hazard ratios of EDV were 5.31 (95% confidence intervals, 3.52-7.99; first tertile) and 1.94 (95% confidence intervals, 1.21-3.09; second tertile) compared with the third tertile. The individuals with high IMT and low EDV had >2-fold ischemic stroke risk compared to those with low IMT and high EDV (2.10; 95% confidence intervals, 1.35-3.26) after adjusting for age, sex, and traditional cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS-Common carotid IMT and EDV jointly and independently predicted future ischemic stroke in this Taiwanese population. More prospective studies are required in various ethnic groups to understand the significance and implication of the current findings, particularly with respect to EDV. © 2011 American Heart Association, Inc.

79954586755	Prediction equations and point system derived from large-scale health check-up data for estimating diabetic risk in the Chinese population of Taiwan	Aim: To develop tools for predicting diabetes development in middle-aged Chinese adults living in Taiwan. Methods: This study made use of data from 24,899 non-diabetic adults aged ≥35 years who received health examination service from a private health check-up clinic during the period of 1994-1996 and had one or more examinations before December 31, 2006. The proportional hazard model and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method were used respectively to construct the prediction equation and assess the model's performance. A point system is developed for the ease to calculate diabetes risk. Results: Increased risk of diabetes development was associated with older age, lower education level, alcohol abstinence, abdominal obesity, elevated body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), triglycerides, and impaired fasting glucose. Model 1, incorporating personal socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, BMI, and waist circumference (WC), had an area-under-curve (AUC) of 0.717. The AUC increased to 0.726 (model 2) when BP was introduced and to 0.823 (model 3) when both BP and clinical chemistry measures were added. The AUCs in the testing set for models 1, 2, and 3 were 0.688, 0.694, and 0.799 respectively. Conclusions: These predictive equations of diabetic risk were easy to use by clinical professions and general subjects. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79955598046	Does dementia increase risk of thrombolysis?: A case-control study	Background: Dementia represents a potential challenge when thrombolysis is a treatment option. In this study, we assess the impact of dementia on the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and hospital mortality associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients treated with thrombolysis. Methods: A cohort of patients with AIS was identified from the National Inpatient Sample database for the years 2000 to 2007. Vascular and degenerative types of dementia were identified by the International Classification of Diseases-9-CM codes. A matched random sample without dementia was selected from a pool of those with AIS and treated with thrombolysis. Results: In this analysis, 35,557 patients with diagnosis of dementia were included; 207 (0.56%) received thrombolysis. In-hospital mortality (17.48% vs 8.63%) and ICH (5.80% vs 0.38%) were higher in the thrombolysis group (p < 0.0001) compared to those who did not receive thrombolysis. Multivariate analysis showed that thrombolysis was associated with increased hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 16.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.54-30.53) and ICH (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.82-4.32). Compared to a matched population of patients without dementia treated with thrombolysis (n = 621), those who had dementia and were treated with thrombolysis had similar risks of ICH (5.80% vs 4.51%, p = 0.45) and mortality (17.39% vs 14.49%, p = 0.31) rates. With thrombolysis, ICH remained a predictor of mortality for both dementia and control groups (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.02-4.99). CONCLUSION:: The administration of thrombolysis for AIS in patients with dementia was not associated with increased risk of ICH or death compared to the counterparts without dementia. ICH remained as predictor of mortality. © 2011 by AAN Enterprises, Inc. All rights reserved.

0036078129	Clinical identification of the metabolic syndrome in Kinmen	Background: Metabolic syndrome is important to the global burden of cardiovascular disease. This study estimated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Kinmen, according to the clinical criteria from the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (ATP III). Methods: A database of 8,320 men and women aged 30-92 years who participated in a community-based, cross-sectional survey was analyzed. According to ATP III, the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome was made when Three or more of the following risk determinants were present: abdominal obesity (waist circumference: men 102; women > 88 cm), high triglycerides (150 mg/dL), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (men, < 40 mg/dL; women < 50 mg/dL), high blood pressure (130/85 mm Hg), and high fasting glucose (110 mg/dL). Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in women (878/4,716, 18.62%) than in men (405/3,604, 11.24%, p = 0.001). The prevalence of the components of metabolic syndrome for men and women were: abdominal obesity, 3.72% and 28.52%, respectively (p = 0.001); high triglycerides, 13.37% and 10.45% (p = 0.001); low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 20.98% and 37.66% (p = 0.001); high blood pressure, 61.07% and 43.74% (p = 0.001); and high fasting glucose, 23.25% and 19.64%, (p = 0.001). When abdominal obesity was redefined according to the cut-offs of waist circumferences > 90 cm for men or > 80 cm for women, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome remained significantly higher in women than in men (23.77% vs 17.73%; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The significant gender difference in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Kinmen is related to the higher prevalence of abdominal obesity and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in women than in men.

0036526450	Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus in Taiwan	Diabetes Mellitus can be divided into type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Because of its increasing prevalence and incidence, diabetes mellitus has become a major public health challenge. Based on the current trends, the population of diabetic individuals will swell to a staggering 300 million and have increased in prevalence to an estimated 5.4% by the year 2025. Those who have poor blood sugar control would have sequential complications, including macrovascular diseases (CVD), microvascular diseases (retinopathy and nephropathy), and neuropathy. Furthermore, these complications may progress to severe states, including blindness, end-stage renal disease, and amputation. From the evidence-based medical viewpoint, this article is especially focused on discussing the epidemiology of diabetes mellitus and its complications in Taiwan. We hope that this literatur review could provide more information in establishing screening strategies and health management programs popular diabetic subjects.

79959350047	Pulsatile hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in acute heart failure	BackgroundThe role of pulsatile hemodynamics in the management of patients with acute heart failure syndrome (AHFS) remains to be elucidated. We investigated the changes of the pulsatile hemodynamics along the hospital course of AHFS in relation to short-term outcomes.MethodsA total of 80 AHFS patients (73.2 14.1 years, 82.5% men) were enrolled and followed up for up to 6 months after discharge. Measures of the pulsatile hemodynamics including brachial and central systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse (PP) pressure, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid augmentation index (cAI and cAI 75) and carotid augmented pressure (cAP) were obtained within 24h of admission, before discharge, and 2 weeks after discharge.ResultsDuring a follow-up of 174 32 days (16-183 days), 29 patients experienced events including rehospitalization for heart failure, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and mortality. Predischarge brachial and central PP, and cAP, and postdischarge brachial and central SBP and PP, cAP, and cf-PWV were significantly lower in patients without events than those with events. Predischarge central PP (hazard ratio per 1-s.d. and 95% confidence interval 1.62 (1.12-2.34)) and cAP (1.47 (1.05-2.05)) predicted events independent of age and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. Similarly, postdischarge brachial and central SBP and PP, cAP, and cf-PWV were also significant independent predictors. ConclusionSuboptimal recovery of the perturbations of the pulsatile hemodynamics in patients hospitalized due to AHFS may relate to adverse short-term outcomes and warrant aggressive treatment. © 2011 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

80051933631	Diet and health trends in Taiwan: Comparison of two nutrition and health surveys from 1993-1996 and 2005-2008	The availability of new food choices has increased dramatically in recent times, whilst increasingly sedentary lifestyles have reduced calorie intake requirements. The present study uses 24 hour dietary recall data, and biochemical and anthropometric measurements from the 1993-1996 and 2005-2008 Nutrition and Health Surveys in Taiwan (NAHSIT) to investigate trends in dietary habits, and cardiovascular and metabolic disease markers in Taiwanese persons aged 19 years and above. We found that dietary habits in Taiwan are changing, particularly in regards to intakes of cakes and sweets, and sugary drinks. Energy intakes in young people have increased, and combined with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, this may have led to the increase in obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Large increases in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and gout have been observed. Fortunately, some positive dietary and behavioral changes have also been observed; including an increased avoidance of products made from animal fats and oils' and a concomitant increase in the use of vegetable oil. Intakes of fruit and vegetables, soy products, fish, whole grains, nuts and seeds have also increased; and intakes of red meat, carbohydrates and sodium containing foods have decreased. These positive dietary changes could explain the lack of large changes in the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and the decrease in prevalence of hyperuricemia. Intake of dairy products remains low, and continues to be an important dietary issue in Taiwan.

80051916416	Trends in hyperuricemia and gout prevalence: Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan from 1993-1996 to 2005- 2008	Hyperuricemia is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study investigated trends in uric acid levels, hyperuricemia and gout among adults in Taiwan from 1993-1996 to 2005-2008, using data collection from, Nutrition and health surveys in Taiwan (NAHSIT) conducted in 1993-1996 and 2005-2008. Information on food frequency, medical history, physical measures and fasting blood parameters were analyzed. Mean uric acid levels decreased between 1993-1996 and 2005-2008 in both genders (6.77 vs 6.59 mg/dL in men and 5.33 vs 4.97 mg/dL in women) and the prevalence of hyperuricemia declined from 25.3% to 22.0% in men (p<0.0001) and from 16.7% to 9.7% in women (p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of gout (self-reported) increased (4.74% vs 8.21% in men and 2.19% vs 2.33% in women, p<0.0001). Reduced rank regression was used to identify dietary patterns that explained significant amounts of variance in uric acid. Frequency of consumption of lean meat, soy products and soymilk, milk, eggs, vegetables, carrots, mushrooms, fruit and coffee were negatively associated with hyperuricemia, whereas consumption of organ meats, bamboo shoots, and soft drinks were positively associated with hyperuricemia. The dietary factor score (DFS) composed of the frequency of above food items decreased from -5.40 to -6.00 between the two surveys (p<0.0001). In conclusion, uric acid levels and prevalence of hyperuricemia both declined, whilst self-reported gout increased between 1993-1996 and 2005- 2008. Changes in dietary patterns may in part explain the decrease in uric acid levels between the two national surveys.

84856752481	Gender-specific risk factors for incident gout: A prospective cohort study	Previous reports suggested that gout incidence increased with serum uric acid (sUA) level. In addition to sUA, we aimed to examine the gender-specific risk factors for incident gout. A prospective study was conducted using data of the MJ Health Screening Center and outcome database from Taiwan's National Health Insurance. Cox proportional hazard model was used for risk analysis of incident gout. During a mean follow-up of 7.31 years for 132,556 individuals aged ≥18 years, 1,606 subjects (1,341 men and 265 women) with clinical gout were defined. Hyperuricemia (sUA ≥7.7 mg/dL for men or ≥6.6 mg/dL for women) was the most important risk factor for gout development with a respective hazard ratio of 9.65 (95% confidence level, 8.53-10.9) for men and 9.28 (7.00-12.3) for women. The age-standardized sUA-gout relationship demonstrated a differential impact of sUA level on gout incidence between men and women. Metabolic comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidemia were significantly associated with gout with respective HR of 1.32 (1.17-1.48), 1.30 (1.15-1.47), and 1.12 (0.99-1.26) for men and 1.34 (1.02-1.77), 2.15 (1.67-2.76), and 1.70 (1.32-2.19) for women. However, the relationship between diabetes and incident gout was not as prominent. The sex difference of sUA-gout relationship and the association between metabolic comorbidities and incident gout were demonstrated. Generalizability of these findings to other ethnic population needs further investigation. © 2011 Clinical Rheumatology.

84855917291	Hyperuricemia and increased risk of ischemic heart disease in a large Chinese cohort	Aims: There is an ongoing discussion on whether serum uric acid (SUA) predicts ischemic heart disease (IHD) independently of other metabolic factors, which, if confirmed, would signify a role for uric acid in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether such a relation exists for ethnic Chinese with low CVD risk. Methods and results: Enrolled, between 1994 and 1996, were 128,569 adults ≥ 20 years from four 'MJ' Health Check-up Clinics in Taiwan. Excluded were those with heart disease, previous stroke(s), renal disease, and/or cancer. Physical examinations, biospecimen collections, and structured questionnaires were executed according to standardised protocols. We identified IHD events according to the ICD-9-CM codes 410-414 using hospitalisation records obtained from the National Health Insurance and the Death Certification Registry databases. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) between SUA and IHD events. A total of 2049 subjects (1239 men, 810 women) developed IHD from baseline to Dec. 31, 2002. Men had a higher IHD incidence than did women (2.84 vs. 1.61 1/1000 person-years; p < 0.0001). The risk-factor-adjusted HRs (95% confidence-interval [CI]) for hyperuricemiae (SUA ≥ 7.0/≥6.0 mg/dL) were 1.25 (1.11-1.40) for men and 1.19 (1.02-1.38) for women. In the low-risk population (lacking the NCEP-ATPIII metabolic syndrome components), a significant association was still observed (adjusted HR: 1.54 [1.09-2.17]). Conclusion: The hyperuricemia was independently associated with the development of IHD not only in the general population but also in those without any metabolic risk factor for NCEP ATPIII. Hyperuricemia may be considered as a potential risk factor for IHD. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84860332802	Risk of asthma associated with energy-dense but nutrient-poor dietary pattern in Taiwanese children	Childhood asthma has rapidly increased over the past few decades, possibly due to changes in lifestyle and dietary patterns. We aimed to determine associations between dietary patterns and asthma in schoolchildren in Taiwan. The Nutrition and Health survey in Taiwan Elementary School Children was carried out by using a multistaged complex sampling design. A total of 2,082 elementary school children with complete data on dietary, lifestyle, demographics and asthma were included in the analysis. We used a Chinese version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire to generate an asthma symptom score and to define asthma outcomes. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Reduced rank regression (RRR) was used to identify the dietary pattern associated with the asthma symptoms score. Asthma outcomes included; current asthma, current severe asthma, nocturnal cough, exercise-induced wheeze and asthma ever. The RRRderived dietary pattern was characterized by high consumption of fast foods, high-fat snacks, candy, and cheese; and low consumption of fruit, vegetables and rice. The RRR-derived dietary pattern was associated with an increased risk of current asthma (OR [95% CI]) (2.42 [1.19-4.93] for Q4/Q1, p-for-trend=0.01), current severe asthma (3.21 [1.11-9.25] for Q3/Q1, 4.45 [1.59-12.5] for Q4/Q1; p-for-trend=0.003), and nocturnal cough (1.79 [1.06-3.05] for Q2/Q1, 1.74 [1.02-2.97] for Q3/Q1, 1.82 [1.07-3.11] for Q4/Q1; p-for-trend=0.049). Our results suggest that a diet with a high intake of fat and simple sugars and low intake of fruit, vegetables and rice is associated with an increased risk of asthma in Taiwanese children.

84862832776	Measurement of central systolic blood pressure by pulse volume plethysmography with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor	Background Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM). Methods We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient. Results Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were 1.3 ± 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 ± 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.ConclusionsThe PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated. © 2012 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

84862199583	Metformin-inclusive sulfonylurea therapy reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease occurring with Type 2 diabetes in a Taiwanese population cohort	Objectives: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the role of oral anti-hyperglycemic agents (OAA) in any diabetes-PD linkage. Methods: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance database on 01-01-2000, a representative cohort of 800,000 was obtained between 1996-01-01 and 2007-12-31. Those ≥20 years were classified by presence (n = 64,166) or absence (n = 698,587) of T2DM, and whether any OAA (n = 41,003) or not (n = 23,163) was used. Those with T2DM were matched with those diabetes-free by birth-date and gender for the comparison of PD incidence. We considered those ≥50 years and matched PD-free diabetes patients with and without OAAs by age, gender, locality, health service, Charlson comorbidity index and T2DM diagnosis-date to avoid 'immortal time bias'. PD incidence densities (PID, per 10,000 person-years) and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated. Results: HRs (95% confidence interval, CI), related to diabetes-free, were 2.18 (1.27-3.73) and 1.30 (0.77-2.19) for T2DM without and with OAAs. For sulfonylurea alone, PID (95% CI) increased from 58.3 (46.6-70.1) to 83.2 (68.6-97.7), with similar findings by gender, but little difference if metformin was used. The metformin-alone HR (95% CI) was 0.95 (0.53-1.71), sulfonylurea-alone 1.57 (1.15-2.13), and combined therapy 0.78 (0.61-1.01) and these differences persisted when incident PD was excluded for 4 years after T2DM diagnosis. The use of metformin first, in those without insulin, provided an HR of 0.40 (0.17-0.94). Conclusions: Incident PD risk in T2DM increases 2.2-fold. Sulfonylureas further increase risk by 57%, which is avoided by combination with metformin. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862776662	Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infection in Taiwan from 2005 to 2008: Further spread of CRF07-BC and emergence of CRF07-BC/subtype B dual infection	Background: In 2004, HIV-1 infection among Taiwanese injection drug users (IDUs) started to surge. In 2007, a resurgence of HIV-1 epidemic among men having sex with men (MSM) occurred. We conducted a molecular epidemiological study of HIV-1 among different risk groups in Taiwan from 2005 to 2008. Methods: In total 1133 HIV-1-infected adults including 576 IDUs, 464 MSM, and 93 heterosexuals were recruited. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction and phylogenetic analysis. Dual infection was confirmed using cloning, sequencing, and heteroduplex mobility assay. Results: Among HIV-1/AIDS subjects, 96.1% MSM and 62.5% heterosexual males were infected with subtype B, whereas 66.7% female heterosexuals were infected with CRF01-AE. Most IDUs (84.5%) were infected with CRF07-BC. Four heterosexual males, 2 females and 2 MSM who were not IDUs had CRF07-BC. Forty-nine patients had CRF07-BC/subtype B dual infection and 44 (89.8%) were IDUs. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the odds ratio for dual infection among IDUs who shared syringes >5 times per month was 4.7 (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 17.7). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that there were 2 main groups of CRF07-BC strains with sporadic transmission between different risk groups. Among 10 IDUs infected with CRF01-AE, 7 cases were clustered with an outbreak happened in 2005 and 3 cases were clustered with other strains from heterosexual population. Conclusions: In Taiwan, 7.8% of HIV-1-infected IDUs had dual infection. It may have important impact to their clinical management. Although CRF07-BC was still remained in IDUs, it has spread to MSM and heterosexual populations. © 2012 Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.

84863056816	Two strategies to intensify evidence-based medicine education of undergraduate students: A randomised controlled trial	Introduction: Undergraduate evidence-based practice (EBP) is usually taught through standalone courses and workshops away from clinical practice. This study compared the effects of 2 clinically integrated educational strategies on fnal year medical students. Materials and Methods: Final year medical students rotating to the general medicine service for a 2-week internship were randomly assigned to participate in a weekly EBP-structured case conference focusing on students' primary care patients (Group A, n = 47), or to receive a weekly didactic lecture about EBP (Group B, n = 47). The teaching effects of these 2 interventions were evaluated by a validated instrument for assessment of EBP related knowledge (EBP-K), attitude (EBP-A), personal application (EBP-P), and anticipated future use (EBP-F) on the frst and last days of rotation. Results: All scores improved signifcantly after the 2-week EBM-teaching for both groups. When compared to Group B, students in Group A had signifcantly higher post-intervention scores of EBP-K (21.2 ± 3.5 vs 19.0 ± 4.6; ie. 57.8 ± 72.9% vs 29.1 ± 39.1%; P <0.01) and EBP-P (18.7 ± 4.3 vs 15.3 ± 3.9; ie. 28.5 ± 25.5% vs 14.1 ± 18.7%; P <0.001). In contrast, the scores of EBP-A and EBP-F were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Structured case conference, when compared to the didactic lectures, signifcantly improved EBP-K and EBP-P for fnal year medical students.

84866505041	Cardiovascular determinants of prognosis in normotensive hemodialysis patients	Background: Normotension has been hold to be the goal of hemodialysis. It remains obscure which cardiovascular parameter determines the prognosis in these normotensive hemodialysis patients. Methods. We prospectively enrolled 145 hemodialysis patients, who had attained normotension without anti-hypertensive medications, and followed them for 72.628.5 months. Important cardiovascular parameters were obtained at enrollment. Predictors for all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were identified with the Cox model. Results: There were 45 (18 cardiovascular/27 non-cardiovascular) deaths occurred during follow-up. Age, diabetes, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) were significant predictors for all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. After adjustment for age and diabetes, only LVEF was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. LVEF was significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality. LVEF remained as a significant independent predictor of cardiovascular death after adjusting for age, diabetes, LVMI, CIMT, or PWV, respectively. Conclusion: LVEF is the independent predictor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in the normotensive hemodialysis patients. © 2012 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84867743885	Measurement of central aortic pulse pressure: Noninvasive brachial cuff-based estimation by a transfer function vs. a novel pulse wave analysis method	BackgroundThe prognostic value of central aortic pulse pressure (PP-C) may have been underestimated due to its measurement inaccuracy. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of noninvasive brachial cuff-based estimation of PP-C by a generalized transfer function (GTF) or a novel pulse wave analysis (PWA) approach to directly estimate PP-C.MethodsInvasive high-fidelity right brachial and central aortic pressure tracings, and left brachial pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) waveforms from an oscillometric blood pressure (BP) monitor were all digitized simultaneously in 40 patients during cardiac catheterization. An aortic-to-brachial GTF and a PWA multivariate prediction model using the PVP waveforms calibrated to brachial cuff systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP(DBP) were constructed. Accuracy of the two methods was examined in another 100 patients against invasively measured PP-C.ResultsThe error of cuff PP in estimating PP-C was 1.8 ± 12.4 mm Hg. Application of the GTF on noninvasively calibrated PVP waveforms produced reconstructed aortic pressure waves and PP-C estimates with errors of 3.4 ± 11.6 mm Hg (PP-C = reconstructed aortic SBP aortic DBP) and 2.3 ± 11.4 mm Hg (PP-C = reconstructed aortic SBP cuff DBP), respectively. The observed systematic errors were proportional to the magnitudes of PP-C. In contrast, the error of the PWA prediction model was 3.0 ± 7.1 mm Hg without obvious proportional systematic error.ConclusionsLarge random and systematic errors are introduced into the PP-C estimates when PP-C is calculated as the difference between the estimated central SBP and central or cuff DBP. The accuracy can be improved substantially with the novel PWA approach. © 2012 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

84870059299	Increased risk of affective disorders in type 2 diabetes is minimized by sulfonylurea and metformin combination: A population-based cohort study	Background: To confirm whether type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an affective disorder (AD) precursor, and to establish possible effects of oral anti-hyperglycemic agents (OAAs).Methods: A representative cohort of 800,000 subjects was obtained from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance database on 1 January 2000. Those with consistent data (n = 762,753) were followed up between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2007. Over this period, we assessed the presence (n = 62,988) or absence (n = 699,795) of T2DM, and whether any OAA was used (n = 40,232) or not (n = 22,756). To compare the risk of AD by diabetic status, those with T2DM were matched for birth date and gender with those without T2DM. To assess the effect of OAAs, we considered those 50 years and over. Matched AD-free patients with T2DM on OAAs were compared with those without OAAs, for age, gender, locality, health service, Charlson Comorbidity Index. and diabetes diagnosis date to avoid immortal time bias. AD incidence densities, hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Results: Compared with diabetes-free subjects, the HR (95% CI) for AD was 2.62 (2.31 to 2.98) for patients with T2DM who were not on OAAs, and 1.08 (0.99 to 1.18) for those who were on OAAs. The AD incidence density decreased from 91.1 to 39.4 per 10,000 person-years for patients on the combination of metformin and sulfonylurea. The HR (95% CI) for AD was 0.92 (0.59 to 1.45) for those on metformin alone, 1.08 (0.84 to 1.38) for those on sulfonylurea alone, and 0.40 (0.32 to 0.50) for the combined treatment, and the decrease was not related to sequence or insulin usage. Similar patterns were seen for incident AD exclusion for up to 3 years, although more so for bipolar than unipolar.Conclusions: The incident AD risk is increased by 2.6-fold in T2DM, and the combination of sulfonylurea and metformin minimizes this risk. © 2012 Wahlqvist et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84870433992	Excessive wave reflections on admission predict post-discharge events in patients hospitalized due to acute heart failure	AimsThe role of wave reflections in the pathogenesis of acute heart failure syndrome (AHFS) remains unclear. The present study investigated the long-term prognostic values of the carotid augmentation index (cAI), carotid augmented pressure (cAP), amplitude of the reflected pressure wave from a decomposed carotid pressure wave (Pb), and carotid pulse pressure (PP) on admission in patients hospitalized due to AHFS.Methods and resultsA total of 120 patients (72 ± 14 years, 83.3 men) hospitalized due to AHFS (55.8 with systolic heart failure) were enrolled. Measures of cAI, cAP, Pb, carotid PP, and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) by tonometry and thoracic fluid content (TFC) by impedance cardiography were obtained within 24 h of admission. N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were determined before discharge. Patients were followed up for a median of 601 days, accruing 66 adverse events including re-hospitalization for heart failure, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and death. In univariate Cox analysis, all measures significantly predicted post-discharge events (all P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, cAP [hazard ratio per SD and 95 confidence interval: 1.32 (1.051-1.67), P = 0.017], Pb [1.44 (1.13-1.84), P = 0.004] and carotid PP [1.35 (1.05-1.73), P = 0.019], but not cAI, TFC, or cf-PWV, significantly independently predicted events with adjustments for age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, haemoglobin, and NT-proBNP.ConclusionOn-admission measures of wave reflection magnitude, including cAP, Pb, and carotid PP, may be useful for predicting long-term outcomes in AHFS patients. The results support a major role for wave reflection in the pathogenesis of AHFS. © 2012 The Author.

84871779085	Impact of obesity and hypertriglyceridemia on gout development with or without hyperuricemia: A prospective study	Objective Hyperuricemia is the most important risk factor for the development of gout; however, not all patients with hyperuricemia develop gout, and patients experiencing a gout attack are not necessarily found to have hyperuricemia. We hypothesized that the interactions between serum uric acid (sUA) and other potential metabolic comorbidities increase the risk of gout development. Methods A prospective study was conducted to link baseline metabolic profiles from the MJ Health Screening Center to gout outcomes extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the metabolic risks for incident gout stratified by hyperuricemia status (sUA level >7 mg/dl or not). Results During a mean followup period of 6.45 years (261,500 person-years), 1,189 patients with clinical gout (899 men, 202 women ages >50 years, and 88 women ages ≤50 years) were identified among the 40,513 examinees. The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of hyperuricemia for gouty arthritis were 5.80 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 4.93-6.81) in men and 4.37 (95% CI 3.38-5.66) in women. Hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level >150 mg/dl) was found as an independent risk factor, with HRs of 1.38 (95% CI 1.18-1.60) in men with hyperuricemia and 1.40 (95% CI 1.02-1.92) in men without hyperuricemia.

84871858803	Paradoxes with weight disorders for health systems	The body mass index (BMI) has served public health and clinical medicine well in the recognition of obesity. However, its use has generated some instructive paradoxes and misunderstandings which argue for the appreciation of body compositional disorders (BCD) as such and, in particular, for the parallel evaluation of muscle mass with a definition of 'orthosarcal' conditions to enable the early detection of sarcopenia. Across the life-span, and with gender and ethnic differentials, BCD is basic to the full spectrum of nutritionally-related disorders and diseases. In the case of metabolic diseases like diabetes, muscle, fatness and its distribution, and even bone seem to play pathogenetic roles. Optimal body fat and distribution are relevant to child development, maternal health and healthy ageing, with much more to learn about the mechanisms. The economic and societal costs of obesity tend to increase progressively with the BMI, but the health outcomes, at least for mortality, are J-or U-shaped. With some established chronic diseases, like diabetes, renal failure or cardiac failure, overfatness may be protective; sometimes this may be because contaminant fat-soluble endocrine disrupters are segregated in fat tissue. This means that some of the relatively favourable survival in the elderly who have more body fat is at the expense of the health care system. Younger children with chronic energy deficiency, on the other hand, may succumb before expenditure saves them. In these respects, our species is more vulnerable than we have thought. Fortunately, a better understanding of BMI and health is emerging.

84871860638	The U-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality contrasts with a progressive increase in medical expenditure: A prospective cohort study	The U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality has generated uncertainty about optimal BMI. For clarification, we have related BMI to both mortality and medical expenditure. The MJ Health examination cohort of 111,949 examinees established during 1994-1996 was followed with endpoint information derived from death certificates and National Health Insurance records from 1996 to 2007. Age- and gender-specific relative risks between BMI groups were estimated by Cox and logistic regressions. The BMI and all-cause mortality relationship is U-shaped with the concave regions sitting in the region of BMI 22-26, butshifted rightward for the elderly. After excluding smokers and cancer patients at baseline, the low mortality region moved leftward to BMI 20-22. Cause-specific mortalities from respiratory disease, injury, and senility increased in the underweight group (BMI <18.5). Above 18.5, BMI was negatively associated with mortality from respiratory diseases and senility, but not with others. In contrast, irrespective of age and gender, the overall median and mean medical expenditures progressively increased with BMI, particularly beyond 22. Expenditures for injury, respiratory, circulatory diseases and senility all increased with BMI. The U-shaped BMI-mortality relation was a result of elevated death rate at both ends of the BMI scale. Increased mortality at the low end did not contribute to higher medical expenditure, maybe because the lean and frail deceased tend to die abruptly before large amount of medical expenditure was consumed. Our findings suggest that current recommendations to maintain BMI at the lower end of the desirable range remain tenable for the apparently healthy general public.

84875457562	Association of clinical symptomatic hypoglycemia with cardiovascular events and total mortality in type 2 diabetes: A nationwide population-based study	OBJECTIVE-Hypoglycemia is associated with serious health outcomes for patients treated for diabetes. However, the outcome of outpatients with type 2 diabetes who have experienced hypoglycemia episodes is largely unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-The study population, derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database released by the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes during 1998-2009, comprised 77,611 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We designed a prospective study consisting of randomly selected hypoglycemic type 2 diabetic patients and matched type 2 diabetic patients without hypoglycemia. We investigated the relationships of hypoglycemia with total mortality and cardiovascular events, including stroke, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause hospitalization. RESULTS-Therewere 1,844 hypoglycemic events (500 inpatients and 1,344 outpatients)among the 77,611 patients. Both mild (outpatient) and severe (inpatient) hypoglycemia cases had a higher percentage of comorbidities, including hypertension, renal diseases, cancer, stroke, and heart disease. In multivariate Cox regression models, including diabetes treatment adjustment, diabetic patients with hypoglycemia had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular events during clinical treatment periods. After constructing a model adjusted with propensity scores, mild and severe hypoglycemia still demonstrated higher hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular diseases (HR 2.09 [95% CI 1.63- 2.67]), all-cause hospitalization (2.51 [2.00-3.16]), and total mortality (2.48 [1.41-4.38]). CONCLUSIONS-Symptomatic hypoglycemia, whether clinically mild or severe, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. More attention may be needed for diabetic patients with hypoglycemic episodes. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.

84876519046	C-reactive protein predicts systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure but not diastolic blood pressure: The cardiovascular disease risk factors two-township study	OBJECTIVEInflammation has been associated with cardiovascular events and mortality, using C-reactive protein (CRP) as a marker. We examined whether the baseline serum concentration of CRP can independently predict the development of hypertension or future systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) in a community-based population in Taiwan. Methods A study population sample was recruited in cycle 2 (1990-1993) of the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtors Two-township Study (CVDFACTS) and was followed to 1994-1997. A total of 2,113 nondiabetic adults with normal BP were enrolled for the study of incident hypertension. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90mm Hg, or the use of antihypertensive drugs. Cox regression and linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between baseline serum concentrations of CRP measured with a high-sensitivity assay and the development of hypertension and future SBP/DBP and pulse pressure (PP).RESULTSDuring the follow-up period of a median of 3.27 years, 145 participants developed incident hypertension. The incidence rates of hypertension by tertile of increasing CRP were 9.3, 19.0, and 33.0 per 1,000 person-years (P for trend < 0.01). In the multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, and prehypertension, baseline CRP remained significantly predictive of incident hypertension. The concentration of CRP was associated with SBP and PP, but not with DBP.CONCLUSIONInflammation is associated with future SBP in the Taiwanese population. © 2013 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013.

84878015791	Gender difference in statin intervention on blood lipid control among patients with coronary heart disease	SummaryBackground The aim of this study was to clarify the current status in the effective control of dyslipidemia in Taiwanese women and men with coronary heart disease (CHD). Materials and methods A total 1584 patients with CHD (1188 men, aged 64.8 ± 11.6 years and 396 women, aged 69.0 ± 9.8 years) from 3486 patients who had atherosclerotic vascular disease and complete lipids measured values [total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)] were used for analysis. Results The waist, height, weight, and creatinine levels were higher in men than in women. The systolic blood pressure, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose, and platelet were lower in men than in women. Men were more likely to achieve the target goal than women in TC < 160 mg/dL, LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and TG < 150 mg/dL as well as to achieve HDL-C goal. Conclusion A significant gap was found between the guidelines and clinical practice in statin intervention among these CHD patients, particularly for women. The strategy in control of dyslipidemia should consider gender difference. Copyright © 2013, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

84878323021	The impacts of serum uric acid on arterial hemodynamics and cardiovascular risks	Hyperuricemia, and its clinical manifestation gout, is a metabolic disease process that has been recognized since the dawn of medical inquiry. Uric acid was hypothesized to be a mediator of cardiovascular disease for period of time. Epidemiological correlations of hyperuricemia with hypertension and cardiovascular events were evident for two centuries' studies. With recent animal studies shedding light on the causal mechanisms of hypertension, and clinical trials suggesting that urate-lowering therapy can lower blood pressure, there appears to be growing evidence of a connection between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease. To help bring this recent uric acid research into context, we have undertaken this narrative review of hyperuricemia, hypertension, its hemodynamics and its outcomes, and the risk for cardiovascular diseases.

84878903054	White coat hypertension is more risky than prehypertension: Important role of arterial wave reflections	Arterial aging may link cardiovascular risk to white coat hypertension (WCH). The aims of the present study were to investigate the role of arterial aging in the white coat effect, defined as the difference between office and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressures, and to compare WCH with prehypertension (PH) with respect to target organ damage and long-term cardiovascular mortality. A total of 1257 never-been-treated volunteer subjects from a community-based survey were studied. WCH and PH were defined by office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures. Left ventricular mass index, carotid intima-media thickness, estimated glomerular filtration rate, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, carotid augmentation index, amplitude of the reflection pressure wave, and 15-year cardiovascular mortality were determined. Subjects with WCH were significantly older and had greater body mass index, blood pressure values, intima-media thickness, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, amplitude of the backward pressure wave, and a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than PH. Amplitude of the backward pressure wave was the most important independent correlate of the white coat effect in multivariate analysis (model r=0.451; partial r/model r=90.5%). WCH had significantly greater cardiovascular mortality than PH (hazard ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-7.91), after accounting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, fasting plasma glucose, and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio. Further adjustment of the model for amplitude of the backward pressure wave eliminated the statistical significance of the WCH effect. In conclusion, the white coat effect is mainly caused by arterial aging. WCH carries higher risk for cardiovascular mortality than PH, probably via enhanced wave reflections that accompany arterial aging. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84879209678	Reduced medication use and improved pulmonary function with supplements containing vegetable and fruit concentrate, fish oil and probiotics in asthmatic school children: A randomised controlled trial	Dietary pattern changes may be one of the key factors associated with increasing asthma prevalence. Observational studies have found negative associations between fruit, vegetable and fish consumption and risk of asthma. Experimental studies have also shown that probiotics can modulate the immune system. However, each dietary component exhibits a modest effect. The objective of the present study was to investigate the joint effect of multiple beneficial dietary components on asthma. We designed a 16-week school-based double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial. The supplement group received fruit plus vegetable concentrate, fish oil and probiotics (FVFP supplement), while the control group received placebos. A total of 192 asthmatic children aged 10-12 years were recruited from elementary schools in metropolitan Taipei. Pulmonary function, medication usage, Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) score and the Childhood Asthma Control Test score were evaluated at baseline, and at weeks 8 and 16. Compared with the placebo group, the supplement group showed significant improvement in pulmonary function parameters (91 v. 178 ml for forced vital capacity (FVC), 40 v. 107 ml for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and 1·6 v. 4·8 % for FEV1:FVC ratio; all P values < 0·01) and had a significantly reduced proportion of those using short-acting inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. However, the PAQLQ score and the Childhood Asthma Control Test score were not significantly different between the two groups, possibly because the majority of the children were treated routinely. FVFP supplements reduced medication use and improved pulmonary function in asthmatic children. The present study supports an adjuvant intervention with a combination of fruit, vegetable, fish and probiotic foods. © 2012 The Authors.

84880309934	Association between alanine aminotransferase and intracerebral hemorrhage in east Asian populations	Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and chronic liver disease are relatively common in East Asian countries. However, the relationship between the two diseases is unclear. Thus, we investigated the association between serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and ICH risk in East Asian populations. Methods: The East Asian Network for Stroke Prevention enrolled 279,982 participants with ALT measurements from four cohort studies in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and mainland China. Among them, 1,324 ICH events and 493 ICH deaths were observed. Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis was performed in each cohort to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) after adjusting for age, blood pressure, diabetes, total cholesterol, smoking and alcohol intake. Combined HRs were then estimated using pooled analyses with fixed-effects models. Results: The multivariate-adjusted pooled HRs (with 95% confidence interval, CI) for ICH incidence per 10 IU/l increments of ALT were 1.04 (1.03-1.04) in men and 1.01 (0.98-1.04) in women. Corresponding HRs for ICH mortality were 1.04 (1.02-1.05) in men and 1.04 (1.00-1.08) in women. The pooled HRs for ICH incidence in participants with ALT levels greater than or equal to 50 IU/l compared to those with levels less than 20 IU/l were 1.74 (1.41-2.16) in men and 1.60 (1.06-2.40) in women. The corresponding HRs for ICH mortality were 1.72 (1.21-2.44) in men and 1.63 (0.79-3.36) in women. Conclusions: An elevated ALT level was independently and significantly associated with an increased risk of ICH in East Asian men, but the association was less prominent in women. © 2013 S.

84883749528	Dietary intakes consistent with the DASH dietary pattern reduce blood pressure increase with age and risk for stroke in a Chinese population	The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been proven to effectively lower blood pressure (BP), and associate with a lower cardiovascular disease and stroke risk in mainly non-Asians. Further, it is unclear if adhering to the DASH target nutrients has similar BP impact as adhering to the recommended DASH food groups. Associations between adherence to DASH foods or nutrients and BP or stroke risk were assessed in 1420 and 2061 Taiwanese adults from 1989 to 2002, respectively. The DASH food score (p=0.053), dairy (p=0.030) and calcium (p=0.020) intake were significantly and inversely associated with follow up systolic BP change in univariate analyses. Both dairy (p=0.020) and calcium (p=0.001) also showed a consistent inverse association with systolic BP change in multivariate analysis. None of the factors examined was associated with diastolic BP change. Both DASH nutrient score and magnesium intakes were significantly associated with the hazard ratio (HR) for total stroke in an inverse relationship. The HR of total stroke comparing the highest to the lowest tertile was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.41-0.98, p=0.037) for the DASH nutrient score, and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.40-0.97, p=0.030) for magnesium intake. Similar findings were observed for DASH nutrient score (p=0.011) and magnesium intake (p=0.043) with the HR for ischemic stroke. The HR for total and ischemic stroke for calcium intake also showed a borderline trend (p=0.071 and 0.051, respectively). In conclusion, adhering to the DASH diet is beneficial for long term BP control and reduction of stroke risk in this Chinese population.

84884846282	Meat intake and cause-specific mortality: A pooled analysis of Asian prospective cohort studies	Background: Total or red meat intake has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of mortality in Western populations, but little is known of the risks in Asian populations Objective: We examined temporal trends in meat consumption and associations between meat intake and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Asia Design: We used ecological data from the United Nations to compare country-specific meat consumption. Separately, 8 Asian prospective cohort studies in Bangladesh, China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan consisting of 112,310 men and 184,411 women were followed for 6.6 to 15.6 y with 24,283 all-cause, 9558 cancer, and 6373 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. We estimated the study specific HRs and 95% CIs by using a Cox regression model and pooled them by using a random-effects model Results: Red meat consumption was substantially lower in the Asian countries than in the United States. Fish and seafood consumption was higher in Japan and Korea than in the United States. Our pooled analysis found no association between intake of total meat (red meat, poultry, and fish/seafood) and risks of all-cause, CVD, or cancer mortality among men and women; HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality from a comparison of the highest with the lowest quartile were 1.02 (0.91, 1.15) in men and 0.93 (0.86, 1.01) in women Conclusions: Ecological data indicate an increase in meat intake in Asian countries; however, our pooled analysis did not provide evidence of a higher risk of mortality for total meat intake and provided evidence of an inverse association with red meat, poultry, and fish/seafood. Red meat intake was inversely associated with CVD mortality in men and with cancer mortality in women in Asian countries. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.

84885618620	Hysterectomy in young women associates with higher risk of stroke: A nationwide cohort study	Background and purpose Hysterectomy is a common procedure for treatment of numerous gynecologic diseases. However, reduction of endogenous sex hormone levels has been reported in hysterectomized women, and the association of hysterectomy with the cardiovascular risk remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the influence of hysterectomy on the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease, with adjustment for traditional risk factors. Methods A nationwide population-based study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance database from 1 million sampling cohort data set. A total of 7605 women who underwent hysterectomy without simultaneous oophorectomy from 1997 to 2009 were identified. The control group consisted of 30,420 women without hysterectomy, selected by matching the age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and the commencement date of follow-up. Results A total of 558 strokes and 599 coronary heart diseases (CHD) developed during a median 7.24 years follow-up. The difference was not significant between women with and without hysterectomy for stroke (2.34 vs. 2.08 per 1000 person-year, p = 0.26) and CHD (2.39 vs. 2.26, p = 0.53). However, of the women who underwent hysterectomy before 45 years, the hazard ratio of hysterectomy was 2.29 (95% CI, 1.52-3.44) for stroke and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.71-1.83) for CHD. Conclusions Categorized by the patients' age at operation, the associations between hysterectomy and the risk of stroke were different. The excess risk of stroke was observed in women who had hysterectomy before 45 years and remained significant even after accounting for baseline cardiovascular risk factors. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84885632063	Associations of serum uric acid levels with arterial wave reflections and central systolic blood pressure	Background Uric acid may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We investigated the roles of four major hemodynamic parameters of blood pressure, including arterial stiffness, wave reflections, cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR), in the association between uric acid and central systolic blood pressure (SBP-c). Methods A sample of 1303 normotensive and untreated hypertensive Taiwanese participants (595 women, aged 30-79 years) was drawn from a community-based survey. Study subjects' baseline characteristics, biochemical parameters, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), amplitude of the backward pressure wave decomposed from a calibrated tonometry-derived carotid pressure waveform (Pb), CO, TPR, and SBP-c were analyzed. Results In multi-variate analyses adjusted for age, waist circumference, body mass index, creatinine, total cholesterol, smoking, and heart rate, uric acid significantly correlated with Pb and cf-PWV in men, and Pb and TPR in women. The correlation between uric acid and Pb remained significant in men and women when cf-PWV was further adjusted. In the final multi-variate prediction model (model r

84885235556	Association between body mass index and cardiovascular disease mortality in east Asians and south Asians: Pooled analysis of prospective data from the Asia Cohort Consortium	Objective To evaluate the association between body mass index and mortality from overall cardiovascular disease and specific subtypes of cardiovascular disease in east and south Asians. Design Pooled analyses of 20 prospective cohorts in Asia, including data from 835 082 east Asians and 289 815 south Asians. Cohorts were identified through a systematic search of the literature in early 2008, followed by a survey that was sent to each cohort to assess data availability. Setting General populations in east Asia (China, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and Korea) and south Asia (India and Bangladesh). Participants 1 124 897 men and women (mean age 53.4 years at baseline). Main outcome measures Risk of death from overall cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, and (in east Asians only) stroke subtypes. Results 49 184 cardiovascular deaths (40 791 in east Asians and 8393 in south Asians) were identified during a mean follow-up of 9.7 years. East Asians with a body mass index of 25 or above had a raised risk of death from overall cardiovascular disease, compared with the reference range of body mass index (values 22.5-24.9; hazard ratio 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.15), 1.27 (1.20 to 1.35), 1.59 (1.43 to 1.76), 1.74 (1.47 to 2.06), and 1.97 (1.44 to 2.71) for body mass index ranges 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, 30.0-32.4, 32.5-34.9, and 35.0-50.0, respectively). This association was similar for risk of death from coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke; for haemorrhagic stroke, the risk of death was higher at body mass index values of 27.5 and above. Elevated risk of death from cardiovascular disease was also observed at lower categories of body mass index (hazard ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.39) and 2.16 (1.37 to 3.40) for body mass index ranges 15.0-17.4 and <15.0, respectively), compared with the reference range. In south Asians, the association between body mass index and mortality from cardiovascular disease was less pronounced than that in east Asians. South Asians had an increased risk of death observed for coronary heart disease only in individuals with a body mass index greater than 35 (hazard ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 3.12). Conclusions Body mass index shows a U shaped association with death from overall cardiovascular disease among east Asians: increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease is observed at lower and higher ranges of body mass index. A high body mass index is a risk factor for mortality from overall cardiovascular disease and for specific diseases, including coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, and haemorrhagic stroke in east Asians. Higher body mass index is a weak risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular disease in south Asians.

84886862518	Derivation and validation of diagnostic thresholds for central blood pressure measurements based on long-term cardiovascular risks	Objectives This study sought to derive and validate outcome-driven thresholds of central blood pressure (CBP) for diagnosing hypertension. Background Current guidelines for managing patients with hypertension mainly rely on blood pressure (BP) measured at brachial arteries (cuff BP). However, BP measured at the central aorta (central BP [CBP]) may be a better prognostic factor for predicting future cardiovascular events than cuff BP. Methods In a derivation cohort (1,272 individuals and a median follow-up of 15 years), we determined diagnostic thresholds for CBP by using current guideline-endorsed cutoffs for cuff BP with a bootstrapping (resampling by drawing randomly with replacement) and an approximation method. To evaluate the discriminatory power in predicting cardiovascular outcomes, the derived thresholds were tested in a validation cohort (2,501 individuals with median follow-up of 10 years). Results The 2 analyses yielded similar diagnostic thresholds for CBP. After rounding, systolic/diastolic threshold was 110/80 mm Hg for optimal BP and 130/90 mm Hg for hypertension. Compared with optimal BP, the risk of cardiovascular mortality increased significantly in subjects with hypertension (hazard ratio: 3.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 9.05). Of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, incorporation of a dichotomous variable by defining hypertension as CBP ≥130/90 mm Hg was associated with the largest contribution to the predictive power. Conclusions CBP of 130/90 mm Hg was determined to be the cutoff limit for normality and was characterized by a greater discriminatory power for long-term events in our validation cohort. This report represents an important step toward the application of the CBP concept in clinical practice. © 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation Published by Elsevier Inc.

84891879697	Early contribution of arterial wave reflection to left ventricular relaxation abnormalities in a community-dwelling population of normotensive and untreated hypertensive men and women	We examined the contribution of arterial wave reflection to early abnormalities in left ventricular relaxation, whether this association was modified by gender or hypertension and the role of reflected wave timing and amplitude. We studied a cohort of normotensive and untreated essential hypertensive Taiwanese participants (675 men, 601 women, mean age 52 years). Doppler flow and applanation tonometry were performed to assess carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI). Diastolic parameters including the ratio between the peak velocity of early and late diastolic mitral inflow (E/A), E-deceleration time and left atrial (LA) diameter were measured by echocardiography. In multivariate models predicting E/A, women were more likely to have lower E/A than men (β=-0.08, P<0.001). AI was significantly associated with lower E/A in both men (β=-0.09, P=0.005) and women (β=-0.12, P<0.001) independent of PWV. Inclusion of AI in the overall model reduced the gender difference in E/A by 61% and rendered it nonsignificant. There was a significant interaction between AI and hypertension (P=0.02). The inverse association between AI and E/A was significant only in normotensive men and women, and only for the amplitude but not timing of the reflected wave. In conclusion, the contribution of wave reflection to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was independent of arterial stiffness, more pronounced in normotensive individuals and explained a significant portion of the gender difference in diastolic function.

84893070147	Gender disparities in optimal lipid control among patients with coronary artery disease	Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide in both men and women. Hypercholesterolemia is a major factor contributing to the incidence of CHD. Many lipid-lowering trials have shown statins to be effective medications for the primary and secondary prevention of CHD. Some studies have suggested that statins are as or more effective in women than in men. However, there is a substantial gender gap in lipid goal attainment with respect to primary care guidelines, as reported in observational studies. In this article, we attempt to explain gender differences in lipid control in individuals with or at risk of CHD in order to improve awareness of and narrow gaps in gender disparities in lipid management.

84894228427	Diagnostic performance of a stand-alone central blood pressure monitor: Application of central blood pressure in the diagnosis of high blood pressure	BACKGROUNDOscillometric central blood pressure (CBP) monitors have emerged as a new technology for blood pressure (BP) measurements. With a newly proposed diagnostic threshold for CBP, we investigated the diagnostic performance of a novel CBP monitor.METHODSWe recruited a consecutive series of 138 subjects (aged 30-93 years) without previous use of antihypertensive agents for simultaneous invasive and noninvasive measurements of BP in a catheterization laboratory. With the cutoff (CBP ≥130/90mm Hg) for high blood pressure (HBP), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the novel CBP monitor were calculated with reference to the measured CBP. In comparison, the diagnostic performance of the conventional cuff BP was also evaluated.RESULTSThe noninvasive CBP for detecting HBP in a sample with a prevalence of 52% showed a sensitivity of 93% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 91-95), specificity of 95% (95% CI = 94-97), PPV of 96% (95% CI = 94-97), and NPV of 93% (95% CI = 90-95). In contrast, with cuff BP and the traditional HBP criterion (cuff BP ≥140/90mm Hg), the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 49% (95% CI = 44-53), 94% (95% CI = 92-96), 90% (95% CI = 86-93), and 63% (95% CI 59-66), respectively.CONCLUSIONSA stand-alone oscillometric CBP monitor may provide CBP values with acceptable diagnostic accuracy. However, with reference to invasively measured CBP, cuff BP had low sensitivity and NPV, which could render possible management inaccessible to a considerable proportion of HBP patients, who may be identifiable through noninvasive CBP measurements from the CBP monitor. © 2014 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

84896737477	The impact of chronic kidney disease on lipid management and goal attainment in patients with atherosclerosis diseases in Taiwan	Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a very high risk cardiovascular disease population and should be treated aggressively. We investigated lipid management in CKD patients with atherosclerosis in Taiwan. Methods: 3057 patients were enrolled in a multi-center study (T-SPARCLE). Lipid goal are defined as total cholesterol (TC) < 160mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <100 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) > 40 mg/dl in men, HDL > 50 mg/dl in women, non-HDL cholesterol < 130mg/dl, and triglyceride < 150 mg/dl. Results: Compared with those without CKD (n=2239), patients with CKD (n=818) had more co-morbidities (hypertension, glucose intolerance, stroke and heart failure) and lower HDL but higher triglyceride levels. Overall 2168 (70.5%) patients received lipid-lowering agents. There was similar equivalent statin potency between CKD and non-CKD groups. The goal attainment is lower in HDL and TG in the CKD group as compared with non-CKD subjects (47.1 vs. 51.9% and 63.2 vs. 68.9% respectively, both p < 0.02). Analysis of sex and CKD interaction on goals attainment showed female CKD subjects had lower non-HDL and TG goals attainment compared with non-CKD males (both p < 0.019). Conclusion: Although presenting with more comorbidities, the CKD population had suboptimal lipid goal attainment rate as compared with the non-CKD population. Further efforts may be required for better lipid control especially on the female CKD subjects. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84900415399	Burden of Total and Cause-Specific Mortality Related to Tobacco Smoking among Adults Aged ≥45 Years in Asia: A Pooled Analysis of 21 Cohorts	Background:Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for many diseases. We sought to quantify the burden of tobacco-smoking-related deaths in Asia, in parts of which men's smoking prevalence is among the world's highest.Methods and Findings:We performed pooled analyses of data from 1,049,929 participants in 21 cohorts in Asia to quantify the risks of total and cause-specific mortality associated with tobacco smoking using adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. We then estimated smoking-related deaths among adults aged ≥45 y in 2004 in Bangladesh, India, mainland China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan-accounting for ∼71% of Asia's total population. An approximately 1.44-fold (95% CI = 1.37-1.51) and 1.48-fold (1.38-1.58) elevated risk of death from any cause was found in male and female ever-smokers, respectively. In 2004, active tobacco smoking accounted for approximately 15.8% (95% CI = 14.3%-17.2%) and 3.3% (2.6%-4.0%) of deaths, respectively, in men and women aged ≥45 y in the seven countries/regions combined, with a total number of estimated deaths of ∼1,575,500 (95% CI = 1,398,000-1,744,700). Among men, approximately 11.4%, 30.5%, and 19.8% of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory diseases, respectively, were attributable to tobacco smoking. Corresponding proportions for East Asian women were 3.7%, 4.6%, and 1.7%, respectively. The strongest association with tobacco smoking was found for lung cancer: A 3- to 4-fold elevated risk, accounting for 60.5% and 16.7% of lung cancer deaths, respectively, in Asian men and East Asian women aged ≥45 y.Conclusions:Tobacco smoking is associated with a substantially elevated risk of mortality, accounting for approximately 2 million deaths in adults aged ≥45 y throughout Asia in 2004. It is likely that smoking-related deaths in Asia will continue to rise over the next few decades if no effective smoking control programs are implemented.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. © 2014 Zheng et al.

84901602469	Epidemiology of human herpesvirus type 8 and parvovirus B19 infections and their association with HIV-1 among men who have sex with men and injection drug users in Taiwan	Background/Purpose: Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), the causal agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), is transmitted sexually among men who have sex with men (MSM), but little is known of its transmission among injection drug users (IDUs). By contrast, human parvovirus B19 (B19), a causative agent for anemia, is most frequently detected in IDUs. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between HHV-8 infection and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and between B-19 and HIV-1 among MSM and IDUs patients. Methods: Serum samples from 553 IDUs and 231 MSM were analyzed for anti-HHV-8 lytic and anti-B19 viral structural capsid protein 2 (VP-2) antibodies using enzyme immunoassay, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoblot assays. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the associations between different viral infections. Results: HIV-1-seropositive MSM had significantly higher rates of HHV-8 infection than seronegative MSM (32.3% and 15.4%, respectively; OR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.37-5.02). Among HIV-1/AIDS patient groups, MSM had significantly higher HHV-8 seropositive rates (32.3% vs. 6.6%, p < 0.0001) and lower B19 infection rates (35.4% vs. 78.8%, p < 0.001) than IDUs. In addition, HIV-1-infected MSM were 5.95 times (95% CI = 3.38-10.46) more likely to be infected with HHV-8 than male HIV-1-infected IDUs. By contrast, male IDUs were 6.74 times odds (95% CI = 4.28-10.61) more likely to contract B19 infection than MSM. Conclusion: In Taiwan, MSM have a significantly higher prevalence for HHV-8 than IDUs. The contrasting risks of HHV-8 and B19 infections between different HIV-1/AIDS groups suggest that the efficiency of viral infection is affected by their distinct transmission routes. © 2013.

84901931742	Skeletal muscle mass and risk of death in an elderly population	Background and aim: Body mass index (BMI) has a U-shaped relationship with mortality among the elderly, in contrast to the general adult population. Skeletal muscle mass may be more appropriate than BMI for classifying mortality risk among the elderly. We investigated the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and mortality among elderly Chinese persons. Method and results: A total of 1512 elderly from the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwanese Elderly (1999-2000) was enrolled, and the survival status was followed using data from the National Death Registry. The skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) was calculated by dividing skeletal muscle mass by height in meters squared. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the association between SMMI and mortality. During the follow-up (average time: 7.9 years), one-third elderly died (n=506) by any cause and 25% of them was cardiovascular mortality (ICD-9-CM: between 390 and 459). The total mortality and cardiovascular mortality were 4.23 and 1.07 per 100 person-years. Elderly participants with the lowest SMMI had the highest total mortality and cardiovascular mortality among the four quartiles (6.72, 3.76, 3.25 and 3.50 per 100 PY for total mortality; 1.81, 0.76, 0.87, 0.93 for cardiovascular mortality). Those with a low (1st quartile) SMMI had a 2-fold increase in total mortality (1.96; 1.63-2.35) and cardiovascular mortality (2.16; 1.51-3.08) risk compared to those with a normal [2nd, 3rd, or 4th quartile] SMMI. Conclusions: The threshold relationship between SMMI and mortality is contrast to the reverse J-shaped relationship between BMI and total mortality. Therefore, skeletal muscle mass measurement may be considered with a high priority to identify elderly individuals with a high mortality risk. © 2014.

12844257048	Combined use of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial index for fast assessment of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis in a community	Background: Pulse volume recordings and blood pressures at arms and ankles can be obtained automatically and simultaneously to allow fast measurements of the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and the ankle-brachial index. We applied this novel technique to assess the extent of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis in a community. Methods: A total of 1329 residents in Kinmen completed a health survey including interview, physical examination, blood test, and the measurements of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial index in 10 working days. Results: Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was significantly related to age, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, ankle-brachial index, and fasting blood levels of glucose, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, and creatinine, and was significantly related to the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease estimated from the Framingham risk function. The prevalence of arteriosclerosis as defined by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity values higher than the age and sex stratified references from the low risk subjects was 27.1% for men and 25.4% for women. The prevalence of atherosclerosis defined by ankle-brachial index <0.9 was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women. In men but not in women, subjects with low ankle-brachial index had significantly greater risk for developing coronary artery disease than those with normal values. Conclusions: Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial index can be obtained simultaneously and quickly for the assessment of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis in a community. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

13844281418	Hypertension and the insulin-related metabolic syndrome: Factor analysis in 17,539 Taiwanese	Background: Hypertension is a component of the insulin resistance-related metabolic syndrome. However, the relationship between insulin resistance and hypertension remains unclear. Factor analysis is a statistical technique that extracts several unrelated components from a set of intercorrelated risk variables. Risk variables contributing to the same component may share the same pathophysiological process. Methods: Risk variables from 17,539 Taiwanese (8516 men and 9023 women, aged 30 years and older) randomly selected from a large physical checkup database were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis with principal components method. Results: Factor analysis identified two independent factors for men and women, respectively. In men, a cluster of triglycerides, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference, and body mass index (metabolic syndrome) accounted for 42%, and a cluster of glucose, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index (hyperglycemia plus hypertension plus obesity) accounted for 19% of the total variance in all variables considered. In women, a cluster of glucose, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass index (hyperglycemia plus hypertension plus obesity) accounted for 46%, and a cluster of triglycerides, high-density- lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference, and body mass index (metabolic syndrome) accounted for 17% of the total variance. Conclusion: A distinct insulin-resistance-related metabolic syndrome was observed for both men and women in Taiwan. Hypertension was probably linked to the metabolic syndrome through obesity in both Taiwanese men and women.
