9744235918	On the relations between three methods for representing 3D surface textures under arbitrary illumination directions	Representing the appearances of surfaces illuminated from different directions has long been an active research topic. While many representation methods have been proposed, the relationships between the different representations have been less well researched. These relationships are important, as they provide (a) an insight into the different capabilities of the surface representations, and (b) a means by which they may be converted to common computer graphics application formats. In this paper, we introduce a single mathematical framework and use it to express three commonly used surface texture relighting representations: Surface Gradients, Polynomial Texture Maps (PTM) and Eigen base images. The framework explicitly reveals the relations between the three methods, and from this we propose a set of conversion methods.

9744235944	Estimating parameters of an illumination model for the synthesis of specular surface textures	This paper proposes a method to estimate the parameters of an illumination model and then uses these parameters for the synthesis of specular surface textures. We used the relationship between surface gradient maps in the frequency domain as a constraint for the separation of diffuse and specular components. During the estimation, we always keep errors between the real images and reconstructed images as small as possible. The estimated parameters form sample surface representation maps, which are then used as inputs for the synthesis of large representation maps. The synthesized representation maps are finally relit using the illumination model to produce new images under arbitrary illumination directions.

33745422915	Image quantification of high-throughput tissue microarray	Tissue microarray (TMA) technology allows rapid visualization of molecular targets in thousands of tissue specimens at a time and provides valuable information on expression of proteins within tissues at a cellular and sub-cellular level. TMA technology overcomes the bottleneck of traditional tissue analysis and allows it to catch up with the rapid advances in lead discovery. Studies using TMA on immunohistochemistry (1HC) can produce a large amount of images for interpretation within a very short time. Manual interpretation does not allow accurate quantitative analysis of staining to be undertaken. Automatic image capture and analysis has been shown to be superior to manual interpretation. The aims of this work is to develop a truly high-throughput and fully automated image capture and analysis system. We develop a robust colour segmentation algorithm using hue-saturation-intensity (HS1) colour space to provide quantification of signal intensity and partitioning of staining on high-throughput TMA. Initial segmentation results and quantification data have been achieved on 16,000 TMA colour images over 23 different tissue types.

33947251323	Road junction background reconstruction based on median estimation and support vector machines	Reconstruction of road junction background is the key for real-time traffic flow detection using background subtraction. High vehicle density and their rapid changing speeds at the junction present difficulty to background reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a new method that combines Median estimation and the SVM theory for background modeling. We introduce a mechanism for collecting sample frames and blocks for background estimation. Background reconstruction based on Median values is efficient and accurate when the traffic flow is not severely congested. The SVM based background reconstruction method, on the other hand, can overcome the shortcoming of the Median estimation method due to the traffic congestion and therefore enhance the reliability of reconstruction. The proposed method can be applied in intelligent transportation systems based on video sequences. © 2006 IEEE.

34247354192	Experimental investigation of the fringe pattern of capillary tube filled with liquid by using focused laser sheet of light	A focused laser light sheet was used to illuminate the capillary tube filled with liquid and fringe patterns can be seen. The fringe patterns can be formed by rays directly passing through the capillary tube or reflected one time or two times by the walls of the capillary tube then transmitted again. The fringe patterns formed by transmission light lie before the capillary tube and can be bell-shaped, steep bell-shaped, or almost parallel, which strongly depend on the position of the capillary tube. The bell shaped pattern can be qualitatively explained by the addition of diffraction of multi-slits and is relative to the aberration of the cylindrical lens. This pattern is also relative to the refractive index of liquid containing in the capillary tube. The fringe patterns caused by reflected light lie before or after the capillary tube, which will influence the contrast of the bell shaped fringe pattern formed by transmitted light.

35148820688	Combining color, texture and region with objects of user's interest for content-based image retrieval	Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems normally return the retrieval results according to the similarity between features extracted from the query image and candidate images. In certain circumstance, however, users concern more about objects of their interest and only wish to retrieve images containing relevant objects, while ignoring irrelevant image areas (such as the background). Previous work on retrieval of objects of user's interest (OUI) normally requires complicated segmentation of the object from the background. In this paper, we propose a method that utilize color, texture and shape features of a user specified window containing the OUI to retrieve relevant images, whereas complicated image segmentation is avoided. We use color moments and subband statistics of wavelet decomposition as color and texture features respectively. The similarity is first calculated using these features. Then shape features, generated by mathematical morphology operators, are further employed to produce the final retrieval results. We use a wide range of color images for the experiments and evaluate the performance of the proposed method in different color spaces, including RGB, HSV, YCbCr. Although simple, the method has produced promising results. © 2007 IEEE.

35148827763	New texture features based on wavelet transform coinciding with human visual perception	Wavelet decomposition is widely used in texture image retrieval and classification. Subbands statistics are normally used as feature vectors during feature selection phase. However, most previous methods seldom make further analysis of the transforms' subbands according to human visual perception. Based on wavelet decomposition, this paper proposes three new texture features which coincide with human visual perception. These features include directionality, contrast and coarseness in wavelet domain. We test our new texture features using the Brodatz texture database, and the experimental results indicate that the new texture features are consistent with human visual perception well. © 2007 IEEE.

35148844738	Image fusion based on wavelet transform	Image fusion is the process of combing multiple images of the same scene into a single fused image with the aim of preserving the full content information and retaining the important features from each of the original images. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to measure every wavelet decomposition coefficient's saliency of the original images. The saliency value reflects the visually meaningful content of the wavelet decomposition coefficients and is consistent with human visual perception. The novel scheme aims to preserve the full content value and retain the visually meaningful information with human visual perception more exactly than the traditional method. In addition, the proposed novel method can be combined with any sophisticated fusion rules and fusion operators that are based on wavelet decomposition. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, which can retain perceptually important image information. © 2007 IEEE.

35148866230	Reducing the dimensionality of feature vectors for texture image retrieval based on wavelet decomposition	Content-based texture image retrieval based on wavelet decomposition is one of the most active research areas. Subband statistics are normally used to construct feature vectors for calculating the similarity between the example and candidate images. However, most previous methods make no further analysis of the decomposed subbands or simply remove most detail coefficients. The retrieval algorithms commonly use many features without consideration of whether the features are effective for discriminating different classes. This may produce unnecessary computation burden and even decrease the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a method for selecting effective wavelet subbands based on new feature selection functions, which are derived from a modification of Fisher's discriminant. The method can discard those subbands that are redundant or may lead to wrong retrieval results. We test our method using samples from the VisTex texture database, and evaluate the retrieval performances using Daubechies and Gabor wavelet decomposition. The experimental results indicate that, compared with traditional approaches, our method can not only reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors but also improve retrieval performance. © 2007 IEEE.

By the method, we use line integral convolution (LIC) and topological flow methods to generate the first images from the source data. Then use the arrow method to generate arrow image. The next step is the images synthesized by all these images, and then the last step is to discuss the problems when the flow is time-varying and present solutions.

39749098576	A simple method for Chinese license plate recognition based on support vector machine	We present a simple method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Chinese license plate recognition. By firstly pre-processing the input images containing license plates, a set of normalized subimages can be obtained, each of which contains a number, an English letter or a Chinese character. We then transform these subimages into vectors by simply using pixel values. In this way, we can avoid the problem of excessive dependency on feature extraction during recognition. Next, scaling and cross-validation are performed to eliminate outliers and find the best parameters for the SVM model. We use real color images captured at a motorway toll in our experiments. Be compared with previous work based on neural network, the SVM-based method produces a higher correct recognition rate. Experimental results also show the superiority of the SVM-based method when only a small number of samples are available. © 2006 IEEE.

39749116191	A fast image rotation algorithm for optical character recognition of Chinese documents	Optical Character Recognition (OCR) normally requires the input image to be properly positioned. If the input image is skewed, it is necessary to adjust the orientation by image rotation. However, commonly used rotation algorithms require a large amount of floating point computation. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that can rotate an image by directly moving pixels according to the skewed angle and meanwhile avoid floating point computation. Experimental results based on Chinese documents show that the new algorithm improved the image rotation speed without affecting the correct recognition rate. The proposed algorithm has been applied in a reading robot to achieve real-time character recognition. © 2006 IEEE.

34247391975	Source rock maturity study by capillary tube interferometer	The mechanism of capillary tube interferometer is expected to be two-beam interference by ray tracing. A computer program to simulate the interference fringe pattern was established. By comparing the simulated fringe pattern and experimental fringe pattern, the refractive index of the liquid can be given when the two fringes coincide best. The results of this method are very near the Abbe refratometer. In the first time, the refractive indices of the low transparent extraction of source rocks were measured by capillary tube interferometer. A curve between the refractive indices of the diluted extraction of source rocks and corresponding vitrinite reflectance Ro was established. When Ro is in the range of 0.36-1.25, the refractive indices of the extraction increase with Ro, or the maturity of the source rocks. Good correlation was observed between the refractive indices and vitrinite reflectance Ro. The refractive index of the extraction of source rock is valuable for determining the degree of maturity of source rock. This technique is promising to measure the refractive indices of low transparent liquids and could be used to estimate the maturity of source rock.

34249997795	Self-similarity based editing of 3D surface textures using height and albedo maps	This paper presents an inexpensive method for self-similarity based editing of real-world 3D surface textures by using height and albedo maps. Unlike self-similarity based 2D texture editing approaches which only make changes to pixel color or intensity values, this technique also allows surface geometry and reflectance of the captured 3D surface textures to be edited and relit using illumination conditions and viewing angles that differ from those of the original. A single editing operation at a given location affects all similar areas and produces changes on all images of the sample rendered under different conditions. Since surface height and albedo maps can be used to describe seabed topography and geologic features, which play important roles in many oceanic processes, the proposed method can be effectively employed in applications regarding visualization and simulation of oceanic phenomena. © Science Press 2007.

First, we introduce the Simulated Annealing Algorithm to compensate the Genetic Algorithm's weak ability in search of local optimization. Secondly, we extend the method to be able to use the sets of 3D surface texture representations as input, and we relight these representations to generate visual textures under different illumination conditions. Experimental results show this approach can produce visually plausible textures without rhombic seams.

84897043341	Illumination-insensitive texture discrimination based on illumination compensation and enhancement	As the appearance of a 3D surface texture is strongly dependent on the illumination direction, 3D surface-texture classification methods need to employ multiple training images captured under a variety of illumination conditions for each class. Texture images under different illumination conditions and directions still present a challenge for texture-image retrieval and classification. This paper proposes an efficient method for illumination- insensitive texture discrimination based on illumination compensation and enhancement. Features extracted from an illumination-compensated or -enhanced texture are insensitive to illumination variation; this can improve the performance for texture classification. The proposed scheme learns the average illumination-effect matrix for image representation under changing illumination so as to compensate or enhance images and to eliminate the effect of different and uneven illuminations while retaining the intrinsic properties of the surfaces. The advantage of our method is that the assumption of a single-point light source is not required, so it circumvents and overcomes the limitations of the Lambertian model and is also suitable for outdoor settings. We use a wide range of textures in the PhoTex database in our experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

42549121149	Flow visualization based on 3D surface texture synthesis	This paper presents a novel approach for flow visualization based on 3D surface texture synthesis. Unlike previous work based on 2D still texture, the paper adds illumination information to the flow and generates realistic image results which can provide more flow information under different illumination directions and therefore make the flow field more obvious. First, a set of four 3D surface texture images captured under different illumination angles are rotated by certain angles to form several groups, and surface gradient together with albedo maps are extracted from all groups using Photometric Stereo. The surface gradient and albedo maps are then used for the synthesis along vector directions. Finally, the synthesized gradient and albedo maps containing vector field information are relit to generate flow visualization images under different illumination conditions. The synthesized visualization results show that the visual effect is dramatically different from traditional method based on 2D texture.

Unlike graph cut which supports iterative refinement for improvement of the patch seams, the improved graph cut method re-synthesis the max error overlap region using k-nearest neighbor method. This paper follows a simple 3D surface texture synthesis framework, which comprises three steps: capture, synthesis and relighting. Firstly, it represents 3D surface textures under varied illumination directions using gradient and albedo maps. Then, it uses the surface representation to synthesis a description of a larger surface. Finally, it renders the surface representation. It proposes an improved graph cut method for the synthesis step, and the proposed method can generate perceptually smooth images of 3D surface texture from small samples.

44349186124	Recovery of nonrigid structures from 2D observations	We present a new method for simultaneously determining three-dimensional (3D) motion and structure of a nonrigid object from its uncalibrated two-dimensional (2D) data with Gaussian or non-Gaussian distributions. A nonrigid motion can be treated as a combination of a rigid component and a nonrigid deformation. To reduce the high dimensionality of the deformable structure or shape, we estimate the probability distribution function (PDF) of the structure through random sampling, integrating an established probabilistic model. The fitting between the observations and the estimated 3D structure will be evaluated using the pooled variance estimator. The recovered structure is only available when the 2D feature points have been properly corresponded over two image frames. Applications of the proposed method to both synthetic and real image sequences are demonstrated with promising results. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.

An annular segmentation algorithm based on the distribution of salient regions is designed. It takes not only local image features into account, but also the spatial distribution information of the salient regions. Color moments and Gabor features around the salient regions in every annular region are computed as feature vectors used for indexing the image.

45149121369	Image capture and fusion of 3D surface texture using wavelet transform	Image fusion is a process, in which the multiple images of the scene are combined into a single fused image in order to preserve the full content of the scene and also retain the important features from each original image respectively. In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet transform based approach to achieve the image capture and fusion of 3D surface texture. There are two components in real-world surface textures - rough surface geometry properties and its reflectance properties. 3D surface textures are different from 2D textures as their appearing can vary dramatically with different illumination conditions. A novel wavelet transform based scheme is employed in this paper. Every saliency of wavelet decomposition coefficient is measured in each original input image. The saliency value visually reflects the meaningful contents of the wavelet decomposition coefficients, and it's consistent with human visual perception too. This novel scheme aims to preserve the full content values and retain the meaningful information with respect to human visualization and perception. In addition, the fusion of 3D surface texture composes both the albedo (e.g. color) and geometry properties (e.g. height or gradient map), therefore a new fusion image of the 3D surface texture under arbitrary illuminant direction can be generated. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only captures and fusions 3D surface texture under arbitrary illumination directions, but also has the ability to retain the surface geometry structures and preserve perceptual features in the image. © 2007 IEEE.

46449084442	A new image compression method based on primal sketch model	In this paper, we introduce the primal sketch model [1, 2, 3] which might lead to a new image compression method. The primal sketch model integrates two modeling schemes for two type components in natural images: the sketchable and the non-sketchable parts. The sketchable part explains the structural components of the image by using a hidden layer of image primitives [4, 1, 3]. The non-sketchable part denotes the remaining textural components without distinguishable elements by Markov random field models for texture images. The primitives in the image representation are not independent but organized as a sketch graph. The whole image can be coded by a sketch graph with a primitive dictionary and texture descriptors. Such a lossy coding scheme could achieve the compression ratio of 20 to 40 for natural images. With the similar visual effect, the coding length of JFEG2000 [5] is about 1.5 to 3 times higher. This promising compression method could be applied to some situations such as wireless transmission where the bandwidth is critical and low quality images are still acceptable. © 2007 IEEE.

These surface textures are different from 2D still texture as their images can therefore vary dramatically with illumination directions. Research into hole filling has long been focusing on 2D images, surfaces of 3D models or video clips to reconstruct missing information around the hole area. However, no reports are available regarding hole filling for rough or 3D surface textures. This paper presents a simple framework for filling holes on 3D surface texture. Firstly, we represent 3D surface texture under varied illumination directions using gradient and albedo maps as well as eigen base images. Then, the hole area is searched and an order map is established for filling the hole iteratively using patches from surface representation. Finally, the filling algorithm for the 3D surface representation is performed according to the order map to generate missing information in the hole area. Experiments show that the proposed approach can not only produce hole-filled images under arbitrary illumination directions, but also has the ability to repair the surface geometry. ©2007 IEEE.

49049120399	Approach to evaluation of degree of facial paralysis based on image processing and pattern recognition	Facial paralysis usually affects one side of the face, causing a drooping mouth, drooling, and excessive tearing from one eye. Nowadays a great number of people in the world are suffering from facial paralysis. The evaluation of the degree of paralysis is very important, as different degree requires different treatment methods, especially for those based on acupuncture. In recent years, many grading system for facial paralysis have been proposed. However, most of them are based on subjective decisions and therefore can be imprecise and unreliable. Based on face recognition technologies, this paper presents a facial grading system which can examine the condition of facial paralysis patients. We first capture facial images when patients perform actions instructed by doctors. Then the system automatically locates a set of facial feature points and uses these points to decide the degree of paralysis. A score which shows the degree is calculated based on the comparison of the distances between the two halves of the face. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed system can produce promising results.

This paper presents an efficient method for super-resolution on 3D surface texture. It focuses on synthesizing real-world surface textures with higher resolution and under varied illumination directions. To this extent, it first employs an Eigen-based method to represent 3D surface texture images under multiple illumination directions.

While many representation methods have been proposed, the relationships and conversion between different representations have been less well researched. These relationships are important, as they provide (a) an insight as to the different capabilities of the surface representations, and (b) a means by which they may be converted to common formats for computer graphic applications.

The framework explicitly reveals the relations between the three methods, and from this we propose a set of conversion methods. We use 26 rough surface textures illuminated from 36 directions for our experiments and perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments to evaluate the conversion methods. The quantitative assessment uses a normalized root-mean-squared error as metric to compare the original images and those produced by proposed representation methods. The qualitative assessment is based on psychophysical experiments and non-parametric statistics. The results from the two assessments are consistent and show that the original Eigen representation produces the best performance. The second best performances are achieved by the original PTM representation and the conversion between Polynomial Texture Maps (PTM) and eigen base images (Eigen), while the performances of other representations are not significantly different. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Photometric Stereo, as one of the effective technologies for capture of three-dimensional surface texture information, has attracted wide attention. Uniform illumination is the essential condition for the capture and reconstruction of three-dimensional surface texture using Photometric Stereo. In practice, non-uniform illumination leads to distorted surface heightmaps during the capture and reconstruction processes. This paper proposes a simple method to automatic correction of non-uniform illumination for 3D surface heightmap reconstruction and to eliminate this kind of distortion and aberration. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. ©2009 IEEE.

Then the skew images are corrected by using a skew detection and correction algorithm. In the following stage rectangular frames on the envelopes containing postcode are removed by using opening operators in mathematical morphology. Finally, a post-processing procedure is used to remove remaining thin lines. In this stage, connected components are labeled. We test 800 camera-captured envelope images in our experiments, including handwritten and machine-printed envelopes. For almost all of these images, the proposed approach can accurately separate the address block, stamp and postmark from the background. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

Finally, the predicting process is carried out in a pixel by pixel manner using the learned model. The model uses saturation in NTSC color space or filtered images by Gabor filter as the input features while the output class label is treated as 1 or 2 (enteromorpha or background), which is assigned to the location that is being predicted. In fact, this application is only a two-class pattern classification problem.

If we wish to synthesize a texture at a variety of zoom levels, an impractical high input resolution must be required. In this paper, we present a new method for synthesizing real-world 3D surface textures with different spatial scales. We only require as few as three low-resolution input images with near Lambertian reflectance. Then we can generate two surface gradient maps and an albedo map by Photometric Stereo to show 3D surface texture characteristics and accordingly to extend the 2D multiscale texture synthesis algorithm to the three-dimensional domain. Finally, we produce synthesized multiscale surface texture with varied illumination directions. © 2010 IEEE.

77952213797	Evaluation of facial paralysis degree based on regions	Facial paralysis commonly results in complete loss of voluntary movement on one side of human face. Before making treatment strategy doctors need to estimate the degree of paralysis. Previous work only used a few salient points to achieve the goal, whereas this paper proposes a new method to quantitatively estimate the paralysis degree based on comparison of multiple regions on human face. For each patient, we capture four images and each image stands for one movement . Since these movements change the surface areas of specific facial regions, we can obtain the facial paralysis degree by calculating these changes. Experiments show that our method is effective and convenient in practice. © 2010 IEEE.

77957939288	Deformable template combining alignable and non-alignable sketches	This paper proposes a hybrid model for deformable template which combines alignable and non-alignable sketches. These sketches are subject to slight or considerable translations in different images. For slight translations, Wu et al [13] proposed active basis model to capture them, where each sketch is allowed to shift in position and orientation. For larger translations of sketches, [13] assumed that they follow the same distribution as sketches of natural image ensembles, which need not be explicitly modeled. But in fact, for a specified object class, the unaligned sketches follow a totally different distribution from those of natural images. We summarize these sketches by their means in the foreground mask. We treat the mean value in each direction as independent features and fit their marginal distributions on object ensemble and natural image ensemble using Gaussian distribution. The marginal distributions are combined with Active Basis into a joint probability ratio to distinguish foreground object from natural background. Experiments are conducted on 14 object classes, most of which show considerable improvement in ROC. © 2008 IEEE.

77957966907	Texture synthesis by Support Vector Machines	We introduce a simple texture synthesis method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). Although SVM has been effectively used for various pattern recognition tasks, there is no report available on directly applying SVM for texture synthesis. The advantage of using SVM is that the sample can be simply modeled by a linear model and is not required during the synthesis stage. In addition, the method can be further extended to synthesize 3D surface texture or Bidirectional Texture Functions. Our experimental results show that the method can successfully model and synthesize semi or highly structured textures, which can be difficult subjects for previous texture synthesis methods based on parametric models. © 2008 IEEE.

78149475283	Illumination estimation of 3D surface texture based on active basis	This paper describes an approach to estimate illumination directions of 3D surface texture based on Active Basis. Instead of applying Gabor wavelet transform to extract texture features, we represent our texture features with a simple Haar feature to improve efficiency. The Active Basis model can be learned from training image patches by the shared pursuit algorithm. The base histogram can then be obtained based on each model. We measure the illumination directions by minimizing the Euclidean distance and the entropy difference of base histograms between the test image and the training sets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. © 2010 IEEE.

78649532381	Predicting flow velocity affected by seaweed resistance using SVM regression	Sea water exchange is an important source of nutrient salts. Culture living beings such as kelp in a sea-farming region will bring resistance to the exchange of water flows and therefore affect nutrient supplement. Study of hydrodynamic environment in marine culture zones is important for revealing water exchange conditions and guiding reasonable layout of mariculture regions. In recent years, statistical learning theories represented by Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been well developed. However, no publications are available regarding using SVM to predict marine environment elements related to hydrodynamic and combining these predicted elements with ocean models. In this paper, we use SVM regression to predict water flow velocity based on an improved hydrodynamic models with the resistance by cultivation breeding such as kelp. In particular, we use SVM regression to predict the velocity of following time points at a location with the coordinate in north-south and east-west directions. The experimental results are promising. © 2010 IEEE.

78650577449	Texture synthesis based on multiple seed-blocks and support vector machines	We introduce a new method for texture synthesis based on multiple seed-blocks and support vector machines (SVM). First the sample texture is used to train the SVM model with class labels assigned to gray levels. During the synthesis process, each time we generate one patch in the left-to-right order in the result texture. The size of each patch is smaller than that of the sample, and we search a seed-block in the already generated patches to ensure the synthesized patch has similar texture characteristics as the sample. Support vector machines are used to generate pixel values within each patch. The advantage of using SVM is that the sample is not required during the synthesis stage since it has been modeled by a linear model. Unlike previous work in [8], which can only synthesize highly structured texture, the proposed method can successfully synthesize both random and structured textures. It is also extended to synthesize 3D surface texture or Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). ©2010 IEEE.

78650886198	Augmenting photometric stereo with coaxial illumination	The authors propose a new photometric stereo (PS) method that augments a conventional four-light approach with coaxial illumination. The new method is based on a four-light, leave-one-out approach: the authors argue that coaxial lighting improves robustness to shadowing and specular highlights. The authors also specify a method to detect pixels that are shadowed or that do not conform to Lambert's law. The approach is tested on cylinders of various materials. The authors found that for dielectrics the method gave reliable results for gradients in the range -2 to 2. The results lead them to conclude that coaxial illumination makes PS more robust to shadow and specularity. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The Worley basis function of Cellular Texture is the most popular one and widely used to create various kinds of solid textures. However, most applications are implemented over 2D textures, which do not present varied illumination and viewpoint information. We present a method for creating surface height maps based on cellular textures and relighting them on 3D scenes. Furthermore, we implement our algorithm on GPU and show real-time relighting performance under arbitrary lighting directions. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

78651551109	Intergrating salient regions with new perceptual texture features based on wavelet transform for image retrieval	In content-based image retrieval, the representation of local properties in an image is one of the most active research issues. This paper introduces a salient region detector based on wavelet transform. The detector can extract the visually meaningful regions on an image and reflect local characteristics. An annular segmentation algorithm based on the distribution of salient regions is designed. It takes not only local image features into account, but also the spatial distribution information of the salient regions. Then, Color moments and the introduced visual perception texture features of the regions around the salient points were computed as a features vector used for indexing the image. We tested the proposed scheme using a wide range image samples from the Corel Image Library, the experimental results indicating that the method has produced promising results. © 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

78651564991	3D surface texture synthesis using wavelet coefficient fitting	Texture synthesis is widely used in virtual reality and computer games and has become one of the most active research areas. Research into texture synthesis is normally concerned with generation of 2D images of texture. However, real-world surface textures comprise rough surface geometry and various reflectance properties. These surface textures are different from 2D still texture as their images can therefore vary dramatically with illumination directions. This paper presents a simple framework for 3D surface texture synthesis. Firstly, we propose a novel 2D texture synthesis algorithm based on wavelet transform that can be efficiently extended to synthesis surface representations in multi-dimensional space. The proposed texture synthesis method can avoid joint seams during synthesis by first fitting wavelet coefficients in the overlap texture images, and then performing an inverse wavelet transform to generate new textures. Then, Photometric Stereo (PS) is used to generate surface gradient and albedo maps from three synthesized surface texture images. The surface gradient maps can be further integrated to produce a surface height map (surface profile). With the albedo and height or gradient maps, new images of a Lambertian surface under arbitrary illuminant directions can be generated. Experiments show that the proposed approach can not only produce 3D surface textures under arbitrary illumination directions, but also have the ability to retain the surface geometry structure. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79952643816	Contourlet features for 3D surface texture classification and fusion	Contoulet-based features have been paid much attention in image processing applications such as image enhancement, edge detection, image fusion and image retrieval. In this paper, we present a novel approach which takes advantage of the multi-scale and multi-directional properties of the Contourlet transform to extract features of real-world rough surface texture. These features are effectively used for 3D surface texture classification and fusion. The classification scheme based on these features achieves good results even for those test samples not included in the training data sets. Three-dimensional surface texture fusion based on Contourlet can successfully preserve original texture patterns and retain the significant features of input images, which can generate fusion images under arbitrary illumination directions. © 2011 SPIE.

79959564450	Capture and fusion of 3d surface texture	Image fusion is a process that multiple images of a scene are combined to form a single image. The aim of image fusion is to preserve the full content and retain important features of each original image. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on wavelet transform to capture and fusion of real-world rough surface textures, which are commonly used in multimedia applications and referred to as3D surface texture. These textures are different from 2D textures as their appearances can vary dramatically with different illumination conditions due to complex surface geometry and reflectance properties. In our approach, we first extract gradient/height and albedo maps from sample 3D surface texture images as their representation. Then we measure saliency of wavelet coefficients of these 3D surface texture representations. The saliency values reflect the meaningful content of the wavelet coefficients and are consistent with human visual perception. Finally we fuse the gradient/height and albedo maps based on the measured saliency values. This novel scheme aims to preserve the original texture patterns together with geometry and reflectance characteristics from input images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only capture and fuse 3D surface texture under arbitrary illumination directions, but also has the ability to retain the surface geometry properties and preserve perceptual features in the original images. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

80052841364	A system for detecting sea oil leak based on video surveillance	In this paper, we introduce an oil leak detection system based on video surveillance built on a petroleum platform or an island in the sea. Video surveillance can offer real-time monitoring by means of data acquisition, storage, transmission and monitoring. The video images are processed in data supervisory centre, and the system will sound alarm as soon as abnormal video images are found. In the period of image processing, dilation and erosion theories are used to detect oil spills. The system will greatly improve the efficiency of oil leak surveillance, and provide strong technical support for energy reduction and emergency management. Experiment results show that the new system play a high-performance on detecting oil leak compared with the previous methods. © 2011 IEEE.

80053309635	Seamless montage of natural texture	Seamless montage for texturing 3D models is very important in 3D video games and computer animations. The goal is to generate an arbitrarily large texture from a small sample image while both the sample texture and the result texture must be perceived by human observers to be the same and there is no obvious seam. This is slightly different from texture synthesis whose main principle is that the result texture must be non-periodical. Since there exist substantial periodical textures in real world, this paper presents a method for seamless montage without seams to form periodical textures. First we apply a quilting algorithm together with Wang Tiles to design the tile for montage, and we make comparison between them in terms of practical maneuverability. Then we employ the tile designed through Wang Tiles for seamless montage to generate a large texture with an arbitrary size. We also consider the montage of 3D surface textures under various illumination directions. © 2011 IEEE.

84859236150	Photometric stereo applied to diffuse surfaces that violate Lambert's law	This paper investigates the use of photometric stereo (PS) with reflectance functions that are diffuse but not Lambertian. We show that, for the special case where light sources are arranged at 90° intervals around the optical axis, standard PS is not limited to Lambertian surfaces, and we define criteria for its use. A series of rough test surfaces are used as models for surface microstructure-we found that the Oren Nayar (ON) reflectance model accurately predicted the surfaces' reflectance functions. The ON model does not meet our theoretical criteria for using PS, but PS performs well in simulations if the microroughness is moderate (rms slope <0.3). When PS was applied to real surfaces, the estimated and actual slopes were highly correlated, but there were significant errors in the slope estimates for the rougher samples. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

84866844414	Illumination compensation and enhancement for face recognition	Face images of the same person under different illuminations represent a challenge for face recognition. Traditional methods based on the Lambertian model construct a face image invariant to illuminations by combining a number of the images of different illuminations linearly. A drawback with the Lambertian model is that a single-point light source placed at infinity is assumed. This paper proposes an efficient scheme for illumination compensation and enhancement of face images. Our illumination model is universal without requiring the assumption of a single-point light source, so it circumvents and overcomes the limitations of the Lambertian model. In practice, it is reasonable to assume that the variations in intensity and illumination directions cause the face images of the same person different. The proposed approach can learn the average representations of face images under changing illuminations so as to compensate or enhance the face images and to eliminate the effect of different and uneven illuminations while keeping the intrinsic properties of the face surface. Our experiments have provided promising results, demonstrating that the proposed methods are effective.

However, the prototype is seriously affected by shadows, ambient light, and noises. A solution to this problem is to train the prototype based on a facial database. In our algorithm, the facial shape and the albedo of a novel human face under unknown lighting conditions are reconstructed based on the trained prototype and singular value decomposition. Extensive experiments have proven that using our proposed trained prototype is more robust than other methods when a face is under shadow. © 2012 IEEE.

84871854240	Estimating the ocean surface drag coefficient based on the least squares method	The aquaculture of the marine organism affects the flow of the sea to a certain extent. Thus, it also affects the water exchange rate and reduces the supplementary of nutrition salt, which accordingly restricts the growth of marine organisms to some extent. Therefore, studying the seawater resistance produced by the marine organisms in the sea has a practical significance. However, the drag coefficient of the seawater resistance produced by the marine organisms is unknown. The least squares method is a mathematical optimization technique to minimize the square of the error and find the best function matching with a set of data. That is, using an easiest way to obtain the absolutely unknowable true value which makes the error sum of squares minimum. In this paper, we used the least squares method to fit the drag coefficient of the seawater resistance in the ocean model POM to estimate its true value, and then with the coefficient we can determine the exact value of the seawater resistance. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84878834214	A novel face-hallucination scheme based on singular value decomposition	In this paper, an efficient mapping model based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed for face hallucination. We can observe and prove that the main singular values of an image at one resolution have approximately linear relationships with their counterparts at other resolutions. This makes the estimation of the singular values of the corresponding high-resolution (HR) face images from a low-resolution (LR) face image more reliable. From the signal-processing point of view, this can effectively preserve and reconstruct the dominant information in the HR face images. Interpolating the other two matrices obtained from the SVD of the LR image does not change either the primary facial structure or the pattern of the face image. The corresponding two matrices for the HR face images can be constructed in a "coarse-to- fine" manner using global reconstruction. Our proposed method retains the holistic structure of face images, while the learned mapping matrices, which are represented as embedding coefficients of the individual mapping matrices learned from LR-HR training pairs, can be seen as holistic constraints in the reconstruction of HR images. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, experiments show that our proposed face-hallucination scheme is effective in terms of producing plausible HR images with both a holistic structure and high-frequency details. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The separation of variables method is very common for solving constant coefficient linear partial differential problems. The finite difference method has been the main method of numerical computation in early work. The direct method is to formulate the boundary integral equation and can be solved using a direct time integration procedure. There are also some transform methods such as Fourier, Laplaces and wavelet transforms etc. to solve the wave equations. The retarded potential technique to solve the wave problems numerically was first used in the early 1960s. Since then, many authors have worked on the method and its applications. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84892528250	Facial-feature detection and localization based on a hierarchical scheme	An efficient hierarchical scheme, which is robust to illumination and pose variations in face images, is proposed for accurate facial-feature detection and localization. In our algorithm, having detected a face region using a face detector, a wavelet-based saliency map - which can reflect the most visually meaningful regions - is computed on the detected face region. As the eye region always has the most variations in a face image, the coarse eye region can be reliably located based on the saliency map, and verified by means of principal component analysis. This step in the proposed hierarchical scheme narrows down the search space, thereby reducing the computational cost in the further precise localization of the two eye positions based on a pose-adapted eye template. Moreover, among the facial features, the eyes play the most important role, and their positions can be used as an approximate geometric reference to localize the other facial features. Therefore, localization of the nose and mouth can be determined by using the saliency values in the saliency map and the detected eye positions as geometric references. Our proposed algorithm is non-iterative and computationally simple. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve a superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84894902674	FSAM: A fast self-adaptive method for correcting non-uniform illumination for 3D reconstruction	Since three-dimensional surface texture can display texture information of an object better than its two-dimensional counterpart and can vary with scene illumination and the view angles, it is widely used in virtual reality, computer games and animation applications. Photometric Stereo, as one of the most effective technologies for capturing three-dimensional surface information, has attracted wide attention both from academic researchers and industrial fields. Uniform illumination is the essential condition for capturing and reconstructing surface heightmaps. In practice, non-uniform illumination leads to distorted surface heightmaps, such as distortion and aberration during the capture and reconstruction processes. This paper proposes and assesses a fast and self-adaptive method based on inverse-square law to correct non-uniform illumination for reconstruction of 3D surface heightmaps, and to eliminate the distortions. In order to objectively assess the performance of the illumination correction algorithm, average absolute gradient (AAG) is proposed to compare the surface heightmaps reconstructed using corrected illumination with those reconstructed without illumination correction. Experimental results show that the method is efficient and can produce convincing results. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84899862432	Why do rough surfaces appear glossy?	The majority of work on the perception of gloss has been performed using smooth surfaces (e.g., spheres). Previous studies that have employed more complex surfaces reported that increasing mesoscale roughness increases perceived gloss [Psychol. Sci. 19, 196 (2008), J. Vis. 10(9), 13 (2010), Curr. Biol. 22, 1909 (2012)]. We show that the use of realistic rendering conditions is important and that, in contrast to [Psychol. Sci. 19, 196 (2008), J. Vis. 10(9), 13 (2010)], after a certain point increasing roughness further actually reduces glossiness. We investigate five image statistics of estimated highlights and show that for our stimuli, one in particular, which we term "percentage of highlight area," is highly correlated with perceived gloss. We investigate a simple model that explains the unimodal, nonmonotonic relationship between mesoscale roughness and percentage highlight area. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84905671413	Hierarchical mesh deformation with shape preservation	It is very difficult to deform flexible objects in computer animation. This paper presents a novel approach to address this problem. A detail-sensitive and deformation-sensitive simplification is first conducted on the original mesh. The simplified mesh is then deformed, and this deformation is transferred to the original mesh to produce an initial result. Because of the discontinuity between some vertices, an as-rigid-as-possible optimization is employed to prevent the shape distortion and control the surface stiffness. Various experimental data demonstrate that our algorithm is intuitive, efficient, and effective in deforming large meshes. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This work investigated a derived model for evaluating surface roughness in accordance with human visual perception. This was accomplished with the help of extensive psychophysical experiments. Surface textures resembling natural materials were generated with different roughness. Subjects rated the surface textures on 5-point Likert scales based on visual perception of surface roughness. We trained a general model for mapping features of surface images to perceptual scales of roughness. It can be observed that the roughness obtained in this way is in good agreement with that perceived by human. Thus, given a material surface, roughness can be estimated accurately. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84907264581	Automatic recognition of facial movement for paralyzed face	Facial nerve paralysis is a common disease due to nerve damage. Most approaches for evaluating the degree of facial paralysis rely on a set of different facial movements as commanded by doctors. Therefore, automatic recognition of the patterns of facial movement is fundamental to the evaluation of the degree of facial paralysis. In this paper, a novel method named Active Shape Models plus Local Binary Patterns (ASMLBP) is presented for recognizing facial movement patterns. Firstly, the Active Shape Models (ASMs) are used in the method to locate facial key points. According to these points, the face is divided into eight local regions. Then the descriptors of these regions are extracted by using Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to recognize the patterns of facial movement. The proposed ASMLBP method is tested on both the collected facial paralysis database with 57 patients and another publicly available database named the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient for both paralyzed and normal faces.

84914815109	Visual texture perception with feature learning models and deep architectures	Texture is an important property of images, and a key component for human visual perception. In this work, based on several feature learning models and deep architectures, we study the visual texture perception problem, which is helpful for understanding both the impact of texture itself and the basic mechanisms of human visual systems. Through a series of psychophysical experiments, we find that 12 perceptual features are significant to describe the texture images with regard to the human perceptions. Hence, we represent each texture image with a 12-dimensional vector, corresponding to the values of the 12 perceptual features. To improve the learnablity of existing feature learning models, we propose a set of deep architectures to learn compact representations of the texture perceptual features. Extensive experiments on texture images classification demonstrate the effectiveness of both the feature learning models and the deep architectures. In particular, the advantage of deep architectures over existing feature learning models is shown.
