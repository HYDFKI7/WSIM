84930918284	Loess records	Loess is aeolian sediment, dominated by silt-sized particles, that is identifiable in the field as a distinct sedimentary body. It covers a significant portion of the land surface of the Earth and as such constitutes one of the most important archives of long-term dust deposition. Large tracts of loess cover Europe, Asia, South America, and North America, and smaller loess bodies are found covering parts of Africa, the Middle East, New Zealand, and Australia. Loess thickness, particle size, and carbonate content decrease downwind from sources, trends that are powerful tools for reconstructing paleowinds. Many loess sections consist of relatively thick deposits of mostly unaltered sediment with intercalated paleosols. Paleosols represent periods of landscape stability when loess deposition ceased or at least slowed significantly. Studies from several continents show that loess in most regions was deposited during glacial periods and paleosols formed during interglacial and interstadial periods.

84948469731	Synchronous turnover of flora, fauna, and climate at the Eocene-Oligocene Boundary in Asia	The Eocene-Oligocene Boundary (~34 million years ago) marks one of the largest extinctions of marine invertebrates in the world oceans and of mammalian fauna in Europe and Asia in the Cenozoic era.Ashift to a cooler climate across this boundary has been suggested as the cause of this extinction in the marine environment, but there is no manifold evidence for a synchronous turnover of flora, fauna and climate at the Eocene-Oligocene Boundary in a single terrestrial site in Asia to support this hypothesis. Here we report new data of magnetostratigraphy, pollen and climatic proxies in the Asian interior across the Eocene- Oligocene Boundary; our results show that climate change forced a turnover of flora and fauna, suggesting there was a change from large-size perissodactyl-dominant fauna in forests under a warm-temperate climate to small rodent/lagomorph-dominant fauna in forest-steppe in a dry-temperate climate across the Eocene- Oligocene Boundary. These data provide a new terrestrial record for this significant Cenozoic environmental event.

14944367008	Long-term fluvial archives in the Fen Wei Graben, central China, and their bearing on the tectonic history of the India-Asia collision system during the Quaternary	Staircases of large-scale river terraces are striking features of the landscape in the Fen Wei Graben, adjacent to the Qinling orogenic belts, central China. Field investigations indicate that all five river terraces are composed of a basal channel gravel and an overlying, thick loess-palaeosol succession. As Chinese loess stratigraphy has been well studied, it favours age determination of these terraces and their correlation with the marine oxygen isotope stages. Our research indicates that the ages of the five terraces are approximately 2.6, 1.2, 0.9, 0.65, and 0.15 Ma, respectively. The formation of these river terraces within the Fen Wei Graben has been attributed to NW-SE crustal extension, associated with left lateral displacement between the North and South China Blocks, in response to the northward movement of India towards Asia since Cenozoic time. Thus, the stepped terraces in the Fen Wei Graben reflects elements of the India-Asia collision systems, in which terraces define episodes of accelerated northward movement of India towards Asia during the Quaternary. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1542644766	Timing of the Tianshan Mountains uplift constrained by magnetostratigraphic analysis of molasse deposits	The Tianshan Mountains lie in the actively deforming part of the India-Asia collision zone. The thrust faulting and folding of the Neogene and Quaternary sediments, forming linear, roughly east-west anticlines at the northern and southern borders of the orogenic belts, indicate crustal shortening and thickening in late Cenozoic time. Detailed magnetostratigraphic studies of the molasse deposits of the folded Neogene and Quaternary strata in the northern edge of the Tianshan Mountains indicate that the onset of uplift occurred at ∼7 Ma. Deposition of the thick conglomerates between 7 and 2.58 Ma in the studied region was mainly in response to the tectonic uplift, while the accumulation of the early Pleistocene conglomerates (Xiyu Formation) was mostly controlled by both tectonics and climatic cooling. Our results indicate that the present high relief of the Tianshan Mountains is the result of two dominant phases of uplift occurring at about 7-2.58 Ma and the early Pleistocene. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

21344432362	Tectonic uplift in the northern Tibetan Plateau since 13.7 Ma ago inferred from molasse deposits along the Altyn Tagh Fault	In response to the collision of India with Asia, thick molasse deposits were shed off the high evolving edge of the northern Tibetan Plateau, providing great potential for understanding the relationships between mountain building, rock denudation, and sediment deposition. A precise knowledge of the initial accumulation of the molasse deposits is important for understanding uplift history along the northern margin of Tibet. Field investigations indicate that thick Neogene sediments in the piedmont depression zones of the Altun Mountains are strongly deformed in a fold and thrust system, indicating crustal shortening and thickening in the late Cenozoic. Detailed magnetostratigraphic studies of the molasse deposits along the Altyn Tagh Fault show that the accumulation of coarse conglomerate began ca. 13.7 Ma ago, the source material of the deposits changing at the same time. Together with the remarkable increase in the sedimentation rate after 13.7 Ma, we attribute the accumulation of the conglomerates to the tectonic uplift along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, a process that continued until at least 9 Ma ago. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

0000090919	Stepwise advance of the Mu Us Desert since late Pliocene : Evidence from a red clay-loess record	Analyses of paleomagnetic polarity reversals, magnetic susceptibility and grain size on the red clay-loess sequence, about 280 m thick, at Jingbian show that this sequence contains most of the stratigraphic units recorded in the standard red clay-loess sections of the Loess Plateau over the past 3.5 Ma. Using sand particle percentage > 63 μm%) of the eolian sequence as a proxy indicator of desert extent and aridity in the dust source regions, it is found that during the past 3.5 Ma, there are three important climatic events indicating the advance of the Mu Us Desert. The events occurred at about 2.6, 1.1 and 0.6 MaBP, respectively. The stepwise advance of the Mu Us Desert may be linked closely to increase in global ice volume and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the late Cenozoic.

0032462434	Deposits and soils of the past 130,000 years at the desert-loess transition in northern China	The desert-loess transitional zone in north-central China has long been thought sensitive to Quaternary climatic change. However, reconstruction of Quaternary climates in this area has been hindered by incompleteness of geological sections. Here we report the analytical results of two recently found sand-loess-soil sections. Both sections have thick eolian deposits from the last interglacial-glacial cycle and can be correlated with one another. Field observations, thermoluminescence dating, and other laboratory analyses show that the last interglacial period produced three paleosols and two intercalated loess layers. Loess from the last glacial period is interbedded with three sand horizons that represent desert extension. The expansion and contraction of desert in northern China may have been forced by the east Asia monsoon.

0032465725	Wind-blown origin of the Pliocene red clay formation in the central Loess Plateau, China	In order to determine the depositional processes of the Pliocene red clay formation deposited directly beneath the Plio-Pleistocene loess in the Chinese Loess Plateau, four red clay sections spanning over 400 km are studied. Grain size analysis of closely spaced samples in the sections shows that the particles of the red clay are very fine with the sand fraction (>63 μm) being negligible, and that all the curves indicating changes in different grain size parameters have a similar pattern. The grain size records in the upper part of the four sections are almost identical with the median grain size centered at 4-8 μm. The REE patterns of 28 samples from the Jiaxian red clay section are all characterized by LREE enrichments, relatively flat HREE and slight negative Eu anomaly, being similar to those of eolian loess and the average upper continental crust. These lines of evidence point to a wind-blown origin of the red clay deposits. Accumulation of the loess-soil sequences in the Chinese Loess Plateau during the past 2.6 Ma can be therefore regarded as the continuation of the Pliocene atmospheric dust deposition. Observations of spatial grain size changes in the Loess Plateau suggest that the eolian red clay might be transported mainly by the westerlies, differing significantly from the overlying loess that was transported essentially by the East-Asia winter monsoonal winds.

0032522174	Preliminary magnetostratigraphy of a thick eolian red clay-loess sequence at Lingtai, the Chinese Loess Plateau	Magnetic remanence and bulk susceptibility measurements are reported for a 305-m eolian loess-red clay sequence at Lingtai, the Chinese loess Plateau. Polarity zonation defined by about 680 remanence data yields a basal age of about 7.05 Ma for the section, which represents the oldest wind-blown dust deposited continuously in north-central China during the late Cenozoic. The resultant magnetostratigraphic scheme implies a nearly linear accumulation rate (about 2.98 cm/ka) of atmospheric dust on the Loess Plateau during the period of 7.05 to 2.58 Ma. Comparison of the bulk susceptibility record with the pedogenic characteristics of the red clay observed in the field suggests that magnetic susceptibility in the red clay is not as useful as in the loess-soil sequence to indicate summer monsoon variations.

0032533131	Thermoluminescence chronology of sand profiles in the Mu Us Desert, China	Thermoluminescence (TL) is used to calculate the ages of two sand-loess profiles in the marginal zone of the Mu Us Desert, China. Alternating units of dune sand and loess with palaeosols in the two profiles imply episodes of dune formation separated by periods of loess accumulation and pedogenesis. Our results indicate that there are three layers of dune sand intercalated in sediments of the last full glacial cycle, suggesting the occurrence of three arid episodes during this time. The first arid episode within this period occurred between <75 and ~55 ka, broadly corresponding to marine oxygen isotope Stage 4. The second arid episode, with a TL age around 48 ka, can he correlated with part of Stage 3. The latest arid episode occurred between <27 and ~10 ka, broadly coincident with Stage 2. These periods of dune activity in northern China are compared with records of aeolian influx from deep-sea cores and the Vostok ice core, and with continental dune activity in other regions.

24144475022	Stepwise expansion of desert environment across northern China in the past 3.5 Ma and implications for monsoon evolution	A systematic study of the last glacial cycle along three transects across the Chinese Loess Plateau shows that sand-sized particle content within loess decreases rapidly from north to south, and that markedly high sand particle contents in loess horizons occur only in the northern part of the Plateau. This suggests that variation in the sand-sized particle fraction within loess near the desert margin is closely linked to migration of the southern desert border in northern China where sand grains move mainly in saltation or modified saltation mode near the ground surface. As desert margin shift is essentially controlled by the amount of monsoon precipitation, the sand-sized particle content within loess near desert margin is regarded as a new and readily applied proxy for variations in the strength of the East-Asian summer monsoon. A continuous record of sand content in loess along the loess-desert transitional zone shows that the Mu Us Desert migrated southward at 2.6, 1.2, 0.7 and 0.2 Ma, suggesting a stepwise weakening of the East-Asian summer monsoon during the past 3.5 Ma. This evolutionary pattern is significantly different from that previously inferred from loess magnetic susceptibility records, a widely used monsoon proxy. Our results further suggest that changes in global ice volume may have been an essential factor in controlling Plio-Pleistocene monsoon evolution, and that the anticipated future melting of polar ice cover may lead to a northward migration of the monsoon rainfall belt in northern China. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33646345091	Optical dating of Holocene dune sands from the Hulun Buir Desert, northeastern China	Aeolian deposits from the Hulun Buir Desert of northeastern China are studied with optically stimulated luminescence dating methods to establish the chronology of dune building phases and climatic changes since the last deglaciation. Our results indicate that wet climate, marked by dune stabilization and soil development in the Hulun Buir Desert, commenced at ∼ 11 ka ago, and this early episode of dune stabilization lasted until ∼ 4.4 ka ago. This optimum climate between ∼ 11 and ∼ 4.4 ka ago is mostly the response to the strengthened monsoon circulation and increased precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere. The environment generally became arid after ∼ 4.4 ka ago, but the dry climate was interrupted by three phases of weak soil development occurring at ∼ 1.8-1.4, ∼ 1.2-1.0 and ∼ 0.84-0.5 ka ago, respectively. Such short events of dune stabilization were associated with the warm and humid climate in historical time. However, the present dune mobilization in the Hulun Buir Desert is mainly the result of poor land-use practices (land cultivation and overgrazing) since about 300 years ago. © 2006 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.

33646357764	Half-precessional cycles recorded in Chinese loess: response to low-latitude insolation forcing during the Last Interglaciation	Chinese loess offers favourable conditions for identifying evidence for high-resolution climatic changes. Previous studies have examined orbital scale climatic cycles and the other shorter time scale climatic oscillations, similar to the recorded glacial instability in deep-sea cores. In this study, we focus on examining the high-resolution palaeoclimatic records in the northwestern Loess Plateau, where the dust accumulation rate is high and the loess-soil sequences are highly sensitive to the shifting pattern of the East Asian monsoon system. Our results of magnetic susceptibility and particle size analysis from the northwestern Loess Plateau reveal well-defined half-precessional cycles during the last interglaciation, culminating at approximately 122,000, 111,000, 100,000, 88,000, and 79,000 yr. These variations are a direct response to the low-latitude forcing through its modulation on the East Asian summer monsoon. In this context, the East Asian summer monsoon has played an important role in conveying climatic signals from tropical Pacific to the middle latitude areas. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

34250638543	Late Cenozoic magnetochronology and paleoenvironmental changes in the northern foreland basin of the Tian Shan Mountains	The folded Neogene deposits in the northern foreland basin of the Tian Shan Mountains provide important information about tectonic history and environmental changes of northwestern China. On the basis of lithostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic evidence, we develop a new chronology for the previous studied Kuitun He section. Our palynological study on the late Miocene-Pliocene sediment of the Dushanzi section yields new information about vegetation and climate change during the period of 8.7-2.58 Ma. The results indicate that steppe taxa (Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae) were generally dominant in the studied areas between 8.7 and 2.58 Ma, implying that a dry climate has occurred in the inland basins of northwestern China at least since 8.7 Ma ago. Although the general climate pattern indicated by our palynological results displays to some extent of drought, a warm and humid phase occurred at 5.8-3.9 Ma ago. This climatic optimum is comparable with the other records from the Chinese Loess Plateau, central Japan, the Sub-Himalayan Zone, and the marine eustatic sea level rise, implying this seems to be, at least, a regional climatic optimum.

35548991549	Loess sedimentation in Tibet: provenance, processes, and link with Quaternary glaciations	Well-preserved loess deposits are found on the foothills of mountains along the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River in southern Tibet. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is used to determine loess ages by applying the single-aliquot regeneration technique. Geochemical, mineralogical, and granulometric measurements were carried out to allow a comparison between loess from Tibet and the Chinese Loess Plateau. Our results demonstrate that (i) the loess deposits have a basal age of 13-11 ka, suggesting they accumulated after the last deglaciation, (ii) loess in southern Tibet has a "glacial" origin, resulting from eolian sorting of glaciofluvial outwash deposits from braided river channels or alluvial fans by local near-surface winds, and (iii) the present loess in the interior of Tibet has accumulated since the last deglaciation when increased monsoonal circulation provided an increased vegetation cover that was sufficient for trapping eolian silt. The lack of full-glacial loess is either due to minimal vegetation cover or possibly due to the erosion of loess as glaciofluvial outwash during the beginning of each interglacial. Such processes would have been repeated during each glacial-interglacial cycle of the Quaternary. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Grain size analyses show that the advance-retreat changes of the deserts in northern China may be the most important factor controlling changes in the sand particle percentage of the loess-soil sequences during the last glacial-interglacial period. It is thus suggested to use the sand grain content of loess deposits as a proxy indicator of desert variations. Applying this indicator to the last glacial loess deposits in the northwestern part of the Loess Plateau reveals that there were many millennial-scale cycles of the desert environments.

0033566839	Pedostratigraphy and paleomagnetism of a ~7.0 Ma eolian loess-red clay sequence at Lingtai, Loess Plateau, north-central China and the implications for paleomonsoon evolution	A 305-m-thick loess-red clay sequence was discovered recently at Lingtai, which is located in the middle part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. It consists of a complete Pleistocene loess-soil sequence with a thickness of about 175 m and 130 m of Tertiary red clay deposits. The red clay sequence at Lingtai is the thickest one presently known in the Loess Plateau. Field observations show that the Lingtai red clay contains over 110 couplets of pedogenic B horizons and horizontal carbonate nodule horizons, and that it can be regarded as an extremely thick soil complex. Paleomagnetic studies of 680 samples suggest that the basal age of the Lingtai loess-red clay sequence is about 7.05 Ma. Grain size analysis of samples taken at 3.3 cm intervals indicates that the red clay has the same sedimentological characteristics as those observed in the loess, thus suggesting a wind-blown origin of the Tertiary red clay and continuous atmospheric dust deposition in the Loess Plateau during the last 7.05 Ma. The pedogenic characteristics of the paleosols within the Pleistocene loess and the B horizons in the red clay suggest that the East-Asia summer monsoon in the latest Miocene may have already been slightly stronger than that during the Holocene. This implies that at about 7.5 Ma BP, the Tibetan Plateau could have been uplifted to a critical height in maintaining the East-Asia summer monsoon system. Observations of the loess-red clay sequence also suggest that the long-term changes in the East-Asia summer monsoon strength have been nonlinear since the latest Miocene.

0033212770	580,000-year environmental reconstruction from aeolian deposits at the Mu Us Desert margin, China	A 76.7 m-thick section of aeolian sediment is exposed in the transition zone between the Mu Us Desert and the Loess Plateau of northern China. The aeolian sediments contain sand beds, loess layers, and palaeosols. The particle-size distribution data and the SEM examination of quartz grains suggest the sand beds are wind-blown origin. Palaeomagnetic measuring combined with thermoluminescence (TL) dating and pedostratigraphic correlation suggests the studied aeolian sequences were deposited within about 580 kyr. The sand layers appear to reflect the episodic extensions of Mu Us Desert during phases of active dune formation and intensified winter monsoon. Both the stratigraphy and the proxy climatic curves such as bulk magnetic susceptibility and grain size indicate that large amplitude second-order climatic oscillations occur during both glacial and interglacial periods. It is worth noting that nearly all the interglacial soils can be sub-divided by the intercalated sand or loess beds, this second-order climatic oscillations are on the order of 10,000 of years which may reflect the precession-scale variations of southeast summer monsoon driven by the orbital pacing of insolation in low latitudes.

0034062081	Origin of eolian sand mobilization during the past 2300 years in the Mu Us Desert, China	Eolian sand dunes and sand sheets are extensive in the semiarid regions of northern-central China. Previous studies indicated that these eolian sands mainly formed during historical times. However, the sand sources and their reworking processes have not been well studied, and even the reasons for their occurrence are still controversial. Field investigation and sedimentary evidence indicate that both the inner Mu Us Desert and its southern marginal region, both sources of modern eolian sand, are largely associated with reworking of sands of the last glaciation. Based on geological, documentary, and archaeological data, three phases of land cultivation during the past 2300 years, together with historical droughts, high wind energy, and the easily reworked sand sources, largely account for the occurrence of active sand dunes and sand sheets in the Mu Us Desert.

0034068280	Re-arrangement of atmospheric circulation at about 2.6 Ma over northern China: Evidence from grain size records of loess-palaeosol and red clay sequences	Recent studies have shown that the red clay sequence underlying the Quaternary loess of the Chinese Loess Plateau is wind-blown in origin. Continuous atmospheric dust deposition in the past 7.0 Ma has been documented. To address the wind system that transported the Tertiary red clay, two north-south transects were studied in the Chinese Loess Plateau. One of the transects was designed to study spatial changes in grain size of the last glacial-interglacial loess records, and the other to observe particle changes of the Tertiary red clay underlying the Quaternary loess. The loess transect consists of nine sections, and the red clay transect of four sections. Analyses of closely spaced samples show that there is a strong southward decrease in grain size of both loess and palaeosol horizons of the Late Pleistocene, which is consistent with the idea that the aeolian materials of the Quaternary in the Loess Plateau are transported by the northerly winter monsoonal winds. Grain size distribution of the red clay sequences, however, does not show such a change. From north to south along the red clay transect, the particle size distribution is almost identical in the four sections, suggesting that the winter monsoonal winds might have played a less important role in transporting the red clay material. It is suggested that the red clay may have been transported by the westerlies from the dust-source regions of northwestern China onto the Loess Plateau. A remarkable re-arrangement of atmospheric patterns at about 2.6 Ma, therefore, has been recorded by the red clay-loess shift. It is speculated that this re-arrangement of atmospheric patterns may have been caused by the onset of glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0033846468	Multiple origins and interpretations of the magnetic susceptibility signal in Chinese wind-blown sediments	In most Chinese loess-paleosol sequences, high magnetic susceptibility values are found in the soil horizons, with low values in the loess layers. The susceptibility signal has been widely used as a proxy climatic indicator. However, both the causes and mechanisms which control susceptibility still remain controversial. Our recent studies challenge some earlier interpretations of the magnetic susceptibility signal in Chinese wind-blown sediments. First, the prevailing hypothesis of pedogenic origin cannot totally account for the susceptibility variations in many sections. Second, in some cases, the principal carrier of the magnetization seems not to be the ultrafine pedogenic minerals, rather coarse lithogenic magnetic minerals derived from local sources can also contribute significantly to the susceptibility signal. Finally, not all the Chinese soils have higher susceptibility values than that of loess or sand layers, opposite relationships do exist. It is concluded that the source and causes of susceptibility may be different from site to site or even at different times at a given site. Any single hypothesis cannot completely account for the susceptibility variations in the Chinese Loess Plateau and its surrounding regions. Besides the previous explanations of carbonate leaching, pedogenic processes and organic decomposition, the contribution of source materials to magnetic susceptibility must also be taken into account.

33644940519	Holocene environmental changes in the central Inner Mongolia, based on single-aliquot-quartz optical dating and multi-proxy study of dune sands	Alternating units of dune sands and paleosols in the central Inner Mongolia imply multiple episodes of dune building and stabilization, in response to the waxing and waning of the East Asian monsoon. Such eolian deposits were dated by using the single-aliquot-quartz optical dating method. Combined with the multi-proxy study on the deposits, the past environmental changes during the Holocene have been reconstructed. Our results indicate that widespread eolian sand mobilization occurred in the studied region during the beginning of the early Holocene from 11.5 ka to ∼ 9 ka. The climate became warm and humid during the period between ∼ 9 ka and ∼ 5.6 ka (Holocene Optimum). After ∼ 5.6 ka, the region again became arid, as inferred from dune building. However, the environmental changes during the late Holocene have been affected by both climate and human impacts, and the presence of desert environment in such semiarid region is not only the result of climatic drought of the late Holocene, but also related to poor land-use practices. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

0034581929	Stratigraphic evidence for the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau between ~1.1 and ~0.9 myr Ago	Uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is manifest not only in widespread denudation, but also by an increased deposition rate of sediment, near or far from the exhumed regions. Our results indicate that the mass accumulation rate (MAR) of eolian dust increased between ~1.1 and ~0.9 myr ago. We associate this increase in MAR and median grain size with uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and its adjacent regions during this period. This Middle Pleistocene uplift can also be evidenced by the age of volcanism in the marginal region, the existence of thick conglomerate deposits surrounding the uplifted plateau, and the increased sedimentation rate of lacustrine deposits in the Qaidam Basin (northeastern Tibetan Plateau) between ~1.1 and ~0.9 myr ago. The correlation between the loess and marine records indicates that after Ο0.9 myr ago, these two records correlate well. This good correlation probably suggest that the Middle Pleistocene upheaval event not only brought the plateau into the cryosphere, but also enhanced the coupling of regional-scale Chinese loess transportation and deposition to the global ice volume variations through its effects on glacial grinding, rock denudation, and east Asian monsoonal circulation. © 2000 University of Washington.

In nearly fifteen hours, approximately 38.3 g/m<sup>2</sup> of dust fell on Beijing. This dust storm was of strong intensity, long duration, and with a wide coverage; it not only affected southern Mongolia and the central and southeastern China, but also the North Pacific Ocean. The source areas of the dust storm were from the Gobi areas of southern Mongolia and the Gobi and desert areas of Inner Mongolia, China.

Our results indicate that dust storms in China are highly associated with the frontal systems and the Mongolian cyclonic depression. The spatial distribution of dust storms indicates that there are two dominant source regions of eolian dust raised from China and its surrounding regions. The major source is the gobi deserts in Mongolia and northern China. Another source region is the Taklimakan Desert in western China. However, dust entrained from the two sources makes different contributions to downwind deposition regions. In most cases, dust materials entrained from the gobi deserts of Mongolia and China can only be entrained to an elevation of < 3000 m. They are the dominant source materials of the eolian sediments in the Loess Plateau, southeastern China, offshore regions, and the near North Pacific Ocean. Dust materials from the Taklimakan Desert can be entrained to an elevation of >5000 m and then transported over long distances (∼ 5000 km) by the westerlies. These materials are not the main sources of the dust deposited in the proximal region, such as the Chinese Loess Plateau, but they are important sources of the eolian fraction of pelagic sediment in the remote North Pacific Ocean.

43849105904	Evidence for enhanced aridity in the Tarim Basin of China since 5.3 Ma	Thick Cenozoic deposits formed from the erosion of the northern evolving edge of the Tibetan Plateau provide opportunities to study the exhumation history and climatic changes within the region. Such deposits are important because they are located in an actively deforming mountain belt as well as in a rain shadow of the Tibetan Plateau. Multi-proxy studies indicate that hyperarid climate has prevailed since 5.3 Ma ago within the basin. This information, together with the geometry analysis of syntectonic deposits of the Sanju Anticline, which indicate tectonic deformation at 5.3 Ma, enable us to better understand the interlay between climatic changes and tectonic uplift. Our results suggest that the tectonic uplift of the Kunlun Mountains at 5.3 Ma must have been one of the significant regional tectonic events, and the uplifted elevation of the Kunlun Mountains more effectively blocks the penetration of moisture from the Indian monsoon into the Tarim Basin and thus enhances the rain shadow effect. This can account for the increasing aridity as well as the formation of the world's second largest active sand desert (the Taklimakan Desert) in the Tarim Basin initiated at 5.3 Ma ago. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Results reflect that climate in Loess Plateau oscillates on millennial time scales during the last glacial period. These can be teleconnected with the records of Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles and Heinrich events in high latitudes. Results also demonstrate that variations in the intensity of wind regime on the Loess Plateau have a close correlation with the changes of global ice sheets volume. All these suggest that two-level forcings may drive climate changes in central Asia. The first level is the volume changes of ice sheets and the second level with short time scales is superimposed upon the first level on a nearly global scale.

Our results indicate that a remarkable warm climate occurred at ca. 18-15 Ma ago, corresponding to the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, while a change to an arid climate occurred at 6 Ma, marked by an increase in the drought-tolerant herb taxa Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae. This latter change was coincident with the late Cenozoic climatic deterioration recorded at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. These inferred climatic events are further supported by the results of principal component analysis of the pollen data, such records are important archives in reconstructing the paleoclimate of the Asian interior. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

57449097386	Syntectonic growth strata and implications for late Cenozoic tectonic uplift in the northern Tian Shan, China	Propagation of faults and folds in the foreland basins of Tian Shan is an important process accommodating Cenozoic crustal shortening and mountain building, but little is known about the accurate time of the Cenozoic tectonic deformation. Based on growth strata and age determination, we show that syntectonic growth strata began to develop in the middle part of Tian Shan since 6 Ma ago. Geometry analysis indicates that formation of the growth strata is associated with progressive fold-limb rotation. Formation of the growth strata is contemporaneous with the tectonic deformation in the thrusting and folding zones. Together with the remarkable increase of sedimentation rate as well as the accumulation of coarse molasse deposits, we conclude that the late Cenozoic crustal shortening and mountain building in the region initiated since about 6 Ma and lasted to the early Pleistocene, as a consequence of intracontinental deformation within the India-Eurasia convergent system. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

69649097845	New evidence on the age of the Taklimakan Desert	The Taklimakan Desert is the world's second-largest shifting sand desert, located in the rain shadow of the Tibetan Plateau. The initiation of desert formation in the Asian interior is one of the most prominent climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere during the Cenozoic Era. Dating the earliest formation of this desert is important for understanding the climatic effects of the uplifted Tibetan Plateau. Here we report 1071-m-thick Neogene deposits with inter calated eolian dune sands from the only outcrop in the central Taklimakan Desert. Based on paleomagnetic measurements, biostratigraphic age control, and previous electron spin resonance dating results, the oldest in situ eolian dune sands were confirmed to be ca. 7 Ma, much older than the previous reported wind-blown siltstone from the southern edge of the Taklimakan Desert. This new result indicates that desert conditions initiated ca. 7 Ma in the center of the Tarim Basin. We attribute this event to the late Cenozoic climatic deterioration and/or to the rain-shadow effect caused by late Miocene uplift of the northern Tibetan margin. © 2009 The Geological Society of America.

70450184851	Magnetostratigraphic data on Neogene growth folding in the foreland basin of the southern Tianshan Mountains	The Tianshan Range is one of the longest and highest mountain belts in Central Asia, stretching east-west for ∼2500 km. Uplift of this late Paleozoic orogenic belt resulted from intracontinental deformation caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates during the Cenozoic era. To constrain the timing of Cenozoic tectonic deformation of the Tianshan Range, we analyzed the magnetostratigraphy of 3780-m-thick Neogene deposits from the Kuqa foreland basin of southern Tianshan. The geometry measurements and magnetic fabric data show that syntectonic growth strata began to accumulate at ∼6.5 Ma ago, indicating that crustal shortening initiated in the latest Miocene. The increase in sedimentation rate and an abrupt change of the magnetic fabric parameters also occurred at 6.5 Ma, accompanied by onset of syntectonic growth strata. The latest Miocene crustal shortening is a significant tectonic event in the foreland basin of the southern Tianshan Range in response to the India-Eurasia collision. © 2009 Geological Society of America.

0035043857	Geochemistry of the pliocene red clay formation in the chinese loess plateau and implication for its origin, source provenance and paleochlimate change	Recent field observations and sedimentological studies suggest the eolian origin of the late Tertiary red clay formation underlying the Pleistocene loess-soil sequence in the Loess Plateau, thereby extending the wind-blown record from Ο2.6 Ma down to Ο7.0 Ma in north-central China. To address the source provenance of the red clay, major and trace element concentrations were analyzed on the samples from a north-south loess transect of the Loess Plateau and a red clay section at Jiaxian. Results show that there is a good agreement of both major and trace element compositions between the last glacial-interglacial loess-soil units and the Jiaxian red clay record. The REE distribution patterns of the loess-soil and red clay samples are remarkably similar in shape, with enriched LREE and fairly flat HREE profiles and clear negative Eu anomaly. The geochemical features of the red clay are also identical to those of upper continental crust. These chemical characteristics provide further evidence for eolian sedimentation of the red clay.

0035053836	Iron geochemistry of loess and red clay deposits in the Chinese Loess Plateau and implications for long-term Asian monsoon evolution in the last 7.0 Ma	Recently, some groups of authors have demonstrated that the Tertiary red clay deposits underlying the Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequence in the Chinese Loess Plateau are wind-blown in origin, thus extending the eolian record in the Plateau from 2.6 Ma back to about 7.0 Ma, and providing a good opportunity to reconstruct long-term monsoon changes. As magnetic susceptibility, the widely used paleomonsoon proxy of loess deposits, is problematic in reconstructing the monsoon history recorded in the red clay, the development of other proxies is urgently needed.

75149195763	Temporal variations in Pb isotopes and trace element concentrations within Chinese eolian deposits during the past 8 Ma: Implications for provenance change	The Pb isotopes and trace element compositions of the silicate fraction of airborne dust from the Chinese Loess Plateau were analyzed to infer provenance change during the past 8 Ma. The results indicate that the composition of eolian dust changed at 2.6 Ma, coincident with initiation of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet. The change in trace element composition at 2.6 Ma indicates that a larger component of the eolian dust was derived from felsic rocks after this time. Pb isotopic evidence demonstrates that the source material of Tertiary Red Clay differs to some extent from that of Quaternary eolian deposits. Although chemical weathering may result in compositional changes in eolian deposits, such a scenario is not supported by the present evidence. Given that glacial grinding and frost-weathering processes have been active in the peaks of high mountains during the Quaternary, eolian dust of this age contains a large proportion of material derived from areas of high topographic relief and relatively little material from low-lying cratonic regions. Such alpine processes played an important role in controlling the distinct changes in Pb isotopes and trance element concentrations recorded at around 2.6 Ma. © 2010.

77955942942	Late oligocene-miocene mid-latitude aridification and wind patterns in the Asian interior	The Asian interior has the largest mid-latitude arid zone in the Northern Hemisphere, and so has become increasingly attractive for studying the initiation and the past extent of aridification in this zone. Given the enormousness of the Asian interior, it remains unclear how old and extensive the eolian deposits might have been, and what wind regimes have been responsible for the formation of the mid-latitude arid zone. Here we report new eolian records of widespread Tertiary eolian deposits in a region far from the Chinese Loess Plateau, the giant Junggar inland basin of northwestern China. Our results demonstrate that the earliest eolian deposition initiated ca. 24 Ma. We interpret that the Tertiary eolian dust in the Junggar Basin was transported by westerly winds, possibly from areas in Kazakhstan; the dust differs from the airborne dust transported by winter monsoon winds from the deserts of Mongolia and northern China that accumulated on the Loess Plateau. These results further reveal that the climate pattern, similar to that of the present, has prevailed at least since the latest Oligocene in Central Asia. © 2010 Geological Society of America.

78650060576	The shrinking process of Siling Co in the past 12 ka: Based on OSL dating of past shorelines	The evolution of inland lakes in Tibet Plateau provides important information about past climatic change. The retreating processes of lake shorelines can be used to infer lake evolutions forced either by tectonic events or climatic change. Identification of the past shorelines is very important in the recognition of climate and tectonic events. In this paper, we focused on studying the lake of Suing Co, which is the second largest inland lake in Tibet Plateau. Our field investigations indicate that well-preserved shorelines can be found in the northeastern bank of this lake. By using single-aliquot regenerative-dose( SAR) protocol method, we yielded three ages for the past shorelines, which imply that stepwise retreating of the lake occurring at 12. 2 ka, 6. 3 ka and 2. 3 ka, respectively.

78650623873	Palynological evidence for Neogene environmental change in the foreland basin of the southern Tianshan range, northwestern China	In this paper, we report 3780-m-thick Neogene deposits accumulated in the Kuqa foreland basin of southern Tianshan range, providing great potential for studying both tectonics and paleoclimatic changes. Based on palynological evidence, we discuss the paleoenvironmental changes as well as the interplay between regional uplift and climatic change in the region studied. Our results indicate that the vegetation and climatic changes from 13.3 to 7. Ma were response to global climatic changes. After 7. Ma, the uplift of the southern Tianshan range partially affects vegetation and climatic changes. Both global cooling and the rainshadow effect of uplifted high mountains affect the enhanced arid climate initiated ca. 5.23. Ma ago. Such climatic changes are important archives in reconstructing paleoclimate of the Asian interior. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

0035874458	Coeval changes in grain size and sedimentation rate of eolian loess, the Chinese loess plateau	To determine the temporal-spatial relationship between strength of the winds transporting the Chinese loess and aridity conditions of the loess source area, six loess sections located respectively in the northern, middle, and southern Loess Plateau were studied. Grain size distributions were analyzed on loess-paleosol samples that are closely spaced in the sections. Time scales were established by tuning each of the grain size records to theoretical changes in the Earth's orbital parameters. Results obtained show that during the last two glacial cycles, particle size of the loess co-varies with apparent sedimentation rates, suggesting that variations in winter monsoon intensity and the aridity of the loess source area are tightly coupled. This proximal relationship is in striking contrast with the observation of distal eolian clays in North Pacific sediments. We propose that this phenomenon may result from the proximity of the Loess Plateau to the source area and from the significant control of the winter monsoon on the expansion-retreat changes of the deserts in the northern and northwestern China.

0036204881	Regional lithofacies and pedofacies variations along a north to south climatic gradient during the Last Glacial period in the central loess plateau, China	Five lateral sand-loess-palaeosol continua occur within the last glacial sediments of the central Loess Plateau of China along a 500km north to south climatic gradient. The continua shift southward or northward in concert with desert expansion or contraction, respectively. Lateral lithofacies (desert sand to loess) variations are evident at the north end of the gradient and follow Walther's Law of the correlation of facies. Lateral pedofacies (loess to palaeosol) variations are present near the south end of the gradient, where the climate was warmer and wetter. The lateral stratigraphic changes from sand to loess or loess to soil are driven by variations in the rate of sedimentation along a climatic gradient. Vertical stratigraphic profiles at the north end of the gradient reveal alternating sand and loess beds. In contrast, alternating loess and palaeosols occur within the same stratigraphic interval in the southern Loess Plateau, where dust accretion rates were lower. However, in high resolution studies of climate change vertical profiles of alternating loess and palaeosols (especially weak palaeosols) may not reflect regional or global climate change. Alternating loess and weak palaeosols may reflect local variations in the balance between the rates of dust accretion and pedogenesis. Local fluctuations in either of these rates could result in the presence of time equivalent loess and palaeosols at high resolutions. Thus, some of the high resolution loess-palaeosol alternations may reflect local climatic variation rather than global or hemispherical climate change. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

80051808050	Luminescence sensitivities of quartz grains from eolian deposits in northern China and their implications for provenance	The thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) sensitivities of quartz grains from deserts and loess-red clay sequences are used to trace eolian provenances in northern China. Our results indicate that the 110°C TL peak and OSL sensitivities of quartz grains show differences among Chinese deserts, which can be subdivided into four groups according to the spatial variations of luminescence sensitivities. Such differences are related mostly to the regional difference in rock types of mountains surrounding or adjacent to the deserts. We also examine the possible provenance changes between the Quaternary loess and the Tertiary eolian red clay, and the results indicate that the luminescence sensitivity of Tertiary red clay is higher than that of Quaternary loess (L1, L15, and L33), implying source materials of the eolian deposits changed relative to those of the Quaternary. © 2011 University of Washington.

Although the IRSL ages measured with the conventional method showed underestimation as a result of anomalous fading, the isochron results are broadly consistent with independent ages based on stratigraphic correlation in a glacial/interglacial scale over the last 250 ka. For samples older than 250 ka, the IRSL signals approached in field saturation and the isochron dating gave ambiguous results, suggesting an age limit for the method. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

82955239870	New age determination of the Cenozoic Lunpola basin, central Tibet	Knowing when the Tibetan Plateau reached its present elevation is important for understanding the uplift history of Tibet. Recently, Rowley & Currie (2006) suggested that central Tibet exceeded 4000 m from 35 Ma to the Pliocene using the oxygen-isotope composition of calcareous minerals in Lunpola basin sediments. However, they adopted a poor age assignment for the Dingqing Formation in the Lunpola basin based on previous microfossil studies. In this study, we present SIMS U-Pb zircon dates from a bentonite layer intercalated within the middle to lower Dingqing Formation. Twenty-six measurements yield a highly reliable U-Pb age of 23.5 ± 0.2 Ma (2σ, MSWD = 1.1), suggesting that the deposition age of the Dingqing Formation is late Oligocene to early Miocene, much older than the Miocene-Pliocene age used by Rowley & Currie (2006). This age robustly constrains the age of Cenozoic sedimentary strata in central Tibet, and hence provides an important basis for estimating the palaeoelevation in the high Tibet during the geological past. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.

84856353656	Multispectral remote sensing mapping for hydrocarbon seepage-induced lithologic anomalies in the Kuqa foreland basin, south Tian Shan	The mineralogy of oil and gas reservoirs can be altered through the effects of hydrocarbon seepage. Mapping this mineral alteration is thus a potential tool for hydrocarbon exploration. Hydrocarbons that escape from underground reservoirs can cause oxidation-reduction reactions in situ or along vertical migration pathways. They can also produce anomalies in surface sediments and soils. The surface changes can potentially be detected by various techniques, including geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing methods. In this study, satellite multi-spectral data combined with field spectrometry, geochemical and mineralogical information were evaluated for mapping areas of known hydrocarbon seepages from the Qiulitage thrust-and-fold belt in the Southern Tian Shan, northwest China. This study found that ASTER band ratios of 2/1 and 4/9 reveal mineral signatures related to alterations induced by hydrocarbon seepages such as bleached red bed and secondary carbonates, respectively in the Qiulitage thrust-and-fold belt. These overly known hydrocarbon seepages and thus provide a targeting tool for similar styles of hydrocarbon elsewhere. In addition, given that hydrocarbon seepages are also one of the non-negligible sources for emission of greenhouse gases, multispectral remote sensing system can thus potentially be used to map and monitor emission of greenhouse gas emissions from hydrocarbon accumulations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84862794719	The importance of solar insolation on the temperature variations for the past 110kyr on the Chinese Loess Plateau	The late Quaternary temperature history on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is little known due to the absence of suitable paleothermometers. Here, we present a quantitative temperature record for the last 110kyr from Lantian county, southern CLP, based on the distributions of bacterial tetraethers. Lantian loess temperature variations display significant correlation with the Northern Hemisphere insolation (35°N) as well as the cave monsoon records at the precession band. We attribute such correlation to both the latent heat release from the East Asian summer monsoon and the direct influence of Sun's sensible heat over the semi-arid landscape. The long term cooling during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and the modest temperature drop of ~5°C from 79 to 65ka are best explained by interactions among multiple climate forcings including insolation, atmospheric CO

Our results indicate a normal sedimentary magnetic fabric for almost of all samples, characterized by minimum susceptibility axes grouped in an almost vertical direction. Magnetic foliation and anisotropy degree show upwards decreasing trend due to decreasing post-depositional compaction. Magnetic lineations show no preferred directions and thus cannot indicate paleowind patterns. AMS parameters at Luochuan are controlled by particle size, pedogenesis, and sedimentary compaction. The high peaks of magnetic foliation and anisotropy degree of L2, L3, L6, L9, and L15 correspond to the coarse particle sizes of these loess beds, indicating the grain-size dependence of AMS. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The study region lies in the northwestern marginal zone of the east Asian summer monsoon and is sensitive to climate change. The dating results combined with environmental proxies indicate that the Holocene Climate Optimum period, took place from 8.5 to 5 ka ago and was marked by lake development. After ~5 ka ago, the region became arid, as inferred from lake regression and fluvial activity. Deposition of fluvial sediments lasted from ~5 ka to ~2 ka ago. At about 2 ka ago, incision of the Sala Us River was initiated into the underlying sediments, with a down-cutting rate of ~3-4 cm/yr. Since 2 ka ago, human activities also played an important role in causing environmental change in the region. © The Author(s) 2011.

0037054713	A short, reverse polarity interval within the Jaramillo subchron: Evidence from the Jingbian section, northern Chinese Loess Plateau	A high-resolution paleomagnetic and rock magnetic investigation supported by scanning electron microscopy observations, X-ray diffraction determinations, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analyses has been carried out on a loess-paleosol sequence from Jingbian (37.4°N, 108.8°E), at the northern extremity of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results indicate that the magnetic assemblage is dominated by pseudo-single-domain magnetite with associated maghemite and traces of a higher-coercivity phase, probably hematite. The Brunhes-Matuyama and upper Jaramillo transitions have been carefully documented and a record of a short reverse polarity interval (SRI), entirely within the Jaramillo normal polarity subchron, has been obtained. The duration of the SRI, recorded over a stratigraphic interval of 48 cm, is 10.1 kyr (29 kyr if the polarity transitions are included). These results seem to exclude that rock magnetic variations are adversely affecting the recording process and compel us to reconsider the Jaramillo subchron as characterized by a pair of normal polarity intervals interrupted by a short reverse polarity interval.

0037328014	Rock magnetic record of the last glacial-interglacial cycle from the Kurtak loess section, southern Siberia	Detailed rock magnetic investigations, grain size determination and X-ray diffraction were carried out on loess and buried soils of the last glacial-interglacial cycle from Kurtak, southern Siberia. The susceptibility and the sand fraction of > 63 μm fluctuate in parallel, suggesting that the higher susceptibility values in the loess horizons are mainly associated with the coarse size fraction. The frequency dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of the loess and buried soils is very low and uniform, indicating the absence of superparamagnetic grains and negligible pedogenically induced enhancement of magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic assemblage is dominated by multidomain-like magnetic grains. Maghemite and haematic are also present in the buried soils and loess horizons. Goethite may have been formed from gleying or water-logging processes under a cooler and more humid climate. The coarse magnetite grains, which contribute significantly to magnetic susceptibility, are probably carried by valley winds and derived from local sources. Thus, the coarser magnetite grains with higher susceptibility values in the loess horizons could mainly reflect stronger wind intensity during cold and semi-arid conditions, and the consequent ease with which dense magnetite particles can be transported. The lower susceptibility values in the buried soil horizons are mainly caused by weaker wind intensity during interglacial and interstadial periods, although post-depositional processes associated with gleying modifications are also partially responsible for the observations.

0036871369	Source regions and formation of the loess sediments on the high mountains regions of northwestern China	Loess on the high mountains of northwestern China is largely controlled by the topographic features, distributed mainly on the northern slopes of the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains as well as in the Ili Valley (between the northern and central Tianshan ranges). Loess distributed in different regions has different ages, with the oldest (early Pleistocene) loess occuring in the Ili Valley. Geochemical, mineralogical and granulometric analyses demonstrate that the loess in the three different regions has different provenance. The loess on the northern Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains is mainly derived from the Junggar and Taklimakan Deserts, respectively, whereas the loess in the Ili Valley is derived mainly from the Sary-Ishikotrau Desert located in the Republic of Kazakhstan. However, these deserts serve mostly as holding areas for the silts rather than original source regions. The production of the silt-sized particles is mainly associated with glacial abrasion and tectonic-induced rock denudation. Thus, the loess in the studied regions can be described as "mountainous" loess rather than simply "glacial" loess or "desert" loess. It is unlikely that the mechanisms of loess formation are the same in different regions, given their dependence on specific geomorphological conditions and associated processes. © 2002 University of Washington.

0037110561	Provenance of loess material and formation of loess deposits on the Chinese Loess Plateau	Results of a multiple, isotopic, chemical and mineralogical analysis of loess from the three northwestern inland basins (the Junggar Basin, the Tarim Basin and the Qaidam Basin) and the Loess Plateau region of China are summarized. They suggest a qualification of the conventional views that the three northwestern basins were the important source areas of the Loess Plateau and that the sand deserts were the primary single source of the Chinese loess. It is argued that the gobi (stony desert) in southern Mongolia and the adjoining gobi and sand deserts (the Badain Jaran Desert, Tengger Desert, Ulan Buh Desert, Hobq Desert and Mu Us Desert) in China, rather than the three inland basins, are the dominant source areas of the Loess Plateau. However, although these gobi and sand deserts are regarded as the main source regions, they serve as dust and silt holding areas rather than dominant producers. The mountain processes (including glacial grinding, frost weathering, salt weathering, tectonic processes, and some fluvial comminution) in the Gobi Altay Mts., Hangayn Mts. and the Qilian Mts. have played an important role in producing the vast amounts of loess-sized material for forming the Loess Plateau. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037172847	Optical dating of dune sands in the northeastern deserts of China	Optical dating has been used to obtain the ages of fossil-stabilized sand dunes from four sections in the northeastern deserts of China. Our results indicate that the optically stimulated luminescence ages of the four sections correlate well, even though the samples were collected from different deserts about 600 km apart. Our results also indicate that active dune formation in this region lasted from the Last Glacial Maximum to about 10 ka, and that the warm climate of the Holocene was interrupted by a cold/dry dune formation episode about 3.5-1.7 ka. The Holocene Optimum in this region is between 10 and 3.6 ka, and a later warm/humid dune stabilization phase lasted from at least 1.6 to 1.0 ka. The youngest age on the uppermost sand unit yielded an age of only 40 yr, supporting the previous argument that the existence of modern active eolian sands in the regions with a mean annual precipitation of up to 450 mm is not mainly due to drought, but to extensive land cultivation over historic time. From the luminescence properties of the quartz grains, it is hypothesized that the sands in most of the sections are probably derived from more than one source, with a minor source of quartz having a different thermal history before deposition. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037446452	Hydrologic and geologic factors that influenced spatial variations in loess deposition in China during the last interglacial-glacial cycle: Results from proxy climate and GCM analyses	Results from climate proxy and General Circulation Model (GCM) analyses suggest that variations in soil moisture and desert expansion are key hydrologic and geologic factors, respectively, influencing temporal and spatial variations in loess texture and distribution in the Loess Plateau of China. During the last glacial period a reduction in soil moisture led to dune destabilization and a southward expansion of the desert (the source of loess) toward the Loess Plateau. Changes in soil moisture in East Asia may have been influenced by the size and extent of the Fennoscandian ice sheet, and the atmospheric circulation pattern that it induced downstream. These results suggest that both regional factors (i.e. changes in soil moisture and the position of the desert margin) and hemispherical factors (i.e. changes in the size and extent of the Eurasian ice sheets) have influenced loess deposition on the Loess Plateau of China. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

84867189056	Molecular and Paleontological Evidence for a Post-Cretaceous Origin of Rodents	The timing of the origin and diversification of rodents remains controversial, due to conflicting results from molecular clocks and paleontological data. The fossil record tends to support an early Cenozoic origin of crown-group rodents. In contrast, most molecular studies place the origin and initial diversification of crown-Rodentia deep in the Cretaceous, although some molecular analyses have recovered estimated divergence times that are more compatible with the fossil record. Here we attempt to resolve this conflict by carrying out a molecular clock investigation based on a nine-gene sequence dataset and a novel set of seven fossil constraints, including two new rodent records (the earliest known representatives of Cardiocraniinae and Dipodinae). Our results indicate that rodents originated around 61.7-62.4 Ma, shortly after the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary, and diversified at the intraordinal level around 57.7-58.9 Ma. These estimates are broadly consistent with the paleontological record, but challenge previous molecular studies that place the origin and early diversification of rodents in the Cretaceous. This study demonstrates that, with reliable fossil constraints, the incompatibility between paleontological and molecular estimates of rodent divergence times can be eliminated using currently available tools and genetic markers. Similar conflicts between molecular and paleontological evidence bedevil attempts to establish the origination times of other placental groups. The example of the present study suggests that more reliable fossil calibration points may represent the key to resolving these controversies. © 2012 Wu et al.

Here we present new results from the southwestern margin of the Tarim Basin for discussing tectonic history in the northern Pamir Plateau as well as for providing precise dates of the final seawater retreat from the studied region. Our results indicate that early uplift of the northern edge of the Pamir Plateau occurred at about 55. Ma, but this uplift preceded the closure of the link between the Neotethys and the Tarim Basin. Five marine transgression and regression cycles occurred during the early Eocene, mostly in response to global eustatic sea level fluctuations, and the final seawater retreat from the southwest Tarim Basin occurred at about 47. Ma. Another uplift episode started 34. Ma, supported by the accumulation of coarse molasse deposits as well as our palynological evidence, suggesting that the convergence between the Pamir Plateau and the Tian Shan ranges accelerated since the beginning of the early Oligocene. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Due to strike of the ATF, stream channels are deflected and elongated by adding new sections along the fault line. After subsequent water erosion and fluvial refreshment, banks of these deflected streams are overlain by aeolian loess. Geomorphological features suggest that stream deflections along the fault were developed as a result of faulting activities and displacements were progressively accumulated from multiple faulting cycles. Each faulting cycle is composed of faulting event triggered elongation of channels, creation of stream banks or risers and subsequent aeolian loess deposition on the banks. A model is proposed to illustrate the relationship between fault movement and loess deposition, which is supported by OSL dating of the loess on the offset stream channels. Our results demonstrated that: (1) loess deposits along deflected streams can be used to trace fault slip history, given specific geomorphic assumptions discussed in the text; and (2) based on stream channel offsets and loess ages, the Holocene slip rate of the ATF is estimated to be 11 ± 2. mm/year along the Aksay segment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The OSL dating results indicate that the sandy deposits at the bottom of the section formed at ~11.8. ka ago, corresponding to low magnetic susceptibility and low fractions of fine particles (<63. μm). The variations of the two climate proxies suggest that the region was mainly influenced by arid climate. Above the bottom sand layer, there are loamy soils, which formed between ~6.2 and ~4.3. ka ago. The soils have relatively higher magnetic susceptibility and finer grain size than the bottom sands. The climate of this period was relatively warm and humid, dominated by enhanced summer monsoon. During the late Holocene (from ~4. ka to present), Hunshandake was dominated by semi-humid to arid climate, as indicated by the aeolian sand beds and interbedded weak sandy soils. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

0344603870	Changes in sand content of Loess deposits along a north-south transect of the Chinese Loess Plateau and the implications for desert variations	Geological records have shown that the deserts east of the Helan Mountains in northern China were covered by grass during the Holocene Optimum, whereas during marine oxygen isotope stages 2 and 4 distribution of the deserts was almost the same as at present. The wide advance-retreat cycles of the deserts may have exerted an important control on grain-size changes in the loess of the Loess Plateau by altering the distance between the source and the accumulation zone of the loess. This challenges the widely accepted model that winter monsoon winds were the sole factor responsible for spatial and temporal changes in loess texture. To observe spatial changes in sedimentological characteristics of loess during the last glacial-interglacial cycle, the texture of loess was measured along a north-south transect of the Loess Plateau. This transect consists of nine loess sections, starting at Yulin in the transitional region between the Loess Plateau and the Mu Us Desert and ending at Weinan in the southernmost part of the Loess Plateau. Southward changes in sand (>63 μm) content along the transect suggest that variations in desert extent have indeed played a significant role in loess grain-size distributions, particularly in the northern part of the Loess Plateau. It is proposed that sand content (>63 μm%) of loess in the loess-desert transitional zone may be used as a proxy indicator for proximity to the desert margin.

84896874863	Palynological evidence for the latest Oligocene-early Miocene paleoelevation estimate in the Lunpola Basin, central Tibet	Uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is ultimately driven by the Cenozoic collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates and their continued convergence. One approach for studying the Tibetan Plateau uplift is to verify the paleoelevation changes from collision to present day. This is important for understanding both the tectonics and the climatic effects. The new high resolution palynological record of the uppermost Oligocene to the lowest Miocene strata from the Lunpola Basin indicates that the vegetation types during the latest Oligocene-earliest Miocene were dominated by mixed coniferous-broadleaved forests being different from the modern steppe vegetation. By using the Coexistence Approach to the fossil pollen records, after calibration the effects of temperature difference and the lapse rate, a maximum paleoelevation of 3190. ±. 100. m asl was estimated in the Lunpola Basin in the latest Oligocene-earliest Miocene, being 1500 to 2000. m lower compared with the previous oxygen isotope paleoelevation in the same region. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84899859381	Vertical variations of luminescence sensitivity of quartz grains from loess/paleosol of Luochuan section in the central Chinese Loess Plateau since the last interglacial	The provenance of loess in Chinese Loess Plateau, including origin, transport pathways and source areas, has long been one of the most important questions. In this study, the vertical variations of the luminescence sensitivity of quartz grains from the central Chinese Loess Plateau were investigated by using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques. Our results indicate that the luminescence sensitivity of quartz grains of paleosols can be much higher than that of loess beds. In addition, the quartz grains from the loess-paleosol sequence exhibit a temporal trend in the strength of luminescence sensitivity, characterized by higher values in soils and lower values in loess beds. The OSL sensitivity of quartz grains of the loess-paleosol sequence also shows very similar trend to the magnetic susceptibility and particle size fluctuations, implying that the luminescence sensitivity might be climatic dependent. The possible factors affecting the variations of luminescence sensitivity were discussed including particle size, natural radioactivity, and the provenance of eolian deposits. We suggest that the temporal variations of luminescence sensitivity can be attributed to the retreat-advance of deserts, the different contributions of glacial origin quartz particles associated with mountain processes, and wind patterns during glacial/interglacial cycles. Therefore, the secular variations of luminescence sensitivity of quartz grains are ultimately influenced by past climatic change through its controlling on sediment provenance changes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84901025357	Chronology of relict lake deposits around the Suwalong paleolandslide in the upper Jinsha River, SE Tibetan Plateau: Implications to Holocene tectonic perturbations	The Suwalong paleolandslide is located in the Batang-Zhongza reach of the upper Jinsha River, at the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau where tectonic activity is very strong, and has formed a great deal of large paleolandslides or their relicts. The relict deposits that have been exposed around the Suwalong paleolandslide provide an opportunity to understand the formation process and potential origin of a former landslide-dammed lake in the active belt region. Two-level platforms of ancient dammed lake deposits were found on both the upstream and downstream sides of the relict landslide dam. The chronology of the landslide and its surrounding relict lake deposits were studied by using

84909974975	Case study based on earth system science theory -geomorphic, environmental, and climatic effects of the tectonic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau	If we think that the theory of “Continental Drift and Plate Tectonics” is the most representative geologic innovation of the 20th century, then, the international geological science is now undertaking a new reform, changing from a past sole science to interdisciplinary scientific research of “Global Change” and the “Earth System Science Theory”. Moreover, such kinds of multi-disciplinary integration not only involve geologic fields, but also integration with atmospheric science, oceanography, and biology, leading the “Earth System Science Theory” to a new stage. Actually, many significant geologic or climatic events on earth, especially the Cenozoic tectonic uplifts of the Tibetan Plateau, closely link to the interactions among lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. If we still take a conservative view to cope with the tectonic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and its environmental effects, it will be difficult to have new development in geology science.

0346911978	Oxygen isotope compositions of quartz grains (4 - 16 μm) from Chinese eolian deposits and their implications for provenance	Oxygen isotope compositions were measured in quartz grains extracted from a 7.0 Ma red clay-loess sequence at Lingtai and six late Pleistocene loess sediments (Malan loess). Results show that the changes in oxygen isotope compositions of Malan loess are basically controlled by the geochemical characteristics of the source materials, while the effect of weathering process after dust deposition could be minor. The oxygen isotope distribution of quartz grains from red clay at Lingtai is similar to that of the overlying loess-paleosol sequence, thus indicating that the red clay at Lingtai has the same eolian origin as the loess-paleosol deposits. Furthermore, the oscillations of the isotope compositions in 4-16 μm-sized quartz grains may reflect the changes, to some extent, of the climatic systems of the source region.
