15944373883	Simulation of heterogeneous structures and analysis of energy consumption in particle-fluid systems with pseudo-particle modeling	Heterogeneous structures of a particle-fluid system at constant fluid flow velocity and constant pressure drop are simulated by the so-called pseudo-particle modeling (PPM). The mass specific energy consumption Nst for suspending and transporting the solids is obtained by a weighted average method simultaneously. The stability criterion, Nst=min, proposed in the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is demonstrated numerically, which reflects the spatial and temporal compromise of the movement tendencies of the fluid and solid phases, and leads to the formation of heterogeneous structures. Further work shows that when the total mass specific energy consumption for the solids (NT) is variable, Nst/NT=min should be used as a more general expression of the original stability criterion. Analysis of simulation results also shows dilute-to-dense phase drag responsible for the difference between Nst and NT. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

17644383013	Characterizing particle clustering behavior by PDPA measurement for dilute gas-solid flow	Based on particle velocity and size information measured by phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA), an algorithm to calculate particle cluster properties for dilute gas-solid flow was developed. The aggregate properties investigated in this study including voidage inside particle clusters, occurrence frequency, time fraction and particle cluster velocity show heterogeneous distributions in both axial and radial directions, although different properties differ from core to annulus region of the fluidized bed in their sensitivities to the variation of operating parameters. Experimental analysis shows that particle cluster properties are closely related to local time-averaged voidage and turbulent fluctuation of particles. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

20444380056	From homogeneous dispersion to micelles - A molecular dynamics simulation on the compromise of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate in aqueous solution	The structural and functional diversity of surfactant systems has attracted simulation works in atomistic, coarse grain, and mesoscopic models (Bandyopadhyay, S.; et al. Langmuir 2000, 16, 942; Senapati, S.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 12906; Haiti, P. K.; et al. Langmuir 2002, 18, 1908; Srinivas, G.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 8153; Groot, R. D.; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1999, 110, 9739; Rekvig, L.; et al. Langmuir 2003, 19, 8195). However, atomistic models have suffered from their tremendous computational cost and are, so far, not able to simulate the structural behaviors in sufficient spatio-temporal scales (Shelley, J. C.; Shelley, M. Y. Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci. 2000, 5, 101). The other two approaches are not microscopic enough to describe the configurations of the surfactants that determine their behaviors (Shelley and Shelley). In this study, we propose to simplify atomistic models based on the observation that the compromise of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic effects (Li, J.; Kwauk, M. Chem. Eng. Sci. 2003, 58, 521-535) and molecular structures of surfactants are the dominant factors shaping their structures in the systems. With this simplification, we are able to simulate with moderate computing cost the whole process of micelle formation from an initially uniform dispersion of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in aqueous solution. The resulting micelle structures are different from those predicted by atomistic simulations that started with a predefined micelle configuration at the same surfactant concentrations. However, if we use their initial micelle configuration, micelle structures the same as theirs are obtained. Analyses show that our results are more realistic and that the results of the atomistic simulations suffer from artificial initial conditions. Therefore, our model may serve as a reasonable simplification of atomistic models in terms of the general structure of micelles. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

18844412142	Parallel implementation of macro-scale pseudo-particle simulation for particle-fluid systems	As a particle method, macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling (MaPPM) is an effective approach applied to micro-scale simulation of particle-fluid systems. In this paper, a parallel algorithm for macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling based on spatial decomposition (SD) is presented. The parallel implementation utilizes MPI as the programming environment. Due to movement of particles during simulation, the parallelization of MaPPM may suffer from load imbalance and attendant performance degradation. Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB) is adopted to partition the whole computational domain in a dynamic fashion to balance the workload in processors. The Shift scheme is modified to meet the communication requirement in the dynamic partition. The parallel approach was applied to simulation of bubble behavior in gas-solid fluidized beds with different system sizes to test its performance. The computations were conducted on cluster of workstations (COW). Experimental results show that the algorithm has a good scalability. With dynamic load balancing (DLB), the parallel efficiency can be improved by up to 8%. To sum up, it was a successful implementation for the parallelization of macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

22744443144	Multi-scale compromise and multi-level correlation in complex systems	Following a brief discussion on the importance of understanding complex systems and the effectiveness of multi-scale method in analysing complex systems in chemical engineering, this presentation characterizes the hierarchical structures in complex systems by clarifying the difference between levels and scales. That is, 'level' is defined as a domain higher than 'scale', which can be described more or less by an explicit model when studied from its upper level; while 'scale' is used to describe the structural organization within a level. Using these terms, three different kinds of multi-scale methods are discussed. The descriptive method lays a basis for the other two methods, but no correlation between the scales are considered. The correlative method can describe the correlation between neighbouring scales or levels, but has faced with closure problems within a level, which can be solved by incorporating the variational method that correlates different scales through stability conditions. The variational method is more relevant to complexity science and is discussed in more detail including its physical principle and prospects in solving engineering problems in industries. Stability is critical to the variational method, which is r ecognized to be subject to compromise between dominant mechanisms and relationship between different scales of phenomena in systems. This strategy, mechanism compromise and scale resolution, is elucidated by studying two-phase structure in gas-solid systems. Then, its extension to different kinds of complex systems is presented. Verification of the strategy is carried out by computer-aided experiments, and its application to industries is demonstrated by three industrial cases where the method was applied. It is indicated that the local compromise between different dominant mechanisms with respect to both time and space leads to the formation of mesoscale structure which conformed to a variational criterion defined by a minimum lumped parameter. The presentation will be concluded by discussions on the possibility of generalizing the variational multi-scale method and some prospects of the method. © 2005 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

0013097073	General approach for discrete simulation of complex systems	By applying a general algorithm to different particle models, i.e. molecular dynamic (MD) and macroscale pseudo-particle models (MaPPM), two physical phenomena of distinct nature and scale differences, i.e. the mutual diffusion of two gases and the instability on the interface between two fluids, are simulated successfully. It demonstrates the possibility that the general algorithms of good parallelism and software of modular architecture can be established for complex physical systems based on the particle methods (PMs), which will thereby develop into a mainstream approach as finite element (FE) and finite difference (FD) approaches.

0030169702	Structure heterogeneity, regime multiplicity and nonlinear behavior in particle-fluid systems	This paper is devoted to the understanding of the structure heterogeneity, regime multi-plicity and behavior nonlinearity of particle-fluid systems which give rise to predominant difficulties in their modeling and scale-up. Possible approaches are explored for dealing with these aspects of complexities. Two types of nonlinearity are recognized in particle-fluid systems -intrinsic, as related directly to particle-fluid interaction, and secondary, as related to particle geometric and system scale-up. It is indicated that multiple resolution with respect to energy, process, movement and structure may be a promising approach to coping with intrinsic nonlinearity, though understanding of secondary nonlinearity calls for more specific analysis of the effects of external factors on intrinsic nonlinearity.

A two-dimensional phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA) was used to measure the size, velocity and the time for crossing the measurement volume for individual particles. Signals from the PDPA system were processed to obtain the local instantaneous voidage and to visualize the dynamic process of cluster dissolution and reformation. The time series of particle size and velocity were also used to examine the sequence of particles passing through the PDPA measurement volume, in terms of the time difference of particle arrival at the laser measurement volume.

0032476191	Dissipative structure in concurrent-up gas-solid flow	The necessary condition for the formation and dissolution of the dissipative structure in particle-fluid two-phase flow has been investigated, revealing its origin in the compromise between the movement tendencies of the particles and the fluid. As soon as either the particles can dominate the fluid, or the fluid can dominate the particles, the dissipative structure either dissolves or a newly formed coexisting uniform structure appears. At this transition point, operating conditions and material properties alone become insufficient to ensure the steady state. Quantification of such a complicated structure calls for some mode of multiple resolution, for instance, it could be resolved with respect first to scale and then to amplitude and periodicity.

It not only greatly simplifies the formulation of the EMMS model but also makes the computation of the model converge more easily to its solution, and therefore greatly facilitates the application of the EMMS model. In addition, some confusion on extremum energy in fluid-particle two-phase flow is also clarified by recapitulating the EMMS model.

2442429353	Multi-scale methodology for complex systems	This paper reviews the development of the multi-scale methodology in complexity science, and elucidates the importance of understanding complex systems in chemical engineering by discussing the relevance between complex systems and a few challenging problems in this field. Multi-scale structure is considered to be the focus in studying complex systems, particularly, the following four critical issues: correlation between phenomena at different scales, compromise between different dominant mechanisms, coupling between spatial and temporal structural changes and critical phenomena occurring in complex systems. It is considered that complex systems can be formulated as a multi-objective variational problem. The multi-scale methodology is promising in coping with complex systems, which can be descriptive, correlative or variational. It will be reviewed in particular by analyzing the above four critical issues and by showing its 20-year development at IPE from a rough idea to modeling approaches, softwares and finally to industrial applications as well as its extension to a number of chemical and physical systems. The strategy of "from the particular to the general" in developing the variational multi-scale methodology is emphasized, and challenges for mathematicians and physicists are identified to show the necessity of transdisciplinary cooperations. The paper will be concluded by prospects and suggestions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

2442473054	Compromise between dominant polymerization mechanisms in preparation of polymer microspheres	A system consisting of uniform-sized styrene monomer droplets dispersed in an aqueous phase was employed to study the compromise between dominant polymerization mechanisms in the preparation of polymer microspheres. Monomer droplets were prepared by a microporous membrane emulsification technique, with negligible size distribution. Two polymerization mechanisms were identified-polymerization in micro-sized monomer droplets and nano-sized secondary nuclei, even in the presence of a hydrophobic initiator. Factors affecting the compromise between these two dominant mechanisms were investigated. Increasing the amount of hydrophobic additive (hexadecane) and/or adding water-soluble inhibitor in the aqueous phase suppressed the polymerization in the secondary nuclei, while adding a relatively hydrophilic monomer in the styrene feed and/or increasing the amount of the initiator and the size of the monomer droplets promoted the polymerization in the secondary nuclei. Under the condition where a hydrophilic monomer was added, hollow microspheres were formed when polymerization in the secondary nuclei was dominant, while one-hole microspheres resulted when polymerization occurred only inside the larger monomer droplets, indicating that the compromise between dominant mechanisms is critical to the polymerization process. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

25144502558	VOC adsorption in circulating gas fluidized bed	The purpose of the work is to show that CFB adsorption process is technically feasible to obtain an interesting pollution abatement, and to set the bases of a process design. Experimental results are presented, obtained with toluene being adsorbed from an air stream on polymeric adsorbent in a batch operation circulating fluidized bed. This results in a breakthrough behavior at the top of the riser, analogous to a fixed-bed experiment. The existence of breakthrough curves that are astonishingly sharp in spite of the strong mixing of the solid phase implies that efficient toluene abatement can be achieved. The breakthrough curves can be used to predict the behavior of the process in a continuous mode where the adsorbent would be partially regenerated, and which would lead to an less than total toluene abatement. The shape of the breakthrough curves clearly depends on the operating parameters, in particular the gas flow rate and the solids circulation rate. The EMMS model was adapted and implemented to describe the flow pattern of gas and solid. The model predicts the relative volume fractions of these phases, the volume fractions inside each, the superficial velocities of gas and solid in each phase, and the average cluster size. From this description, an estimation of the apparent gas/solid mass transfer coefficients may be done, and their dependence on operating conditions investigated. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

25844525417	Multi-scale mass transfer model for gas-solid two-phase flow	This article is devoted to analyzing the mass transfer in heterogeneous gas-solid flow by means of structure and process decomposition. A multi-scale mass transfer model was developed on the basis of the hydrodynamics calculated from the so-called EMMS model. This resulted in the predictions of the steady-state two-dimensional concentration distributions of sublimated substance as well as total mass transfer coefficient for circular concurrent gas-solid contactors. The predictions were validated by experimentally measured (via an on-line HP GC-MS system) axial concentration distributions of sublimated naphthalene in air in a circulating fluidized bed riser 3.0 m in height and 72 mm in diameter. The experiment also obtained mass transfer coefficients comparable to theoretical predictions under conditions with various gas velocities, solid circulation rates, particle sizes, and active material fractions in the particles. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that the heterogeneous flow structure prevailing in the concurrent gas-solid flow greatly influenced the flow's mass transfer.

In this paper, the shapes, structures and sizes of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) micelles under different concentrations in an oil/water mixture were studied via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a simplified atomistic model which basically maintains the hydrophile and lipophile properties of the surfactant molecules.

2942543199	Simulations of annulus-core structure in CFB	The stochastic particle-trajectory model is proposed for simulating the dynamic behavior of circulating fluidized bed (CFB). In our model, the motion of solid phase is obtained by calculating the individual particle trajectory while gas now is obtained by solving the Navier-Stokes equation including two-phase interaction. For the calculation of solid phase, the motion of each particle is decomposed into a collision process and a suspension process. In suspension process, the less important and/or unclear forces are described as a random force considering gravity, drag force and pressure gradient. As a result, the proposed model gives some numerical simulations of CFB. It indicates that the stochastic particle-trajectory model can be used to simulate qualitatively the annulus-core structure of CFB and the influences of stochastic factors cannot be ignored. In a CFB, the coupling of stochastic factors between two phases makes the radial voidage decreased. Moreover, the upward motion of particles is mitigated by both stochastic factors and turbulence between two phases.

3042819208	Multi-scale characteristics of chaos behavior in gas-liquid bubble columns	The multi-value phenomenon of correlation dimension appearing in chaos analysis of time series of pressure fluctuation obtained from gas-liquid bubble columns was studied. Its relationship with multi-scale flow behavior and possible application in the identification of flow regime and regime transition in bubble columns were investigated. The results indicated that the multi-value phenomenon of correlation dimension results from the multi-scale behavior existing in the heterogeneous churn flow regime in bubble columns. When a bubble column is in the homogeneous flow regime, only one correlation dimension is found at a specified superficial gas velocity, indicating that single-scale behavior is dominant in the system. When a bubble column is in the heterogeneous churn flow regime, multi- (generally three) correlation dimensions can be obtained, showing the appearance of multi-scale behavior. Therefore, the formulation of an effective flow model depends on an appropriate multi-scale analysis for bubble columns. Flow regime and regime transition can be characterized by the structure and structure variation of the plot of the correlation integral versus radius of the hyper-sphere. On the basis of the above analysis, a complementary potential methodology called correlation integral analysis for the identification of flow regime and regime transition in gas-liquid bubble columns is recommended. © Taylor and Francis Inc.

The influence of operating conditions on the structure of particle clusters in the dilute regime of circulating fluidized beds was investigated. Under the operating conditions in this study, both axial and radial distributions of the characteristics of particle clusters, such as time fraction, frequency, transient local voidage and axial average velocity, showed heterogeneous profiles. The radial profile was not affected greatly by solids circulation rate and showed a core-annulus structure. The axial profile changed much more significantly than the core-annulus structure when superficial gas velocity changed.

Particle methods (PMs) are ideal constitutors and powerful probes of multi-scale models, owing to their physical insight and computational simplicity. In this paper, the role of different PMs for multi-scale modeling of complex flows is critically reviewed and possible development of PMs in this background is prospected, with the emphasis on pseudo-particle modeling (PPM). The performances of some different PMs are compared in simulations and new development in the fundamentals and applications of PPM is also reported, demonstrating PPM as a unique PM for multi-scale modeling.

33748766387	High-resolution simulation of gas-solid suspension using macro-scale particle methods	Dynamic multi-scale structures in a gas-solid suspension with 1024 particles are investigated with direct numerical simulations using macro-scale particle methods. The suspension is found to be characterized by heterogeneity with clustering solids and bypassing gas. The solid particle velocity distribution is found to be anisotropic though nearly Maxwellian in each direction, which is in agreement with measurements in liquid-solid systems, supporting the necessity of incorporating anisotropy into the continuum descriptions of such flows. The drag force on the particles in the dilute phase can be far larger than that in the center of the dense phase, and much less than that on the phase interface, suggesting the insufficiency of correlating interphase friction to local averaged voidage only. However, statistics shows nearly Gaussian distribution of the drag forces, which is potentially favorable to establishing a diffusion model accounting for drag dispersion. The need for a multi-scale description of gas-solid flows, and on the other hand, the power of particle methods as exploring tools for this purpose, are demonstrated. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The variation of voidage inside particle clusters is strongly dependent upon the change of the number of particles within the clusters.

By discretizing the fluid phase into a large number of interactive simple particles, which can incorporate many-body moving boundaries easily, pseudo-particle modeling (PPM) has reproduced reasonable radial and axial heterogeneity on macro-scale as well as solids clustering and fluid flows on meso- and micro-scales. The simulation suggests a consistent evolution of the complexity across different scales with itself serving as an ideal exploring tool.

33751002039	Simulation of gas-solid two-phase flow by a multi-scale CFD approach-of the EMMS model to the sub-grid level	Gas-solid two-phase flow features temporal-spatial multi-scale structures. Calculation of characteristic scales for an air/FCC (fluid-catalytic-cracking particle) flow indicates that the lack of scale separation entails a structure-dependent modeling approach even on the sub-grid level. For solving this problem, the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is extended and coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) through calculation of a structure-dependent drag coefficient in each grid, for which the schemes EMMS/sub-grid and EMMS/matrix are presented. Numerical analysis of the extended EMMS model suggests that gas and particles tend to achieve a compromise of flow dominance by gas finding the way with less resistance and particles clustering. So the dilute-phase part of drag force can be neglected and the major flow resistance arises from inside the dense-phase aggregate and over the interface. The inertial difference between the dense phase and the interface results in breakup or formation of particle clusters. The integrated approach is further verified through numerical description of the choking point demarcating the flow regime transition between the dilute pneumatic transport and the all-dense flow. Simulation shows that usual practice with assignment of only gas velocity and solids flux is insufficient for determination of the dense bottom height in a riser, and this can be attributed to the absence of another independent variable, solids inventory or imposed pressure drop. This critical phenomenon has been identified by earlier experiments, but most simulation practitioners remain unaware of it. More verification of the model is performed through visualization of micro-scale dynamics, characterization of meso-scale clusters and quantification of macro-scale distribution of two-phase parameters. Good agreement with experimental evidence is quite encouraging even quantitatively. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The fluid flow is distributed within each computational cell from pressure balance considerations according to weighted local porosities, rather than by using traditional linear interpolations. The drag on each particle is then calculated with its local porosity and slip velocity, which shows significant difference to traditional methods.

Emphasis is paid to the correlation between different scales, which is one of the focuses in complexity science. The energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model for particle-fluid flow is revisited as an implementation of the analytical multi-scale method to elucidate its principles, in which the correlation between scales is established by analyzing the compromise between dominant mechanisms. This strategy has been extended to six other systems, covering single-phase flow, gas-liquid flow, granular flow and emulsions. A general framework of the method and the common feature of the compromise processes are then presented together with an introduction to some practical applications of the analytical multi-scale method and its extensions.

3442883455	Parallel algorithm of macro-scale pseudo-particle simulation for two-phase flow	The macro-scale pseudo-particle model (MaPPM) is an effective method used in high resolution simulation of particle-fluid systems, which can be implemented with an algorithm similar to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. However, the wide application of MaPPM is only possible with the advent of high-performance parallel computers. The great size gap between solid particle and pseudo-particle makes MaPPM different from MD simulations during the parallelization process, which is the specialty and difficulty in this paper. The domain decomposition method is used in the parallel algorithm because of the great number of pseudo-particles in particle-fluid systems. The algorithm is also improved according to the specialty in MaPPM to reduce computation cost. The computation is conducted on COW (cluster of workstations) with different system sizes and various numbers of processors to test its performance. Computation results indicate that the new algorithm has high parallel efficiency and good scalability. The parallel implementation will help to make use of MaPPM in large-scale simulations of two-phase flow.

34547941418	Multi-scale CFD simulation of gas-solid flow in MIP reactors with a structure-dependent drag model	The MIP (maximizing iso-paraffins) reactor, which was developed by SINOPEC to meet the challenge for clean fuels, consists of a series of reaction zones with different diameters, thus allowing coexistence of multiple flow regimes. This study is to probe the flow behavior in the MIP reactor through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, in which a new drag-coefficient relation based on the energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model was applied. A testing simulation of a lab-scale MIP reactor validates our approach first; further investigation of an industrial MIP reactor indicates that, the so-called "choking" phenomenon, which is characterized by an S-shaped profile of voidage and saturation carrying of particles, also exists in the MIP reactor. This choking phenomenon deserves our reemphasis, since most of the existent simulations take for granted that, a riser flow can be determined by specification of only gas and solids velocities, ignoring the effect of solids inventory. In practice, understanding of the "choking" may facilitate troubleshooting of MIP units, as the related flow and transition behaviors are critical to the reaction performance. In general, this simulation unfolds a fresh perspective of the EMMS-based multi-scale CFD approach. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

3543038779	Characteristics of pressure with respect to heterogeneous flow structure in fluidized beds	The characteristics of pressure in gas/solids fluidization is measured with respect to the heterogeneous structure typified as lateral core/annulus segregation and local two-phase coexistence. Experiments are carried out in two circulating fluidized bed risers with bed diameters of 0.09 m and 0.15 m, respectively. Particles FCC (Geldart A) and silica sand (Geldart B) are used in the experiment, and are fluidized by air. It is found that the dynamic changes of the particle-rich dense phase (clusters or emulsion) and the fluid-rich dilute phase (broth or bubbles), as well as the alternations between these two distinct phases, can create a serious imbalance of instantaneous pressures among different radial locations at a same bed height. However, only a subtle time-mean pressure difference can be detected between the bed wall and the bed center with the higher pressure residing on the bed wall. It is observed that this wall-to-axis pressure difference is less than 30 Pa in a typical fast fluidized bed, while it reaches at most about 150 Pa for usual bubbling fluidization. The intra-phase pressures in both the dense phase and the dilute phase are also demonstrated to be subject to a dynamic variation other than a particular relation.

36049023434	Explorations on the multi-scale flow structure and stability condition in bubble columns	Physical understanding of heterogeneous flow structure is of crucial importance for modelling and simulation of gas-liquid systems. This article presents a review and report of recent progress in our group on exploratory application of the variational (analytical) multi-scale approach to gas-liquid systems. The work features the closure of a hydrodynamic model with the incorporation of a stability condition reflecting the compromise between the dominant mechanisms in the system. A dual-bubble-size (DBS) model is proposed to approximate the heterogeneous structure of gas-liquid systems based on a single-bubble-size (SBS) model previously established. Reasonable variation of the gas holdup and the composition of the two bubble species with operating conditions have been calculated and the regime transition can therefore be reasonably predicted for air-water system, suggesting that stability condition may provide an insightful concept to explain the general tendencies in gas-liquid systems out of their hydrodynamic complexity, and to give simple models of their overall behaviors. Of course, the diversity of the correlations for drag force and minimum bubble size and the sensitivity of the model predictions to these correlations may suggest the necessity to clarify further the essential and robust results in the current model and to reduce the uncertainties involved. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0033165966	Particle-motion-resolved discrete model for simulating gas-solid fluidization	This paper presents numerical simulations of two-dimensional gas-solid fluidized beds by establishing the so-called particle-motion-resolved discrete model in which the motion of the solid phase is calculated by considering individual particle motions while gas flow is described by the Navier-Stokes equation. The particle-motion-resolved method is used to treat the interparticle interaction and particle/fluid interaction, resolving the overall movement of particles into the collision process accounting for the interparticle interaction and the suspension process related to the interaction with the fluid. It was assumed that momentum conservation of collision mechanics controls the interaction between colliding particles, while the state of each suspended particle is fully dominated by fluid/particle interaction. Comparing a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice with a three-dimensional hexagonal packed structure, an unreal porosity calculated on area basis is transformed into a three-dimensional porosity in order to give reasonable simulation results. The above model has been used for simulating bubbling, slugging and cluster behavior in gas-solid fluidization, resulting in more reasonable phenomena such as distinct eddies, particle-free slugs and the dynamic clusters.

38749094441	Granular flow in a rotating drum with gaps in the side wall	This paper presents a numerical investigation of the motion of bi-sized particles in a short rotating drum by using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The side wall of the drum has equally spaced gaps whose width is just between the two particle diameters. One end wall of the drum is fixed while the other rotates with the side wall. Small particles are fed into the drum continuously at the center region in the axial direction. The effect of rotating speed on the volumetric holdup and residence time of small particle is investigated. A critical rotating speed is found, below which the decrease of rotating speed will increase the volumetric holdup and the residence time of the small particles sharply. A jump in the axial distribution of the outflow rate of the small particles is observed at the region adjacent to the fixed end wall. The flow pattern inside the drum is analyzed. In the region between the fixed end wall and the feeding point, all small particles, on average, move towards the fixed end wall. While in the region between the rotating end wall and the feeding point, the small particles curve away the rotating end wall in the upper part of the charge and return to this wall in the lower part.

39049150801	Eulerian simulation of heterogeneous gas-solid flows in CFB risers: EMMS-based sub-grid scale model with a revised cluster description	Gas-solid two-phase flow in CFB risers is characterized by the clustering of solid particles producing dynamical multi-scale structures, and how to quantify such heterogeneity is a critical yet unsolved issue. Recently, incorporating the energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model with Eulerian approach has obtained encouraging results for simulating the hydrodynamics in CFB risers. However, owing to the cluster diameter correlation used, the present model is still limited to the simulation of Geldart A particles. In this study, a stochastic geometry approach named doubly stochastic Poisson processes is used to analyze the fluctuation characteristics of solid concentration in CFB risers, which provides a mean to define the solid concentration inside clusters. The predicted results are validated by experimental data available in literature, and a revised cluster diameter correlation is then proposed for EMMS model previously developed for cocurrent-up gas-solid flow. Following our previous studies, the EMMS model thus improved is incorporated into an Eulerian-Eulerian description of gas-solid flow as a sub-grid scale model for inter-phase drag force, with which the hydrodynamics of both Geldart A and Geldart B particles in CFB risers are simulated. It is shown that the experimentally found S-shaped axial voidage profiles and the choking phenomenon can be well predicted. The computed one-dimensional slip velocities decrease toward the top of the risers and increase with decreasing cross-sectional averaged voidages. The experimentally found dependence of the root mean square of the solid concentration on its mean value at a given position is also well predicted. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40149103608	A revised surface tension model for macro-scale particle methods	A simple treatment for surface tension in immiscible fluids is proposed for macro-scale particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling (MaPPM). By introducing a repulsion between the neighboring particles of different fluids, surface tension arises automatically, while simple equations of state are still possible for each phase. This treatment is validated by comparative simulations on the deformation of a square liquid drop in suspension using the volume of fluid (VOF) method. The relationship between surface tension and the repulsion intensity parameter in our model is obtained by the sessile drop method. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0034610114	Dynamic behaviors of heterogeneous flow structure in gas-solid fluidization	A method was established to quantitatively describe nonlinear dynamic behavior of heterogeneous flow structure in gas-solid fluidization by carrying out multiple resolution and time series reconstruction of experimental signals. Optimum sampling frequency was proposed by analyzing the dependence of Kolmogorov entropy of time series on sampling frequencies. Original signals could be resolved with respect first to scale, and then to time and amplitude into a periodic function and three irregular changes (micro-scale fluctuations, and meso-scale irregular amplitude and time fluctuations). Statistical analysis indicated that the three kinds of irregular components are of random characteristics, with a complicated evolution of their probability density distributions with changing operating conditions. A new distribution function, called Compound Weibull distribution with seven parameters, was developed to describe the irregular fluctuations of flow structure, leading to a nonlinear dynamic model for simulating dynamic behaviors of heterogeneous flow structure in gas-solid fluidization, which has been coded into a software package.

0034699235	Compromise and resolution - Exploring the multi-scale nature of gas-solid fluidization	Research strategy in studying gas-solid fluidization at the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy (ICM) is outlined. Particle-fluid compromise is recognized to be the origin of the multi-scale dissipative structure in the system, to which multiple resolution is applied, leading to the establishment of the variational criterion for stability and the critical condition for choking. The dynamic behavior of such a heterogeneous structure in fluidized systems is formulated by carrying out wavelet analysis and resolving the whole process with respect first to scale, and then, to time and amplitude. Average approaches, as commonly used, are considered to be inadequate to describe transport behaviors in gas-solid fluidization. Discrete computer simulation on micro-scale is regarded to be a promising approach to further understanding of the complicated mechanism of particle-fluid interaction.

84877343333	Steady-state modeling of axial heterogeneity in CFB risers based on one-dimensional EMMS model	Axial heterogeneity in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers is very important to the design of fluidized bed reactors, which is, however, still unable to be described in theory. Based on a successful description of local hydrodynamics in gas-solid flow, the Energy-Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) theory further relates axial hydrodynamics with local and global stability conditions in the system, providing a theoretical way to account for the axial heterogeneity in CFB risers. This research reveals that the interaction between particle clusters and the dilute phase as well as the surrounding dense phase has a significant effect on their dynamical evolution. Similar to cluster diameter in the EMMS theory, number density of particle clusters serving as a comprehensive indicator to the heterogeneity in gas-solid flow is constrained by both local and global stability conditions in the system. With the above cognition, a one-dimensional EMMS model is developed to perform steady-state modeling of the axial heterogeneity in CFB risers. The model successfully reproduces a complete transition zone and the parametric effects on it at the choking condition. The S-shaped axial voidage profile calculated by the one-dimensional EMMS model is in good agreement with the experimental results in gas-solid fast fluidization. This research is not only the first step toward implementing the three-scale computation in virtual process engineering (VPE), but also of referential significance to industrial chemical process development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84908261622	A stability condition for turbulence model: From EMMS model to EMMS-based turbulence model	The closure problem of turbulence is still a challenging issue in turbulence modeling. In this work, a stability condition is used to close turbulence. Specifically, we regard single-phase flow as a mixture of turbulent and non-turbulent fluids, separating the structure of turbulence. Subsequently, according to the picture of the turbulent eddy cascade, the energy contained in turbulent flow is decomposed into different parts and then quantified. A turbulence stability condition, similar to the principle of the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model for gas-solid systems, is formulated to close the dynamic constraint equations of turbulence, allowing the inhomogeneous structural parameters of turbulence to be optimized. We name this model as the "EMMS-based turbulence model", and use it to construct the corresponding turbulent viscosity coefficient. To validate the EMMS-based turbulence model, it is used to simulate two classical benchmark problems, lid-driven cavity flow and turbulent flow with forced convection in an empty room. The numerical results show that the EMMS-based turbulence model improves the accuracy of turbulence modeling due to it considers the principle of compromise in competition between viscosity and inertia.

4344576759	Simulation of heterogeneous structure in a circulating fluidized-bed riser by combining the two-fluid model with the EMMS approach	To consider the critical effect of mesoscale structure on the drag coefficient, this paper presents a drag model based on the energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) approach. The proposed structure parameters are obtained from the EMMS model, and then the average drag coefficient can be calculated from the structure parameters and further incorporated into the two-fluid model to simulate the gas-solid flow in a circulating fluidized-bed riser. Simulation results indicate that the simulated flow structures are different for the EMMS-based drag model and the hybrid model using the Wen and Yu correlation and the Ergun equation. The former shows its improvement in predicting the solids entrainment rate, the mesoscale heterogeneous structure involving clusters or strands, and the radial and axial voidage distributions. The simulation results support the idea that the average drag coefficient is an important factor for the two-fluid model and suggest that the EMMS approach could be used as a kind of multiscale closure law for drag coefficient.

42649127364	Non-equilibrium phase transitions in suspensions of oppositely driven inertial particles	The structural evolution of a two-specie suspension of inertial particles under opposite driving forces is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of the driving force (F) and the total number density of the particles (ρ) on the final structure are explored. When F is increased under a high ρ, the system starts with a frozen phase, passes through an ordered phase characterized by two demixed lanes moving in opposite directions, and finally returns to a disorder phase. When ρ is increased under a low F, a novel re-entrant phase transition is found: more than two lanes parallel to the driving forces are observed first, followed by a disordered phase with different kinds of particles blocking each other, and then an ordered state with all particles separating into two demixed lanes. We comment on the possible mechanisms underlying these phase transitions in terms of the compromise between the directional driven motion and random thermal fluctuation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

4344716913	Application of the discrete approach to the simulation of size segregation in granular chute flow	Size segregation is commonly observed in flows of particles with different physical and mechanical properties. It can be favorable or undesirable, depending on different industrial processes. In our case, the size segregation of ore particles in a chute flow is utilized to prepare a well-bedded feedstock for high sintering quality, and magnets are installed below the chute to enhance size segregation. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations are carried out to explore the optimal arrangement of the magnets. The system is reduced to two dimensions, and the irregular ore particles of continuous size distribution are represented by rough disks of four diameters, with their properties reasonably sampled from the sintering materials. The magnetic fields are calculated using Ansoft in advance, which excludes the influence of the ore layer itself because it is weakly magnetic only. The simulations show that the proper magnetic field can significantly enhance the segregation, and it seems that the component normal to the chute has the dominant effect on segregation but the tangential component is also critical. The simulation results are in good agreement with our experiences in the industrial systems designed with consultation to these results. We suggest that despite major simplifications, the DEM is still an effective tool for dynamic studies and the design of complex granular flows in mineral processing.

50849088025	Molecular dynamics simulation of a single polymer in hydrophilic nano-slits	The behavior of a single polyethylene polymer in aqueous solution confined between two hydrophilic walls is studied with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The thickness of the nano-slit ranges from 1.26 to 3.15 nm, which is comparative to the polymer dimension. A monotonic transition from 3D-to 2D-like configurations is observed as the distance between the two walls narrows. Monomers are compressed into several layers and the preferred bond orientations alternate between parallel and normal to the walls accordingly. The diffusivity in the direction parallel to the wall is always larger than the one perpendicular to it. Calculation of the entropy and enthalpy changes during the folding of the polymer chain alone cannot explain the spontaneous process. The corresponding increase in water entropy due to volume expansion may be large enough to result in the overall free energy decrease. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

54949149563	Multi-scale CFD simulation of operating diagram for gas-solid risers	Our recently presented multi-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach has proven to be able to capture the choking phenomena in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB). However, how to transfer this capability to assist industrial operation remains to be explored. To this end, this paper presents further simulation results over the intrinsic flow regime diagram and the operating diagram for gas-solid risers, showing the variation of flow regimes with gas velocity and solids flux as well as riser height. It is confirmed that the choking in CFB risers, characterized by the saturation carrying capacity and the coexistence of both dense and dilute flows, holds clear-cut definition in hydrodynamics. In physics, both the choking, non-choking transitions, and the critical point in-between are intrinsic nature of gas-solid riser flows; they initiate as functions of gas velocity and solids flux. In engineering operation, however, their appearances vary with the riser height used. As a result, the intrinsic flow regime diagram can be defined by the combination of gas velocity and solids flux, although it is hard to obtain in practice owing to the limitation of riser height. The operating diagram of a CFB should be, accordingly, height-dependent in practice, demanding the riser height as a parameter besides commonly believed gas velocity and solids flux. © 2008 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.

Studies on nanoparticles have scored great progress in three aspects: novel process exploration, properties of structured nanoparticles, and sintering behaviours. Parallel to continuing efforts on granular systems applications and bulk solids handling, fundamental understanding and computer simulation have been highly intensified these years to provide insight into the mechanisms of powder behaviors.

Especially, the promising structure-oriented computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are presented in detail. This review also outlines the critical problems in the field of powder technology, and prospects in experiments, theories and computations for future developments in powder technology.

57049098078	Pattern formation in particle systems driven by color field	The structural evolution of systems with two kinds of particles driven in opposite directions, i.e., driven by a color field, is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Gaussian thermostat, a common treatment to restrict the thermal velocity of the particles in the systems, has been used so as to account for the dissipation of heat and allow the system to reach a steady state. It has been found that with the increase of the strength of driving force (F), the system undergoes an obvious structural transition from an initially random mixing state to a state characterized by separate lanes and in each lane only one kind of particles exists. The analysis shows that the reason for the formation of lane structure is not only the increase of F but also the variation of particle friction coefficient. While using Gaussian thermostat the particle friction coefficient becomes a function of F. Increasing F leads to high particle friction coefficient and inevitably results in lane formation for strong enough driving force. When lifting the effect of F on friction coefficient and choosing a constant friction coefficient, our results show that for a given F there always exists a critical value of friction coefficient higher than which the system will develop into lane structure. © 2008 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent simulation of a full-loop CFB revealed that the axial profiles of cross-sectionally averaged solid volume fraction, and the radial profiles of solid axial velocity and solid volume fraction were in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Based on this agreement, database derived from experiments not yet accomplished was replenished with such simulations, and fluid regime diagrams and pressure balance around the CFB loop were derived accordingly. This work presents an integrated viewpoint on CFB and unfolds a fresh paradigm for CFB modeling, which can be expected to help resolve certain issues long in dispute but hard for experiments. © 2008 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

58149175810	Direct numerical simulation of particle clustering in gas-solid flow with a macro-scale particle method	Particle clustering has long been a focus in the study of gas-solid flow. Detailed flow field information below the particle scale is required to understand the mechanism of its formation and the statistical properties of its dynamic behavior, but is not easily obtained in both experiments and numerical simulations. In this article, a meshless method is used to reveal such details in the destabilizing of a suspension with hundreds of particles. During the process, doublets, quadruplet and larger clusters are seen to form and disintegrate dynamically, showing a tendency to minimize local voidages. At the same time, single vertical streams, pairs of parallel streams and many irregular streams appear and disappear between particle clusters alternatively, exhibiting a tendency to suffer lowest resistance. Globally, the spatio-temporal compromise between these two tendencies results in a configuration of large clusters separated by fast flow streams. In the clustering process, the inter-phase slip velocity is seen to increase long after the forces on each phase have stabilized, suggesting that inter-phase friction is not a function of local voidage and Reynolds number only, as commonly considered. The article concludes with prospects on the sub-grid scale models for continuum description of gas-solid flow that can be established upon such simulation results. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

61649107909	Modeling of regime transition in bubble columns with stability condition	Understanding the physical essence of regime transition is of crucial importance for the modeling and simulation of hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer in bubble columns. The regime transition of the air-water system has been captured by the dual-bubble-size (DBS) model in our previous work [Yang et al. Chem. Eng. Sci. 2007, 62, 6978-6991] as a jump change from one minimum point of the stability criterion to the other. The DBS model features the incorporation of a stability condition with hydrodynamic conservation equations through the analysis of compromise between dominant mechanisms. This work reiterates our previous work and further explores some remaining issues and underlying physics related to the jump change by analyzing the trajectory of global minimum points in the three-dimensional space of structural parameters. The influence of drag coefficient correlations on the model prediction is investigated. The effect of liquid viscosity on regime transition is evaluated using the DBS model for saccharose and glycerin systems. The dual effects of liquid viscosity reported in literature, namely, suppressing the regime transition while slightly increasing viscosity and destabilizing the homogeneous regime at higher viscosity, can be reasonably predicted with this model. Finally, the concept of the compromise between dominant mechanisms is extended to understand the bubble behavior at different scales and its relationship with stability condition. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

Our previous work indicated that the second point could be reasonably predicted and physically interpreted by the DBS model for various gas-liquid systems. This work further clarifies the relationship between the bifurcation of energy dissipation and of structural parameters and the regime transition. It is found that the bifurcation of energy dissipation exists for both the gas-liquid and gas-solid systems and can be used to predict and understand regime transition in multiphase flow. Then the DBS model is incorporated into the two-fluid model for calculating interphase coupling, and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation is performed to simulate a bubble column. The "shoulder" on the gas hold-up curve can be observed in the simulation with the new coupling method, and the second transition point predicted from the CFD simulation is consistent with experiments and the calculation of the DBS model. Sparger effects are investigated through the two simulation cases for uniform aeration and local aeration, and the radial distribution of local hydrodynamic parameters is comparable with experimental data in the literature. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

The results are in good agreement with the available experimental results (Horowitz, P. M.; Butler, M. Interactive Intermediates Are Formed During the Urea Unfolding of Rhodanese. J. Biol.

Besides that our simulation can also depict more dynamic details of the unfolding process. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) shows a remarkable increase mainly due to a more exposed hydrophobic area, indicating that the hydrophobic interaction is considerably weaker at high temperatures. Comparisons between the thermal stabilities of equivalent secondary structures in both domains suggest that the C-domain is more fragile than the N-domain and the breaking down of the secondary structures follows the pattern [α-helix]→ [bend, turn, 3-helix, and 5-helix].

0034828696	Macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling for particle-fluid systems	Pseudo-particle modeling (PPM) is a particle method (PM) proposed in 1996. Though it is effective for the simulation of microscopic particle-fluid systems, its application to practical systems is still limited by computational cost. In this note, we speed up the computation by using a combination of weighted averaging with finite difference techniques to upgrade the particle interactions to a fluid element level, which conforms to the Navier-Stokes equation. The approach, abbreviated to MaPPM, is then applied to the problem of one-dimensional Poiseuille flow with a quantitative comparison to the results of another related PM smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), where the accuracy and efficiency of MaPPM is found to be much better than that of SPH. Flows around a cylinder and multiple freely moving particles are also simulated with the new model, resulting in reasonable flow pattern and drag coefficient.

0035428273	Multi-scale mass transfer model for heterogeneous gas-solid two-phase flow	By means of structure and process decomposition, this work is devoted to elucidating mass transfer process in heterogeneous flow theoretically. Mass transfer process in heterogeneous flow of gas-solid circulating fluidized bed is considered to consist of two subprocesses: static and dynamic. At the mean time, the static subprocess is decomposed to three scales: mass transfer in dilute phase; dense phase; and inter phase. Then, by virtue of EMMS model, local hydrodynamics of heterogeneous two-phase parameters are calculated from the condition of operation parameters (solids mass flux, gas velocity) and species characteristics. Mass transfer coefficient is obtained by slip velocity, voidage, etc. Based on above, axial distribution of concentration is studied.

71849090520	A conceptual model for analyzing the stability condition and regime transition in bubble columns	The abrupt change on the curve of gas holdup vs. superficial gas velocity calculated from the dual-bubble-size (DBS) model was physically interpreted as a shift from the homogeneous and transition regimes to the heterogeneous regime for bubble columns in our previous work (Yang et al., 2007. Explorations on the multi-scale flow structure and stability condition in bubble columns. Chem. Eng. Sci. 62, 6978-6991). The fundamentals related to the DBS model and this jump change are further analyzed in this work. A conceptual analysis is performed on the momentum and energy transfer modes between phases and the partition of energy dissipation at different scales, thus the hydrodynamic equations can be closed with a stability condition formulated as a variational criterion, that is, the minimization of micro-scale energy dissipation or the maximization of meso-scale energy dissipation. Model calculation indicates that the stability condition drives the variation and evolution of structure parameters for the two bubble classes and hence causes the jump change of gas holdup which is due to the shift of the location of the global minimum point of the micro-scale energy dissipation from one ellipsoid of iso-surface to another in the 3D space of structure parameters. The stability condition brings about the compromise between small and large bubbles in that these two classes compete with each other to approach a critical diameter at which drag coefficient reaches minimum. For different liquid media, generally only one bubble class could jump to the critical diameter, except the critical state at which the roles of stabilizing and destabilizing flow reach a balance and the two bubble classes jump together to the critical diameter. This may offer a physical explanation on the dual effect of liquid viscosity and surface tension on flow stability and regime transition reported in literature, and the model calculation for this dual effect and the regime map is in reasonable agreement with experimental findings. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

74649085830	A review of multiscale CFD for gas-solid CFB modeling	Meso-scale structure is of critical importance to circulating fluidized bed (CFB) applications. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with consideration of meso-scale structures can help understand the structure-oriented coupling between flow, heat/mass transfer and reactions. This article is to review our recent progress on the so-called multiscale CFD (MSCFD), which characterizes the sub-grid meso-scale structure with stability criteria in addition to conservation equations. It is found that the mesh-independent solution of fine-grid two-fluid model (TFM) without sub-grid structures is inexact, in the sense that it overestimates the drag coefficient and fails to capture the characteristic S-shaped axial profile of voidage in a CFB riser. By comparison, MSCFD approach in terms of EMMS/matrix seems to reach a mesh-independent solution of the sub-grid structure, and succeeds in predicting the axial profile and flow regime transitions. Further application of MSCFD finds that neglect of geometric factors is one of the major reasons that cause disputes in understanding the flow regime transitions in a CFB. The operating diagram should, accordingly, include geometric factors besides commonly believed operating parameters for the intrinsic flow regime diagram. Recent extension of MSCFD to mass transfer finds that Reynolds number is insufficient for correlating the overall Sherwood number in a CFB. This is believed the main reason why the conventional correlations of Sherwood number scatter by several orders of magnitude. Certain jump change of state of motion around Reynolds number of 50-100 can be expected to clarify the abrupt decay of Sherwood number in both classical- and circulating-fluidized beds. Finally, we expect that the real-size, 3-D, full-loop, time-dependent multiscale simulation of CFB is an emerging paradigm that will realize virtual experiment of CFBs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As for "middle-fractured" structure, it is found that the ultimate oil recovery is almost determined by the height of fracture regardless of its orientation, and the result compares well with corresponding experiments. Besides, the water-wet wall is favorable to higher oil recovery.

77955554963	Direct numerical simulation of sub-grid structures in gas-solid flow-GPU implementation of macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling	Due to significant multi-scale heterogeneity, understanding sub-grid structures is critical to effective continuum-based description of gas-solid flow. However, it is challenging for both physical measurements and numerical simulations. In this article, with the macro-scale pseudo-particle method (MaPPM) implemented on a GPU-based HPC system, up to 30,000 fluidized solids are simulated using the N-S equation directly. The destabilization of uniform suspensions and the formation of solids clusters are reproduced in two-dimensional suspensions. Distinct scale-dependence of the statistical properties in the systems at moderate solid/gas density ratio is observed. Obvious cluster formation and its effect on drag coefficient are shown in a system at high solid/gas density ratio. On the computational side, about 19 folds speedup is obtained on one GT200 GPU, as compared to a mainstream CPU core. The necessity for investigating even larger systems is prospected. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the process of developing, improving and extending the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) method, we have gradually recognized that meso-scales are critical to the understanding of the different kinds of multi-scale structures and systems. It is a common challenge not only for chemical engineering but also for almost all disciplines of science and engineering, due to its importance in bridging micro- and macro-behaviors and in displaying complexity and diversity. It is believed that there may exist a common law behind meso-scales of different problems, possibly even in different fields. Therefore, a breakthrough in the understanding of meso-scales will help materialize a revolutionary progress, with respect to modeling, computation and application. © 2010 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

78650193792	Molecular dynamics simulation of macromolecules using graphics processing unit	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful computational tool to study the behaviour of macromolecular systems. However, many simulations in this field are limited in spatial or temporal scale by the available computational resource. In recent years, graphics processing units (GPUs) have provided unprecedented computational power for scientific applications. Many MD algorithms suit the multithread nature of GPU. In this paper, MD algorithms for macromolecular systems that run entirely on GPU are presented. For validation, we have performed MD simulations of polymer crystallisation with our GPU package, GPU-MD-1.0.5, and the results agree perfectly with computations on CPUs, meanwhile GPU-MD-1.0.5 achieves about 39 times speedup compared with GROMACS-4.0.5 on a single CPU core. Therefore, our single GPU code has already provided an inexpensive alternative for macromolecular simulations of traditional CPU clusters and will serve as a basis for developing parallel GPU programs to further speed up the computations. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

0035802227	Multiscale nature of complex fluid-particle systems	Most multiphase chemical reactors are complex systems. This paper explores the multiscale nature of complex systems in chemical engineering and the intrinsic mechanism of the scale-up effect. Two approaches - multiscale and pseudoparticle - are discussed, which we believe to be effective and promising in revealing underlying mechanisms and extracting simplicity in complex systems. Heterogeneous structure, the most important characteristic of complex systems and a crucial aspect in scaling up reactors, is analyzed as the focus of this paper. The multiscale approach follows the strategy of structure resolution in describing the heterogeneous structure and mechanism compromise in defining the variational criterion. The pseudoparticle approach describes the heterogeneous structure by discretizing the fluid into pseudoparticles with a size much smaller than that of the real particles, that is, the particle-fluid interaction is treated as the interaction between real particles and pseudoparticles. This paper outlines the respective advantages and prospects of these two approaches and explores some concepts in understanding complex systems.

0035861751	Application of the energy-minimization multi-scale method to gas-liquid-solid fluidized beds	A model for gas-liquid-solid three-phase fluidized beds with concurrent gas-liquid up-flow is proposed, which is formulated on the basis of the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) method for gas-solid two-phase flow. The three-phase fluidization system is resolved into the suspending and transporting subsystem and the energy dissipation subsystem, and the former is further divided into three sub-subsystems: liquid-solid phase, gas phase and inter-phase. Force balance is analyzed at three different scales: micro-scale of particles, meso-scale of bubbles and macro-scale of the whole system. In addition to the analysis of multi-scale interactions, the energy consumption in the system is analyzed to establish the stability condition for the system, which is considered indispensible due to the multiplicity of three-phase fluidized beds. The total energy of the system consumed with respect to unit mass of particles is resolved into two portions: suspending and transporting energy and dissipated energy. The stability condition is reached when the suspending and transporting energy of the system, N

0035688969	Lagrangian simulations of gas-solid two-phase flow: Pseudo-particle model	With an aim to study gas flow information at a single particle scale, a Lagrangian method for gas/solid flow, termed pseudo-particle model (PPM), is presented in this work. According to the PPM, viscous and pressure forces acting on pseudo-particles are introduced. With this model, two numerical simulations of gas flowing around a circular cylinder are conducted at Re = 1.58 and Re = 30.92. Twin eddies in the downstream flow were observed at Re = 30.92. Simulation of gas flowing around a particle assembly is also performed, and the effect of structure heterogeneity on gas flow field is observed. As applications of the PPM to dynamic behavior simulation, bubbling phenomena with single and double orifices are computed, which shows the development process of bubbles formation near the orifice to the break-up at the bed top. Fluidization of multi-sized particles with the same density is also simulated, showing good agreement with experimental results.

0036486942	Experimental study on gas-solid mass transfer in circulating fluidized beds	This study is devoted to gas-solid mass transfer behavior in heterogeneous two-phase flow. Experiments were carried out in a cold circulating fluidized bed of 3.0 m in height and 72 mm in diameter with naphthalene particles. Axial and radial distributions of sublimated naphthalene concentration in air were measured with an online concentration monitoring system HP GC-MS. Mass transfer coefficients were obtained under various operating conditions, showing that heterogeneous flow structure strongly influences the axial and radial profiles of mass transfer coefficients. In the bottom dense region, mass transfer rate is high due to intensive dynamic behavior and higher relative slip velocity between gas and clusters. In the middle transition region and the upper dilute region, as a result of low mass transfer driving force and the influence of flow structure, mass transfer rate distribution becomes non-uniform. In conclusion, among the operating parameters influencing mass transfer coefficients, the superficial gas velocity is the most important factor and the solid circulation rate should be also taken into account.

79958744391	Multi-scale analysis of gas-liquid interaction and CFD simulation of gas-liquid flow in bubble columns	The ratio of effective drag coefficient to bubble diameter is of critical importance for CFD simulation of gas-liquid flow in bubble columns. In this study, a novel model is proposed to calculate the ratio on the basis of the Dual-Bubble-Size (DBS) model. The motivation of the study is that a stability condition reflecting the compromise between different dominant mechanisms can serve for a closure in addition to mass and momentum conservative constraints, and the interphase momentum transfer should be related to different paths of energy dissipation. With the DBS model, we can first offer a physical interpretation on macro-scale regime transition via the shift of global minimum point of micro-scale energy dissipation from one potential trough to the other. Then the proposed drag model is integrated into a CFD simulation. Prior to this integration, we investigate the respective effects of bubble diameter and correction factor and found that the effect of bubble diameter is limited, whereas the correction factor due to the bubble swarm effect is eminent and appropriate correction factor has to be selected for different correlations of standard drag efficient to be in accord with experiments. By contrast, the DBS drag model can well predict the radial gas holdup distribution, the total gas holdup as well as the two-phase flow field without the need to adjust model parameters, showing its great potential and advantage in understanding the complex nature of multi-scale structure of gas-liquid flow in bubble columns. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79959932592	Meso-Scale Modeling-The Key to Multi-Scale CFD Simulation	Meso-scale structure is critical to characterize complex systems in chemical engineering. Conventional two-fluid model (TFM) without meso-scale modeling has proved to be inadequate for describing gas-solid flow systems featuring multi-scale heterogeneity. In this review, it is demonstrated that, based on the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model, the multi-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for gas-solid systems has reasonably accounted the effects of meso-scale structures and hence upgraded both computational efficiency and accuracy significantly. This approach has succeeded in predicting the circulating solids flux, revealing the mechanisms of the choking phenomena and resolving the disputes in transport phenomena of gas-fluidized beds. It has also been applied to a wide range of industrial processes including fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), coal combustion, and so on. In all, the multi-scale CFD with EMMS modeling is intrinsically multi-scaled, free from the requirement of clear scale separation, and it can be expected to be an emerging paradigm for the simulation of multiphase flows and reactors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A single GPU is used first to simulate a small model system with about 8000 particles in real-time, and the simulation is then scaled up to industrial scale using more than 200 GPUs in a 1D domain-decomposition parallelization mode. The overall speed is about 1/11 of the real-time.

80051667072	Meso-scale oriented simulation towards virtual process engineering (VPE)-The EMMS Paradigm	With the dramatic development of computational science and technology, computer simulation is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research and engineering practice, and is believed to bring about a profound revolution to the mode and means of these activities. For chemical engineering, it will promote the transition from an experience-and-experiment-based research and development mode to the one based on virtual process engineering (VPE). However, such a revolution still requires tremendous improvements in the Accuracy of physical modeling and numerical methods, the Capability of the computing hardware and software, and the Efficiency of the simulation activities, or in short, ACE. This article will systematically review the 3-decade endeavors at IPE, CAS (Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences) on upgrading ACE by establishing a multi-scale computing paradigm focusing on meso-scale structures. We also report recent developments in this direction with projections on future work. Meso-scales refer to the intermediate scales at which the discrete elements in a system interact to shape the global behavior of the system. Reasonable description of the structures at such scales is a bottleneck for reliable and accurate modeling of global behaviors. To address this problem, we started from gas-solid flow by proposing the energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model to quantify the hydrodynamics of meso-scale structures in gas-solid fluidization. This model, that is, its stability condition, was thoroughly analyzed and verified with the pseudo-particle modeling (PPM) method. Other systems, such as turbulence and gas-liquid flow, were then studied following the same strategy, revealing the ubiquity of stability conditions for meso-scale structures as a result of the compromise among different dominant mechanisms, and leading to a generalized model mathematically formulated as a multi-objective variational (MOV) problem. Meanwhile, along with wider industrial applications of the EMMS-based simulation methods, common features were recognized that ACE requires structural consistency among the simulated system, the physical model, the numerical software and the computing hardware under the umbrella of MOV, which we have named as the EMMS Paradigm. The EMMS Paradigm was first implemented from the software level using traditional computing hardware to achieve Accuracy. Since 2007, with the development of general-purpose GPU (graphic processing unit) computing, CPU (central processing unit)-GPU hybrid computing was deployed to implement the Paradigm from the hardware level, boosting the Capability to Petaflops range. In applying the Paradigm to the development of an industrial petro-chemical process (maximizing iso-paraffins, MIP), enabling technologies such as pre- and post-processing, error-tolerance, network-based computing and seamless integration of different simulation methods are now under development, which will greatly improve the Efficiency. A demonstration virtual laboratory featuring the comparison and interaction of online measurement and real-time computing is under construction. With these endeavors, an industrial process could be simulated globally in almost real-time, and different levels of details could be traced from the global distribution of flow parameters in a reactor to the inner-channels of catalytic particles at a perceivable evolution speed. The realization of VPE is, therefore, in the foreseeable future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, to investigate the effects of particle properties on these meso-scale structures, for all particle types, two-fluid modeling with and without consideration of meso-scale structures were performed and compared. Generally, the modeling with EMMS drag coefficient shows better results than without considering meso-scale structures, but their discrepancy decays with the Archimedes number. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical schemes and their GPU parallelism strategy are described in detail, where more than 40-fold speedup is achieved on one Nvidia C2050 GPU over one core of Intel E5520 CPU in double precision, and nearly ideal scalability is maintained when using up to 672 GPUs.

84859782241	An EMMS-based multi-fluid model (EFM) for heterogeneous gas-solid riser flows: Part II. An alternative formulation from dominant mechanisms	The gas-solid flow in circulating fluidized bed risers is characterized by the existence of two-phase structure with particle-rich dense phase and gas-rich dilute phase, but in traditional coarse grid simulation using two-fluid models, the constitutive laws are based on the assumption of structural homogeneity inside computational cells, which seems to be inaccurate for riser flows. One way out is to carry out coarse grid simulation with proper meso-scale or sub-grid scale models considering the effect of heterogeneous structures on the constitutive laws. In this study, we propose an EMMS-based two-fluid model (EFM), which features: (i) the particle-rich dense phase and the gas-rich dilute phase representing the physical realizations of particle-dominated and gas-dominated mechanisms are defined as the two interpenetrating continua; (ii) the interactions between heterogeneous gas-solid flow are decomposed into the interactions within three homogeneous sub-systems according to the concept of EMMS model, that is, dilute-phase, dense-phase and inter-phase; (iii) the constitutive laws are determined by the EMMS model featuring a stability condition. It was shown that the hydrodynamics of a riser predicted by EFM are in a good agreement with experimental data, indicating the feasibility of EFM for describing the hydrodynamics of heterogeneous gas-solid flow in risers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84859802715	An EMMS-based multi-fluid model (EFM) for heterogeneous gas-solid riser flows: Part I. Formulation of structure-dependent conservation equations	In gas-solid riser flows, meso-scale structures have significant effects on the flow, mass/heat transfer as well as reaction behavior. To be consistent with these structures, this paper reformulates the Energy-Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) model in terms of its structure-dependent conservation equations. These conservation equations (namely the Structure-dependent multi-Fluid Model, SFM) may reduce to the Two-Fluid Model (TFM) if homogeneous distribution is assumed within each grid, and restore to the balance equations of the original EMMS model if they are used to describe steady-state, global behavior. The closure of the structure-dependent parameters in SFM requires the stability condition defined in the original EMMS model. Thus, the EMMS-based multi-Fluid Model (EFM) can be defined with the stability-constrained SFM. Our previous practice in Multi-Scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (MSCFD), which is characterized by coupling of TFM and EMMS drag coefficient, can then be viewed as a simplified realization of EFM. Finally, simulation with this simplified version of EFM was performed and compared to experimental data for verification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84860119909	Stability-driven structure evolution: Exploring the intrinsic similarity between gas-solid and gas-liquid systems	As the core of the Energy-Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) approach, the so-called stability condition has been proposed to reflect the compromise between different dominant mechanisms and believed to be indispensable for understanding the complex nature of gas-solid fluidization systems. This approach was recently extended to the study of gas-liquid bubble columns. In this article, we try to analyze the intrinsic similarity between gas-solid and gas-liquid systems by using the EMMS approach. First, the model solution spaces for the two systems are depicted through a unified numerical solution strategy, so that we are able to find three structural hierarchies in the EMMS model for gas-solid systems. This may help to understand the roles of cluster diameter correlation and stability condition. Second, a common characteristic of gas-solid and gas-liquid systems can be found by comparing the model solutions for the two systems, albeit structural parameters and stability criteria are specific in each system: two local minima of the micro-scale energy dissipation emerges simultaneously in the solution space of structure parameters, reflecting the compromise of two different dominant mechanisms. They may share an equal value at a critical condition of operating conditions, and the global minimum may shift from one to the other when the operating condition changes. As a result, structure parameters such as voidage or gas hold-up exhibit a jump change due to this shift, leading to dramatic structure variation and hence regime transition of these systems. This demonstrates that it is the stability condition that drives the structure variation and system evolution, which may be the intrinsic similarity of gas-solid and gas-liquid systems. © 2012 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

All cells have developed their structurally and functionally distinct classes of molecular chaperones to help nonnative proteins fold to their native structures, one of which is the most studied GroEL/ES complex. In the present article, large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out on rhodanese folding in a series of chaperonin mutants for 200 ns to understand the mechanism therein. In accordance with experimental results, two factors have been identified to play a significant role, the geometrical confinement effect of the folding cavity and the charge effect of the inner surface of the cavity. Our analysis of the properties during simulation suggests that the GroEL/ES complex directly exerts force on the contacting residues of the substrate, thus assists substrate folding. © 2011 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

84863011545	In-depth exploration of the Dual-Bubble-Size model for bubble columns	The Dual-Bubble-Size (DBS) model is an extension of the Energy-Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) model, which was originally proposed for gas-solid fluidization to gas-liquid systems. This model is featured by a stability condition in addition to conservative equations for two bubble classes. The stability condition is mathematically formulated as a minimization tendency of microscale energy dissipation and physically reflects the compromise between different dominant mechanisms. This work attempts to use the Simulated Annealing (SA) method to solve the nonlinear optimization problem of the model. It is found that the SA method could greatly reduce the computational cost while capturing the jump change of gas holdup more accurately for the DBS model. The jump change reflects the transition from homogeneous and transitional regimes to heterogeneous regime, and essentially arises from the inflection of the trajectory of global minimum point within the space of the three structure parameters. The DBS model then is extended to Triple-Bubble-Size (TBS) and Multiple-Bubble-Size (MBS) models by introducing three or more bubble classes. We find that the TBS and MBS model prediction is reduced to that of DBS model and the two characteristic bubble classes are distinct in the calculation, even though the gas is resolved into three or more bubble classes. This implies that gas-liquid flow in bubble columns are essentially dominated by two bubble classes rather than multiple bubble classes, and the DBS model may be an intrinsic model for reflecting the compromising mechanisms in the system and thereby describing the system evolution and gas-liquid interaction. Its integration with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation may offer a more reasonable way to model the complex gas-liquid flow in bubble columns. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The circulating fluidized bed (CFB) measures the instantaneous axial solids-concentration profile in the riser.

Calculated solid flux by the EMMS drag agrees well with the experimental value; while the traditional homogeneous drag over-predicts this value. EMMS drag force model can also predict the macro- and meso-scale structures. Quantitative comparison of the results by the EMMS drag force model and the experimental measurements show high accuracy of the model. The effects of the number of particles per parcel and wall conditions on the simulation results have also been investigated in the paper.

0036756489	Physical mapping of fluidization regimes- The EMMS approach	The existence of multiple regimes of distinctive flow structure is a remarkable characteristic of fluidization, which is far from being physically interpreted under a unified approach. The energy minimization multi-scale model (Particle-Fluid Two-Phase Flow, the Energy Minimization Multi-Scale Method, Metallurgical Industry Press, Beijing, 1994) is potentially such an approach in which the inclusion of stability criteria enables the prediction of heterogeneity and non-linear behaviors in fluidized beds. However, fully analytical solution of the model is impossible so far, and numerical solutions have resorted to general optimizing software. Therefore, the detailed characteristics of the solutions and their theoretical implications have not been fully explored. In this paper, we have achieved this by a rigorous numerical approach and by retrieving all missing roots, which leads to physical mapping of fluidization regimes. The model is also extended to unsteady conditions with acceleration and simplified by employing a single stability criterion, which identifies choking as a jump between two branches of the stable solution. Calculations based on this version are in reasonable agreement with measurements on bench, pilot and commercial scale circulating fluidized beds. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

0037293194	Exploring complex systems in chemical engineering - The multi-scale methodology	Challenges in quantitative design of chemical processes mainly reside in their complex structures, which are usually multi-scale in nature, and are difficult to analyze by the average approach as commonly used. The multi-scale methodology has thus received more and more attention in recent years. There are three kinds of multi-scale methodology: Descriptive for distinguishing the phenomenological difference of structures at different scales; and correlative for formulating phenomena at higher scales by analyzing the mechanisms at lower scales; and variational for revealing the dominant mechanisms of the structure and the relationship between the scales. This paper presents an overview of multi-scale methodologies with emphasis on the variational methodology, and proposes the possibility of establishing a generalized multi-scale methodology, effective for analyzing single-phase turbulent flow in pipe, gas-solid two-phase fluidization, and gas-solid-liquid three-phase fluidization. The variational multi-scale methodology consists of the following steps: •Phenomenological resolution with respect to scales of structures. •Identification of dominant mechanisms. •Establishment of conservation conditions with respect to different scales and correlation between different scales. •Formulation of variational criterion to identify what dominates the stability of structure and what compromise exists between different dominant mechanisms. •Integration between conservation conditions with stability conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cascading simulation approaches on different scales, with small-scale approaches provide constitutional correlations to larger scale approaches, is considered a practical way toward this direction. However, by physically reproducing many macro-scale phenomena in fluid flow and fluidization on micro-scales even below the traditional continuum limit, pseudo-particle modeling (PPM, Ge and Li (Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Circulating Fluidized Bed, Beijing, China, Science Press, Beijing, 1996) has suggested the possibility of a more straightforward and penetrating way. In this paper, traditional approaches are reviewed first and then PPM is discussed in full length and validated further. We demonstrate that it has maintained all necessities on the molecular level for comprehensive flow description, and the reproduced phenomena, such as bubbling, clustering and radial heterogeneity, have reflected the fundamental mechanism of their macro-scale counterparts despite the vast scale difference. With this digital miniature, every detail of the flow can be traced non-intrusively until the lowest level in classic physics and experiment with flexible parameters, which provides a unique tool for theoretical study and engineering predictions. Therefore, PPM is at least a useful complement, if not substitute, to traditional approaches. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

84866879959	Discrete particle simulation of gas-solid two-phase flows with multi-scale CPU-GPU hybrid computation	Though discrete particle simulation (DPS) has been widely used for investigating gas-solid flows from a more detailed level as compared to traditional two-fluid models (TFMs), it is still seriously limited by the computational cost when large scale systems are simulated. GPUs (graphic processing units), with their massive parallel architecture and high floating point performance, provide new possibilities for large-scale DPS. In this paper, a multi-scale CPU (central processing unit)-GPU hybrid computation mode is developed, in which the fluid flow is computed by CPU(s) while the particle motion is computed by GPU(s). To explore its feasibility, this mode is adopted to simulate the flow structures in the fluidization of Geldart D and A particles, respectively. Further coupled with an EMMS (energy minimization multi-scale) based meso-scale model, the flow behavior in an industrial fluidized bed is finally simulated, shedding light on the engineering applications of DPS, as an alternative to TFM. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84870515946	Extending EMMS-based models to CFB boiler applications	Recently, EMMS-based models are being widely applied in simulations of high-throughput circulating fluidized beds (CFBs) with fine particles. Its use for low flux systems, such as CFB boiler (CFBB), still remains unexplored. In this work, it has been found that the original definition of cluster diameter in EMMS model is unsuitable for simulations of the CFB boiler with low solids flux. To remedy this, we propose a new model of cluster diameter. The EMMS-based drag model (EMMS/matrix model) with this revised cluster definition is validated through the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of a CFB boiler. © 2012 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this article, we try to extend the work of Kwauk and redraw the diagram by taking into account the effects of mesoscale structures on drag force closure. The generalized choking is then defined on the new diagram, which is characterized by the bistable, coexisting states in both concurrent and countercurrent flows.

84872931612	Fluidized bed simulation: Structure-dependent multiscale CFD	Meso-scale structure is key to gas-solids fluidization modeling. Traditional two-fluid model is not suitable for describing multiscale behavior in fluidized beds. In contrast, the structure-dependent multi-fluid model(SFM), which is based on the energy-minimization multi-scale(EMMS)method, takes into account the heterogeneous structure within local space(or, sub-grid structure)and hence its prediction is only weakly dependent on grid resolution, reducing greatly computing load. Based on the structural characterization of SFM, we proposed an EMMS based mass transfer model to explain why literature data scatter up to several orders of magnitude. These models were integrated into a whole set of multiscale computational fluid dynamics(CFD)method, with which we predicted the typical S-shaped axial profile of volume fraction and further revealed the "choking" mechanism and the reason why scale-up of a fluidized bed was so difficult. Currently, 3D, whole-loop, transient, reactive simulation of an industrial circulating fluidized bed could be made possible. In prospect, to realize the shift of research mode from simulation to virtual process engineering, we still need breakthrough in understanding meso-scale structures. © All Rights Reserved.

84872948578	Evaluation of drag models for cocurrent and countercurrent gas-solid flows	Gas-solid systems, whether cocurrent or countercurrent, manifest meso-scale heterogeneity to some extent. However, most of the previous modelling efforts, including the study of the effects of meso-scale structures as well as relevant drag closures, are mainly focused on cocurrent up riser flows, leaving cocurrent down and countercurrent systems less explored. In this work, by extending drift flux analysis and experimental validation for cocurrent down and countercurrent flow systems, we show that the most commonly used homogeneous drag models may be successful in a certain range of operating conditions, especially with fine-grid resolution. Fine-grid resolution is indeed helpful for reliable simulation of coexisting states, by predicting concave slip velocity curves. By comparison, the energy minimization multiscale (EMMS) drag model allows the use of much coarser grid resolution and better prediction over wider range of operating conditions. Its predictability of the overall slip velocity as well as the drift flux is nearly grid independent over the entire range of voidage. This fact leads us to the obvious advantage of saving computational time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84872969438	3-D full-loop simulation of an industrial-scale circulating fluidized-bed boiler	Three-dimensional (3-D) simulations using an Eulerian multiphase model were employed to explore flow behaviors in a full-loop industrial-scale CFB boiler with and without fluidized-bed heat exchanger (FBHE), where three solids phases were employed to roughly represent the polydisperse behavior of particles. First, a simulation of the boiler without FBHE is implemented to evaluate drag models, in terms of pressure profiles, mixing behaviors, radial velocity profiles, etc. Compared to the conventional model, the simulation using the energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) model successfully predicts the pressure profile of the furnace. Then, such method is used to simulate the boiler with FBHE. The simulation shows that solid inventory in the furnace is underpredicted and reduced with an increase of the valve opening, probably due to the underevaluated drag for FBHE flows. It is suggested to improve EMMS model which is now based on a single set of operating parameters to match with the full-loop system. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

84875634523	Influence of initial distributions on hydrodynamic simulation of gas-solids riser	Recent studies have shown that a reasonable initial distribution can significantly reduce the transition time from initialization to reaching steady state for simulation of a riser. In this work, a series of simulations were performed to study the relationship between initial conditions and simulation efficiency. The results indicated that statistically-averaged distribution could be an effective initial distribution. Then, all the flow parameters for defining this initial distribution (i.e. pressure, gas and solids velocities, voidage) were investigated respectively for sensitivity analysis. It was found that transition time could be reduced greatly if a good axial distribution of voidage was provided at the beginning of the simulation. This finding was confirmed further by a hydrodynamical simulation of gas-solids flow in a riser with EMMS (energy-minimization multi-scale) model, in which EMMS model was used to provide a reasonable axial voidage distribution as the initial condition. The relevant results, such as solids flux, were in good agreement with experimental data. © All Rights Reserved.

The structure and dimensions of the blender and other simulation conditions are set according to experimental data from literature. A parametric study on fill level and rotation rate is carried out from which optimum values are found with respect to mixing rate, productivity and energy consumption. It is also found that the standard horizontal installation of the blender results in poor axial mixing, while inclining the blender at a certain angle can enhance mixing effectively. This may be ascribed to the larger mean particles velocity and better velocity distribution under such conditions, which is confirmed to be a consistent character for relatively large-scale systems. Furthermore, the effect of operating conditions for the inclined blender is also examined. It is close to those for the standard blender but has less effect on mixing rate. © 2013.

84877043791	Dominant role of compromise between diffusion and reaction in the formation of snow-shaped vaterite	The diffusion and reaction are two general kinetic factors playing an important role in the structure development of materials. Upon diffusion limitation, a noncompact structure is easily formed, while a compact structure is usually formed in a reaction-limited condition. In this Article, we take the precipitation of calcium carbonate as an example to discover the roles of diffusion and reaction in shaping particles. By adjusting the diffusion and reaction in a three-cell reactor, we synthesize snow-shaped particles, which are a new morphology of calcium carbonate. The microscopic characterization shows that the microparticle is composed of aggregates of nanoparticles. Computer simulation suggests that the snow-shaped particle is formed in a condition that the diffusion and reaction compete to regulate the structure of particles and their compromise leads to the formation of snow-shaped morphology, which is confirmed by later experiments. The following discussion concentrates on the compromise concept to disclose its essence and role in shaping particles, which brings us a new view on the physical mechanisms governing the diversity of materials structures. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84879405493	A two-fluid smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TF-SPH) method for gas-solid fluidization	A two-fluid smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TF-SPH) method was proposed in this work for the simulation of gas-solid fluidization, which combines an Eulerian solution of the gas phase and a Lagrangian SPH solution of the solid phase. The basic governing equations of TF-SPH are the same with those of the two-fluid model (TFM). The SPH solution of the solid phase allows significant reduction of the amount of particles that is actually simulated as compared to that encountered in industrial reactors. Thus, it can be expected to speed up the simulation. The sensitivity of SPH parameters to smoothing length and its ratio to particle space was tested. Quantitative comparison was also provided against the experimental data in literature. The TF-SPH method can be expected to be a promising approach for simulation of gas-solid fluidization. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84879532667	A structure-dependent multi-fluid model (SFM) for heterogeneous gas-solid flow	For the heterogeneous gas-solid flow in a fluidized bed, meso-scale structures, such as bubble and cluster, have significant effects on the hydrodynamics, mass/heat transfer and reaction rate. These structures can be described with certain kinds of bimodal probability density distribution of solids concentration, i.e., the dilute-dense two-phase structures. To keep the physical nature of these meso-scale structures in mathematical formulation, a structure-dependent, multi-fluid model (SFM) was proposed. Then, the SFM was reduced to the conventional two-fluid model (TFM) as well as the hydrodynamic equations of the bubble-based and cluster-based EMMS (energy-minimization multi-scale) models by assuming different simplifications of structures. Thus, the SFM unifies these different models. A new version of bubble-based EMMS model was presented thereby and validated with comparison to experimental data. This bubble-based EMMS model was found to be applicable to wide flow regimes ranging from bubbling, turbulent to fast fluidization. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84879993658	Multiscale cfd simulation of multiphase process equipments - Structure-dependent multi-fluid modelling (SFM)	The multiphase reactive flow in process equipments, e.g., fluidized beds, involves complex coupling among flow, heat/mass transfer and reaction kinetics over scales ranging from molecules, sub-particle eddies up to equipments. Conventional two-fluid model (TFM) ignores the effects of meso-scale structures, and hence is not suitable for describing the intrinsically multi-scale heterogeneity within multiphase systems. To be consistent with the meso-scale structures, we proposed a structure-dependent multi-fluid model (SFM), and closed its drag force by invoking the stability condition defined in the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model. The SFM reduces to the conventional TFM if homogeneous distribution is assumed within each grid, and reverts to the original EMMS model if it is used to describe steady state, global behavior of a fluidized bed. The multi-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is characterized by coupling of TFM and EMMS drag coefficient, can then be viewed as a simplified solution of the SFM. We demonstrate that the SFM significantly improves the accuracy and at the same time enables higher efficiency by allowing for much coarser grid used than in TFM. Recent application of it in 3D, full-loop, transient simulation of industrial processes, e.g., fluid catalytic cracking, coal combustion, gasification, kaolinite clay calcinations, shows its advantages in helping design and troubleshoot multiphase process equipments.

84880512000	Stability-constrained multi-fluid CFD models for gas-liquid flow in bubble columns	We have proposed a Dual-Bubble-Size (DBS) model featuring a stability condition describing the compromise of two dominant mechanisms, and then a stability-constrained multi-fluid model (SCMF-A) integrating the DBS model into CFD simulation. This work further validates the model and extends to much higher flow rate, and then tentatively proposes a new model termed SCMF-B. It solves the conservative equations for a dense phase composed of small bubbles and liquid and a dilute phase involving large bubbles. The DBS model supplies the structure parameters of the two bubble classes such as the gas volume fraction of small bubbles, the ratio of drag coefficient to bubble diameter for large bubbles and the superficial gas velocity of large bubbles to close the SCMF-B model. A thorough comparison indicates that without any fitting parameters, the SCMF models are superior to the two-fluid model (TFM) with empirical drag correlations in the prediction of overall gas holdup, radial profile of gas holdup and liquid flow field over a wide range of operating gas velocities. By comparison, each SCMF model has its strength and weakness at different flow conditions. SCMF-B can better reproduce the plateau of overall gas holdup as a function of gas flow rate, and the relative error of radial profile of gas holdup is the smallest among all the models at relatively higher flow rate. SCMF-A is better for the lower and much higher gas flow rates. We also design a special and step-by-step strategy to ascertain the evolution from SCMF-A to SCMF-B. We find that the physical properties, flow rate and drag coefficient of different bubble classes have respective functions in the model evolution and only their synergistic effects could generate reasonable prediction. This suggests that the definition of two "fluids" in the SCMF-B in terms of the differences in dense and dilute phases, rather than the thermal physical properties, is reasonable only when all the above "external" and "internal" factors are taken into account. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880240881	Multiscale simulations of protein folding: Application to formation of secondary structures	A multiscale simulation method of protein folding is proposed, using atomic representation of protein and solvent, combing genetic algorithms to determine the key protein structures from a global view, with molecular dynamic simulations to reveal the local folding pathways, thus providing an integrated landscape of protein folding. The method is found to be superior to previously investigated global search algorithms or dynamic simulations alone. For secondary structure formation of a selected peptide, RN24, the structures and dynamics produced by this method agree well with corresponding experimental results. Three most populated conformations are observed, including hairpin, β-sheet and α-helix. The energetic barriers separating these three structures are comparable to the kinetic energy of the atoms of the peptide, implying that the transition between these states can be easily triggered by kinetic perturbations, mainly through electrostatic interactions between charged atoms. Transitions between α-helix and β-sheet should jump over at least two energy barriers and may stay in the energetic trap of hairpin. It is proposed that the structure of proteins should be jointly governed by thermodynamic and dynamic factors; free energy is not the exclusive dominant for stability of proteins. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84880631676	Lattice Boltzmann based discrete simulation for gas-solid fluidization	Discrete particle simulation, a combined approach of computational fluid dynamics and discrete methods such as DEM (discrete element method), DSMC (direct simulation Monte Carlo), SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), PIC (particle-in-cell), etc., is becoming a practical tool for exploring lab-scale gas-solid systems owing to the fast development of parallel computation. However, gas-solid coupling and the corresponding fluid flow solver remain immature. In this work, we propose a modified lattice Boltzmann approach to consider the effect of both the local solid volume fraction and the local relative velocity between particles and fluid, which is different from the traditional volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A time-driven hard sphere algorithm is combined to simulate the motion of individual particles, in which particles interact with each other via hard-sphere collisions, the collision detection and motion of particles are performed at constant time intervals. The EMMS (energy minimization multi-scale) drag is coupled with the lattice Boltzmann based discrete particle simulation to improve the accuracy. Two typical fluidization processes, namely, a single bubble injection at incipient fluidization and particle clustering in a fast fluidized bed riser, are simulated with this approach, with the results showing a good agreement with published correlations and experimental data. The capability of the approach to capture more detailed and intrinsic characteristics of particle-fluid systems is demonstrated. The method can also be used straightforward with other solid phase solvers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting with the study of particle clustering phenomenon, the EMMS (energy-minimization multiscale) model was established for gas-solid fluidization systems by analyzing the compromise between dominant mechanisms, which was then verified, and further extended to other multiphase systems. In recent years, the EMMS principle was used to define a multi-scale computation paradigm-the EMMS paradigm, featuring the structural similarity between problem, modeling, software and hardware, which was implemented by constructing a supercomputer with a capacity of 1.0 Petaflops. This paradigm was believed to be promising for realizing the virtual process engineering (VPE). The EMMS principle was also believed to be a universal one for all meso-scale phenomena, that is, could be the principle for the emerging science-Meso- science. This presentation reviews the principles, methodology, computation and application of the EMMS paradigm, and gives perspective for VPE and meso-science. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

The modeled granular materials were made of particles with same size and density but different color. We observed that the binary granular system inevitably went through a transient radial segregation state before reaching the final homogeneous mixing state. Depending on the filling degree and rotating speed, there exist totally three types of transient segregation patterns. Analysis of the flow field shows that such transient radial segregating phenomena were induced by different axial transporting characteristics of material. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84881612308	Theoretical analysis on the applicability of traditional SPH method	As a fully Lagrangian, particle-based numerical method, the traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) generally suffers from the accuracy problem. To investigate the physical origins of this numerical error, the elastic effect between SPH particles is specifically identified by analogy with physical entities, and a unique non-dimensional number is proposed to evaluate the relative dominance of viscous to elastic effect. Through the simulation of two-dimensional Couette flow, the velocity profile and arrangement of particles are examined for various ratios of viscous to elastic effect. The effective viscosity of SPH particles decreases as this non-dimensional number increases, while the increase of particle number significantly reduces the effective viscosity only at lower ratio of viscous to elastic effect. The disparity among nominal viscous dissipation, total dissipation, and theoretical dissipation further confirms the presence of unphysical dissipation resulting from the elastic effect. In summary, due to the constraints from the Mach number and the ratio of viscous to elastic effect, there exists a critical Reynolds number below which the Newtonian behavior could be approximately obtained through suitable choice of model parameters. © 2013 The Author(s).

84884361104	Coarse grid simulation of heterogeneous gas-solid flow in a CFB riser with polydisperse particles	Industrial fluidized beds usually show a wide particle size distribution which significantly affects the performance of gas-solid two-phase reactors. However, in traditional CFD models the particle size distribution is often represented by the Sauter mean diameter no matter whether the distribution is wide or narrow, which cannot reflect the effects of the particle size distribution on its operation. In this study, a simplified population balance model (PBM) is combined with two-fluid model (TFM) and the Energy Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) drag model for simulating heterogeneous gas-solid flow. The EMMS drag model is used to characterize the effects of meso-scale clustering structures on the inter-phase drag force. The current model is compared with the model with the assumption of single particle diameter, and is used to study the segregation and mixing characteristics in a riser. It was shown that (i) for the specific cases we studied, particle polydispersity has a negligible effect on the time-averaged axial solid concentration profiles but has a notable effect on the particle velocity distributions, (ii) the experimental hydrodynamics as well as segregation and mixing patterns in a riser with a continuous particle size distribution can be predicted reasonably well by present combined TFM-EMMS-PBM method. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While for the sake of simplicity, the motion of particle phase is tracked by following the hard-sphere discrete particle model (DPM).

84885320954	SPH simulation of selective withdrawal from microcavity	The selective withdrawal of weakly compressible fluids is investigated by smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with a revised model of surface tension. In our model problem, fluid is withdrawn from a two-dimensional microcavity through a narrow outlet above the interface of two immiscible fluids. The outflow boundary is implemented by a particular zone of fluid particles with prescribed velocity, together with the introduction of artificial boundary particles. Based on the average number density of fluid particles, the effective contribution of boundary particles is corrected for the compressible context. It is found that there exists a critical withdrawal rate for each initial interface height, beyond which the lower phase becomes entrained in a thin spout along with the upper phase. Besides, the Froude number with redefinition for this kind of multiphase flow could serve as a criterion of flow behavior. Furthermore, larger surface tension, smaller dynamical viscosity and density of the upper phase all lead to longer threshold time of formation of the spout state, and thus are favorable to the withdrawal of upper phase both in terms of higher efficiency and larger quantity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0141459915	Biomass. Bionergy in China	With the background of a China in continual economic growth for a long time and its associated growing need for energy impels Chinese policy among other things to accelerated development of renewable energy technologies. As the most important renewable energy carrier, biomass plays a central role in China. The discussion covers a survey of renewable energies in China; the energetic use of biomass; combustion of biomass; biomass gasification; biogas use; small-scale digester; medium and large scale digesters; generation of liquid motor fuels; and conclusion and outlook. The Chinese energy market is on its way to a world summit. About 1.3 billion people there today use 10.4 Pw-hr/yr of energy while only 20 years ago a billion people used half this amount of energy. Despite the Chinese one-child policy a number of forecasts estimate an increase in population to about 1.5 billion persons in the next 20 years. The energy increase will be 3.6%/year correlated to the increase in gross domestic product, of a further doubling of the energy need. In view of the coal dominated structure of the energy supply this growth has far reaching effects on the interest of environmental protection since unhindered climate relevant green house gases could lead worldwide to perceptible climate changes. In the list of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters, China is second to the USA. China now emits 14% of global carbon dioxide and in 2020 this share is expected to increase to about 19%. China, however, is playing a constructive role to counteract this trend. For example, since 1980 the growth of energy use is less than the growth in gross domestic product. The share of coal as primary energy is dropping versus less carbon-rich energy carriers such as natural gas. China has six sources of renewable energy, namely, hydropower, wind energy, biomass, solar energy, geothermal energy, and tidal power. The usable hydropower potential, for example, is an estimated 380 Gw. In 2000, hydropower represented about 8% of China's energy production, corresponding to installed hydropower output of 80 Gw or 21% of the usable potential. Wind energy resources in China are an estimated 1.6 Tw of which about 10% are used. About 75% of the Chinese people live in the country such that the use of biomass as a renewable energy carrier is traditionally of importance. The energy need of this region is about 600 MTCE (metric tons of carbon equivalent, where 1 MTCE is about 29.3 Gj) of which more than 33% is from biogenic energy carders. Biomass is thus ahead of hydropower and wind energy as the most significant renewable energy carrier in the country.

0042635755	Particle-fluid interaction in heterogeneous gas-solid fluidization	Drag coefficient is of crucial importance for the simulation of heterogeneous gas-solid two-phase flow with the two-fluid model. However, the correlations in the previous literature are based on the average method, and therefore not suitable for simulating the heterogeneous flow structure in fast fluidization. This paper is devoted to shedding some light on the effect of heterogeneous flow structure on drag coefficient. A new approach based on the modified energy-minimization multi-scale model is presented to calculate the drag coefficient in a control volume of computational fluid dynamics. The results indicate that the drag coefficient is much lower than that calculated from correlations based on average method, therefore showing reasonable agreement with the conclusion from experimental results.

0345330155	CFD simulation of concurrent-up gas-solid flow in circulating fluidized beds with structure-dependent drag coefficient	Meso-scale structure existing in the form of particle clusters or strands in concurrent-up gas-solid two-phase flow has been extensively corroborated in experimental research. However, its significant effects on interfacial drag coefficient are seldom taken into account in current computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations by using the two-fluid models. The energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) approach, in which the heterogeneous structure is described by the so-called multi-scale resolution and energy-minimization method, is adapted in this study for investigating the dependence of drag coefficient on structure parameters. The structure-dependent drag coefficients calculated from the EMMS approach are then incorporated into the two-fluid model to simulate the behavior of the concurrent-up gas-solid flow in a riser. Simulation results indicate that the simulated solid concentration with the Wen and Yu/Ergun drag correlations is rather dilute, leading to a more homogenous structure; while the dynamic formation and dissolution of clusters can be captured with the drag correlations derived from the EMMS approach, and the simulated outlet solid flux and voidage profile in both radial and axial directions are in reasonable agreement with experimental results, suggesting the feasibility for the EMMS approach to be used as a sub-grid closure law for drag coefficient. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

0242659857	Simulation of particle-fluid systems with macro-scale pseudo-particle modeling	Pseudo-particle modeling (PPM) is a particle method (PM) proposed in 1996. Though it is effective for the simulation of local phenomena in particle-fluid systems, its application to practical systems is still limited by computational cost. Therefore, macro-scale PPM, or MaPPM is proposed, which combines finite difference (FD) with weighted averaging techniques to upgrade particle interactions to the fluid element level. In this paper, a detailed derivation of the model is presented together with a clearer demonstration of the convergence and accuracy of the model. The approach is then applied to the problem of plane Poiseuille flow and particle-fluid suspension, resulting in a physically reasonable flow pattern.

84891894792	Three-dimensional simulation of dense suspension upflow regime in high-density CFB risers with EMMS-based two-fluid model	Dense suspension upflow (DSU) regime in high-density circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers, featuring no downward particle flux and high mean solid holdup, offers significant advantages over conventional fast fluidization, such as much less solid backmixing and higher solid holdup. While most of the previous CFD simulations are limited to the regime of fast fluidization in low-density CFB risers, it is difficult to reproduce the hydrodynamics of DSU regime using CFD simulation. In this study, a recently proposed EMMS-based two-fluid model (Wang et al., 2012. Chem. Eng. Sci. 75, 349-358), where the particle-rich dense phase and gas-rich dilute phase are treated as the two interpenetrating continua instead of treating gas and solid phases as interpenetrating continua as in standard two-fluid models, is first modified and then used to study the hydrodynamics of high-density CFB risers. Extensive simulations have been performed, and the comparison with experimental data indicated that the EMMS-based two-fluid model had the ability to correctly capture main features of the DSU regime. Therefore, present study not only provided further validation of the idea and feasibility of EMMS-based two-fluid model, but also offered new possibility to explore the hydrodynamic characteristics of DSU regime in high-density CFB risers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84894427252	Hydrodynamic modeling of gas-solid bubbling fluidization based on energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) theory	Hydrodynamic modeling of gas-solid bubbling fluidization is of significance to the development of gas-solid bubbling reactors since it still remains at the stage of experimental and empirical science. As is the role of particle clusters in gas-solid fast fluidization, gas bubbles characterize the structural heterogeneity of gas-solid bubbling fluidization, and their evolution is mainly subject to the constraints of the stability and boundary conditions of the system. By considering the expansion work of gas bubbles against the normal pressure stress in the emulsion phase, an improved necessary stability condition is proposed to close a gas-solid bubbling model. Applying the upgraded gas-solid bubbling model at the scale of vessels, the steady-state hydrodynamics of gas-solid bubbling fluidization can be reproduced without introducing bubble-specific empirical correlations such as for diameter and/or acceleration. The unified modeling of the entire gas-solid fluidization regime from bubbling to fast fluidization is performed by integrating the upgraded gas-solid bubbling model with the original energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) model. Incorporating the upgraded gas-solid bubbling model into commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software at the scale of computational cells, the unsteady-state simulation of gas-solid bubbling fluidization is realized with a higher accuracy than that based on homogeneous drag models. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84902662867	An EMMS based mixture model for turbulent fluidization	Turbulent fluidization has only been widely recognized as a distinct flow regime for the past two decades, even though it is commonly utilized in industrial fluidized-bed reactors. Relatively fewer efforts have been made to model these systems as compared to bubbling and circulting fluidized beds. In current work, we have reformulated the original EMMS model in terms of a mixture. This mixture comprises of gas and particles at micro-scale and voids and suspension phase at meso-scale. Subsequently, all properties are calculated in terms of mixture rather than individual phases. With the minimization of the objective function, the system is then solved numerically. The objective function, used to close the system of equations, is made of the energy consumption rates needed to suspend gas-particle suspension and the energy consumed due to interaction between suspension and voids. The model is then applied to simulate gas-solid turbulent fluidized bed. Results of simulations are found in good agreement with experimental data by prediction of a dense bottom and dilute top zone. A comparison of results with homogeneous drag model is also presented.

84904388334	CFD simulation of solids residence time distribution in a CFB riser	Solids residence time distribution (RTD) in circulating fluidized bed risers is a critical parameter for evaluating reactor performances, however, it is still very difficult to be predicted via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation due to the complexity of particle clustering phenomenon. This paper tries to establish an effective CFD model to reasonably predict solids RTD of gas-solids riser flows by means of properly addressing the paramount role of particle clusters in determining solids RTD. The gas-solids hydrodynamic characteristics were solved by Eulerian-Eulerian model, where an energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) drag model was applied to modify the gas-solids drag force to account for the influence of particle clusters. The motion of tracer particles was calculated using species transport equation, where the diffusion coefficient of particles, a vital parameter indicating particle diffusion capacity, was investigated thoroughly. The established CFD model was validated against the available experimental data in the literature. It was shown that axial profiles of solids volume fraction and radial profiles of solids mass flux can be well predicted with EMMS drag model, but not with homogeneous drag model. The proper prediction of bed hydrodynamics is also very crucial to the success of solids RTD simulation. On the other hand, the effect of the diffusion coefficient of particles, the magnitude of which can span a range from 10

84904820944	Meso-scale structure - A challenge of computational fluid dynamics for circulating fluidized bed risers	Multi-scale heterogeneous structures are characteristic of the concurrent-up gas-solid flow in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers, which stand for a grand challenge to accurate simulation of industrial-scale CFB risers with reasonable computational cost. Coarse-grid simulations using traditional two-fluid models (TFM), although efficient, are not accurate enough for the purpose of design and control of industrial units, while direct numerical simulations (DNS) starting from below the Kolmogorov scale and particle scale are currently unrealistic for this purpose. Coarse-grid simulations with proper sub-grid scale (SGS) models are expected to provide both reasonable accuracy and efficiency, but the closure of SGS models has been a long-lasting controversial issue. In this presentation, we review our attempts in providing such a closure with specific stability condition for flows in CFB risers on the grid scale, that is, the so-called analytical multi-scale approach and its later improvements and extensions. The resultant SGS model has been incorporated into commercial software and applied in the simulation of industrial CFB risers with various sizes and bed materials. Further extension of the model to mass transfer processes shows that superficial Reynolds number is insufficient for correlating mass transfer rate as multi-scale heterogeneity is not reflected in this criterion. The presentation will be concluded by prospects in multi-scale computational fluid dynamics of multiphase systems.

84904861767	Mesoscience in chemical engineering and virtual process engineering: Analysis and perspective	Traditional R&D modes in chemical and process engineering, featuring longer period and higher risks and cost, have become a bottleneck for the fast development of chemical and process industries. Breaking the bottleneck should be based on the mesoscience and virtual process engineering (VPE). Firstly, the scientific challenge roots in the multiscale and multilevel structures in which the mesoscales, as the key, are far from being well understood. Understanding the mesoscale complexity plays an important role in the study of structure-function relationships of materials, mixing and transfer in reactors as well as the system integration. Only by coupling the flow, mass and heat transfer as well as reactions on the mesoscales, could the multiscale structure in multiphase reactors be accurately predicted. On the other hand, the mesoscience-based VPE may become a new R&D mode in the near future, greatly shortening the time period and generating high-value and fine products. VPE bridges the gap between the mesoscience and the R&D of new technology and processes, assembling various tools, packages, knowledge database, each of which is of a certain function, and hence materializing the mesoscience and its application in R&D and upgrading the R&D capability. Traditional theories and supercomputing is inadequate to sustain the VPE. The mesoscience, however, offers an unprecedented opportunity for VPE. Involving interdisciplinary research, VPE is not only the task of computational scientist, but the mission of experimentalists, engineers and practitioners in chemical and process industries. It may also be integrated with cloud computation, enabling the advent of big data era in chemical engineering. © Copyright.

84905055524	A switch from classic crystallization to non-classic crystallization by controlling the diffusion of chemicals	Here we report a study on controlling the shape of particles by regulating the diffusion of chemicals. To change the diffusion rate of the reactive ions, we used a designed three-cell reactor in which the reactive ions were separated by porous membranes. We studied the reduction of hexachloroplatinate ions by sodium borohydride as an example. The experimental results show that control of the chemical diffusion led to the platinum product changing from cubic particles to dendritic particles. Further analysis indicates that the cubic particles were formed by the classic crystallization process via layer-wise deposition, while the dendritic particles were formed by the non-classic crystallization process through cluster aggregation. The control over the chemical diffusion prolongs the nucleation period and produces nuclei continuously, facilitating the aggregation of nuclei, which leads to the crystallization switching from the classic model to the non-classic model. The obtained results in this paper suggest that control over the chemical diffusion is a green and promising process to manipulate the structures of materials. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84905660387	A multi-scale architecture for multi-scale simulation and its application to gas-solid flows	A multi-scale hardware and software architecture implementing the EMMS (energy-minimization multi-scale) paradigm is proven to be effective in the simulation of a two-dimensional gas-solid suspension. General purpose CPUs are employed for macro-scale control and optimization, and many integrated cores (MICs) operating in multiple-instruction multiple-data mode are used for a molecular dynamics simulation of the solid particles at the meso-scale. Many cores operating in single-instruction multiple-data mode, such as general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs), are employed for direct numerical simulation of the fluid flow at the micro-scale using the lattice Boltzmann method. This architecture is also expected to be efficient for the multi-scale simulation of other complex systems. © 2013 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

84907232206	EMMS-based discrete particle method (EMMS-DPM) for simulation of gas-solid flows	Understanding the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flows is a grand challenge in mechanical and chemical engineering. The continuum-based two-fluid models (TFM) are currently not accurate enough to describe the multi-scale heterogeneity, while the discrete particle method (DPM) following the trajectory of each particle is computationally infeasible for industrial systems. Following our previous work, we report in this article a coarse-grained DPM considering the meso-scale structure based on the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model, which can be orders of magnitude faster than the traditional DPM and can take full advantage of CPU-GPU (graphics processing unit) hybrid supercomputing. The size and solids concentration of the coarse-grained particles (CGP), as well as their interactions with the gas flow (the drag) are determined by the EMMS model with a two-phase decomposition. The interactions between CGPs are determined according to the kinetic theory of granular flows (KTGF). The method is tested by simulating the onset of fluidization and the steady state flow in lab-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers with different geometries and operating conditions both in 2D and 3D. The results agree well with experiments and traditional DPM based on single particles. The prospect of this method as a higher-resolution alternative to TFM for engineering applications and even for virtual process engineering is discussed finally.

84907276430	Unification of EMMS and TFM: Structure-dependent analysis of mass, momentum and energy conservation	The two-fluid model (TFM) has been widely applied in simulation of various multiphase flow systems. In particular, for fine-particle circulating fluidization, the drag force plays a critical role whereas the classic drag models based on empirical correlations of homogeneous fluidization are found inadequate. Therefore, various approaches have been proposed in recent years to account for the effects of meso-scale structure on the drag force, in which the energy-minimization multi-scale model (EMMS) has received rapidly growing applications.However, the relationship between the TFM and EMMS has not been clarified to enable their combination. To solve this problem, we present a structure-dependent analysis of mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. This analysis is rooted in the structure-dependent multi-fluid model (SFM), which details the composition of drag forces and energy consumptions and their relationships with consideration of meso-structures. With assumption of homogeneous structures, it reduces to the TFM equations; for steady-state systems with structures, it restores the force balance equations, equal pressure drop relation and energy relationship of the EMMS. In future, the scale dependence of this analysis deserves more efforts to understand the applicability of the EMMS stability condition on different scales.

84907705506	Structure-dependent multi-fluid model for mass transfer and reactions in gas-solid fluidized beds	A fluidized bed reactor embraces complex coupling among flow, heat/mass transfer and reaction kinetics over a wide range of spatial-temporal scales, on which the meso-scale structure in forms of bubble or cluster plays the critical role. The traditional two-fluid model (TFM) is based on local equilibrium assumption and neglects the effects of sub-grid meso-scale structures, thus, it is not suitable for simulating dense, heterogeneous gas-solid riser flow. To be consistent with the meso-scale characteristics, we proposed a structure-dependent multi-fluid model (SFM). It reduces to the conventional two-fluid model (TFM) if local equilibrium or homogeneity is assumed within each grid, and reverts to the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model if it is used to describe global behavior of a fluidized bed. The multiscale CFD based on SFM and EMMS drag has been successfully applied in simulating gas-solid fluidized bed flows in recent years. In this work, we will extend such approach to the realm of reactive flows with mass transfer and reactions. The heterogeneity indexes for reaction and mass transfer are thereby defined, which may facilitate TFM-based reactive simulations with structure-dependent corrections. Two experiments of ozone decomposition in circulating fluidized beds are simulated to validate this approach with comparison to data.

10944232055	Multiscale analysis and modeling of multiphase chemical reactors	Multiphase gas-solids fluidized bed reactors are of multiscale structure, i.e. single particles, particle clusters/bubbles and reactor vessel, and of multiple physics, i.e. hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and reaction kinetics. The formation of complex structures/patterns in each regime is a result of a compromise between dominant mechanisms at multiple scales. Coupling of hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer, and reaction kinetics takes place at molecular and particle levels where conductive and convective transfer and diffusion within the internal pores of the catalyst are accompanied by the adsorption, surface reaction and desorption of reactant and product on the surface. This work first presents an overview of the general multiscale approaches, including the sequential approach, iterative/concurrent approach and the variational multiscale approach, applicable to multiphase flow and reaction systems, followed by a review on multiscale modeling of gas-solids fluidized bed reactors including bubbling/turbulent and fast fluidized bed reactors. Finally, a multiscale circulating fluidized bed reactor model is outlined in which hydrodynamics are modeled by the combined energy-minimization multiscale/two-fluid computational fluid dynamics coupled with multiscale heat and mass transfer sub-models and reaction kinetics. The interaction and compromise among dominant mechanisms are represented by the variational criterion.
