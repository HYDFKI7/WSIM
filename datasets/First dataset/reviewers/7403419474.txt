14844312020	Reinforcement of bee-plant interaction by phenolics in food	The winter-blooming plant Elsholtzia rugulosa produces nectar with high levels of phenolics, compounds known to both attract and deter flower visitors. In an effort to begin elucidating the interaction between phenolics and flower visitation to E. rugulosa by the native honey bee, Apis cerana, we investigated the effects of phenolic-laced sugar syrup on honey bees feeding behaviour. Honey bees fed more and foraged for immediate consumption when phenolics were presented in food. Foraging and feeding data suggest that phenolic-laced nectar is not an impediment to flower visitation by A. cerana on E. rugulosa; to the contrary, our data suggest that phenolics may increase flower visitation rate in this system.

18844438118	Function of Ficus in tropical rainforest ecosystem in Xishuangbanna	Figs are one of the key species in the tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna. Through offering habitats and foods to all kinds of animals, plants and microorganisms, they help to maintain the biodiversity in the tropical rainforest ecosystem. Some species of figs are stangler plants which play important roles in the succession and renovation of forests. Some of the species are pioneers which can accelerate the progress of vegetation restoration. The protection of Ficus species in the rainforest of Xishuangbanna is a critical step in maintaining the structure and function of the rainforest ecosystem. However, the overexploitation has made the tropical rainforest fragmented and resulted in significant decrease in fig population sizes and the quantity variation in species and populations of fig wasps and frugivores which feed on figs. Only the colony of Ficus was conserved, which is one of the important measures, could the whole ecosystem of the tropical rainforest be rehabilitated.

1942437577	Structure and biodiversity of insect community on syconia fruits of Ficus racemosa in tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna, China	Ficus racemosa is a keystone plant in tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan. The structure, dynamic and biodiversity of insect community on its syconia fruits were investigated in different plots located in Menglun nature reserve, ravine rainforest in the botanical garden, and secondary forest by Luosuo River. The results showed that the total number of collected insects were 184 264, belonging to 5 order, 19 families, 36 genera, and 51 species. Hymenoptera was the most dominant group, accounted for 37.3% of the total collected species. The pollinator of Ceratosolen fusciceps had huge individual quantities among Hymenoptera, and its successful pollination influenced the stability and development of F. racemosa population. In addition, the proportion of Lepidopter inspects was 31.4% , and the other 31.3% species belonged to Coleoptera, Homopter and Diptera. Through calculating diversity index, evenness index and richness of three plots, it showed that these three indexes were the highest in Menglun nature reserve, secondary in ravine rainforest, and low species diversity and richness in secondary forest by Luosuo River. The experimental results reported here showed that the insect species decreased, the individual number of common species increased, and special species reduced.

1942472026	The sex express and reproductive characters of Ficus auriculata	Ficus auriculata is a gynodioecious plant. Its pollinator is Ceratosolen emarginatus, it is highly coevolved mutualists that depended completely on each other for reproduction. Hence, their structures showed adaptive change. The female flower of Ficus auriculata varied markedly in style length. In the female inflorescence, the style of female flower was long and had some bristles; Stigma was funnelform and possessed short hairs. The structures of long-styled female flowers could prevent oviposition and be beneficial for sticking pollen. Short-styled female flowers developed in the male inflorescences, its style was smooth and suitable for laying eggs. The population of Ficus auriculata had inflorescences around the year, there were 2 peaks in production of female trees, the fruit-bearing ratio was 80%. Most male trees bore fruits from October to March of next year, the fruit-bearing ratio attained 90%. Male inflorescences mainly provide places for pollinating wasps to survive the winter, and producing enough pollination wasps to following fruit-bearing peak of female trees. In the population of Ficus auriculata, diameter of male inflorescence was larger and its developing time was longer than that of female inflorescence, which it costed 125 days to complete whole developmental period, and 78% of male inflorescences could normally be mature. However, female inflorescences only costed 80 days from pre-female to mature phases. 22% of female inflorescences could successfully produce seed because inflorescences were eaten by insects or affected by other factors. Moreover, five species of non-pollination also lived in inflorescences, they laid eggs outside fig to compete ovaries with pollinators, or parasitized pollinators. In result, the population of Ceratosolen emarginatus was restrained, and further influenced the pollination and seed production of Ficus auriculata.

21444438630	Adjustment and stabilization of sex ratio in Ceratosolen solmsi marchali	All fig-pollinating wasps share a similar life cycle. Generally some number of mated foundress wasps enter a receptive male fig, lay eggs in ovaries of flowers, then and die. The offspring finish development within the ovary. The wingless adult males first emerge from natal galls, and crawl around the interior of syconium, and mate with females still contained in galls. The mated female wasps then emerge from their galls, gather pollen, leave the syconium, and disperse to begin the cycle anew. The natural history of fig-pollinating wasps makes them well suited for the study of sex ratio evolution, especially local mate competition (LMC), and good fits have been obtained between empirical data and model preditions incorporating LMC and inbreeding effects at the population level. At present, LMC, inbreeding and haplodiploidy are generally regarded as three mechanisms of adjusting progeny sex ratio in fig wasps. Undoubtedly, the haplodiploid genetic system favors a female-biased sex ratio, and its effect is independent of any influence of LMC or inbreeding, a mother may adjust the sex ratio of her brood by fertilizing or not fertilizing eggs with sperm she stores in the spermatheca. However, LMC and inbreeding cannot explain all variation observed in sex ratios. In this study, we analyzed the impact on pollinator sex ratio of pollinator adjustment and non-pollinators. The results showed: (i) Sex ratio increases with reduced LMC intensities; (ii) The proportion of males drops with increasing foundress mating times, this being the first reported negative relationship between sex ratio and mating times; (iii) non-pollinating fig wasps did not affect the sex ratio of fig-pollinating wasps. Philotrypesis drained food resources from pollinators and starved them to death. Apocrypta bakeri parasitized pollinators or Philotrypesis and directly killed them. Though three species of non-pollinating fig wasps decreased pollinator numbers, no significant impact on pollinator sex ratio was found. Ensuring normal reproduction of fig-pollinating wasps might be a key factor that enables non-pollinating fig wasps to successfully invade the fig-pollinator mutualism system and coexist in the long term.

25844481452	Ficus and the Wasp community within Syconia in Xishuangbanna	In the tropical rainforests of Xishuangbanna the biological diversity is extremely rich, and the fig is a king of key plant species. It is the biggest tropical rainforest of China, and there has the most species of Ficus in China. There has all the 4 subgenus of Ficus, including 23 species and subspecies of Urostigma; 4 species of Pharmacosyea; 2 species and subspecies of Sycomorus, and 41 species, subspecies and variants of Ficus. Now 69 species, subspecies and var-species of Ficus was reported in Xishuangbanna, which takes 69.4% of all Ficus reported in China. There are the obligate pollinating wasp and some non-pollinating wasps in syconia. 29 species of Ficus and 30 species specific of pollinators and more than 170 species non-pollinating wasps have been identified in Xishuangbanna, while many other Ficus species and their wasp communities have not been classified because of lacking samples. Pollinating and non-pollinating wasps, which interacts each other and affect the fig-pollinator mutualism, construch the complex wasp community in syconia. The study of this community now is in primary phase, and it requires more thorough and material compositive researches of ecology, biology, genetics and molecular biology.

27744467203	Fig wasp community in the syconia of Ficus altissima	The fig wasp community in the syconia of Ficus altissima is most diverse among all the known fig wasp communities in China. We sampled 600 sampled figs in different seasons and collected 78063 wasps. We found 25 species, including 2 pollinating species and 23 non-pollinating species. They belonged to 7 families, 14 genera. Pollinators dominated the wasp community, its dominant index averaged 51. 62% for the year with the lowest value of 18. 42% in January, and sometimes even reached 100%. In a single syconium, the number of wasp species and abundance varied greatly among figs ranging between 1-8 fig wasp species, commonly 2-4 species, and 1 to 561 wasps, mostly between 100 and 200. The relative frequency of presence for different wasp species also varied among species: Eupristina sp. and Sycoscapter sp. 2 were present during the entire year, while others only appeared in particular months with low abundance. The total number of wasp species varied between 3 and 9 species during different months, with 3 high peaks in January, April and August. The abundance of pollinators correlated negatively with non-pollinators. The diversity index also had a significant negative relationship with the proportion of pollinators, but exhibited a positive relationship with the proportion of non-pollinators. In three different study sites, the species diversity and richness were low in the heavily disturbed site. However, pollinating and non-pollinating wasps responded differently to habitat disturbance. The non-pollinating wasps vanished in the disturbed habitat, whereas the pollinating population expanded sharply. In contrast, the pollinating population descended and the species and individuals of non-pollinating wasps increased with the improvement of habitat.

33744501831	The style-length of the female florets and their fate in two dioecious species of Xishuangbanna, China	Constraints and evolution are central for the resolution of conflicts between mutualism species and for the stability of mutualisms. Dioecious fig species and their specific pollinators are also in conflict on the use of fig ovaries. Here, our experiments provided some data on the female florets allocation in two dioecious fig trees. The results showed that: (1) there is a bimodal distribution in the style-length of two fig trees' female florets, moreover, the style-lengths are fairly similar and narrowly distributed in gall figs and more variation seems to occur in seed figs; (2) the styles in seed figs are a little longer than those in gall figs; (3) the pollinator's ovipositor lengths are shorter than the style-lengths in seed figs, but they are very similar to those in gall figs so that pollinators can only lay their eggs into the ovaries of gall figs, but not in seed figs; (4) the stigmas stick together, and the style is curly and flexible in seed syconia of the two fig species studied, so it is very difficult for the pollinators to find suitable ovipositing sites and lay their eggs in seed figs; (5) the variations of style-lengths are bigger in seed figs than gall figs, but they are smaller in dioecious figs than monoecious figs; (6) for Ficus cyrtophylla, about 10% styles are shorter in seed figs than those in gall figs, even shorter than ovipositor. In contrast, about 2% styles in gall figs of Ficus hispida are longer than its corresponding pollinator's ovipositor. In a word, our study suggests that the female floret's fate in these two fig species is mainly dependent on its style-length, but not all. The stigma shape and the floral organization can both also attribute to their fate in the two fig species studied. Â© Springer-Verlag 2006.

33748319577	Temporal dynamics of Ceratosolen solmsi marchali population on Ficus hispida	In this paper, fig-pollinating wasp (Ceratosolen solmsi marchali) was collected from the fig Ficus hispida in the Xishuangbanna tropical area at different time to study the temporai dynamics of its population within a natural fig, and three foundresses were introduced to a single fig in different periods to know the temporal dynamics of the population size of the fig-pollinating wasp in controlled experiments. The results showed that the population sizes of the fig-pollinating wasp were varied in different years, months and days, and the numbers of female had a greater change than those of male. Some significant differences in the means of pollinators within a single fig were observed in different years and months, and the possible limiting factors were the development status of fig trees, climate, and non-pollinating fig wasp. But, there was no significant difference in the means of pollinators within a single fig in different days of a month, which was thought to be the adjustment of the vitality and lifespan of foundresses, and the figs of different spaces. This study could provide scientific basis for controlling experiments in the future.

33947534861	The impacts of pollinating behaviour of fig wasp on its reproduction	Research was carried out on the reproductive impacts of different carry pollen process of fig-pollinating wasp of Ficus hispida in the tropical rainforest of Xishuangbanna. The results showed that the pollinator was active pollination, and the female figs just produced seeds rather than wasps, while the male figs produced wasps, and there was a seed inside male fig. The pollinator's foundresses left male-floral fig and looked for new receptive fig for reproduction. A foundress averagely made 353.93 Â± 91.72 galls, and only 283.28 Â± 101.42 wasps were able to complete life cycles. The ratio of galls and wasps was 0.26 and 0.81 respectively. In controlled experiment, a no flying foundress was introduced inside single fig, which it made 446.74 Â± 60.06 galls and finally 396.15 Â± 87.46 completed life cycles. The ratio of galls and wasps was 0.31 and 0.88 respectively. In contrast, no flying foundress always reproduced more offspring than that of flying foundress. This implies that carrying pollen and fly would increase reproductive costs of fig-pollinating wasp.

41549095584	Foreword. Fig and fig wasp biology: A perspective from the East	The papers in this volume are the result of a meeting of fig and fig wasp biologists held in China, July 2006. Here we provide an overview of current themes in fig-fig wasp research and introduce the papers in this volume. Figs are pollinated by tiny, highly specific wasps whose larvae feed on a proportion of the flowers they pollinate. Other symbionts, including a diversity of non-pollinating wasps and vertebrate fruit eaters, exploit or otherwise depend on this obligate mutualistic interaction. Recently it was found that a substantial number of fig species harbour more than one species of pollinating wasp. This has lead to renewed interest in the question of specificity and its co-evolutionary implications. There has also been a substantial increase in the interest in fig and fig wasp biology in Asia, not least in China where our meeting was held. Directly following from this is an increased interest in dioecious figs, which are predominantly Asian. Dioecious figs offer a very different perspective on the stability of the fig-fig pollinator interaction to the better studied monoecious figs. They have also radiated into a remarkable diversity of ecological niches and, therefore, promise to reveal how fig-fig wasp interactions have responded to a variety of different ecological conditions. The study of non-pollinating fig wasp communities, which are every bit as interesting as the pollinating wasps, has been hampered by difficulties in determining their life-histories. A number of the papers presented here pioneer new methods to address these difficulties, and hence promise to prise open this field. Fig and fig wasp biology appears on the cusp of rapid developments on a number of fronts, and hence fig-fig wasp biologists can look forward with excitement to the coming years. Â©2008 Balaban.

41549115591	Co-occurrence of two Eupristina species on Ficus altissima in Xishuangbanna, SW China	The fig-fig wasp mutualism has long been considered strictly species-specific. However, more and more cases of breakdown in the one-to-one rule are being documented. Here, we report on the co-existence of Eupristina altissima and Eupristina sp. in the figs of Ficus altissima in Xishuangbanna, SW China. Species coexisted on the same tree, even in the same fig. Most crops sampled during a three year survey had both species, but E. altissima was more frequent. Brood sizes, when figs were entered by a single foundress, were not significantly different between species. However, our study strongly suggests that E. altissima is an active pollinator, while Eupristina sp. does not actively pollinate Ficus altissima, as only very few seeds were observed in figs only entered by this species. Morphological analysis corroborated this finding: Eupristina sp. has reduced pollen pockets and there is no coxal comb, two morphological characters normally linked with active pollination. This is the second report of a non-pollinating agaonid fig wasp, and opens interesting perspectives on the evolution of cheating in fig pollinators. Â©2008 Balaban.

41549144966	The community structure of insects associated with figs at Xishuangbanna, China	Ficus racemosa. Ficus benjamina, Ficus auriculata and Ficus hispida are the most common fig species in primary and secondary forests at Xishuangbanna. Several different insect functional groups that utilize these figs can be recognized: pollinating fig wasps; non-pollinating fig wasps including gall-makers, parasites and inquilines; pulp eating insects; insect predators; sap feeding insects; and decomposers. We studied the structure of these insect communities on each of the four common fig species. Of 116,719 insects collected, six orders, 23 families, 40 genera, and 65 species were identified. Pollinators comprised the fewest species, but the largest number of individuals. There was an abundance of non-pollinators on monoecious figs (F. racemosa and F. benjamina). In dioecious figs, male figs harbored more non-pollinators, but female figs attracted more pulp eating insects. The position and size of inflorescences on the different fig species were important traits in determining the associated insect communities. Cauliflorous species of fig (those bearing figs on trunks and branches, rather than on the ends of twigs), and those with larger fruits, supported both individually abundant, and species-rich, insect communities. Both diversity and evenness of insect communities were higher in primary rainforest, as compared with secondary forest. Thus, fig-associated insect communities may be used as indicators of forest quality, for the purposes of the protection and restoration of tropical rainforest. Â©2008 Balaban.

58049104097	Distribution patterns of galls with different fig wasps in syconium of monoecious Ficus racemosa	Ficus racemosa Linn. is monoecious, there exist several flower layers in figs at the stage of pre-post flora. According to the pedicel length,the galls are classified into three layers: galls projected into the cavity are named as inner layer (the length of pedicel is 5.13 Â± 0.65 mm), then intermediate layer (the length of pedicel is 3.60 Â± 0.47 mm), galls next to the fig wall belong to the outer layer (the length of pedicel is 1.32 Â± 0.15 mm). The size of ovaries in the different layers are not the same, the ovaries in the inner layer are significantly bigger than those in intermediate and outer layer. The ovaries are also with the different sizes the wasps. The ovaries contained Platyneura testacea are the biggest, they are significantly larger than the others. The ovaries occupied by P. mayri are larger than those by P. agraensis and pollinators, but there exist little difference between Apocrypta westwoodi and Apocrypta sp. The distribution of ovaries contained pollinators are almost in inner and intermediate layers, but the non-pollinators are inclined to live in the outer layers. Specially, as gall-makers, P. testacea are different to other non-pollinators, they prefer live in the ovaries of inner layer,which is quite similar to pollinators.

77954242805	The reproductive success of Ficus altissima and its pollinator in a strongly seasonal environment: Xishuangbanna, Southwestern China	Fig trees (Ficus spp.) are of great ecological significance, producing fruits that are fed on by more birds and mammals than any other plants in the tropics. They are pollinated by host-specific pollinator fig wasps (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae), and their fruit phenology and reproductive success are, therefore, modulated by symbiotic fig wasps. However, there are few studies focusing on the variation of Ficus reproductive success in strongly seasonal environments. We examined the phenology and reproductive success of Ficus altissima growing in a highly seasonal climate towards the northern limit of the range of fig trees in Xishuangbanna, China. Leaf production occurred at irregular intervals throughout the year, with new leaves and syconia initiated together, producing between three and seven crops over a 3-year period. Syconia were produced in synchronous crops with asynchrony between trees. The syconia produced more seeds than pollinators, and those syconia with more seeds also produced more pollinators. Reproductive success (measured as the number of seeds and pollen-carrying agaonid females produced by each syconium) varied greatly between seasons. It was highest for crops that matured during the cooler, relatively dry periods from February to March and October to November, and was lowest during the summer months from April to August. This variation corresponded to small differences in the number of flowers in the syconia, but was mainly driven by large seasonal differences in the relative abundance of non-pollinating fig wasps.

84897093148	Ultrastructure and distribution of sensilla on the antennae of female fig wasp Eupristina sp. (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae)	In the species-specific and obligate mutualism between the fig (Moraceae: Ficus spp.) and its pollinator (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae), the continuity of lifecycle of both partners completely depends on the female pollinator's ability to detect receptive figs. To better understand the chemical location mechanism, we examined the antennae and their sensilla of the female fig pollinator Eupristina sp. using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The antennae of female Eupristina sp. are geniculated, and in total, there were seven types of sensilla found on the antennae: two types of multiporous placoid sensilla (type 1 is sausage-like and type 2 is rounded), sensilla trichodea (ST), basiconic sensilla (BS), chaetica sensilla (ChS), coeloconic sensilla (CoS), and one specialized sensillum classified as sensillum obscurum (SO). We described external morphology, abundance, distribution, ultrastructure and discussed putative functions. We inferred from their ultrastructures as chemoreceptors that two types of multiporous placoid sensilla, BS and CoS, were innervated by sensory neurons. The aporous type ST, ChS, and SO were not innervated by dendrites which may function as mechanoreceptor/proprioceptor. These results were also discussed in relation to the interaction between Eupristina sp. and its host fig. Â© 2012 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

84907964459	Ficus cornelisiana, a new species of Ficus subsection Urostigma (Moraceae) from the Sino-himalayan region	A small fig tree has been misidentified as Ficus orthoneura for a long time. However, morphologically it is distinct from F. orthoneura and F. hookeriana. Typical are the ellipsoid, puberulous receptacle and caducous basal bracts. Leaf anatomy shows a multiple epidermis with the cells in the inner layer much larger than in the outer layer and thus both layers resemble an epidermis with a separate hypodermis. The abaxial cuticle is strongly sculptured, the palisade layer shows some long subdivided cells, and enlarged lithocysts are only present abaxially. Because of these differences we hereby describe it as a new species, named in honour of Cornelis (Cees) Berg: Ficus cornelisiana.

84908269401	Fig wasps from the centre of figs have more chances to mate, more offspring and more female-biased offspring sex ratios	Pollinator fig wasps serve as useful empirical models for studies of sex ratio evolution because females adjust their offspring sex ratios in relation to the number of foundresses that share a fig. Placement of pollinator offspring within figs is not random and more centrally located flowers are more likely to support pollinator development. We compared components of fitness of female fig wasps developing in central and peripheral flowers and whether this influenced the sex ratios of their offspring. We used Ceratosolen solmsi marchali, a pollinator of the Asian dioecious fig tree, Ficus hispida. Mating frequency was determined from the number of mating holes in females' flowers. Most females mated once, but some had the opportunity to mate up to four times and multiple mating opportunities were more frequent among centrally located galls. Body size was not linked to flower location, although the females that mated most were significantly larger than others, and came from significantly larger galls. Females that had multiple mating opportunities produced more daughters but similar numbers of sons, resulting in more female-biased broods. These females are likely to have produced more offspring because of their larger size but may have also benefited from mating with more males. The results demonstrate that differences in the natal locations of foundresses can modify offspring sex ratios and obscure sex ratio adjustment in response to the number of foundresses sharing a fig.

43749114296	Sex ratio adjustment of a non-pollinating fig wasp species on Ficus semicordata in Xishuangbanna	Through controlling the number of ovipositing foundresses inside a fig, and combining with the observation of ovipositing behavior and mating behavior, this paper studied the sex ratio of Apocryptophagus sp., a species of non-pollinating fig wasps hosted on Ficus semicordata in Xishuangbanna. The results showed that female Apocryptophagus sp. started to visit the fig on the 3rd day after pollinator Ceratosolen gravelyi oviposited. Apocryptaphagus sp. oviposited on the outside of the fig, and the ovipositing lasted for 2 days. Male Apocryptophagus sp. emerged at the same time with pollinators. The males opened a small hole on the wall of gall where the females developed, and mated with the females. Mated females emerged from their development fig, and left for a new receptive fig. The sex ratio of Apocryptaphagus sp. was in agreement with local mate competition theory, i. e., it was female-biased. Meanwhile, the total number of offspring increased with increasing foundress number. In contrast, the average number of offspring per foundress decreased. At individual level, when a female laid eggs inside a fig, the sex ratio of offspring correlated negatively with the number of offspring.

47549090132	A species of fig tree and three unrelated fig wasp pollinators	Background and question: A few non-agaonid wasps can enter figs to oviposit and effectively pollinate their fig hosts. In Xishuangbanna (Yunnan, SW China), Ficus curtipes is passively pollinated by an undescribed Eupristina species (Agaonidae). Two species of non-agaonid fig wasps, Diaziella yangi and Lipothymus sp., also enter the fig to oviposit. Yet such wasps do not establish a mutualistic relationship with figs similar to that of agaonids. Why? Method: Using controlled experiments in which only one foundress per species was introduced to a fig, we compared the effect of the three wasp species on pollination. We recorded foundress distribution in the fig female floral phase, and counted the number of wasps and seeds in the male floral phase. Results: Diaziella yangi and Lipothymus sp. follow Eupristina sp. into the figs, and both non-agaonids are efficient pollinators. In nature, most figs were entered by just one species of foundress: 36% were entered by Eupristina sp. only, 8% by D. yangi only, and 3% by Lipothymus sp. only. About 28% of adult fig wasps emerging from figs were D. yangi, 4% were Lipothymus sp., and 65% were Eupristina sp.; ten other non-agaonids ovipositing from outside the fig comprised just 3% of the adult wasps that emerged from figs. Both species of fig-entering non-agaonid wasps significantly reduced the number of Eupristina sp. emerging from mature figs but had no effect on seed production. If D. yangi or Lipothymus sp. was introduced to figs containing one foundress of Eupristina sp., both non-agaonid wasps produced offspring. But without the Eupristina, D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. failed to reproduce. Diaziella yangi and Lipothymus sp. depend on the agaonid, Eupristina, to make galls. Conclusion: Because they depend on the legitimate pollinator to make galls, neither D. yangi nor Lipothymus sp. is able to replace the agaonid wasp and establish a mutualistic relationship with their host fig.

63949083079	Host pollination mode and mutualist pollinator presence: Net effect of internally ovipositing parasite in the fig-wasp mutualism	The Ficus-their specific pollinating fig wasps (Chalcidoidea, Agaonidae) interaction presents a striking example of mutualism. Figs also shelter numerous non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW) that exploit the fig-pollinator mutualism. Only a few NPFW species can enter figs to oviposit, they do not belong to the pollinating lineage Agaonidae. The internally ovipositing non-agaonid fig wasps can efficiently pollinate the Ficus species that were passively pollinated. However, there is no study to focus on the net effect of these internally ovipositing non-agaonid wasps in actively pollinated Ficus species. By collecting the data of fig wasp community and conducting controlled experiments, our results showed that internally ovipositing Diaziella bizarrea cannot effectively pollinate Ficus glaberrima, an actively pollinated monoecious fig tree. Furthermore, D. bizarrea failed to reproduce if they were introduced into figs without Eupristina sp., the regular pollinator, as all the figs aborted. Furthermore, although D. bizarrea had no effect on seed production in shared figs, it significantly reduced the number of Eupristina sp. progeny emerging from them. Thus, our experimental evidence shows that reproduction in Diaziella depends on the presence of agaonid pollinators, and whether internally ovipositing parasites can act as pollinators depends on the host fig's pollination mode (active or passive). Overall, this study and others suggest a relatively limited mutualistic role for internally ovipositing fig wasps from non-pollinator (non-Agaonidae) lineages. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag.

67649815009	Floral characteristics of Ficus curtipes and the oviposition behavior of its pollinator Fig wasp	Figwasps (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) can only develop inside the fruit (figs) offigtrees (Moraceae; Ficus spp.). Figs are hollow, rounded structures lined on the inside by numerous tiny flowers. To lay their eggs, female fig wasps enter the figs and typically walk around on a platform of stigmas (synstigma) from which they insert their ovipositors through the stigmas and down the styles before reaching the ovules, where they oviposit. Previous studies have described fig wasp oviposition behavior in those Ficus species with a synstigma and have related ovipositor lengths to style lengths accordingly. Here, we show that this oviposition pattern is not universal within Ficus and that variation in fig architecture leads to the modification of oviposition behavior. Figs of the monoecious Asian fig tree F. curtipes and relatives (subsection Conosycea) lack a synstigma, which is replaced by an irregular mass of elongate stigmas. The ovipositor of the pollinator Eupristina sp. is sufficiently long to reach all the ovules. Despite this, and unlike other fig wasps, they do not oviposit via the top of the stigmas, but insert their ovipositors through the stigmal bases. Oviposition behavior in fig wasps is therefore responsive to variation in floral structure within their host figs.

70349438913	Disturbance effects on community structure of Ficus tinctoria fig wasps in Xishuangbanna, China: Implications for the fig/fig wasp mutualism	Fig trees are important components of tropical forests, because their fruits are eaten by so many vertebrates, but they depend on pollinating fig wasps to produce mature fruits. Disturbance to habitat structure can have a major impact on insect diversity and composition, potentially reducing fruit yields. We investigated the impact of habitat disturbance on the fig wasp community associated with male figs of Ficus tinctoria in Xishuangbanna, China. The community comprised one pollinator species Liporrhopalum gibbosae and six non-pollinating wasp species: Sycoscapter sp.1, Philotrypesis ravii, Philotrypesis sp.1, Neosycophila omeomorpha, Sycophila sp.1, and Walkerella sp.1. More disturbed areas were characterized by higher temperatures, less shade, and more vehicle noise. The response of the fig wasp community was complex, with no simple relationship between intensity of disturbance and pollinator abundance. However, the sex ratios (proportion of male progeny) of pollinators increased significantly in more disturbed areas. We conclude that potential changes in fig wasp community composition brought about by disturbance, are unpredictable, with unclear consequences for tropical rainforest biodiversity.

70350708474	The comparison of three fig wasp pollinators and their pollination efficiency on Ficus curtipes	Figs and fig-pollination wasps (Agaonidae) are highly coevolved mutualists that depend completely on each other for continued reproduction. A few non-agaonid wasps can enter figs to oviposit and effectively pollinate their fig hosts. However, there are few studies that compare the pollination efficiency of agaonid and non-agaonid wasps. In Xishuangbanna, Ficus curtipes is monoecious, and is typically pollinated by agaonid Eupristina sp. Two species of nonagaonid wasps Diaziella yangi and Lipothymus sp. also enter the fig to oviposit and can effect pollination. These wasps are specific and strictly dependent on the fig for their development. The pollination efficiencies of the three species of fig wasps were compared in this study. We collected the data from natural populations and combined these with introduction experiments of the three species of fig wasps. We compared the contribution of three fig wasps to the seed production of F. curtipes. The results showed that the number of three fig wasps trapped in the fig cavity was usually one. However, as the number of conspecific foundresses per fruit increased, the number of seeds produced increased. Sometimes the pollination efficiency of D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. was even higher than that of Eupristina sp. When one Eupristina sp. and one non-agaonid wasp were introduced to enter a fig at the same time, the seed production did not significantly increase and the number of seeds was close to that when only one foundress of Eupristina sp. entered. This implied that D. yangi or Lipothymus sp. did not increase the pollination efficiency. When comparing the pollination efficiency of three fig wasps in one- and two-foundress broods, in two-foundress brood the average pollination efficiency of Eupristina sp. and Lipothymus sp. decreased, but that of D. yangi increased. The differences of pollination efficiency possibly result from different interactions between three fig wasps and the host Ficus. The results will be useful for further studying the mutualism origin of the fig-fig wasp interaction.

77649243723	Ultrastructure of antennal sensilla of female ceratosolen solmsi marchali (hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: agaonidae: Agaoninae)	Fig-pollinating wasps are phytophagous wasps that mainly use olfaction to locate their fig (Ficus L., Moraceae) hosts. To provide a morphological framework for studying agaonid olfaction, we examined the antennal sensilla of female Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We identified and characterized (ultrastructure, distribution, abundance, and position) 13 types of sensilla: multiporous placoid sensilla (types 1 and 2), basiconic sensilla (types 1 and 2), basiconic capitate peg sensilla, sensilla chaetica (types 1-3), sensilla trichodea, sensilla coeloconica (types 1-3), and one specialized sensillum regarded as a sensillum obscurum. We suggest that five types are chemoreceptors because they are porous and innervated by multiple sensory neurons. Sensilla coeloconica type 1 may also function as chemoreceptors, based on external morphology. Other sensilla may be involved in mechanoreception, thermo- and (or) hygro-reception, or pressure detection. We discuss our results in relation to the lifestyle of C. solmsi marchali.

77950864173	Coevolution of reproductive characteristics in three dioecious fig species and their pollinator wasps	This study investigates dioecious fig species using a pollinator introduction experiment. Our aims were to determine: (1) whether there was a significant difference in foundress distribution between sexes per fig species; (2) whether fig size and foundress number affect reproductive success of dioecious figs; and (3) who is the 'controlling partner' in the fig/pollinator mutualism. Three dioecious fig species: Ficus semicordata, Ficus hispida and Ficus tinctoria from Xishuangbanna, China, were selected for this experiment. We found that there was no significant difference of the foundress number in female and male figs of F. semicordata, F. hispida and F. tinctoria. Also, the foundress number did not depend on the fig diameter. The numbers and the proportions of fig seeds and female wasp offspring significantly increased with more foundresses; and fig seed number was significantly higher than female wasp offspring in F. semicordata and F. hispida, but not in F. tinctoria. Our results indicate that figs are generally the 'controlling partner' in fig-wasp mutualisms in species with large figs, but not with small figs. Compared with published studies of reproductive success in monoecious figs, the dioecious figs seem to be more efficient in producing both seeds and wasp offspring when there is a high number of foundress.

78049257814	Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. associated with Theobroma cacao and other plants in PanamÃ¡: Multilocus phylogenies distinguish host-associated pathogens from asymptomatic endophytes	Colletotrichum interacts with numerous plant species overtly as symptomatic pathogens and cryptically as asymptomatic endophytes. It is not known whether these contrasting ecological modes are optional strategies expressed by individual Colleto-trichum species or whether a species' ecology is explicitly pathogenic or endophytic. We explored this question by inferring relationships among 77 C. gloeosporioides s.l. strains isolated from asymptomatic leaves and from anthracnose lesions on leaves and fruits of Theobroma cacao (cacao) and other plants from PanamÃ¡. ITS and 5'-tef1 were used to assess diversity and to delineate operational taxonomic units for multilocus phylogenetic analysis. The ITS and 5'-tef1 screens concordantly resolved four strongly supported lineages, clades A-D: Clade A includes the ex type of C. gloeosporioides, clade B includes the ex type ITS sequence of C. boninense, and clades C and D are unidentified. The ITS yielded limited resolution and support within all clades, in particular the C. gloeosporioides clade (A), the focal lineage dealt with in this study. In contrast the 5'-tef1 screen differentiated nine distinctive haplotype subgroups within the C. gloeosporioides clade that were concordant with phylogenetic terminals resolved in a five-locus nuclear phylogeny. Among these were two phylogenetic species associated with symptomatic infections specific to either cacao or mango and five phylogenetic species isolated principally as asymptomatic infections from cacao and other plant hosts. We formally describe two new species, C. tropicale and C. ignotum, that are frequent asymptomatic associates of cacao and other Neotropical plant species, and epitypify C. theobromicola, which is associated with foliar and fruit anthracnose lesions of cacao. Asymptomatic Colletotrichum strains isolated from cacao plants grown in China included six distinct C. gloeosporioides clade taxa, only one of which is known to occur in the Neotropics.

78149416686	Comparison of reproductive strategies in two externally ovipositing non-pollinating fig wasps	The reproductive strategies of Walkerella sp.1 associated with Ficus curtipes and Walkerella sp.2 associated with Ficus benjamina were investigated. Both species oviposited from outside the fig wall. Walkerella sp.1 was the first non-pollinating fig to oviposit on Ficus curtipes and began to do this ten days after figs syconia began to develop. The larvae of Walkerella sp.1 were only found in the most external ovary layer of the fig. Walkerella sp.2 starts ovipositing after several other non-pollinating fig wasps have already laid their eggs in F. benjamina. The progeny of Walkerella sp.2 are distributed in the external ovary layer, the middle ovary layer, and/or the inner ovary layer of the figs. However, more than a quarter of the offspring were found in the most external layer and only a few in the inner layer. Experimental studies proved that the two Walkerella species are gall formers. In both manipulated figs and in natural figs, the sex ratios of Walkerella sp.1 and Walkerella sp.2 were female-biased. In Walkerella sp.2, the overall sex ratio increased with the proportion of figs parasitized in a crop, but this was not the case for Walkerella sp.1. Females of both Walkerella species appear not to have information about the patches on which they oviposit because sex ratios of both species decreased as brood sizes within individual figs increased and foundresses of both species were able to lay clutches containing a single male egg and several female eggs.

78349283381	Reproductive strategies of two forms of flightless males in a non-pollinating fig wasp under partial local mate competition	The underlying basis of alternative male reproductive strategies is either genetic or environmental. Several non-pollinating fig wasp lineages have dimorphic males, typically with winged males that disperse from natal figs to mate and flightless males that seek mating opportunities in natal figs.Walkerella sp. from Ficus benjamina has dark and pale wingless males. Observations and experiments in Xishuangbanna, Southern China found that (i) the sex ratio of Walkerella sp. did not vary with foundress number or brood size. (ii) The frequency of dark males increased with brood size and foundress number and they were absent from figs with a single foundress. This produced a higher proportion of dark males at higher densities. (iii) Males of both morphs fought, but injuries to dark males were more frequent. (iv) Dark males were more likely to disperse away from their natal figs and (v) they were more resistant to dehydration.Responses to selection are constrained by the genetic options available. Consequently, selection pressures acting on different lineages can produce similar outcomes that are achieved in different ways. Walkerella species lack winged males, but dark males display some of their features, dispersing from natal figs and displaying appropriate physiological and behavioural adaptations. However, dark males also displayed increased levels of damage from fighting - a feature unlikely to be shared with the winged males of other species. Â© 2010 The Authors.

78650620550	Ecology of parasite Sycophilomorpha sp. on Ficus altissima and its effect on the fig-fig wasp mutualism	Figs and their pollinating wasps are a classic example of an obligate mutualism. In addition, figs are parasitized by a suite of non-mutualistic wasps whose basic ecology is largely undescribed. Sycophilomorpha (subfamily Epichrysomallinae) fig wasps are ovule gallers and the genus contains only 1 described species. An undescribed Sycophilomorpha species parasitized Ficus altissima at Xishuangbana, Southwestern China. The wasp was observed ovipositing on the tiny immature figs that were still concealed beneath the involucral bracts. A Sycophilomorpha wasp oviposited on more than 1 fig and spent long time-periods to lay large clutches on a single fig. The wasps naturally occurred on all 7 sampled trees, but the occurrence of wasps was significantly different among trees, crops and months. These wasps were able to prevent unpollinated figs from being aborted, and their offspring were able to develop in the figs that otherwise had no pollinator wasps or seeds. The Sycophilomorpha wasp had a detrimental effect on the fig-fig wasp mutualism. Figs in which Sycophilomorpha wasps were present, produced significantly fewer seeds, pollinators and cheaters. However, the abundance of Sycophilomorpha in a fig was only significantly negatively correlated with pollinator production and not seed or cheater production. Our study illustrates a previously unknown fig wasp niche and expands our understanding of factors that can affect the fig-fig wasp interaction. Â© Cambridge University Press 2010.

79551512810	Body size in a pollinating fig wasp and implications for stability in a fig-pollinator mutualism	The fig-fig pollinator association is a classic case of an obligate mutualism. Fig-pollinating wasps often have to fly long distances from their natal syconia to a receptive syconium and then must enter the narrow ostiole of the syconium to reproduce. Large wasps are expected to have a greater chance of reaching a receptive syconium. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and then examined whether the ostiole selectively prevented larger pollinators from entering the syconial cavity. In Xishuangbanna, China, Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) pollinates the dioecious syconia of Ficus hispida L. (Moraceae). The body size of newly emerged wasps and wasps arriving at receptive syconia were compared. Wasps arriving at receptive syconia were significantly larger than newly emerged wasps. We also compared the size of wasps trapped in the ostiole with those in the cavity. Wasps trapped in the ostiole were significantly larger than those in the syconial cavity. Thus, in the case of F. hispida, large wasps were more likely to reach receptive syconia, but the ostiole limited maximum fig wasp size. This indicates that the ostiole, as a selective filter to pollinators, stabilizes pollinator size. Hence, it helps to maintain stability in the fig-fig pollinator mutualism. Â© 2011 The Authors.

79851476021	Ethnomycological use of medicinal chinese caterpillar fungus, Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk.) G. H. Sung et al. (ascomycetes) in Northern Yunnan Province, SW China	Ophiocordyceps sinensis is a well-known medicinal mushroom in traditional oriental medicine such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM). It is endemic to alpine habitats on the Tibetan Plateau, located predominantly in Tibet and Tibetan autonomous prefectures of neighboring Provinces and the high Himalayas. This area includes parts of Northern Yunnan, but is inhabited by other ethnic groups. Although ethnopharmacological use among Tibetan people has been researched, such studies among other ethnic peoples are limited. This study aims to review the traditional uses of caterpillar fungus among Bai, Naxi, Lisu and Tibetan people living in the mountainous Northern Yunnan Province. Ethnomycological survey methods, interviews, participatory action research and field visits were conducted to elicit information on the uses of caterpillar fungus. In this paper, we have presented this traditional knowledge about collection, discovery, protection, and nutritional value, learned from these indigenous peoples. Of special interest is the range of diseases treated with O. sinensis and the corresponding methods of application. Furthermore, the diverse ethnic groups examined each have their own unique legends regarding O. sinensis. Â© 2010 Begell House, Inc.

79956261834	The mating behaviors of the non-pollinating fig wasps of Ficus curtipes	Ficus and their species-specific pollinator wasps (Agaonidae) exhibit a remarkable obligate mutualism. Fig trees are typically pollinated only by female agaonids, whose offspring feed on the ovules of the plant. Figs also shelter numerous other, unrelated, fig wasps that usually exploit the fig pollinator mutualism. Ficus curtipes Corner is a monoecious strangler fig tree. At Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, 9493 individual fig wasps were reared from 100 figs (syconia). They included one species of agaonid wasp and five unrelated fig wasps. The agaonid Eupristina sp. was represented by 45% of the individuals, Diaziella yangi van Noort & Rasplus by 46% and the remaining 9% by Lipothymus sp., Philotrypesis sp., Sycobia sp. and Sycoscopter sp. Females of the first three species enter the figs to oviposit whereas the others lay their eggs from the outside of the figs. In this study, the order of emergence of the fig wasps from their natal figs and their mating behavior were recorded. They followed a strict sequence of emergence, with Sycobia sp. emerging first, then Lipothymus sp., followed by Diaziella yangi. Eupristina sp., Philotrypesis sp. and Sycoscopter sp. emerged last. Contrary to expectations, the mating sites of the five species of non-agaonid fig wasps were not always linked to the presence or absence of wings in the males. D. yangi (with winged males) mated mostly inside the figs and its males engaged in fatal fights for mating opportunities. Male Lipothymus sp. (with wingless males), mated both inside and outside the figs whereas male Sycobia sp. (with winged males) only mated outside. Males of Philotrypesis sp. and Sycoscopter sp. (both with wingless males), only mated inside the figs. Fig wasps often display highly female-biased sex ratios linked to local mate competition. D. yangi, despite having winged males, mated mainly inside the figs, which is likely to influence its optimal sex ratio. The presence of wings in male fig wasps is therefore not a good predictor of mating sites, nor sex ratio.

0036320910	Pollination biology of Ficus hispida in the tropical rainforests of Xishuangbanna, China	Ficus hispida L. (Moraceae) is a remarkable species in the ecosystem of tropical rainforests in Xishuangbanna, China. The figs and fig-pollination wasps (Chalcidoidae: Agaonidae) are highly co-evolved mutualists that depend completely on each other for propagating descendants. Pollination of all fig species is done by fig wasps; their unique symbiotic associates, the fig wasps, cannot develop in anywhere except in the fig syconia. The present paper reports on the biology and flowering phenology of F. hispida, as well as the propagation character and pollination behavior of the fig wasps (Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr) based on our observations in the rainforests of Xishuangbanna, southern Yunnan of China. F. hispida is a dioecious tree that annually blossoms and bears fruits 6 - 8 times, with four to five fruit-bearing peaks. The male trees produce pollen and provide fig wasps with reproductive havens, while the female trees produce fig seeds after pollination by the female wasps. Pollen of F. hispida cannot escape from the dehiscent anthers until they are disturbed by fig wasps. The female wasps open the anthers and collect pollen with their antennal scrapes, mandibles and legs, and then carry pollen to the female receptive syconia where fertilization takes place. Meanwhile, some of the female wasps lay eggs in the male receptive syconia. It takes about 3 - 67 min to search for the receptive syconia for pollination, and 15 - 23 h to enter the female receptive syconia. The number of female wasps entering a syconium has close relation with the impregnation and seed-bearing rate of female flowers, as well as the oviposition and reproduction rate of the fig wasps themselves. F. hispida is endowed with a relatively high level of seed bearing (54.1% - 82.5%, average 73.8%). The wasps oviposition rate on the male flowers is between 72.3% and 93.8% with a mean of 84.4%.

79960929218	Comparison of habitats and seasonally differentiated distribution patterns of fig wasp populations associated with Ficus racemosa in Xishuangbanna	The population distribution patterns of fig wasps associated with Ficus racemosa in Xishuangbanna were studied by using several indexes. The results indicated that the distribution patterns of 6 fig wasp species were all clump. The aggregative intensity of pollinating wasp (Ceratosolen fusciceps ) population at primeval rain forest was nearly equal to that at seriously disturbed site, whereas they were both much higher than that at moderately disturbed site. In the meanwhile, the population aggregative intensity for the same wasp species was higher in rainy season than in dry-hot season, and the lowest was occurred in foggy-cool season. Non-pollinating wasp (Platyneura testacea, Platyneura mayri, Platyneura agraensis, Apocrypta westwoodi, Apocrypta sp. ) population and each of their sex group were varied significantly in aggregative intensity, responding to the habitat change and seasonal alteration. The protection of original habitat should be focused on the protection of the mutualism of Ficus racemosa and fig wasps.

81055140472	The impact of a gall midge on the reproductive success of Ficus benjamina, a potentially invasive fig tree	Fig trees (Ficus spp.) are popular ornamental trees that are entirely dependent on a mutalistic association with host-specific pollinating fig wasps for reproduction. They can become naturalized and invasive in countries where the associated pollinator is also established. Figs (syconia) are also also utilized by a diverse community of organisms that are potentially detrimental to the pollinators or seed production. Ficus benjamina is a widely-planted fig tree with the ability to establish outside its native range. We examined the impact of an undescribed gall midge species associated with F. benjamina within the plant's natural range in Xishuangbanna, south-western China. Observations on the levels of abundance of the midge together with fig abortion and seed germination rates showed that the gall midge had a strong negative effect on reproduction. The gall midge reduced pollinator survival and at high densities eliminated all pollinators, due primarily to premature abortion of figs. Seed numbers were only reduced at high gall midge densities, but seed quality, as measured by germination success and root growth rates, was greatly reduced whenever the gall midge was present. Within its presumed natural range the gall midge appears to be host specific, and given its dramatic impact on host reproductive success, is a potential candidate for the biological control of F. benjamina.

84857234933	Phylogenetic analyses suggest a hybrid origin of the figs (Moraceae: Ficus) that are endemic to the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, Japan	The Ogasawara Islands are oceanic islands and harbor a unique endemic flora. There are three fig species (Ficus boninsimae, F. nishimurae and F. iidaiana) endemic to the Ogasawara Islands, and these species have been considered to be closely related to Ficus erecta, and to have diverged within the islands. However, this hypothesis remains uncertain. To investigate this issue, we assessed the phylogenetic relationships of the Ogasawara figs and their close relatives occurring in Japan, Taiwan and South China based on six plastid genome regions, nuclear ITS region and two nuclear genes. The plastid genome-based tree indicated a close relationship between the Ogasawara figs and F. erecta, whereas some of the nuclear gene-based trees suggested this relationship was not so close. In addition, the phylogenetic analyses of the pollinating wasps associated with these fig species based on the nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial cytB genes suggested that the fig-pollinating wasps of F. erecta are not sister to those of the Ogasawara figs These results suggest the occurrence of an early hybridization event(s) in the lineage leading to the Ogasawara figs.

84859564522	Costs of inflorescence longevity for an Asian fig tree and its pollinator	In ecological situations where interactions between two species are to their mutual benefit, traits are expected to evolve to maximise the value of the timing of their encounters. Plants that depend on animals for pollination vary in the longevity of their flowers and also in how the quality of the rewards they offer varies in flowers of different ages. However, costs of floral longevity are rarely studied. Using field experiments with Ficus semicordata, a SE Asian dioecious fig tree, we examined sexual differences in syconium ageing, how the reproductive success of the plant and its pollinator change with syconium age and whether these changes are reflected in pollinator preferences. Un-pollinated syconia remained receptive to their host-specific pollinators for long periods, but eventually abort. Compared with male syconia, un-pollinated female syconia aborted more quickly and lost their ability to attract pollinators more quickly. Older pollinated female syconia were also more likely to abort. Further, declines in productivity with syconium age were also more apparent in female syconia, though older male syconia also produced fewer, smaller wasp offspring. The longevity costs are reflected in pollinator preferences. This suggests that sexual differences in duration of receptivity may be adaptive and a component of the reproductive strategies. It also indicates that placing fig wasps onto older syconia over-estimates their likelihood of being pollinated under natural conditions and prolonged receptivity increases the likelihood of pollination at the cost of reduced productivity with syconium age. This opens interesting perspectives on the co-evolution of this inter-specific interaction. Â© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84860589049	Portable microsatellite primers for Ficus (Moraceae)	Premise of the study: Highly portable microsatellite primers were developed for Ficus to facilitate investigation of genetic structure of complete regional floras using a single set of markers. Methods and Results: Pyrosequencing of five species of Ficus produced a library of 5723 potential primers. Potential primers found in at least two species and presenting identical annealing temperatures were tested on a set of five additional Ficus species. A set of 20 primer pairs producing well-defined and easily readable peaks was retained and tests showed their potential utility for analyzing population genetic structure of 24 Ficus species from Taiwan. Numbers of alleles per locus ranged from one to six in the least variable species and from one to 17 in the most variable species. Conclusions: The results indicate that our set of primers can be used to analyze polymorphism and compare levels of polymorphism among Ficus species. Â© 2012 Botanical Society of America.

84863683699	Exchange of hosts: Can agaonid fig wasps reproduce successfully in the figs of non-host ficus?	In the obligate mutualism between figs (Ficus) and their specific pollinators (Chalcidoidea, Agaonidae), each species of fig wasp typically reproduces in figs of a single host species. Host specificity is maintained largely because pollinators are attracted to tree-specific volatiles released from their host figs, but whether the wasps can reproduce if they enter figs of non-host species is unclear. We investigated the reproductive success of Ceratosolen emarginatus (associated with Ficus auriculata) and Ceratosolen sp. (associated with F. hainanensis) in atypical hosts by experimentally introducing foundresses into host and non-host figs. F. auriculata figs entered by Ceratosolen sp. were more likely to abort than if entered by C. emarginatus, but abortion of F. hainanensis figs was not affected by pollinator species. Single C. emarginatus foundresses produced more but smaller offspring in F. hainanensis than in their normal host. Conversely Ceratosolen sp. produced fewer but larger offspring in F. auriculata than in their normal host, probably as a result of having longer to develop. Mean style length differences, relative to the lengths of the wasps' ovipositors, may have dictated the number of offspring produced, with oviposition made easier by the shorter styles in F. hainanensis figs. Our results imply that, in addition to morphological constraints and tree-specific volatiles, reduced reproductive success in atypical hosts can be another factor maintaining host specificity, but for other species only behavioural changes are required for host switching to occur.

84866181935	An Extreme case of plant-insect codiversification: Figs and fig-pollinating wasps	It is thought that speciation in phytophagous insects is often due to colonization of novel host plants, because radiations of plant and insect lineages are typically asynchronous. Recent phylogenetic comparisons have supported this model of diversification for both insect herbivores and specialized pollinators. An exceptional case where contemporaneous plant-insect diversification might be expected is the obligate mutualism between fig trees (Ficus species, Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps (Agaonidae, Hymenoptera). The ubiquity and ecological significance of this mutualism in tropical and subtropical ecosystems has long intrigued biologists, but the systematic challenge posed by 750 interacting species pairs has hindered progress toward understanding its evolutionary history. In particular, taxon sampling and analytical tools have been insufficient for large-scale cophylogenetic analyses. Here, we sampled nearly 200 interacting pairs of fig and wasp species from across the globe. Two supermatrices were assembled: on an average, wasps had sequences from 77 of 6 genes (5.6 kb), figs had sequences from 60% of 5 genes (5.5 kb), and overall 850 new DNA sequences were generated for this study.We also developed a newanalytical tool, Jane 2, for event-based phylogenetic reconciliation analysis of very large data sets. Separate Bayesian phylogenetic analyses for figs and fig wasps under relaxed molecular clock assumptions indicate Cretaceous diversification of crown groups and contemporaneous divergence for nearly half of all fig and pollinator lineages. Event-based cophylogenetic analyses further support the codiversification hypothesis. Biogeographic analyses indicate that the present-day distribution of fig and pollinator lineages is consistent with a Eurasian origin and subsequent dispersal, ather than with Gondwanan vicariance. Overall, our findings indicate that the fig-pollinator mutualism represents an extreme case among plant-insect interactions of coordinated dispersal and long-term codiversification.

0036983793	Insect communities of Ficus auriculata and Ficus hispida	Ficus auriculata Lour and Ficus hispida Linn are important plant species in the tropical rainforest. They provide foods and habitats for insects, birds and so on. 20 088 samples of insects have been collected, including 8 orders, 21 families, 33 genera and 39 species on the F. auriculata and 7 orders, 21 families, 32 genera and 37 species on the F. hispida. Common characteristics of insect communities show that pests species is abundant, the ratio is 94.6%â¼97.0%, but amount per species are limited and they belong mainly too Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Homopyera etc. Some insects not only eat fig fruits but also eat leaves, other eat leaves or branches. In these insect communities, insects species are the most on the syconia, the ratio is about 54%, and amount is 93.1%â¼94.3%. On the contrary, though species of beneficial insects are low, they have huge individual quantities. The amount of pollination fig-wasp is 86.4%â¼90.2% of all insects, and its successful pollination influences stability and development of fig-trees communities.

84869093865	'Push' and 'pull' responses by fig wasps to volatiles released by their host figs	In the specific mutualism between fig trees (Ficus) and their obligate pollinating fig wasps (Agaonidae), it is crucial that fig wasps can recognize the developmental stages of their host figs. However, the responses of fig wasps to volatiles released from figs during their developmental phases are less clearly understood and are the focus of this study. We extracted and identified the volatiles released from the figs of Ficus curtipes throughout their development. Using Y-tube choice experiments, we also compared the behavioural responses of the tree's pollinator (Eupristina sp.) to figs at different developmental stages, and compared these results to those obtained by trapping fig wasps as they arrived at a tree with a developing fig crop. The chemical composition of the fig volatiles changed during fig development with the blends exhibiting clear segregation among figs at different developmental phases. Male phase figs had the most distinct blend. Fig wasp females were preferentially attracted to receptive figs, but figs at most other developmental phases were also attractive. Conversely, male phase figs had a repellent effect. These results were supported by the behaviour of the wasps under natural conditions, with small numbers of fig wasps arriving at the tree before and after receptive figs were present. These results indicate a more complex relationship between fig volatiles and fig wasp behaviour than previously realized, with volatiles mediating both the initial meeting of the mutualists to achieve pollination and egg laying and the subsequent departure of the next generation of fig wasps.

84868465392	Age at pollination modifies relative male and female reproductive success in a monoecious fig tree	Plants that depend on a single species of insect pollinator must often contend with infrequent and unpredictable visitation. Prolongation of floral receptivity comes at the cost of reduced male and/or female reproductive success among older flowers. Fig trees (Ficus spp.) have a highly specific pollination symbiosis and individual inflorescences (syconia) that remain receptive for days or weeks. Reproductive success in monoecious fig trees involves production of both seeds and fig wasp offspring. We assessed whether the reproductive output of individual syconia changes with the length of time they waited for pollination, and whether the relative female and male reproductive success also changes. A pollination experiment was conducted in an SE Asian monoecious fig tree Ficus curtipes, in which receptive syconia were covered with mesh bags to exclude wasps and pollinated by single pollinators of this fig tree at their different receptive ages. When the syconia matured their size and contents were recorded. Seed quality was also assessed. The results showed that pollinators entered syconia that had been waiting for up to 36 days. The frequencies of abortions among syconia pollinated at different ages were low throughout. The number of un-utilised flowers increased progressively in older syconia. Seed production was highest in syconia entered on the first day of receptivity, whereas pollinator production peaked in syconia pollinated on day 12, then declined in older syconia. Consequently, overall reproductive efficiency declined with syconium age and floral sex allocation became more male-biased in older syconia. Older syconia also produced lighter seeds. These results suggest that un-pollinated syconia of F. curtipes can remain receptive for several weeks. This makes pollination of each syconium more likely, but at the cost of reduced productivity and with more ovules allocated to male function. However, the prolongation of floral receptivity has significance for the co-adaptation between syconia and fig wasps and for the evolution of the fig tree-fig wasp symbiosis.

84880281784	Secondary galling: A novel feeding strategy among 'non-pollinating' fig wasps from Ficus curtipes	The interaction between pollinator fig wasps (Agaonidae) and their host fig trees (Ficus) is a striking example of an obligate plant-insect mutualism, but figs also support numerous 'parasites' of the mutualism. Female agaonids (foundresses) lay their eggs in shorter-styled flowers, whereas longer-styled flowers produce seeds. A few 'non-pollinating' fig wasps (NPFWs) can also enter figs to oviposit Fig wasp oviposition site choice and larval biology in figs of an Asian monoecious species, Ficus curtipes Corner, were recorded where two NPFW species oviposit inside the figs, such as the agaonid. Eupristina sp. agaonids chose flowers in proportion to their availability, rather than preferring to oviposit in shorter-styled flowers. Diaziella yangi van Noort & Rasplus and Lipothymus sp. (Pteromalidae) foundresses followed Eupristina sp. into receptive figs and laid their eggs entirely in flowers that already contained pollinator eggs. This indicates that both NPFWs are inquilines under the widely-used terminology in the fig wasp literature, because they utilise galls generated by the pollinators. However, their adult bodies and galls were larger than those of the pollinators, showing that they independently stimulate ovule growth. These species are better described as secondary gallers that modify galls previously generated by the pollinators and kill these primary gallers. Use of the term 'inquiline' among NPFWs inadequately and often inappropriately describes their biology. No known NPFWs are inquilines in the strict sense that they do not harm their hosts. 'Primary gallers', 'secondary gallers', 'seed predators', and 'parasitoids' describe their biology more accurately. Â© 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.

84883624230	Description of two new species of Walkerella (Pteromalidae, Otitesellinae) from China with a key to species of the genus	Walkerella is an Old World genus of non-pollinating fig wasps in the subfamily Otitesellinae (Chalcidoidea, Pteromalidae). It is the most widely distributed genus of the subfamily, though there has been only six known world species. This paper describes two new species associated with the host Ficus subsection Conosycea of section Urostigma, subgenus Urostigma in Xishuangbanna, China. The two new species, Walkerella nigrabdomina Ma & Yang sp. nov. and W. curtipedis Ma & Yang sp. nov., are described from specimens reared from Ficus pisocarpa and Ficus curtipes, respectively. A key to all described species of Walkerella found is provided. Copyright Â© 2013 Magnolia Press.

84884528535	Larger Fig Wasps Are More Careful About Which Figs to Enter - With Good Reason	Floral longevity reflects a balance between gains in pollinator visitation and the costs of flower maintenance. Because rewards to pollinators change over time, older flowers may be less attractive, reducing the value of extended longevity. Un-pollinated figs, the inflorescences of Ficus species, can remain receptive for long periods, but figs that are older when entered by their host-specific fig wasp pollinators produce fewer seeds and fig wasp offspring. Our field experiments with Ficus hispida, a dioecious fig tree, examined how the length of time that receptive figs have remained un-pollinated influences the behaviour and reproductive success of its short-lived fig wasp pollinator, Ceratosolen solmsi marchali. The results were consistent in three different seasons, and on male and female trees, although receptivity was greatly extended during colder months. Pollinators took longer to find the ostioles of older figs, and longer to penetrate them. They also became increasingly unwilling to enter figs as they aged, and increasing numbers of the wasps became trapped in the ostiolar bracts. Larger individuals were particularly unwilling to enter older figs, resulting in older figs being pollinated by smaller wasps. On female trees, where figs produce only seeds, seed production declined rapidly with fig age. On male trees, the numbers and size of fig wasp offspring declined, and a higher proportion were male. Older male figs are harder to enter, especially for larger individuals, and offer poorer quality oviposition opportunities. This study opens an interesting new perspective on the coevolution of figs and their pollinators, especially factors influencing pollinator body size and emphasises the subtleties of interactions between mutualists.

84899519259	Premature attraction of pollinators to inaccessible figs of Ficus altissima: A search for ecological and evolutionary consequences	Adult life spans of only one or two days characterise life cycles of the fig wasps (Agaonidae) that pollinate fig trees (Ficus spp., Moraceae). Selection is expected to favour traits that maximise the value of the timing of encounters between such mutualistic partners, and fig wasps are usually only attracted to their hosts by species- and developmental-stage specific volatiles released from figs at the time when they are ready to be entered, oviposited in and pollinated. We found that Ficus altissima is exceptional, because it has persistent tight-fitting bud covers that prevent its Eupristina altissima pollinator (and a second species of 'cheater' agaonid) from entering its figs for several days after they start to be attracted. We examined the consequences of delayed entry for the figs and fig wasps and tested whether delayed entry has been selected to increase adult longevity. We found that older pollinators produced fewer and smaller offspring, but seed production was more efficient. Pollinator offspring ratios also varied depending on the age of figs they entered. The two agaonids from F. altissima lived slightly longer than six congeners associated with typical figs, but this was explainable by their larger body sizes. Delayed entry generates reproductive costs, especially for the pollinator. This opens an interesting perspective on the coevolution of figs and their pollinators and on the nature of mutualistic interactions in general. Â© 2014 Zhang et al.

84899639669	Relative investment in egg load and poison sac in fig wasps: Implications for physiological mechanisms underlying seed and wasp production in figs	Fig pollinating wasps and most non-pollinator wasps apply secretions from their poison sacs into oviposited flowers that appear necessary to the formation of the galls that their developing offspring consume. Thus, both eggs and poison sac secretions appear to be essential for wasp reproduction, but the relative investment in each is unknown. We measured relative investment in poison sac and egg production in pollinating and non-pollinating wasps associated with seven species of monoecious Panamanian figs representing both active and passive pollination syndromes. We then collected similar data for four fig hosts in China, where some wasp species in the genus Eupristina have lost the ability to pollinate ("cheaters"). All wasps examined possessed large poison sacs, and we found a strong positive correlation between poison sac size and absolute egg production. In the Panamanian species, the relative poison sac to egg investment was highest in the externally ovipositing non-pollinator wasps, followed by active pollinators, then by passive pollinators. Further, pollinator wasps of fig species with demonstrated host sanctions against "cheating" wasps showed higher investment in the poison sac than wasps of species without sanctions. In the Chinese samples, relative investment in the poison sac was indistinguishable between pollinators and "cheaters" associated with the same fig species. We suggest that higher relative investment in poison sac across fig wasp species reflects higher relative difficulty in initiating formation of galls and subsequently obtaining resources from the fig. We discuss the implications for the stability of the fig-wasp mutualism, and for the ability of non-pollinators to exploit this mutualism. Â© 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

84899644611	A switch from mutualist to exploiter is reflected in smaller egg loads and increased larval mortalities in a 'cheater' fig wasp	The interaction between the hundreds of Ficus species and their specific pollinating fig wasps (Agaonidae) presents a striking example of mutualism. Foundress fig wasps pollinate fig flowers, but also lay their eggs in (and gall) some of them. Only two cases of cheating fig wasps (that fail to pollinate) have been reported, from two continents, suggesting that there is a cost to abandoning pollination. Reasons for the rarity of cheating are a major question in fig biology, because persistence of the mutualism depends on fig wasps continuing to pollinate. A cost in terms of reduced reproductive success among cheaters could be one explanation. Here we compare the behavior and reproduction of an undescribed Eupristina sp., a cheater that coexists with the pollinator Eupristina altissima on Ficus altissima in southern China. Adult females of both species fought with conspecifics when they were seeking entry through the ostiole into receptive figs, but there was no fighting with heterospecifics. Despite a similar body size, female pollinators contained more eggs than female cheaters. Pollinators and cheaters produced similar number of galls, and although almost twice as many flowers were galled in figs entered by two compared to one foundress, larval mortality was greatly increased when two foundresses were present. Larval mortality was also significantly higher for cheaters compared to pollinators, independent of the number of foundresses. Ovules galled by the cheater were thus significantly less likely to result in adult offspring, suggesting that there are significant costs associated with abandoning the mutualism.

84904395881	First record of an apparently rare fig wasp feeding strategy: Obligate seed predation	1. Fig trees require host-specific agaonid fig wasps for pollination, but their figs also support numerous non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW) that gall fig tissues or develop as parasitoids. 2. Ficus microcarpa L. is widely naturalised outside its native range and the most invasive fig tree species. Seed predators are widely used for the biological control of invasive plants, but no obligate seed predatory (as opposed to ovule or fig wall galling) NPFW have been recorded previously from any fig trees. 3. Philotrypesis NPFW are usually regarded as parasitoids or 'inquilines' (parasitoids that also eat plant material) of pollinator fig wasps, but the present study provides evidence that Philotrypesis taiwanensis, a NPFW associated with F. microcarpa, is an obligate seed predator: (i) adults emerge from seeds of typical appearance, with a surrounding elaiosome; (ii) it shows no preference for figs occupied by fig wasp species, other than the pollinator (iii) it only develops in figs that contain pollinated ovules, avoiding figs occupied by an agaonid that fails to pollinate; (iv) larvae are distributed in layers where seeds are concentrated and (v) it has a negative impact on seed but not pollinator offspring numbers. 4. Philotrypesis is a large genus, and further species are likely to be seed predators. Â© 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.

13544256460	Quantitative tests of interaction between pollinating and non-pollinating fig wasps on dioecious Ficus hispida	1. The interaction between Ficus species and their pollinating wasps (Agaonidae) represents a striking example of a mutualism. Figs also shelter numerous non-pollinating chalcids that exploit the fig-pollinator mutualism. 2. Previous studies showed a weak negative correlation between numbers of pollinating and non-pollinating adults emerging from the same fruit. Little is known about the patterns and intensities of interactions between fig wasps. In the Xishuangbanna tropical rainforests of China, the dioecious Ficus hispida L. is pollinated by Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr and is also exploited by the non-pollinators Philotrypesis pilosa Mayr, Philotrypesis sp., and Apocrypta bakeri Joseph. Here, the interaction of pollinator and non-pollinators on F. hispida is studied quantitatively. 3. The exact time of oviposition was determined for each species of fig wasp. Based on observational and experimental work it is suggested that (i) the relationship between pollinator and non-pollinators is a positive one, and that the genus Philotrypesis appears to have no significant impact on the pollinator population, whereas Apocrypta has a significant effect on both Philotrypesis and Ceratosolen; (ii) gall numbers do not always increase with increasing number of foundresses, but developmental mortality of larvae correlates positively with the number of foundresses; and (iii) there is a positive correlation between non-pollinator numbers and their rates of parasitism, but the three species of non-pollinators differed in their rates of parasitism and show different effects on pollinator production. 4. The rates of parasitism when combined with the coexistent percentage and developmental mortality, underpin the way non-pollinating fig wasps successfully exploit and coexist stably in a fig-pollinator mutualism.
