We present a measurement of the electric charge of top quarks using tt¯ events produced in pp¯ collisions at the Tevatron. The analysis is based on fully reconstructed tt¯ pairs in lepton+jets final states. Using data corresponding to 5.3fb-1 of integrated luminosity, we exclude the hypothesis that the top quark has a charge of Q=-4/3e at a significance greater than 5 standard deviations. We also place an upper limit of 0.46 on the fraction of such quarks that can be present in an admixture with the standard model top quarks (Q=+2/3e) at a 95% confidence level.

9744248726	Evidence of color coherence effects in W + jets events from pp collisions at √s = 1.8 TeV	We report the results of a study of color coherence effects in pp collisions based on data collected by the DØ detector during the 1994-1995 run of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, at a center of mass energy √s = 1.8 TeV. Initial-to-final state color interference effects are observed by examining particle distribution patterns in events with a W boson and at least one jet. The data are compared to Monte Carlo simulations with different color coherence implementations and to an analytic modified-leading-logarithm perturbative calculation based on the local parton-hadron duality hypothesis. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Results from the analysis of data collected using the DØ detector during the 1993-1995 Tevatron collider run at Fermilab are combined with those of an earlier study from the 1992-1993 run.

The amplitude method gives a lower limit on the Bs0 oscillation frequency at 14.8ps-1 at the 95% C.L. At Δms=19ps-1, the amplitude deviates from the hypothesis A=0 (1) by 2.5 (1.6) standard deviations, corresponding to a two-sided C.L. of 1% (10%). A likelihood scan over the oscillation frequency, Δms, gives a most probable value of 19ps-1 and a range of 17<Δms<21ps-1 at the 90% C.L., assuming Gaussian uncertainties. This is the first direct two-sided bound measured by a single experiment. If Δms lies above 22ps-1, then the probability that it would produce a likelihood minimum similar to the one observed in the interval 16-22ps-1 is (5.0±0.3)%. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33751535218	Measurement of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets final state with the matrix element method	We present a measurement of the top quark mass with the matrix element method in the lepton+jets final state. As the energy scale for calorimeter jets represents the dominant source of systematic uncertainty, the matrix element likelihood is extended by an additional parameter, which is defined as a global multiplicative factor applied to the standard energy scale. The top quark mass is obtained from a fit that yields the combined statistical and systematic jet energy scale uncertainty. Using a data set of 0.4fb-1 taken with the D0 experiment at Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, the mass of the top quark is measured using topological information to be: mtopℓ+jets(topo)=169. 2-7.4+5.0(stat+JES)-1.4+1.5(syst)GeV, and when information about identified b jets is included: mtopℓ+jets(b-tag)=170.3-4.5+4.1(stat+JES)-1.8+1.2(syst) GeV.

The general case, with CP violation in both B0 and Bs0 systems, is also considered.

34347369825	Measurement of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets channel using the ideogram method	A measurement of the top quark mass using events with one charged lepton, missing transverse energy, and jets in the final state, collected by the D0 detector from pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, is presented. A constrained fit is used to fully reconstruct the kinematics of the events. For every event a top quark mass likelihood is calculated taking into account all possible jet assignments and the probability that an event is signal or background. Lifetime-based identification of b jets is employed to enhance the separation between tt̄ signal and background from other physics processes and to improve the assignment of the observed jets to the quarks in the tt̄ hypothesis. We extract a multiplicative jet energy scale (JES) factor in situ, greatly reducing the systematic effect related to the jet energy measurement. In a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 425pb-1, we observe 230 candidate events, with an estimated background of 123 events, and measure mt=173.7±4.4(stat+JES)-2.0+2.1(syst)GeV.

We apply the analysis to the gluino (g), predicted in split supersymmetry, which after hadronization can become charged and lose enough momentum through ionization to come to rest in dense particle detectors. Approximately 410pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the D0 detector during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron collider are analyzed in search of such "stopped gluinos" decaying into a gluon and a neutralino (χ 10). Limits are placed on the (gluino cross section)×(probability to stop)×[BR(g →gχ 10)] as a function of the gluino and χ 10 masses, for gluino lifetimes from 30μs-100h. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34848837024	Measurement of the tt̄ production cross section in pp̄ collisions using dilepton events	We present a measurement of the tt̄ pair production cross section in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV utilizing approximately 425pb-1 of data collected with the D0 detector. We consider decay channels containing two high pT charged leptons (either e or μ) from leptonic decays of both top-daughter W bosons. These were gathered using four sets of selection criteria, three of which required that a pair of fully identified leptons (i.e., eμ, ee, or μμ) be found. The fourth approach imposed less restrictive criteria on one of the lepton candidates and required that at least one hadronic jet in each event be tagged as containing a b quark. For a top quark mass of 175 GeV, the measured cross section is 7.4±1.4(stat)±1.0(syst)pb and for the current Tevatron average top quark mass of 170.9 GeV, the resulting value of the cross section is 7.8±1.8(stat+syst)pb. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We reconstruct the angle θ* between the momenta of the down-type fermion and the top quark in the W boson rest frame for each top quark decay.

The data are found to be consistent with the resummation prediction at low qT, but above the perturbative QCD calculation in the region of qT>30GeV/c. Using events with qT<30GeV/c, we extract the value of g2, one of the nonperturbative parameters for the resummation calculation. Data at large boson rapidity y are compared with the prediction of resummation and with alternative models that employ a resummed form factor with modifications in the small Bjorken x region of the proton wave function. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

We consider the final state containing a lepton and at least three jets. The entire sample of data collected by the D0 experiment during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, corresponding to 9.7fb-1 of integrated luminosity, is used. The asymmetry measured for reconstructed leptons is AFBl=(2.9±2.1(stat.)-1.7+1.5(syst.))%.

We examine the dependence of AFBl on the transverse momentum and rapidity of the lepton. Combination with the asymmetry measured in the final states containing two leptons yields AFBl=(4.2±2.0(stat.)±1.4(syst.))%. The results are in agreement with predictions from the next-to-leading-order QCD generator mc@nlo, which predicts an asymmetry of AFBl=2.0% for |yl|<1.5.

47649097826	Evidence for production of single top quarks	We present first evidence for the production of single top quarks in the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron pp̄ collider. The standard model predicts that the electroweak interaction can produce a top quark together with an antibottom quark or light quark, without the antiparticle top-quark partner that is always produced from strong-coupling processes. Top quarks were first observed in pair production in 1995, and since then, single top-quark production has been searched for in ever larger data sets. In this analysis, we select events from a 0.9fb-1 data set that have an electron or muon and missing transverse energy from the decay of a W boson from the top-quark decay, and two, three, or four jets, with one or two of the jets identified as originating from a b hadron decay. The selected events are mostly backgrounds such as W+jets and tt̄ events, which we separate from the expected signals using three multivariate analysis techniques: boosted decision trees, Bayesian neural networks, and matrix-element calculations. A binned likelihood fit of the signal cross section plus background to the data from the combination of the results from the three analysis methods gives a cross section for single top-quark production of σ(pp̄→tb+X,tqb+X)=4.7±1.3pb. The probability to measure a cross section at this value or higher in the absence of signal is 0.014%, corresponding to a 3.6 standard deviation significance. The measured cross section value is compatible at the 10% level with the standard model prediction for electroweak top-quark production. We use the cross section measurement to directly determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix element that describes the Wtb coupling and find |Vtbf1L|=1.31-0.21+0.25, where f1L is a generic vector coupling. This model-independent measurement translates into 0.68<|Vtb|≤1 at the 95% C.L. in the standard model. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Our data sample is selected by requiring two fully identified leptons or by relaxing one lepton requirement to an isolated track if at least one jet is tagged as a b jet. The top quark mass is extracted after reconstructing the event kinematics under the tt̄ hypothesis using two methods. In the first method, we integrate over expected neutrino rapidity distributions, and in the second we calculate a weight for the possible top quark masses based on the observed particle momenta and the known parton distribution functions. We analyze 83 candidate events in the data and obtain mt=176.2±4.8(stat)±2.1(sys)GeV and mt=173.2±4.9(stat) ±2.0(sys)GeV for the two methods, respectively.

Implementation of this method requires that the data recoil library describe the properties of the measured recoil as a function of the true, rather than the measured, transverse momentum of the boson.

For the first time, we set limits for arbitrary combinations of left- and right-handed couplings of the W′ boson to fermions. For couplings with the same strength as for the standard model W boson, we set the following limits, assuming that there are right-handed neutrinos νR for all three generations with M(W′)>m(νR): M(W′)>863 GeV for purely left-handed couplings, M(W′)>885 GeV for purely right-handed couplings, and M(W′)>916 GeV if both left- and right-handed couplings are present.

This measurement uses data recorded by the DØ detector at the Fermilab Tevatron in 1994-1995. It represents the first investigation of a proposal that ratios between W and Z observables can be calculated reliably using perturbative QCD, even when the individual observables are not.

The standard model predictions of the charge asymmetries induced by CP violation are small in magnitude compared to the current experimental precision, so nonzero measurements could indicate new sources of CP violation. The measurements differ from the standard model predictions of CP violation in these asymmetries with a significance of 3.6 standard deviations. These results are interpreted in a framework of B meson mixing within the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa formalism to measure the relative width difference ΔΓd/Γd between the mass eigenstates of the B0 meson system and the semileptonic charge asymmetries asld and asls of B0 and Bs0 mesons, respectively. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84898652890	Double parton interactions in γ+3 jet and γ+b /cjet+2 jet events in p p ̄ collisions at s =1.96TeV DOUBLE PARTON INTERACTIONS in γ+3 JET ... V.M. ABAZOV et al.	We determine the fraction of events with double parton (DP) scattering in a single pp̄ collision at s=1.96TeV in samples of γ+3 jet and γ+b/cjet+2 jet events collected with the D0 detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 8.7fb-1. The DP fractions and effective cross sections (σeff) are measured for both event samples using the same kinematic selections. The measured DP fractions range from 0.21 to 0.17, with effective cross sections in the γ+3 jet and γ+b/cjet+2 jet samples of σeffincl=12.7±0.2(stat)±1.3(syst)mb and σeffHF=14.6±0.6(stat)±3.2(syst)mb, respectively. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84902336239	Observation of s -channel production of single top quarks at the tevatron	We report the first observation of single-top-quark production in the s channel through the combination of the CDF and D0 measurements of the cross section in proton-antiproton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The data correspond to total integrated luminosities of up to 9.7fb-1 per experiment. The measured cross section is σs=1.29-0.24+0.26pb. The probability of observing a statistical fluctuation of the background to a cross section of the observed size or larger is 1.8×10-10, corresponding to a significance of 6.3 standard deviations for the presence of an s-channel contribution to the production of single-top quarks. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84904559255	Precision measurement of the top quark mass in L epton+ J ets final states	We measure the mass of the top quark in lepton+jets final states using the full sample of pp̄ collision data collected by the D0 experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at s=1.96TeV, corresponding to 9.7fb-1 of integrated luminosity. We use a matrix element technique that calculates the probabilities for each event to result from tt̄ production or background. The overall jet energy scale is constrained in situ by the mass of the W boson. We measure mt=174.98±0.76GeV. This constitutes the most precise single measurement of the top-quark mass. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84908042688	Constraints on models for the higgs boson with exotic spin and parity in VH →vb b ¯ final states	We present constraints on models containing non-standard-model values for the spin J and parity P of the Higgs boson H in up to 9.7fb-1 of pp¯ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. These are the first studies of Higgs boson JP with fermions in the final state. In the ZH→ bb¯, WH→ νbb¯, and ZH→ννbb¯ final states, we compare the standard model (SM) Higgs boson prediction, JP=0+, with two alternative hypotheses, JP=0- and JP=2+. We use a likelihood ratio to quantify the degree to which our data are incompatible with non-SM JP predictions for a range of possible production rates. Assuming that the production rate in the signal models considered is equal to the SM prediction, we reject the JP=0- and JP=2+ hypotheses at the 97.6% CL and at the 99.0% CL, respectively. The expected exclusion sensitivity for a JP=0- (JP=2+) state is at the 99.86% (99.94%) CL. Under the hypothesis that our data are the result of a combination of the SM-like Higgs boson and either a JP=0- or a JP=2+ signal, we exclude a JP=0- fraction above 0.80 and a JP=2+ fraction above 0.67 at the 95% CL. The expected exclusion covers JP=0- (JP=2+) fractions above 0.54 (0.47).

84909942527	Measurement of the differential γ+2b-jet cross section and the ratio σ(γ+2b-jets)/σ(γ+b-jet) in pp collisions at √s=1.96TeV	We present the first measurements of the differential cross section dσ/dpTγ for the production of an isolated photon in association with at least two b-quark jets. The measurements consider photons with rapidities |y<sup>γ</sup>|<1.0 and transverse momenta 30<pTγ<200GeV. The b-quark jets are required to have pTjet>15GeV and |y<sup>jet</sup>|<1.5. The ratio of differential production cross sections for γ+2 b-jets to γ+b-jet as a function of pTγ is also presented. The results are based on the proton-antiproton collision data at s=1.96TeV collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The measured cross sections and their ratios are compared to the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations as well as predictions based on the k<inf>T</inf>-factorization approach and those from the sherpa and pythia Monte Carlo event generators.

84911445820	Measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry in top quark-antiquark production in p p ¯ collisions using the lepton +jets channel measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry ... V.M. Abazov et al.	We present a measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry in top quark-antiquark production using the full Tevatron Run II data set collected by the D0 experiment at Fermilab. The measurement is performed in lepton+jets final states using a new kinematic fitting algorithm for events with four or more jets and a new partial reconstruction algorithm for events with only three jets. Corrected for detector acceptance and resolution effects, the asymmetry is evaluated to be AFB=(10.6±3.0)%. Results are consistent with the standard model predictions which range from 5.0% to 8.8%. We also present the dependence of the asymmetry on the invariant mass of the top quark-antiquark system and the difference in rapidities of the top quark and antiquark.

84911909728	Measurement of differential t t ¯ production cross sections in p p ¯ collisions MEASUREMENT of DIFFERENTIAL t t ¯ PRODUCTION ⋯ V.M. ABAZOV et al.	The production of top quark-antiquark pair events in pp¯ collisions at s=1.96TeV is studied as a function of the transverse momentum and absolute value of the rapidity of the top quarks as well as of the invariant mass of the tt¯ pair. We select events containing an isolated lepton, a large imbalance in transverse momentum, and four or more jets with at least one jet identified as originating from a b quark. The data sample corresponds to 9.7fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded with the D0 detector during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Observed differential cross sections are consistent with standard model predictions.

84918787644	Observation and studies of double J /ψ production at the Tevatron	We present the observation of doubly produced J/ψ mesons with the D0 detector at Fermilab in pp¯ collisions at s=1.96TeV. The production cross section for both singly and doubly produced J/ψ mesons is measured using a sample with an integrated luminosity of 8.1fb-1. For the first time, the double J/ψ production cross section is separated into contributions due to single and double parton scatterings. Using these measurements, we determine the effective cross section σeff, a parameter characterizing an effective spatial area of the parton-parton interactions and related to the parton spatial density inside the nucleon.

84918812378	Measurement of the direct CP -violating parameter ACP in the decay D+ →k-π+π+	We measure the direct CP-violating parameter ACP for the decay of the charged charm meson, D+→K-π+π+ (and charge conjugate), using the full 10.4fb-1 sample of pp¯ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. We extract the raw reconstructed charge asymmetry by fitting the invariant mass distributions for the sum and difference of charge-specific samples. This quantity is then corrected for detector-related asymmetries using data-driven methods and for possible physics asymmetries (from B→D processes) using input from Monte Carlo simulation. We measure ACP=[-0.16±0.15(stat)±0.09(syst)]%, which is consistent with zero, as expected from the standard model prediction of CP conservation, and is the most precise measurement of this quantity to date.

0346939153	Probing hard color-singlet exchange in pp̄ collisions at √s = 630 GeV and 1800 GeV	We present results on dijet production via hard color-singlet exchange in proton-antiproton collisions at √s = 630 GeV and 1800 GeV using the DØ detector. The fraction of dijet events produced via color-singlet exchange is measured as a function of jet transverse energy, separation in pseudorapidity between the two highest transverse energy jets, and proton-antiproton center-of-mass energy. The results are consistent with a color-singlet fraction that increases with an increasing fraction of quark-initiated processes and inconsistent with two-gluon models for the hard color-singlet. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
