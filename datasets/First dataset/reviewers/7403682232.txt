15044356553	Lifespan extension and elevated hsp gene expression in Drosophila caused by histone deacetylase inhibitors	The heat shock proteins (Hsps) play a positive role in lifespan determination, and histone acetylation has been shown to be involved in transcription of hsp genes in Drosophila, To further determine if hsp22 and hsp70 expression is correlated with lifespan, and if histone acetylation participates in this process, RNA levels for hsp22 and hsp70 were analyzed throughout the lifespan in the long-lived and short-lived iso-female lines. The results showed that hsp22 and hsp70 RNA levels were higher in long-lived line than in short-lived line and that the long-lived flies responded more rapidly to heat but were more tolerant to high temperature. Moreover, we investigated the influences of histone acetylation modification on longevity and on hsp gene expression by using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors TSA and BuA. The results demonstrated that both inhibitors were able to extend the lifespan and promote hsp22 and hsp70 expression. However, the optimal concentrations of these inhibitors, and probably the mechanisms of their actions, vary with the genetic background. In addition, we showed that HDAC inhibitors caused the hyperacetylation of core histone H3, implicating the involvement of chromatin modulation in hsp gene transcription. These data suggested a close correlation among histone acetylation, hsp gene expression and longevity in D. melanogaster.

1542600926	Characterization of a wheat-wheatgrass translocation line by fish	The genomic DNA of wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host) P. B. = Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski = Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth and Dewey) was labelled with biotin-16-dUTP as a probe, and genomic DNA of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) "Chinese Spring" was used for blocking. Wheat-wheatgrass line 33 was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. The terminal regions of a pair of chromosomes showed green fluorescent signals. It has been concluded that chromosome segments containing alien genes of wheatgrass are located at the terminal regions of wheat chromosomes in wheat-wheatgrass line 33, and the translocated segments were small. Wheat-wheatgrass line 33 has been proved to be a translocation line with chromosome segments of wheatgrass translocated to the terminal regions of wheat chromosomes.

14744297590	Histone acetyltransferase p300 promotes the activation of human WT1 promoter and intronic enhancer	The Wilms' tumor gene-1 (WT1) encodes a zinc finger protein involved in gene regulation during kidney, gonad, and heart development. In addition to its promoter, a 258 bp intronic enhancer is required for tissue-specific expression of WT1 gene. p300 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and exerts essential functions in gene regulation. Here, we show that p300 increased the expression of endogenous WT1 mRNA and promoted the activation of the WT1 promoter and intronic enhancer. The results also revealed that the adenovirus E1A repressed the p300 function, while the p300-binding defective E1A delta 2-36 did not, and p300 HAT activity was important for its function since p300 mutant with the HAT domain deleted partially abrogated its ability to activate the WT1 promoter and intronic enhancer. Furthermore, p300 and c-Myb synergistically activated the expression of WT1 gene. This study revealed that p300 and its HAT activity were involved in regulation of WT1 transcription. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

20444493471	Interleukin-12 p40 promoter activity is regulated by the reversible acetylation mediated by HDAC1 and p300	Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by macrophages in response to intracellular pathogens. The importance of IL-12 in generation of Th1 response against human pathogens has been characterized. The coactivator p300 is an important histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and has been implicated in the regulation of many genes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate gene transcription through deacetylation of histones. Whether the reversible histone acetylation/deacetylation modification participates in the regulation of IL-12 p40 transcription expression has not been investigated before. In this study, we analyzed the roles of HDAC1 and p300 in the regulation of human IL-12 p40. Co-transfection studies showed that HDAC1 had a repressing effect on the activity of IL-12 p40 promoter. Contrarily, p300 was able to reinforce the C/EBPβ-mediated activation of IL-12 p40 and it counteracted the HDAC1-mediated repression of the IL-12 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation tests (ChIP) revealed that p300 had a stimulating effect on the acetylation of the histone H3 at IL-12 p40 promoter. In addition, we showed that p300 had a physical interaction with C/EBPβ and can enhance acetylation of C/EBPβ. Data presented in this paper indicate that the reversible histone acetylation/deacetylation modification plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of IL-12. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

20444499535	Reversible histone acetylation/deacetylation modification by p300 and HDAC3 is involved in the regulation of IL-18 promoter activity	Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the development of T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, and it plays important roles in regulation of both the innate and acquired immune responses. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the reversible histone acetylation/deacetylation modification participates in the regulation of IL-18 transcription expression. The transcription coactivator p300 containing the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, and the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) were used in this study to analyze the effect of this modification in the regulation of mouse IL-18 gene. The results demonstrate that transfection of p300-expression plasmid promotes the endogenous IL-18 mRNA synthesis in J774 cells, and stimulates the activation of IL-18 promoter. It has been found that this stimulating effect of p300 was reversed by HDAC3, indicating the involvement of the reversible histone acetylation/deacetylation modification in IL-18 regulation. Furthermore, the data show that the HAT activity of p300 was essential to its function in activating IL-18 promoter. In addition, p300 was shown to be able to work synergistically with the transcription factor c-Fos on activation of IL-18 promoter and this effect could also be impaired by HDAC3. Results presented in this paper indicate that the reversible histone acetylation/deacetylation modification plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of IL-18.

20044367838	The Elp3 subunit of human Elongator complex is functionally similar to its counterpart in yeast	Functions of the Elp3 subunit of the recently purified human Elongator were studied using an in vivo yeast complementation system. We demonstrated that the human ELP3 gene (hELP3) was able partially to complement functional defects of yeast elp3Δ cells. Furthermore, a chimeric ELP3 gene (yhELP3) encoding a protein in which the putative histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of hELP3 fused to the remainder of the yeast Elp3p corrected the growth defects of elp3Δ cells and complemented the slow activation of some inducible genes. Moreover, deletion of the B motif of the catalytic domain of the HAT region of hELP3 eliminated the ability of yhELP3 to complement elp3Δ in vivo, indicating that the HAT activity is essential for ELP3 function. We also demonstrated that replacement of specific lysine residues in histones H3 and H4 by arginine affected the complementation capacity of both the yeast gene (yELP3) and the chimeric yhELP3 in the elp3Δstrain. Specifically, mutation of lysine-14 of H3 (H3 K14R) or lysine-8 of H4 (H4 K8R) reduced the ability of yELP3 and yhELP3 to complement the elp3Δ mutant, whereas simultaneous mutation of both sites (H3 K14R/H4 K8R) almost completely abolished complementation. These results imply a link between the acetylation of specific sites in nucleosomal histones and the regulation of transcription elongation by human Elp3. The data presented in this report suggest that the Elp3 subunits of human and yeast are highly conserved in their structure and functions. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

21444449234	Distribution of DNA and localization of rRNA transcription in G2 phase nucleolus of Physarum polycephalum	Using electron microscopy, NAMA-Ur DNA selective staining and BrUTP incorporation, the nucleolus ultrastructure, the distribution of DNA and the rRNA transcription sites in nucleolus of G2 phase Physarum polycephalum were studied. The nucleolus was found to be different in structure from that of other plant cells. Fibrillar centers (FCs) were present in a large amount all over the nucleolus. DNA was distributed both in dense fibrillar components (DFC) and in FC. The DNA in the nucleolus was less condensed than that of the chromosome territory. These changes suggested that the transcription was active within the nucleolus. BrUTP incorporation localized the rRNA transcription in DFC and at the interface of FC and DFC, suggesting that the DNA in FC is in a storage form and only the rDNA in DFC is transcribed.

23044513289	Histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 enhances the activation of IL-18 promoter	Interleukin-18 (IL-18), an important regulator of innate and acquired immune responses expressed from a variety of cell types, is a pleiotropic cytokine in the development of T helper type 1 (ThI) cells. The p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) coactivator proteins are important histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that regulate the transcription of many genes. Whether p300/CBP play a role in the IL-18 expression has not been investigated previously. In this study, we analyzed the roles of p300 in the regulation of mouse IL-18 by using RT-PCR and a series of co-transfection studies. We showed that p300 had a stimulating effect on the endogenous IL-18 mRNA synthesis and on the activity of IL-18 p1 promoter. The results also showed that IL-18 p1 promoter activity was enhanced by p300 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the p300-mediated activation function can be suppressed by the adenovirus E1A protein, which inhibits the HAT function of p300. Also, a mutation in p300 HAT region abolished the effect of p300 on IL-18 activation. These data further indicate that the acetylase activity of p300 was indispensable to its function. Furthermore, we found that p300 was able to enhance the effect of the transcription factor c-Fos on activation of the IL-18 promoter. Data presented in this paper implicate important roles of p300 in the transcriptional regulation of IL-18. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0000565593	Microdissection of chromosome 7B of common wheat and cloning of low-copy specific DNA sequences	The 7B chromosome of common wheat was microdissected from pollen mother cells of the 7B monosomic line of common wheat cv. Chinese Spring (CS). After proteinase K and DNA topoisomerase I treatments, the isolated chromosomes were subjected to 1 - 3 rounds of DOP-PCR amplification, which produced continuous DNA fragments ranging from 150 to 700 bp. Genomic Southern hybridization confirmed that the PCR products were originated from the wheat genome. Cloning of portion (> 200 bp) of the 3rd round DOP-PCR products (50 μL) could generate about 20 000 recombinant clones. Characterization of 50 randomly chosen clones indicated that 21 clones produced discrete PCR products with the size of 240 - 600 bp. Dot-blot hybridization showed that among the 21 clones, 11 (∼55%) were of low-copy nature while 10 (∼45%) were repetitive. Southern hybridization with the complete set of the CS "nullisomic-tetrasomic (NT)" lines demonstrated that all the 6 low-copy clones were specific to either chromosome 7B or the 7th homoeologous group, whereas the 3 arbitrarily chosen repetitive clones were non-specific, disperse sequences.

By filtering through a series of sieves with decreasing mesh sizes and collecting the resultant filtrate, a suspension culture composed mainly of single embryogenic cells was established. In a medium containing 0.3 mg/l 2,4-D, 1.0 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BAP) and 500 mg/l casein hydrolysate (CH), the single cells underwent direct somatic embryogenesis resulting in the formation of proembryos. These proembryos developed into mature embryos when placed in a double-layer liquid overlay culture. Intact plants were developed from somatic embryos when they were transferred onto solidified MS medium without added growth regulators. © 1996 Springer-Verlag.

3142554263	Unpolymerized nuclear actin is involved in the activation of CSF-1 gene transcription	Nuclear actin is a nuclear component in many kinds of eukaryotic cells but its function is still not clear. In this study, we overexpressed actin in nuclei and found that it promoted transcription of the CSF-1 gene, both exogenous and endogenous, approximately two-fold. Cytochalasin B did not affect this function of nuclear actin. Our results suggest that nuclear actin plays a role in regulating CSF-1 gene transcription, and this role does not depend on actin polymerization. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Federation for Cell Biology.

3242658267	Human interleukin-5 expression is synergistically regulated by histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 and transcription factors C/EBP, NF-AT and AP-1	Interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays a central role in the growth and differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease states including asthma. There has been considerable interest in the identification of the transcriptional mechanisms controlling the synthesis of this cytokine. The regulation of IL-5 message is primarily at the level of transcription and is likely to be controlled, to a large extent, by regulatory elements in the promoter region that can influence the transcriptional activity of the gene. In this study, we performed a series of transient transfection experiments with IL-5 promoter-reporter gene construct and expression plasmid for E1A, an inhibitor of CBP/p300, or for the CBP/p300-binding defective E1AΔ2-36. The results showed that E1A repressed IL-5 promoter activity, while E1AΔ2-36 had no effect on it. This suggested that CBP/p300 was involved in regulation of IL-5 gene expression. Transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 and transcription factors C/EBP, NF-AT, and c-Fos synergistically activated IL-5 promoter. Furthermore, we found that ectopic expression of p300 increased endogenous IL-5 mRNA expression. Thus, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of CBP/p300 was required to activate IL-5 expression. This report provided evidence, for the first time, that CBP/p300 was involved in IL-5 gene expression and the HAT activity was important in regulation of IL-5 expression. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

3142708942	Modified heparin inhibits P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion of human colon carcinoma cells to immobilized platelets under dynamic flow conditions	Accumulating evidence indicates that the formation of tumor cell platelet emboli complexes in the blood stream is a very important step during metastases and that the anti-metastasis effects of heparin are partially due to a blockade of P-selectin on platelets. In this study, heparin and chemically modified heparins were tested as inhibitors of three human colon carcinoma cell lines (COLO320, LS174T, and CW-2) binding to P-selectin, adhering to CHO cells expressing a transfected human P-selectin cDNA, and adhering to surface-anchored platelets expressing P-selectin under static and flow conditions. The aim was to screen for heparin derivatives with high anti-adhesion activity but negligible anticoagulant activity. In this study, four modified heparins with high anti-adhesion activity were identified including RO-heparin, CR-heparin, 2/3ODS-heparin, and N/2/3DS-heparin. NMR analysis proved the reliability of structure of the four modified heparins. Our findings suggested that the 6-O-sulfate group of glucosamine units in heparin is critical for the inhibition of P-selectin-mediated tumor cell adhesion. Heparan sulfate-like proteoglycans on these tumor cell surfaces are implicated in adhesion of the tumor cells to P-selectin. Some chemically modified heparins with low anticoagulant activities, such as 2/3ODS-heparin, may have potential value as therapeutic agents that block P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion and prevent tumor metastasis.

3142762286	The Elp4 subunit of human elongator complex partially complements the growth defects of yeast ELP4 deletion strain	In this study, we performed in vivo experiments to determine the function of human Elongator subunit Elp4 by using a yeast complementary system. Our results indicated that though human ELP4 was not able to complement the growth defects of the ELP4 deletion mutant strain to high concentration salt, it partially reduced the sensitivity of mutant strain to caffeine, high temperature and 6-AU. Gene expression analysis indicated that human ELP4 partially resumed the slow activation of the PHO5 gene caused by the deletion of yELP4 under the low phosphate concentration. Meanwhile, under the condition of heat shock treatment, hELP4 increased the expression level of SSA3 gene. All these data demonstrated that human ELP4 can partially complement the growth defects and restore the slow activation of certain genes of the yELP4 deletion strain. These results indicate that human Elp4 subunit has similar functions to that of the yeast.

33745286770	Effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on transcriptional regulation of the hsp70 gene in Drosophila	Histone acetyltransferases/deacetylases contribute to the activation or inactivation of transcription by modifying the structure of chromatin. Here we examined the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs), trichostatin A, and sodium butyrate on hsp70 gene transcriptional regulation in Drosophila. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HDI treatments induced the hyperacetylation of histone H3 at the promoter and the transcribing regions of hsp70 gene, increased the accessibility of heat-shock factor to target heat-shock element, and promoted the RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Moreover, the quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the HDI-induced hyperacetylation of histone H3 enhanced both the basal and the inducible expression of hsp70 mRNA level. In addition, the acetylation level of histone H3 at the promoter exhibited a fluctuated change upon the time of heat shock. These experimental data implicated a causal link between histone acetylation and enhanced transcription initiation of hsp70 gene in Drosophila. © 2006 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

33747181698	Histone acetyltransferase p300 regulates the transcription of human erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene	Erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis of erythroid cells. Here, we show that treatment of erythroid K562 cells with HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate or Trichostatin A gave rise to a significant increase in ALAS2 gene transcripts, with a concurrent increase in acetylation level of histone H4 at the ALAS2 gene promoter. Histone acetyltransferase p300 bound withALAS2 promoter and overexpression of p300 increased both the promoter reporter expression and endogenous mRNA level of ALAS2. Additionally, two functional Sp1 sites located in ALAS2 promoter were identified. Both of the GATA-1 sites and all the Sp1 sites at the ALAS2 promoter contributed to the transcription synergistic action with p300. These data implicated a close relationship between the acetylation modification of histone at the ALAS2 promoter and the regulation of this gene. Meanwhile, this work identified that ALAS2 is a novel target gene for p300/CBP action as histone acetyltransferases. © 2006.

Antibody neutralization experiment using anti-Ras antibody treatment showed that Ras protein played an important role in cell cycle checkpoint control through regulation of the level of Cyclin B1, suggesting that Ras protein might be a key factor for histone acetylation-mediated cell cycle regulation in P. polycephalum.

33749660052	Coactivator CBP/p300 increased the activity of C/EBP-mediated human interleukin-5 gene promoter	Interleukin-5 (IL-5), expressed primarily by type-2 T helper (Th2) cells, plays an essential role in the development of allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma. Histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 remodels chromatin by acetylating histones, resulting in open structure of chromatin and active transcription. Adenovirus protein E1A inhibits the activity of CBP/p300. In this study, we analyzed the effects of E1A on IL-5 gene promoter/luciferase reporter activity. The results showed that E1A protein inhibited the activity of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated IL-5 gene promoter/luciferase reporter construct. In contrast, overexpression of the CBP/p300-binding defective E1A Δ2-36 protein did not inhibit IL-5 gene promoter activity. These data demonstrated for the first time that transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 was involved in the activation of IL-5 gene promoter. E1A protein can modulate CBP/p300 function to activate the transcription of IL-5 gene promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid. Furthermore, in collaboration with transcription factor C/EBP, CBP/p300 activated IL-5 gene promoter/luciferase reporter expression. This study provides further insight into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of IL-5 gene.

33749685353	Structure and functions of transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP and their roles in regulation of interleukin gene expression	p300/CBP arc versatile transcriptional coactivators that participate in many physiological processes, including cell cycle control, differentiation and apoptosis. p300/CBP possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and they are involved in transcriptional regulation by acetylating histone and nonhistone proteins. Moreover, they act as protein bridges connecting specific transcription factors to the basal transcription machinery and provide a scaffold to integrate multiple transcription cofactors. Several studies suggest that p300/CBP may serve as tumor suppressors since mutations or translocations in p300/Cbp genes have been observed in a number of cancers. Furthermore, in many neurodegenerative diseases, inhibition of p300/CBP function may be one of the underlying causes of cytotoxicity. Several studies have demonstrated that p300/CBP are implicated in the regulation of many interleukin genes. This review focuses on the structures and functions of p300/CBP and their roles in the regulation of interleukin genes based on the work performed in our laboratory.

33845789649	Recruitment of histone deacetylase 4 by transcription factors represses interleukin-5 transcription	The critical role of IL-5 (interleukin-5) in eosinophilic inflammation implicates it as a therapeutic target for allergic diseases. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular basis for the involvement of reversible histone acetylation in IL-5 transcriptional regulation. We provide evidence that HDAC4 (histone deacetylase 4) and p300, a known HAT (histone acetyltransferase), reversibly controlled the activity of the IL-5 promoter in vivo and in vitro, with a concurrent alteration of histone H3 acetylation status at the promoter regions. The nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC4 was shown to play an important role in the suppressive function of HDAC4 in IL-5 gene expression. Point mutation and reporter ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) studies determined that the four transcription factors binding on the IL-5 promoter, i.e. C/EBPβ (CAAT/enhancer-binding protein β), GATA3 (GATA binding protein 3), NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and YY1 (Yin and Yang 1), were essential for the recruitment of HDAC4. Consistent with these observations, HDAC4 was found to form protein complexes with GATA3 and YY1, and to co-exist in the nuclei with GATA3. We propose that the unique regulatory mechanism of IL-5 gene transcription involves the reversible histone modification catalysed by HDAC4 and p300, which are recruited by the transcription factors. The dynamic balance in IL-5 transcriptional regulation is achieved through interactions among HATs/HDACs, histones and transcription factors. These data contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of IL-5 regulation, which is crucial to the development of new therapeutic strategies for IL-5-related allergic diseases. © 2006 Biochemical Society.

33846695671	HDAC inhibitors TSA and sodium butyrate enhanced the human IL-5 expression by altering histone acetylation status at its promoter region	The expression of IL-5 correlated tightly with the maturation and differentiation of eosinophils, and is considered as a cytokine responsible for allergic inflammation. We report here that inhibition of HDAC activity by Trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaBu), the two specific HDAC inhibitors, resulted in the elevation of both endogenous and exogenous activity of IL-5 promoter. We demonstrated that both the mRNA expression and protein production of IL-5 were stimulated by TSA and NaBu treatments. ChIP assays showed that treatments of TSA and NaBu caused hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 on IL-5 promoter in Jurkat cells, which consequently promoted the exogenous luciferase activity driven by this promoter. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that the binding sites for transcription factors NFAT, GATA3 and YY1 on IL-5 promoter were critical for the effects of TSA and NaBu, suggesting that the transcriptional activation of IL-5 gene by these inhibitors was achieved by affecting HDAC function on IL-5 promoter via transcription factors. These data will contribute to elucidating the unique mechanism of IL-5 transcriptional control and to the therapy of allergic disorders related to IL-5. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

34247107123	Histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a potentiates doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by up-regulating PTEN expression	BACKGROUND. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN is a major negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt cellular survival pathway. Overexpression of PTEN by adenoviral transfection increases doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Whereas doxorubicin-induced apoptosis can be potentiated by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. The aim of this work was to investigate whether changes in PTEN expression are involved in TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. METHODS. We treated 293 T cells with TSA and doxorubicin, detected apoptosis by using Hoechst 33342 staining, and examined changes of PTEN and Egr-1 expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the promoter activity of PTEN and Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to confirm changes in the expression of PTEN. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to estimate the acetylation level of PTEN promoter. RESULTS. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was enhanced by TSA, whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PTEN inhibited TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Also, TSA promoted Egr-1 expression, which is the main transcription factor of PTEN, and this resulted in up-regulation of PTEN expression, which consequently potentiated apoptosis. Moreover, histone acetyltransferase p300 was able to synergistically activate PTEN transcription with Egr-1, implicating the role of histone acetylation in the regulation of PTEN expression. CONCLUSIONS. TSA promoted doxorubicin-induced apoptosis through a mechanism that involved the stimulation of Egr-1 expression, acetylation of core histones at the PTEN promoter, and consequently induction of PTEN transcription. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the therapeutic application of combined treatment of TSA/doxorubicin for cancer. © 2007 American Cancer Society.

34250826536	HELP3 subunit of the Elongator complex regulates the transcription of HSP70 gene in human cells	The human Elongator complex is remarkably similar to its yeast counterpart in several aspects. In a previous study, we analyzed the functions of the human elongation protein 3 (hELP3) subunit of the human Elongator by using an in vivo yeast complementation system. However, direct evidence for hELP3 functions in regulating gene expression in human cells was not obtained. In this study, we used hELP3 antisense oligonucleotide inhititors to knock down hELP3 gene expression to investigate its function in human 293T cells. The results showed that specific reduction of hELP3 mRNA and protein caused a significant suppression of HSP70-2 gene expression, and this was accompanied by histone H3 hypoacetylation and decreased RNA polymerase II density at the HSP70-2 gene. Moreover, the data also showed that hELP3 exerted the transcriptional regulatory function directly through its presence on the HSP70-2 gene. Data presented in this report provide further insight and direct evidence of the functions of hELP3 in HSP70-2 gene transcriptional elongation in human cells. © 2007 Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

35548964652	Roles of histone acetylation modification in basal and inducible expression of hsp26 gene in D. melanogaster	The promoter of the Drosophila hsp26 gene contains two DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites and a positioned nucleosome, and this open chromatin structure is required for heat-inducible expression. Histone acetylation modification participates in transcriptional regulation of genes by affecting the status of chromatin remodeling. In this study, we investigated the roles of histone acetylation modification on hsp26 expression in Drosophila. We showed that the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) treatments of Drosophila larvae induced the histone H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter DH sites, which facilitated the binding of heat shock factor (HSF) to heat shock element (HSE). This resulted in a promoted transcription of hsp26 gene following the heat shock, and further increased the inducible expression of hsp26 gene. On the contrary, the HDI-induced histone H3 hyperacetylation in the middle nucleosome decreased the basal expression of hsp26 gene under the normal growth conditions. In addition, by following up the heat-shock time course, we showed that the histone acetylation level at the DH sites exhibited a drop-raise-drop change, while that at the positioned nucleosome underwent a raise-drop-raise-drop switchover. These results demonstrated the distinct roles played by histone acetylation modification in hsp26 gene basal and inducible expression regulation in D. melanogaster. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

Of the six HDACs (HDAC1-6) examined, HDAC4 and HDAC5 were found to have significant repressing effects on the activity of the WT1 reporter gene, as revealed by luciferase reporter assays and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. Luciferase reporter assays showed that the histone acetyltransferase p300 was able to counteract the HDAC4/HDAC5-mediated repression and that p300/CBP synergized with transcription factors Sp1, c-Myb, and Ets-1 in activation of the WT1 reporter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p300 promotes the acetylation level of histone H3 at the WT1 intronic enhancer. Based on these data, we proposed a hypothetical model for the involvement of reversible histone acetylation in transcriptional regulation of the WT1 gene. This study provides further insight into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the WT1 gene and WT1-associated diseases treatment. © 2007 Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

3743130981	Direct somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration in Ornithogalum caudatum	Direct somatic embryos were formed on the explants of Ornithogalun caudatum Jacq. that were excised from the bud scales of the small bulls when placed on an appropriate culture medium. Histological and scanning electron microscopic examinations showed that somatic embryogenesis was initiated from single cells of the outermost layer of the epidermis. The embryogenic cell underwent a periclinal division giving rise to a 2-celled proembryo which developed into the mature embryo through different morphological stages similar to that of a zygotic embryo. The somatic embryos germinated into plantlets which were then transplanted into soil. It was noted that the somatic embryos were formed exclusively on the adaxial surface of the bud scale rings while no embryos were observed on the abaxial surface of the rings. A distinctive difference in cell structure and morphology between these two parts of the explants was observed.

38949102236	Gcn5- and Elp3-induced histone H3 acetylation regulates hsp70 gene transcription in yeast	The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which histone acetylation participates in transcriptional regulation of hsp70 (heat-shock protein 70) genes SSA3 and SSA4 in yeast. Our results indicated that histone acetylation was required for the transcriptional activation of SSA3 and SSA4. The HATs (histone acetyltransferases) Gcn5 (general control non-derepressible 5) and Elp3 (elongation protein 3) modulated hsp70 gene transcription by affecting the acetylation status of histone H3. Although the two HATs possessed overlapping function regarding the acetylation of histone H3, they affected hsp10 gene transcription in different ways. The recruitment of Gcn5 was Swi/Snf-dependent and was required for HSF (heat-shock factor) binding and affected RNAPII (RNA polymerase II) recruitment, whereas Elp3 exerted its roles mainly through affecting RNAPII elongation. These results provide insights into the effects of Gcn5 and Elp3 in hsp70 gene transcription and underscore the importance of histone acetylation for transcriptional initiation and elongation in hsp genes. © The Authors.

33644994349	Transcription factors Ets2 and Sp1 act synergistically with histone acetyltransferase p300 in activating human interleukin-12 p40 promoter	There has been considerable interest in researching the regulatory mechanisms that control the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-12, which plays a central role in the differentiation of T-helper-1 cells. In this study, we performed a series of transient transfection experiments designed to elucidate the functional relationship between the IL-12 promoter-specific transcription factors (Ets2 and Sp1) and histone acetylation modification in IL-12 regulation mediated by p300 and various histone deacetylases (HDACs). Results presented in this report demonstrated that the transcription factors Ets2 and Sp1 acted synergistically with p300 to activate the human IL-12 promoter. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300 was required for this synergic effect, because the adenovirus E1 A protein inhibited the synergy. Conversely, HDACs repressed the synergic effect of transcription factors and histone acetylation on the activation of IL-12, while p300 was able to rectify it. These data indicated that Ets2 and Sp1 worked concertedly and synergistically with p300 in the regulation of human IL-12 expression. ©Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

34247377391	Actin and nuclear myosin I are associated with RNAP II and function in gene transcription	The presence of actin in the nucleus as well as its functions in various nuclear processes has been made clear in the past few years. Actin is known to be a part of chromatin-remodeling complexes BAF, which are required for maximal ATPase activity of the Brg1 component of the BAF complex. Moreover, the essential roles of actin in transcription mediated by RNA polymerases I, II and III have been demonstrated recently. On the other hand, a myosin I isoform, which contains a unique NH2-terminal extension for nucleus localization, has been specifically localized in nucleus. As is well known, myosin I is an actin-binding protein and plays an important role in various cellular activities. Though actin and nuclear myosin I (NM I) have been implicated to play distinct roles in gene expression, there has been no evidence for the actin-myosin interaction that might be involved in gene transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). Here we show evidence that both actin and NM I are associated with RNAP II in nucleus by using co-localization and co-IP assays, and they may act together on gene transcription. The antibodies against β-actin or NM I can block RNA synthesis in a eukaryotic in vitro transcription system with template DNA comprising the promoter and the coding region of human autocrine motility factor receptor (hAMFR) gene; the antibodies pre-adsorbed with purified actin and NM I have no effect in transcriptional inhibition, indicating that the inhibition of transcription by anti-actin and anti-NM I is specific. These results suggest a direct involvement of actin-myosin complexes in regulating transcription. It also implicates that actin and NM I may co-exist in a same complex with RNAP II and the interaction of RNAP II with actin and NM I functions in the RNAP II-mediated transcription. © 2007 Science in China Press.

4344708309	Actin is closely associated with RNA polymerase II and involved in activation of gene transcription	Biochemical and morphological studies have demonstrated the presence of actin in the nucleus of different eukaryotic cells, whereas its role remains unclear. In this work, we studied the interaction and the functional relationship between nuclear actin and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). The immunofluorescence study demonstrated a clear co-localization of nuclear actin with RNAP II in HeLa cells. Meanwhile, actin can be immunoprecipitated by anti-RNAP II antibody, indicating that they could interact with each other. Treatment of cells with α-amanitin induced the formation of actin bundle network in the nucleoplasm. Blocking of the formation of filamentous actin (F-actin) by cytochalasin B modified the distribution of actin. Although the actin content remained unchanged in resting and concanavalinA stimulated mouse lymphocytes, the actin content in the nuclei showed a progressive increase after stimulation. Furthermore, the antibody against actin blocked RNA synthesis in a eukaryotic in vitro transcription system. These observations implicate that nuclear actin interacts with RNAP II and may have function on the RNAP II-mediated transcription. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

48749110071	Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type O (PTPRO) is co-regulated by E2F1 and miR-17-92	PTPRO is often silenced by DNA hypermethylation in primary human tumors and cancer cell lines and functions as a tumor suppressor. Here we show that PTPRO is a target of E2F1. In addition, the microRNA cluster miR-17-92, another target of E2F1, participates in PTPRO regulation. PTPRO mRNA was up-regulated during S phase in synchronized HeLa cells and in vitro PTPRO promoter activity is high in early S phase while the PTPRO 3′UTR reporter activity is low in late S phase. This study provides evidence that the PTPRO gene is co-regulated by both E2F1 and miR-17-92. © 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

48749127300	Sodium butyrate activates erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene through Sp1 elements at its promoter	Sodium butyrate (NaBu) has been shown to induce erythroid cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in NaBu-induced activation of erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene (ALAS2). We showed that NaBu upregulated ALAS2 gene transcription in different cell lineages. By using site-directed mutagenesis of putative responsive elements at ALAS2 promoter and reporter gene analysis, we identified that the Sp1 binding sites within the ALAS2 promoter were responsive to NaBu stimulation. Results from the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that upon the NaBu stimulation, binding of Sp1 protein to ALAS2 promoter increased significantly, with concurrent increases in acetylation level of histone H3 and dimethylation level of H3-Lysine4 at ALAS2 promoter. Also, our data suggested that HDAC1 may be a target enzyme of NaBu action. © 2008.

5144220165	Histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 enhances the activation of IL-12 p40 promoter	Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by macrophages in response to intracellular pathogens and provides an obligatory signal for the differentiation of T-helper-1 cells. p300 is an important histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Whether p300 plays a role in the IL-12 expression has not been investigated before. In this study, we analyzed the roles of p300 in the regulation of human IL-12 p40. By using RT-PCR and a series of co-transfection studies, we found that p300 had a stimulating effect on the expression of endogenous IL-12 p40 mRNA and on the activity of IL-12 p40 promoter. We also showed that the HAT activity of p300 was essential to its function in regulating IL-12 promoter, since the mutant p300 with the HAT domain deleted did not have such a stimulation effect. In addition, the adenovirus E1A protein suppressed the p300 function, whereas the mutant E1A lacking the p300 interaction domain did not. Furthermore, p300 was able to reinforce the c-Rel-mediated activation of IL-12 p40. Results presented in this paper implicate that p300 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of IL-12 p40, and IL-12 p40 is one of the target genes of p300. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

53849135917	The genomic landscapes of histone H3-Lys9 modifications of gene promoter regions and expression profiles in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of nonembryonic origins possess the proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation potentials. It has been established that epigenetic mechanisms could be critical for determining the fate of stem cells, and MSCs derived from different origins exhibited different expression profiles individually to a certain extent. In this study, ChIP-on-chip was used to generate genome-wide histone H3-Lys9 acetylation and dimethylation profiles at gene promoters in human bone marrow MSCs. We showed that modifications of histone H3-Lys9 at gene promoters correlated well with mRNA expression in human bone marrow MSCs. Functional analysis revealed that many key cellular pathways in human bone marrow MSC self-renewal, such as the canonical signaling pathways, cell cycle pathways and cytokine related pathways may be regulated by H3-Lys9 modifications. These data suggest that gene activation and silencing affected by H3-Lys9 acetylation and dimethylation, respectively, may be essential to the maintenance of human bone marrow MSC self-renewal and multi-potency. © 2008 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

59649121111	Recruitment of HDAC4 by transcription factor YY1 represses HOXB13 to affect cell growth in AR-negative prostate cancers	HOXB13 is a homeodomain protein implicated to play a role in growth arrest in AR (androgen receptor)-negative prostate cancer cells. Expression of HOXB13 is restricted to the AR-expressing prostate cells. In this report, we demonstrate that the HDAC inhibitor NaB (sodium butyrate) was able to induce cell growth arrest and to increase HOXB13 expression in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. We also show that both HDAC4 and YY1 participated in the repression of HOXB13 expression through an epigenetic mechanism involving histone acetylation modification. Specifically, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HDAC4 and YY1 formed a complex. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays verified that HDAC4 was recruited to HOXB13 promoter by YY1. Moreover, promoter truncation and point mutation studies determined that the two proximal YY1 binding sites on the HOXB13 promoter were essential for the recruitments of YY1 and HDAC4. Data presented in this report suggest that YY1 and HDAC4 affected cell growth by repressing transcriptional regulation of HOXB13 through an epigenetic modification of histones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Deregulation of Wnt signaling pathway is a hallmark of colorectal cancer. Our results showed that the expression level of SOX7 was frequently down-regulated in human colorectal cancer cell lines and in primary colorectal tumor tissues, and the SOX7 silencing was partially due to the aberrant DNA methylation of the gene. Restoration of SOX7 induced colorectal cancer cell apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. In addition, SOX7 efficiently suppressed β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

66949171025	Histone acetyltransferase p300 regulates the expression of human pituitary tumor transforming gene (hPTTG)	The human pituitary tumor transforming gene (hPTTG) serves as a marker for malignancy grading in several cancers. hPTTG is involved in multiple cellular pathways including cell transformation, apoptosis, DNA repair, genomic instability, mitotic control and angiogenesis induction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hPTTG regulation have not been fully explored. In this study, we found that overexpression of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 upregulated hPTTG at the levels of promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, the HAT activity of p300 was critical for its regulatory function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that overexpression of p300 elevated the level of histone H3 acetylation on the hPTTG promoter. Additionally, the NF-Y sites at the hPTTG promoter exhibited a synergistic effect on upregulation of hPTTG through interacting with p300. We also found that treatment of 293T cells with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) increased hPTTG promoter activity. Meanwhile, we provided evidence that HDAC3 decreased hPTTG promoter activity. These data implicate an important role of the histone acetylation modification in the regulation of hPTTG. © 2009 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

66449087481	BMP4-Smad signaling pathway mediates adriamycin-induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells	Cell senescence, an irreversible cell cycle arrest, reflects a safeguard program that limits the capacity of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Treatment of tumor cells with certain chemotherapeutic agents activates premature senescence to decrease the tumorigenecity. Here we show that sublethal concentrations of adriamycin could induce premature senescence in lung cancer cells. Adriamycin treatment resulted in the up-regulation of BMP4, which is underexpressed in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancers). Moreover, the BMP4-Smad pathway played a key role in mediating adriamycin-induced senescence. Overexpression of BMP4 was able to induce premature senescence in lung cancer cells and this process required the participation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p16

69449102520	Genome-wide analysis of histone H3 lysine9 modifications in human mesenchymal stem cell osteogenic differentiation	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation potentials. It has been established that epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications could be critical for determining the fate of stem cells. In this study, full human genome promoter microarrays and expression microarrays were used to explore the roles of histone modifications (H3K9Ac and H3K9Me2) upon the induction of MSC osteogenic differentiation. Our results revealed that the enrichment of H3K9Ac was decreased globally at the gene promoters, whereas the number of promoters enriched with H3K9Me2 was increased evidently upon osteogenic induction. By a combined analysis of data from both ChIP-on-chip and expression microarrays, a number of differentially expressed genes regulated by H3K9Ac and/or H3K9Me2 were identified, implicating their roles in several biological events, such as cell cycle withdraw and cytoskeleton reconstruction that were essential to differentiation process. In addition, our results showed that the vitamin D receptor played a trans-repression role via alternations of H3K9Ac and H3K9Me2 upon MSC osteogenic differentiation. Data from this study suggested that gene activation and silencing controlled by changes of H3K9Ac and H3K9Me2, respectively, were crucial to MSC osteogenic differentiation. © 2009 Tan et al.

76149135992	Vitamin D stimulates apoptosis in gastric cancer cells in synergy with trichostatin A/sodium butyrate-induced and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-induced PTEN upregulation	Previous studies have shown an anticancer effect of vitamin D, but the mechanisms underlying this action have not been fully explored. Here we show that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3, the active form of vitamin D) significantly promoted apoptosis in the undifferentiated gastric cancer cell line HGC-27, and this was accompanied by a concurrent increase in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) expression on VD3 treatment. In contrast, knockdown of PTEN expression by stable transfection of PTEN small interfering RNA greatly decreased the apoptosis rate. We further demonstrated that VD3 induced PTEN expression through vitamin D receptor. In addition, our evidence showed that vitamin D receptor, Egr-1 and p300 induced PTEN expression in a synergistic fashion. Furthermore, we found that the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and sodium butyrate and the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine played important roles in vitamin D-induced apoptosis through PTEN upregulation. The data presented in this article suggest potential benefits of vitamin D in gastric cancer therapies in association with the use of trichostatin A/sodium butyrate and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. © 2010 FEBS.

77953248068	HDAC4 inhibits the transcriptional activation of mda-7/IL-24 induced by Sp1	Melanoma differentiation-associated gene/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) is a cytokine that can activate monocytes and T helper 2 cells. The expression of mda-7/IL-24 gradually fades with the progression of melanoma, and it is undetectable at the metastatic stage. Ectopic expression of mda-7/IL-24 selectively suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in cancer cells with little harm to normal cells. However, the transcriptional regulation of the mda-7/IL-24 gene has not been extensively studied. In this study, we show that the expression of mda-7/IL-24 was upregulated by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaBu), whereas it was downregulated by HDAC4. We also found that the histone acetylation level and the binding of the transcriptional factor Sp1 to the mad-7 promoter were reduced upon HDAC4 treatment. Moreover, the HDAC inhibitor TSA induced histone hyperacetylation and stimulated Sp1 binding to the mda-7/IL-24 promoter, which in turn enhanced the expression of mda-7/IL-24. Therefore, we conclude that histone acetylation modification plays an important role in the regulation of mda-7/IL-24 and that the transcription factor Sp1 participates in this process. © 2010 CSI and USTC.

78149363293	Activation of RASSF2A by p300 induces late apoptosis through histone hyperacetylation	Both RASSF2A (Ras-associated family 2A) and p300 are implicated in apoptosis. However, little is known about the interrelationship between these two proteins in induction of apoptosis. Here we show that p300 was able to induce late apoptosis through up-regulation of RASSF2A in human gastric cancer cells SGC-7901 (p53-mutant). Our data demonstrated that p300 stimulated RASSF2A expression in 293T cells in cooperation with the transcription factor Sp1. Results of ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays revealed that p300 induced histones H3 and H4 hyperacetylation at RASSF2A promoter. Moreover, p300 and Sp1 reciprocally facilitated their binding to RASSF2A promoter. Overall, data arising from this study indicate that Sp1-mediated RASSF2A gene transcription is activated by p300 through histone acetylation, and this activation plays an important role in inducing late apoptosis. © The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2010 Portland Press Limited.

78649259258	c-Myc attenuates the ability of doxorubicin to reduce the colony formation partially through regulating Nbs1 in U2OS cells	c-Myc is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates a wide variety of genes involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. It was demonstrated that over-expressions of c-Myc and Nbsl attenuated the ability of doxorubicin in reduction of colony formation in U2OS cells, and it was found that this effect of c-Myc was associated with Nbsl. It can be confirmed that Nbs1 is a target gene of c-Myc. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that c-Myc recruited the histone acetyltransferase p300 complex to the promoter region of Nbs1 gene, resulting in an increased level of acetylated histone H4. Furthermore, it was found that the two proximal E-box elements located in Nbs1 promoter region were essential for the c-Myc binding. Thus, it was concluded that c-Myc attenuates the effect of doxorubicin partially through regulating Nbs1, implicating its roles in repair of DNA breakage induced by doxorubicin.

78651327656	Role of p38 MAPK pathway in BMP4-mediated Smad-dependent premature senescence in lung cancer cells	BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) is a multifunctional cytokine known to exert its biological effects through a variety of signalling pathways. The diverse function of BMP4 appears to be due to multiple pathways activated by BMP4 itself. Our previous studies have demonstrated that BMP4 is able to drive lung cancer cells into a process of premature senescence; however, the signalling pathways, as well their interplays and roles associated with this process, are not well understood. To address these questions, in the present study we investigated the signalling and molecular mechanisms underlying the BMP4-induced senescence, and our data demonstrated that p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and Smad pathways were necessary for this process. Meanwhile, the ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) pathway, which is required for senescence, was not activated by BMP4 in the lung cancer cell line NCI-H460. We also showed that the BMP4-responsive R-Smads (receptor-regulated Smads), i.e. Smad1 and Smad5, were necessary for the up-regulation of p16

Among them, PAC-320, a new tri-organic-tin-substitute germanotungstate, displayed remarkable extracellular inhibitory activity. Meanwhile, the crystal structure of PAC-320 was characterized by X-ray crystallography. PAC-320 could stably exist under physiological conditions as revealed by UV spectrum, CV and TG. PAC-320 possessed a strong inhibitory effect to intracellular HDAC activity. More significantly, PAC-320 inhibited the growth of a variety of cancer cells, and exhibited remarkable anticancer effect in a hepatocarcinoma H22 cell mice model. This study revealed, for the first time, that the HDAC inhibitory activity is a mechanism by which POMs exert their anticancer effect. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

79960888055	NEDD9 is a positive regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes invasion in aggressive breast cancer	Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in many biological processes. The latest studies revealed that aggressive breast cancer, especially the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype was frequently associated with apparent EMT, but the mechanisms are still unclear. NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L is a member of the Cas protein family and was identified as a metastasis marker in multiple cancer types. In this study, we wished to discern the role of NEDD9 in breast cancer progression and to investigate the molecular mechanism by which NEDD9 regulates EMT and promotes invasion in triple-negative breast cancer. We showed that expression of NEDD9 was frequently upregulated in TNBC cell lines, and in aggressive breast tumors, especially in TNBC subtype. Knockdown of endogenous NEDD9 reduced the migration, invasion and proliferation of TNBC cells. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of NEDD9 in mammary epithelial cells led to a string of events including the trigger of EMT, activation of ERK signaling, increase of several EMT-inducing transcription factors and promotion of their interactions with the E-cadherin promoter. Data presented in this report contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by which NEDD9 promotes EMT, and provide useful clues to the evaluation of the potential of NEDD9 as a responsive molecular target for TNBC chemotherapy. © 2011 Kong et al.

79960270982	SMAD-4 cooperates with TGF-β to enhance PTEN expression upon the inhibition of RAS/ERK pathway in gastric carcinoma cells	SMAD-4 plays an important role in tumor suppression though controversies still exist regarding its behavior in carcinogenesis and its relationship with the phosphate and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which is regarded as a key controller of cell cycle progression and cell growth. In this study, we investigated the role of SMAD-4 on PTEN expression through TGF-β signaling in 293T cells and in malignant gastric carcinoma MGC-803 cells. Results showed that SMAD-4 and TGF-β enhanced the expression of PTEN in 293T cells, while they suppressed PTEN expression in MGC-803 cells. However, this suppression was relieved upon the inhibition of RAS/ERK pathway. Moreover, the maximum expression of PTEN was achieved by the cooperation of SMAD-4 with TGF-β when SMAD-4 was translocated into the nucleus. Enhancement of early apoptosis of about three folds was achieved with this cooperation, compared with the action of TGF-β alone in MGC-803 cells. These findings shed light on the role of SMAD-4 as a co-Smad protein in TGF-β protein-signaling and in PTEN regulation.

METHODS: The cell survival percentage was examined by MTT (Moto-nuclear cell direc cytotoxicity) assay. SOX7 expression was assessed by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. SB203580 was used to inhibit the p38MAPK signal pathway. SOX7 promoter activity was detected by Luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: SOX7 was upregulated by aspirin and was involved in aspirin-mediated growth inhibition of SW480 human colorectal cancer cells. The p38MAPK pathway played a role in aspirin-induced SOX7 expression, during which the AP1 transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos upregulated SOX7 promoter activities. RESULTS: SOX7 is upregulated by aspirin and is involved in aspirin-mediated growth inhibition of human colorectal cancer SW480 cells. © 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84856221154	FOXC1, a target of polycomb, inhibits metastasis of breast cancer cells	Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have recently been shown related to cancer development. The PcG protein EZH2 is involved in progression of prostate and breast cancers, and has been identified as a molecular marker in breast cancer. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which PcG proteins regulate cancer progression and malignant metastasis is still unclear. PcG proteins methylate H3K27 in undifferentiated epithelial cells, resulting in the repression of differentiation genes such as HOX. FOXC1 is a member of the Forkhead box transcription factor family, which plays an important role in differentiation, and is involved in eye development. We discovered in this study that the expression of FOXC1 gene was negatively correlated to that of PcG genes, i.e., Bmi1, EZH2, and SUZ12, in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. To investigate the regulatory effects of PcG proteins on FOXC1 gene, the two cell lines were transfected with either expression plasmids or siRNA plasmids of Bmi1, EZH2, and SUZ12, and we found that PcGs, especially EZH2, could repress the transcription of FOXC1 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that histone methylation and acetylation modifications played critical roles in this regulatory process. When FOXC1 was stably transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells, the migration and invasion of the cells were repressed. Moreover, the tumorigenicity and the spontaneous metastatic capability regulated by FOXC1 were determined by using an orthotropic xenograft tumor model of athymic mice with the FOXC1-MDA-MB-231HM and the GFP-MDA-MB-231HM cells, and the results showed that FOXC1 in MDA-MB-231HM cells inhibited migration and invasion in vitro and reduced the pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Data presented in this report contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by which EZH2 participates in tumor development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84861056097	TSA-induced JMJD2B downregulation is associated with cyclin B1-dependent survivin degradation and apoptosis in LNCap cells	Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are emerging as a novel class of anti-tumor agents and have manifested the ability to induce apoptosis of cancer cells, and a significant number of genes have been identified as potential effectors responsible for HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanistic actions of these HDAC inhibitors in this process remain largely undefined. We here report that the treatment of LNCap prostate cancer cells with HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in downregulation of the Jumonji domain-containing protein 2B (JMJD2B). We also found that the TSA-mediated decrease in survivin expression in LNCap cells was partly attributable to downregulation of JMJD2B expression. This effect was attributable to the promoted degradation of survivin protein through inhibition of Cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex-mediated survivin Thr34 phosphorylation. Consequently, knockdown of JMJD2B enhanced TSA-induced apoptosis by regulating the Cyclin B1-dependent survivin degradation to potentiate the apoptosis pathways. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0037311737	Histone acetylation and cancer	Alterations in chromatin structure by histone post-translational modifications appear to play a central role in the regulation of gene transcription. Histone modifications consist of methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquityination. Among them histone acetylation is of critical importance. The level of histone acetylation depends on the activity of two families of enzymes, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HATs, which is frequently part of multisubunit coactivator complexes, lead to the relaxation of chromatin structure and transcriptional activation, while HDACs tend to assciate with multisubunit compressor complexes, resulting in chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression of specific target genes. Chromosomal translocations are often associated with acute leukemias, and a significant number of translocations involve genes encoding HATs and HDACs. On the other hand, some histone acetylation-modifyng enzymes have been located within chromosomal regions that am particularly prone to chromosomal breaks. The recent achievements in studies aimed at elucidating the biological roles of histone acetylation modifying enzymes and their potential impacts on the molecular changes involved in the development of cancers are reviewed.

0036919737	Histone acetylation is involved in hsp70 gene transcription regulation in Drosophila melanogaster	The acetylation/deacetylation modifications of N-terminal tails of core histones play critical roles in activation/repression of many eukaryotic genes. However, the role of acetylation in transcription regulation of heat shock protein genes (hsp) is still a disputed issue. In this study, we investigated the influences of histone acetylation modification on changes in structure of polytene chromosomes and in expression of hsp70 gene in Drosophila melanogaster, by using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors Trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (BuA), and the heat shock treatment of larvae of the flies. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that both TSA and BuA were able to affect the chromatin structure at the site where hsp70 gene is located along the polytene chromosome. Furthermore, the HDAC inhibitors significantly promoted the hsp70 gene transcription, at an extent similar to that induced by heat shock. The immunofluorescence in situ localization study further confirmed that the hsp70 gene locus was hyperacetylated after the heat induction. We therefore conclude that histone acetylation can significantly enhance both the basal and the inducible expression of hsp70 gene in D. melanogaster and hence plays important roles in hsp gene regulation. This study has provided a basis and a framework for further investigations aimed at the establishment of the correlation between acetylation modification and hsp gene regulation. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

84876935488	The expression of Millettia pinnata chalcone isomerase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae salt-sensitive mutants enhances salt-tolerance	The present study demonstrates a new Millettia pinnata chalcone isomerase (MpCHI) whose transcription level in leaf was confirmed to be enhanced after being treated by seawater or NaCl (500 mM) via transcriptome sequencing and Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (QRT-PCR) analyses. Its full length cDNA (666 bp) was obtained by 3'-end and 5'-end Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE). The analysis via NCBI BLAST indicates that both aminoacid sequence and nucleotide sequence of the MpCHI clone share high homology with other leguminous CHIs (73%-86%). Evolutionarily, the phylogenic analysis further revealed that the MpCHI is a close relative of leguminous CHIs. The MpCHI protein consists of 221 aminoacid (23.64 KDa), whose peptide length, amino acid residues of substrate-binding site and reactive site are very similar to other leguminous CHIs reported previously. Two pYES2-MpCHI transformed salt-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants (Δnha1 and Δnhx1) showed improved salt-tolerance significantly compared to pYES2-vector transformed yeast mutants, suggesting the MpCHI or the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway could regulate the resistance to salt stress in M. pinnata. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84878254964	Enhancing cellulase production in Trichoderma reesei RUT C30 through combined manipulation of activating and repressing genes	To investigate whether enzyme production can be enhanced in the Trichoderma reesei industrial hyperproducer strain RUT C30 by manipulation of cellulase regulation, the positive regulator Xyr1 was constitutively expressed under the control of the strong T. reesei pdc promoter, resulting in significantly enhanced cellulase activity in the transformant during growth on cellulose. In addition, constitutive expression of xyr1 combined with downregulation of the negative regulator encoding gene ace1 further increased cellulase and xylanase activities. Compared with RUT C30, the resulting transformant exhibited 103, 114, and 134 % greater total secreted protein levels, filter paper activity, and CMCase activity, respectively. Surprisingly, strong increases in xyr1 basal expression levels resulted in very high levels of CMCase activity during growth on glucose. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of improving cellulase production by modifying regulator expression, and suggest an attractive new single-step approach for increasing total cellulase productivity in T. reesei. © 2013 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

84879023026	RNA interference with carbon catabolite repression in Trichoderma koningii for enhancing cellulase production	The cellulase and xylanase genes of filamentous Trichoderma fungi exist under carbon catabolite repression mediated by the regulator carbon catabolite repressor (CREI). Our objective was to find the role of CREI in a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant of Trichoderma koningii, and address whether enzyme production can be further improved by silencing the cre1 gene. cre1 partially silenced strains were constructed to improve enzyme production in T. koningii YC01, a cellulase-hyperproducing mutant. Silencing of cre1 resulted in derepression of cellulase gene expression in glucose-based cultivation. The cre1 interference strain C313 produced 2.1-, 1.4-, 0.8-, and 0.8-fold higher amounts of filter paper activity, β-1,4-exoglucanase activity (ρ-nitrophenyl-β-. d-cellobioside as substrate), β-1,4-endoglucanase activity (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as substrate), and xylanase activity, respectively, than the control strain, suggesting that silencing of cre1 resulted in enhanced enzyme production capability. In addition, downregulation of cre1 resulted in elevated expression of another regulator of xylanase and cellulase expression, xyr1, indicating that CREI also acted as a repressor of xyr1 transcription in T. koningii under inducing conditions. These results show that RNAi is a feasible method for analyzing the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and improving xylanase and cellulase productivity in T. koningii. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..

84882269557	Rb Protein is Essential to the Senescence-Associated Heterochromatic Foci Formation Induced by HMGA2 in Primary WI38 Cells	Cellular senescence is an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest that provides a barrier to neoplastic transformation. The integrity of the Rb (Retinoblastoma) pathway is necessary for the formation of the senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) that offers a molecular basis for the stability of the senescent state. Surprisingly, although high mobility group A2 protein (HMGA2) can promote tumorigenesis and inhibit Rb function in tumor cells, high-level expression of HMGA2 is sufficient to induce SAHF formation in primary cells. It therefore becomes significant to determine whether Rb protein is necessary in HMGA2-induced SAHF formation. In this study, we established the cellular senescence and SAHF assembly WI38 cell model by ectopic expression of HMGA2, in which typical senescent markers were seen, including notable upregulation of p53, p21 and p16, and elevated SA-β-galactosidase staining together with downregulation of E2F target genes. We then showed that the Rb pathway inhibitor E7 protein was able to partly abolish the ability of SAHF formation after HMGA2 expression in WI38 cells, indicating that Rb is a crucial factor for HMGA2-induced SAHF formation. However, Rb depletion did not completely rescue the cell growth arrest induced by HMGA2, suggesting that Rb is not an exclusive pathway for HMGA2-induced senescence in WI38 cells. © 2013.

84883444941	Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and retinoblastoma protein signalling is required for DNA damage-mediated formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci in tumour cells	DNA-damaging agents are able to induce irreversible cell growth arrest and senescence in some types of tumour cells, thus contributing to the static feature of cancer. However, senescent tumour cells may re-enter the cell cycle, leading to tumour relapse. Understanding the mechanisms that control the viability of senescent cells may be critical for tumour suppression. Primary human fibroblasts undergoing oncogene-induced or replicative senescence are known to form senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which contribute to the stability of the senescent state. However, it is unclear whether SAHF formation is universal in tumour cells. We report that the DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin were able to induce the formation of SAHF in some tumour cell types, and this induction was accompanied by activation of the retinoblastoma protein pathway. By contrast, tumour cells in which the retinoblastoma protein pathway could not be activated by doxorubicin or 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin failed to form SAHF. In parallel, tumour cells with deficient retinoblastoma protein were also unable to form SAHF. In addition, we show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 pathway was involved in tumour cell SAHF formation in response to doxorubicin and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin. Furthermore, HMG box transcription factor 1 (HBP1), a downstream target of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38-mediated senescence pathway, was required for SAHF formation. Taken together, the results of the present study highlight the roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38/retinoblastoma protein pathway in tumour cell SAHF formation in response to DNA-damaging agents, and provide new insights into the mechanisms of DNA damage-mediated tumour suppression. Structured digital abstract HBP1 physically interacts with RB by anti bait coimmunoprecipitation (View Interaction: 1, 2) DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin (Dox) and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) were able to induce SAHF in some tumor cell types, which was accompanied by activation of RB pathway. Contrarily, tumor cells in which the RB pathway could not be activated failed to form SAHF. In addition, p38 MAPK pathway was involved in tumor cell SAHF formation. Furthermore, HBP1 was required for SAHF formation. © 2013 FEBS.

84884676050	Establishment of an efficient RNA silencing system in Trichoderma koningii using DsRed as a reporter	We aimed to establish an efficient RNA interference (RNAi) system in the industrially important filamentous fungus Trichoderma koningii using the DsRed protein as a reporter of the silencing process. To accomplish this, a DsRed expression cassette was transformed into T. koningii, and a recombinant strain that stably expressed DsRed was obtained. Next, a vector-directing expression of a DsRed hairpin RNA was constructed and transformed into the T. koningii recipient strain. Approximately 79 % of transformants displayed a decrease in DsRed fluorescence, and expression of DsRed in some transformants appeared to be fully suppressed. Characterization of randomly selected transformants by genomic DNA PCR analysis, real-time PCR quantification, and western blot confirmed downregulation of gene expression at different levels. The RNA silencing approach described here for T. koningii is effective, and the DsRed reporter gene provides a convenient tool for identification of silenced fungal transformants by their DsRed fluorescence compared to the control strain. The results of this study demonstrate the power of RNAi in T. koningii, which supports the use of this technology for strain development programs and functional genomics studies in industrial fungal strains. © 2013 Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.

84886929234	CDK5 is essential for TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and breast cancer progression	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a change of cellular plasticity critical for embryonic development and tumor metastasis. CDK5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase playing important roles in cancer progression. Here we show that CDK5 is commonly overexpressed and significantly correlated with several poor prognostic parameters of breast cancer. We found that CDK5 participated in TGF-β1-induced EMT. In MCF10A, TGF-β1 upregulated the CDK5 and p35 expression, and CDK5 knockdown inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT. CDK5 overexpression also exhibited a potential synergy in promoting TGF-β1-induced EMT. In mesenchymal breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and BT549, CDK5 knockdown suppressed cell motility and tumorigenesis. We further demonstrated that CDK5 modulated cancer cell migration and tumor formation by regulating the phosphorylation of FAK at Ser-732. Therefore, CDK5-FAK pathway, as a downstream step of TGF-β1 signaling, is essential for EMT and motility in breast cancer cells. This study implicates the potential value of CDK5 as a molecular marker for breast cancer.

0039844695	Binding and interaction of histones and transcription factors on the promoter of hAMFR gene	In this study, histone H1, core histones H2A-H2B and H3-H4 were purified from chicken erythrocytes by hydroxy1apatile chromatography. The nuclear extract was prepared from HeLa cells. We investigated the binding and interaction of histones and transcription factors on the upstream sequence of human autocrine motility factor receptor (hAMFR) gene by gel shift mobility assay. We found that the binding of H1 on the promoter sequence of hAMFR gene was relatively stable. We propose that H1 plays an important role in stablizing chromatosome. We also found that histones and HeLa cell extract could form a ternary complex with the DNA template.

0040034877	Effects of the interaction between histone and hAMFR gene promoter on the transcription activity in vitro	The effects of interaction between histones and human autocrine motility factor receptor (hAMFR) gene promoter on the transcription activity in vitro was investigated by using histones purified from chicken erythrocytes, HeLa cell nuclear extracts and heat-treated supernatants of Xenopus eggs. The results showed that the competitive binding of histones and transcription factors at the promoter of hAMFR gene was very important to the transcription in vitro. If a pre-initiation complex was formed with HeLa cell nuclear extracts on the promoter prior to nucleosome assembly, it would prevent nucleosome-mediated transcription repression. When the nucleosome was assembled on the promoter in advance, the transcription activity could be repressed. When histones and HeLa cell nuclear extracts were mixed in the reaction simultaneously, the transcription activity would depend on the relative amount of histones to that of HeLa cell nuclear extracts.

84903785714	LincRNA-ROR induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and contributes to breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis	LncRNAs have critical roles in various biological processes ranging from embryonic development to human diseases, including cancer progression, although their detailed mechanistic functions remain illusive. The lncRNA linc-ROR has been shown to contribute to the maintenance of induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells. In this study, we discovered that linc-ROR was upregulated in breast tumor samples, and ectopic overexpression of linc-ROR in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells induced an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Moreover, we showed that linc-ROR enhanced breast cancer cell migration and invasion, which was accompanied by generation of stem cell properties. Contrarily, silencing of linc-ROR repressed breast tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, our data revealed that linc-ROR was associated with miRNPs and functioned as a competing endogenous RNA to mi-205. Specifically, linc-ROR prevented the degradation of mir-205 target genes, including the EMT inducer ZEB2. Thus our results indicate that linc-ROR functions as an important regulator of EMT and can promote breast cancer progression and metastasis through regulation of miRNAs. Potentially, the findings of this study implicate the relevance of linc-ROR as a possible therapeutic target for aggressive and metastatic breast cancers. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84907516355	PRMT7 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and promotes metastasis in breast cancer	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables metastasis. E-cadherin loss is a hallmark of EMT, but there remains an incomplete understanding of the epigenetics of this process. The protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 functions in various physiologic processes, including mRNA splicing, DNA repair, and neural differentiation, but its possible roles in cancer and metastasis have not been explored. In this report, we show that PRMT7 is expressed at higher levels in breast carcinoma cells and that elevated PRMT7 mediates EMT and metastasis. PRMT7 could inhibit the expression of E-cadherin by binding to its proximal promoter in a manner associated with altered histone methylation, specifically with elevated H4R3me2s and reduced H3K4me3, H3Ac, and H4Ac, which occurred at the E-cadherin promoter upon EMT induction. Moreover, PRMT7 interacted with YY1 and HDAC3 and was essential to link these proteins to the E-cadherin promoter. Silencing PRMT7 restored E-cadherin expression by repressing H4R3me2s and by increasing H3K4me3 and H4Ac, attenuating cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Overall, our results define PRMT7 as an inducer of breast cancer metastasis and present the opportunity for applying PRMT7-targeted therapeutics to treat highly invasive breast cancers.

10644242733	Histone acetylation regulates both transcription initiation and elongation of hsp22 gene in Drosophila	Histone acetylation is associated with transcriptional activation of many genes. However, the role of acetylation in transcriptional regulation of heat shock protein genes (hsp) still remains an obscure issue. Here we examined the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs), trichostatin A, and sodium butyrate, on changes in acetylation level of core histones and on expression of hsp22 gene in Drosophila melanogaster. The results showed that both HDIs elevated the acetylation level of histone H3. By using the chromatin immunoprecipitation, we located the HDI-induced H3 hyperacetylation at both the promoter and the downstream of RNA polymerase II of the transcribing hsp22 gene. Meanwhile, the elevated acetylation level increased the accessibility of heat shock factor to target cis-acting regulatory sites. We conclude that histone acetylation stimulates the transcription initiation and promotes the transcription elongation, thereby up-regulating both basal and inducible expression of hsp22 in D. melanogaster. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

10344221614	Trichostatin A extends the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster by elevating hsp22 expression	The level of acetylation of histones in nucleosomes is related to the longevity of yeast and animals. However, the mechanisms by which acetylation and deacetylation affect longevity remain unclear. In present study, we investigated the influence of histone acetylation modification on the expression of hsp22 gene and the lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster using histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA). The results showed that TSA could extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, TSA significantly promoted the hsp22 gene transcription, and affected the chromatin morphology at the locus of hsp22 gene along the polytene chromosome. Present data implicate that TSA may affect the lifespan of Drosophila through changing the level of histone acetylation and influencing the expression of hsp22 gene that is related to aging.
