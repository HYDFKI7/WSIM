84926395357	Emissions of mercury and other trace elements from a coal-fired power plant	This paper provides details concerning emissions of mercury and other trace elements conducted at a coal-fired power plant with SCR and wet FGD. Mercury emission concentration and its speciation were measured with Ontario Hydro Method (OHM) and Semi-continuous emission monitor (SCEM). The emission of trace elements was determined by EPA method 29. Mercury mass balance and partitioning of trace elements were analyzed based on the analyses of solid samples (such as: coal, bottom ash, fly ash, and flue gas desulphurization (FGD) slurry) and concentration of trace elements in the flue gas. The results indicated that total mercury (Hg

25144495147	Experimental study on drying characteristics of wet fly ash	Granularity analysis of fly ash was done and its physical properties were measured. Many experiments were conducted in different drying conditions, the data were regressed, and the equations of drying characteristic of fly ash were established. The main factors that influenced drying rate and the heat and mass transfer were analyzed. The experimental results show that the water contained in fly ash is unbound water, and the influence of temperature and air speed on drying rate is obvious; the accumulational fly ash has not three classical drying stages when it is dried by through drying. The experimental results can also offer some basis for the design of coal fly-ash dryer.

33746166713	Kinematic model building and servo parameter identification of 3-HSS parallel mechanism	Aiming at a parallel mechanism with three degrees of freedom, a method for dynamic model building and the parameter identification of its servosystem is presented. First, the reverse solution models of position, velocity, and acceleration of parallelogram branch structure are deduced, and then, its dynamic model of a rigid body is set up by using the virtual work principle. Based on the above model, a method to identify the servo parameter of the parallel mechanism is put up. In this method, the triangle-shaped input with variable frequency is adopted to offset the disadvantages of pseudorandom number sequence in parameter identification, such as dramatically changing the vibration amplitude of the motor, easily impacting the motor that results in its velocity loop to easily open, and so on. Moreover, the rotary inertia can also be identified by the additive mass. The abovementioned data will lay a solid foundation for the optimum performance of the system in the whole workspace. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2006.

33749127460	Oxidative injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in total parenteral nutrition-associated liver dysfunction	Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of oxidative injury and apoptosis on total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-associated hepatic dysfunction. Methods: Fifty-nine New Zealand rabbits (6-8 days old) were divided into 4 groups: 12 in the control group (maternal fed), 15 in the PN-3 group (TPN for 3 days), 14 in the PN-7 group (TPN for 7 days), and 18 in the PN-10 group (TPN for 10 days). At the end of the experiment, blood biochemistry analysis and histologic examination of the liver were performed; the malondialdehyde content of liver tissues was determined and hepatocyte apoptosis was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay. Results: We found that the serum level of direct bilirubin became higher as PN duration was extended. The light microscopy features in the PN-3 and PN-7 groups included inflammatory cells infiltrated in portal areas and some degeneration changes, whereas in the PN-10 group, cholestasis (proliferation of bile ducts and bile pigments in hepatocytes) or diffuse steatosis was shown. Electron microscopic manifestation in PN groups included reduced numbers of microvilli and some preapoptosis changes. Both the malondialdehyde content and apoptosis index were the highest in the PN-10 group; there were more apoptotic hepatocytes in the groups with longer PN duration. Conclusions: The longer the TPN duration, the more severe the liver injury. Both oxidative injury and apoptosis may play important roles in the mechanism of TPN-associated hepatic dysfunction. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33751091776	Whole workspace optimization based parameter tuning of high-speed parallel manipulator controller	A new tuning method of constant PID parameters for parallel manipulator is investigated. Considering the mechatronics coupling, characteristics of the whole workspace and variable inertia load along with the pose, three trajectories with different weights are selected. Then inverse kinematics and inverse dynamic model are set up by using vector method and virtual power principle. Making the minimized following trajectory errors of end effector as optimized goal, the controller parameters could be tuned. An example is adopted with one parallel manipulator-Diamond which is developed by Tianjin University, and the values of controller parameters can be given according to the above theory. The problem that the multiobjective functions contradict each other is also solved. At last, a series of experiments are done for validating the correctness and validity of the theory.

33847035505	Study of mercury oxidation by a selective catalytic reduction catalyst in a pilot-scale slipstream reactor at a utility boiler burning bituminous coal	One of the cost-effective mercury control technologies in coal-fired power plants is the enhanced oxidation of elemental mercury in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) followed by the capture of the oxidized mercury in the wet scrubber. To better understand Hg oxidation chemistry within a SCR, the Institute for Combustion Science and Environmental Technology at Western Kentucky University set up a pilot-scale SCR slipstream facility at a selected utility boiler burning bituminous coal. The greatest benefit of this scaled-down SCR slipstream test is the ability to investigate the effects of Hg oxidation in a SCR using actual flue gas with fly ash included and to isolate and control specific flue-gas compositions with spike gas additions. The average sulfur, chlorine, and mercury contents in the burned coal were 1.67% and 731 and 0.13 ppm, respectively. CaO and Fe

34547097529	Motor-mechanism dynamic model based neural network optimized computed torque control of a high speed parallel manipulator	There are wide applications of the parallel manipulators in the industry field because of the high speed and accuracy, but difficulties are also unavoidable in the controlling process for the systematic time-varying and coupling characteristics. Therefore, the approaches for better control performance are vital to the application of parallel manipulator. In this paper, one newly invented 2-DOF (degree of freedom) parallel manipulator called Diamond 600 is investigated as an objective for Pick and Place operation. Firstly, the dynamic model of mechanism and servo driving subsystems are formulated using virtual work principle and field orient control principle, respectively. According to the equivalent torque principle, a mechatronic (motor-mechanism coupling) dynamic model is deduced for real-time control. Secondly, the neural network optimized computed torque control algorithm is described in detail for the proposed coupling model. At last, a series of numerical simulations and experiments are carried out, respectively, to prove the validity of the above methods, and results verify the favourable tracking ability and robustness. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

34547828825	Nutrition assessment in children with short bowel syndrome weaned off parenteral nutrition: a long-term follow-up study	Purpose: The purpose of the study was to assess long-term growth and nutrition status of children with neonatal short bowel syndrome (SBS) after weaning off parenteral nutrition (PN). Methods: Eight children with neonatal SBS weaned from PN therapy for more than 2 years were studied. Medical records were reviewed; anthropometric measurements and blood test (hemoglobin, albumin and prealbumin, immunoglobulin, electrolytes, trace elements, and fat-soluble vitamins) were assayed during follow-up. Results: Anthropometric measurements, weight for age, and height for age were normal in all children; one child was found to be overweight according to weight for height z score. No children were found to have anemia, although one presented with macrocytosis and another had microcytosis. Low serum concentrations of zinc in 3 cases and iron in 1 case were detected. Immunoglobulin levels of all children were within the reference value. Low plasma levels of vitamin A in 2 cases, vitamin E in 4 cases, and β-carotene in 2 cases were found; one of them had obviously low levels of the 3 fat-soluble vitamins. Conclusion: Children with SBS are still at risk for different nutrient malabsorption even after weaning off PN for a long time. Therefore, they need long-term, regular monitoring and intensive nutritional care to prevent various nutrient deficiencies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

36849060523	Evaluation of mercury sorbents in a lab-scale multiphase flow reactor, a pilot-scale slipstream reactor and full-scale power plant	Due to its adverse effects on human health and ecosystem, mercury emission from the coal-fired utility boiler has been generating more and more concern. Sorbent injection upstream of the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or bag-house has been deemed one of the recommended mature technologies to reduce mercury emission. Before a sorbent is used in practice, its mercury capture ability needs to be evaluated, but has until recently only been demonstrated in bench-, pilot- or full-scale experiments separately. In this paper, a lab-scale multiphase flow reactor and a pilot-scale slipstream reactor were set up and conducted such evaluation on the two scales. After that, some kinds of sorbents were injected at a full-scale power station. The experimental results show that the lab- and pilot-scale reactor systems in this paper can provide accurate information of sorbent evaluation under flue gas atmosphere. There was significant difference between the mercury removal efficiency of tested sorbents, varying from 98.3% down to 23%. SO

77954251907	Electrostatic separation for recycling waste printed circuit board: A study on external factor and a robust design for optimization	Electrostatic separation is an effective and environmentally friendly method for recycling waste printed circuit board (PCB) by several kinds of electrostatic separators. However, some notable problems have been detected in its applications and cannot be efficiently resolved by optimizing the separation process. Instead of the separator itself, these problems are mainly caused by some external factors such as the nonconductive powder (NP) and the superficial moisture of feeding granule mixture. These problems finally lead to an inefficient separation. In the present research, the impacts of these external factors were investigated and a robust design was built to optimize the process and to weaken the adverse impact. A most robust parameter setting (25 kv, 80 rpm) was concluded from the experimental design. In addition, some theoretical methods, including cyclone separation, were presented to eliminate these problems substantially. This will contribute to efficient electrostatic separation of waste PCB and make remarkable progress for industrial applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

84861525162	Influence factors of energy metabolism and nutritional risk screening in patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer	Objective: To evaluate the possible factors that may influence the resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer. Methods: Totally, 40 patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer were prospectively collected from November 2008 to June 2009 in Xinhua Hospital. Nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002) was performed. REE and body composition were measured using indirect calo-rimetry and bioeletrical impedence method, respectively. Results: Twenty-seven (67.5%) patients were found with nutrition risk, and NRS score was negatively correlated with prealbumin (r=-0.444, P=0.004) and albumin levels (r=-0.386, P=0.014). Measured REE and predicted REE values were (6770 ± 1360) and (6021 ± 841) kJ/d, respectively (P<0.001). Among all 40 patients, 57.5% of them were hypermetabolic, 30.0% were normal, and 12.5% were hypometabolic. Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that fat free mass was the only significant determinant variable for REE (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Fat free mass is a factor than can influence the energy metabolism in patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer.

Results show that the difference of unburned carbon content among three samples may be caused by different coal types, combustion conditions and unit parameters. For fly ash from the same power plant, its adsorption capability on flue gas mercury basically keeps the same before and after burning test. Besides unburned carbon in fly ash, residuals have also some effects on mercury adsorption. Fly ash with higher content of unburned carbon has also higher adsorption efficiency on flue gas mercury.

Six graphite models with increasing sizes up to seven-fused ring are used to study the effect of molecular size on mercury adsorption. The calculated results show that high-mirror systematical molecule presents positive effect of mercury adsorption on brominated carbonaceous surface. Then, the seven-fused ring is selected to model a carbonaceous surface. Five types of brominated carbonaceous surfaces and pure carbonaceous surface are studied to evaluate the effect of bromine addition on mercury adsorption.

The studied results have demonstrated that different flow characteristics in the reactor affect the mercury speciation distribution in the flue gas, and it also affects the mercury removal efficiency. The possible reasons are that different flow characteristics makes the contents in the flue gas be with different resident time in the reactor and affects the chemical reaction between the contents with mercury, so that mercury speciation distribution in flue gas changes. The results will help improve mercury removal efficiency through optimizing the flow field in the duct so as to reduce mercury pollution emission in the flue gas.

48249150276	Electrostatic separation for recovering metals and nonmetals from waste printed circuit board: Problems and improvements	Electrostatic separation is an effective and environmentally friendly method for recycling comminuted waste printed circuit boards (PCB). As a classical separator, the roll-type corona-electrostatic separator (RTS) has some advantages in this field. However, there are still some notable problems, such as the middling products and their further treatment, impurity of nonconductive products because of the aggregation of fine particles, and stability of the separation process and balance between the production capacity and the separation quality. To overcome these problems, a conception of two-step separation is presented, and a new two-roll type corona-electrostatic separator (T-RTS) was built. As compared to RTS, the conductive products increase by 8.9%, the middling products decrease by 45%, and the production capacity increases by 50% in treating comminuted PCB wastes by T-RTS. In addition, the separation process in T-RTS is more stable. Therefore, T-RTS is a promising separator for recycling comminuted PCB. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

51249088146	The effects of high fat on central appetite genes in Wistar rats: A microarray analysis	Background: To evaluate the effects of high fat on central appetite regulatory genes in Wistar rats by microarray. Methods: Sixteen male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control (15% energy from fat) and high-fat (60% energy from fat) diets for 12 weeks. Body weight and food intake were recorded. Plasma leptin, ghrelin and insulin were measured by radioimmunoassay method. The expression of 111 appetite regulatory genes in the hypothalamus was evaluated by microarray and six genes, including leptin receptor, insulin receptor, orexin, NPY, AgRP, MC-4R, were further evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Body weight increased significantly in HF group compared with control group, whereas energy intake was similar in the two groups. HF had a time dependent effect on plasma leptin, but insulin and ghrelin level remained stable throughout the study. A positive relation was also found between body weight and plasma leptin (r = 0.88, P < 0.01). The expression of 27 appetite genes in the hypothalamus was significantly affected by HF diet. However, only the expression of leptin receptor was confirmed lower in HF group than that in control by real-time PCR, which suggested that lower expression of leptin receptor might be another reason for leptin resistance. Conclusions: HF diet fed rats demonstrated leptin resistance, which could be targeted for obesity treatment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the robustness of the classical roll-type separator is vulnerable because of its sensitivity to variation of granule size. A new "two-roll type corona-electrostatic separator" was built to overcome the limitation of the classical one considering the actual situation of the industrial application which always contains granule with different size. Multi-size granule of crushed printed circuit board (PCB) wastes was used for investigation and the results showed that the efficiency of the separation process was improved by using the new separator. Compared with the process (lower voltage) performed on the old separator, the metal products increased 34% while the middling products reduced 73%, respectively. Compared with the process (higher voltage) performed on the old separator, the metal products increased 22% while the middling products reduced 59%, respectively. In addition, the metal component of the middling products using new machine notably decreased, 33% (new machine) compared with 58% (lower voltage) and 66% (higher voltage).

A jet-flow aeration technique is proposed for use in the forced oxidation process of limestone/gypsum WFGD system. Moreover, a theoretical analysis is conducted of the gas/liquid interphase mass-transfer features of the jet-flow aeration forced-oxidation process by the use of a dual film theory. The results of the analysis indicate that a jet-flow aerator as a kind of mixing device for the chemical reaction mass-transfer of gas/liquid two-phase media can give full play to its intensive mixing action, thus enhancing energy comprehensive utilization rate. The calculation results of the energy consumption of a WFGD project show that the adoption of the jet-flow aeration mode has resulted in energy-savings of more than 20%. The reduction of desulfurization cost is conducive to promoting the domestic manufacture of key desulfurization equipment.

62649165909	Impact of nonconductive powder on electrostatic separation for recycling crushed waste printed circuit board	The electrostatic separation is an effective and environmentally friendly method for recycling metals and nonmetals from crushed printed circuit board (PCB) wastes. However, it still confronts some problems brought by nonconductive powder (NP). Firstly, the NP is fine and liable to aggregate. This leads to an increase of middling products and loss of metals. Secondly, the stability of separation process is influenced by NP. Finally, some NPs accumulate on the surface of the corona and electrostatic electrodes during the process. These problems lead to an inefficient separation. In the present research, the impacts of NP on electrostatic separation are investigated. The experimental results show that: the separation is notably influenced when the NP content is more than 10%. With the increase of NP content, the middling products sharply increase from 1.4 g to 4.3 g (increase 207.1%), while the conductive products decrease from 24.0 g to 19.1 g (decrease 20.4%), and the separation process become more instable. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of boiler load, fuel blending ratio, electrostatic precipitator, flue gas desulphurization, flue gas bypassing the FGD ratio, and mercury measuring methods on mercury emission were analyzed. The results indicated that mercury data from OHM, SCEM and CMM presented a good consistency throughout the entire testing period within ±20% acceptable range; however, the results from Appendix K provided bigger discrepancies than the results of OHM and SCEM due to the interferences of higher selenium content in the flue gas.

Results show that the gaseous state of mercury is of the overwhelming content in the emitted mercury for the test coal, and the bivalent mercury is of the major part in the gaseous mercury. In addition, the mercury content in fly ash is higher than that in slag. Adding NaCl causes a certain reduction of percentage of both gaseous bivalent and elemental mercury in the total content, but an increment of ratio of particle mercury. However, with increased addition of NaCl, the particle mercury increases smoothly and the elemental mercury reduces also slowly.

In this paper a more sophisticated response surface methodology was applied to build quadratic models and optimize the three main factors on a roll-type electrostatic separator. The sample of granular mixture got from crushed PCB wastes (size 0.3-0.45 mm, containing 25% metal and 75% nonmetal). According to the analysis of the experiment data, some quadratic effects were found, and two quadratic models for conductor production (C) and middling production (M) were established. The results indicated that the high voltage level and roll speed are the most important factors for the process. Because of the existence of the quadratic effect, the highest efficiency can also be achieved at a lower voltage level (27-29 kV) compared with a maximum voltage level. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For this process, the trajectory of conductive particle is significant and some models have been established. However, the results of previous researches are limited by some simplifying assumptions and lead to a notable discrepancy between the model prediction and the experimental results. In the present research, a roll-type corona-electrostatic separator and ground printed circuit board (PCB) wastes were used to investigate the trajectory of the conductive particle. Two factors, the air drag force and the different charging situation, were introduced into the improved model. Their effects were analyzed and an improved model for the theoretical trajectory of conductive particle was established. Compared with the previous one, the improved model shows a good agreement with the experimental results.

Methods: Twenty New Zealand rabbits (2 weeks old) were divided into 2 groups as follows: 10 in the control group (maternal feed) and 10 in the TPN group. The rabbits in the TPN group received continuous PN infusion through a silastic catheter inserted in the right jugular vein. Results: After 10 days of treatment, the serum levels of total bilirubin and bile acid were significantly higher in the TPN group than in the control group (P < .01, respectively). The light microscopic findings in the TPN rabbits included inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic steatosis. Electron microscopy showed change in the cytosolic vacuoles and rare microvilli in the microbile duct. Moreover, 10 days of treatment resulted in an inhibition of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in hepatocytes, an increase of the malondialdehyde level, a significant increase in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, a significant increase in caspase 3 activity, and increased apoptosis (P < .01, individually). Conclusions: Oxidative damage may be one of the essential mechanisms of TPN-associated liver dysfunction.

Mercury mass balance was presented based on mercury concentration in coal, pyrite, bottom ash, fly ash, desulphurization slurry and flue gas. Results show that the data obtained by OHM and SCEM are within ± 20% acceptable range, which means the two methods are available to be used for mercury emission monitoring for coal-fired power plants. The total mercury emission fluctuates consistently with mercury content in inlet fuel. The ratios of elemental to total mercury in the flue gas are 48.6%-77.7% for power plants burning coal mixtures containing mainly lignite. Wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) would capture more than 90% of oxidized mercury, while electrostatic precipitator and wet FGD would respectively remove 15% and 34% of mercury.

72749090420	Research on the effect of chloride additive on mercury speciation in coal-fired derived flue gases	A typical coal used widely in the power stations in Shanghai area is adopted as the experimental coal type. A pilot-scale coal-combustion furnace was designed and constructed to study the mercury speciation and transformations in the flue gas under different conditions. The results showed that gaseous mercury in the tested coal products accounted for two thirds of total mercury and solid-state mercury accounted for one third of total mercury. It indicates that gaseous mercury is the main form of mercury emission from the tested coal-fired flue gas. The bivalent mercury accounted for about three fifth of the total gaseous mercury and the elementary mercury accounted for about two fifth of the total gaseous mercury. Of the solid-state mercury, mercury in the fly ash was around thirty one percent and mercury in the slag was about three percent of the total mercury. It shows that bivalent mercury is the main form of gaseous mercury, the mercury content in the fly ash compared to the end of the mercury is higher. The addition of chloride additive makes the percentage of both gaseous bivalent and gaseous elemental mercury in the total mercury decline at some degree, and percentage of particle mercury increase correspondingly. However, with the increasing of additive, the increasing trend of particle mercury became flat gradually and the decreasing of elemental mercury becomes gentle gradually. ©2009 IEEE.

In this paper, mercury emission and speciation in the flue gas from a coal-fired power station was measured by three methods, i.e., OHM (Ontario Hydro method), Hg SCEM (semi-continuous emission monitors), and EPA Appendix K (carbon trap method). The effects of boiler load, flue gas characteristics on mercury emission and its speciation were analyzed. Mercury mass balance was calculated based on the analyses of mercury contents in coal, pyrite, bottom ash, fly ash, FGD (flue gas desulphurization) slurry, and flue gas at FGD inlet and stack. The results indicate that data by the three methods have good consistency within acceptable range. The total mercury emission increases with the increasing of mercury content in fuel and boiler load. The percentages of elemental mercury in the flue gas at FGD inlet and stack are around 26%-48% and 70%-85% respectively. Wet FGD would capture more than 80% of oxidized mercury. © 2009 IEEE.

The possible reasons are that different flow characteristics makes the contents in the flue gas be with different resident time in the reactor and affects the chemical reaction between the contents with mercury, so that mercury speciation distribution in flue gas changes. The results will not only help understand the principle that flow characteristics affects the mercury speciation distribution and mercury removal efficiency by absorbent and fly ash in the flue gas, but also help improve mercury removal efficiency through optimizing the flow field in the duct so as to reduce mercury pollution emission in the flue gas. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

77952626132	A novel computational scheme and its application for simulation of the flow characteristics of flue gas	In this paper, a novel computational scheme, local whole-information difference scheme (LWDS), was proposed to solve significant pseudo diffusion in recirculating flow zone during numerical simulation. In LWDS the effect of all of the local around points on the control volume was considered to demonstrate the spatial characteristics of the flow, and the weighted value at each point is adjusted according to the local velocity field, so as to reduce the numerical diffusion. LWDS is with more accuracy than upwind and power difference schemes, and it is applied to compute the flow characteristics of air in a reactor. The results show that the flow characteristics in the reactor affect the mercury speciation distribution in the flue gas, and it also affects the mercury removal efficiency of the mercury sorbent and fly ash. The possible reasons are that different flow characteristics makes the contents in the flue gas be with different resident time in the reactor and affects the chemical reaction between the contents with mercury. In the multiphase flow reactor, when other conditions were same, four injection ports were with high mercury removal efficiency since it was with more uniform distribution of the sorbent in the flue gas. ©2010 IEEE.

77952660026	Neural network construction and its predication for coal-blending at coal combustion power station	With the coal consumption increasing gradually, coal blending is becoming a routine work in power stations. Due to the fluctuation of the coal quality, coal blending is in fact an optimization problem under uncertain conditions, so that it is difficult to solve with the traditional linear programming model. On the other hand, BP neural network, a nonlinear optimization tool, has been successfully applied to coal blending. In this paper, the prediction effects of different BP neural network model were analyzed and the main factors affecting the prediction effects were also studied. These factors included network structure, learning sample quantities, hidden nodes, learning accuracy and etc. Based on the above analyses and studies, BP neural networks were built to predict characteristics, such as low heat and others, of blended coals, and the prediction accuracy is extremely high. Three cases were predicted in this paper. In addition, the optimization of coal blending was conducted with exhaustive method, and it is very directive to the practical coal blending. The characteristics of neural network are with close relation with the data extension of the input and output samples, so it is universal and has strong expansion. ©2010 IEEE.

77953800930	Carbohydrate-to-fat ratio affects food intake and body weight in Wistar rats	The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of carbohydrate-to-fat ratio on body weight and appetite regulation in Wistar rats. Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomized to three dietary groups (n = 8): normal carbohydrate diet (NC), low-carbohydrate diet (LC) and high-carbohydrate diet (HC) for 12 weeks. Body weight and food intake were recorded. Circulating leptin and insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay method. The expression levels of leptin receptor, insulin receptor, orexin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP) and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC-4R) in the hypothalamus were also measured by realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the LC group, food intake reduced while body weight increased significantly compared with the NC and HC groups. Plasma leptin levels increased in the LC (18.5 ± 8.2 ng/mL) group compared with the NC (8.6 ± 3.8 ng/mL, P< 0.001) and HC (6.6 ± 1.9 ng/mL, P< 0.001) groups. Realtime reverse transcription-PCR revealed a decrease in the hypothalamic expression level of only leptin receptor in the LC (0.764, 0.471-4.648 copy/mL) and HC (0.357, 0.129-0.781 copy/mL) groups compared with the NC (1.323, 0.616-2.392 copy/mL; P = 0.01) group, and that there was no significant change in those of insulin receptor, AgRP, Orexin, NPY and MC-4R. Low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet raised body weight, which led to a rising of circulating leptin levels and a reduced expression of leptin receptor in the hypothalamus.

77956144410	Research on flue gas mercury removal on a lab-scale and a pilot-scale reactor	Due to its harm to human health, mercury emission from coal combustion power stations has brought more and more concern. The existed APCDs such as bag Alter, electrostatic precipitator and wet FGD may remove the oxidized mercury from the flue gas. However, they have no obvious removal efficiency on the elemental mercury. The main direction in the development of new mercury removal technology is to transform the elemental mercury into oxidized mercury and particulatebounded mercury, which may be effectively removed. A lab-scale reation system and a pilot-scale reactor were set up to conduct the experiment on removal of Hg in the sorbent evaluation testbed in order to research different sorbents for the mercury removal efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the experimental systems can provide accurate information of sorbent evaluation under real flue gas atmosphere. The mercury removal efficiency of different sorbents vary in a wide range, from 28.6% to 91.2%. For a same sorbent, the mercury removal efficiency shows a better performance on lab-scale reactor. Under the same condition, the sorbent would have higher mercury capturing efficiency with higher injection rate and longer residence time. © 2010 IEEE.

77956159963	Evaluation study on new sorbents for mercury in coal-fired flue gas	More and more concern has been put on the mercury emitted from power stations burning coal because of its harm to human health. Both of the US EPA and European Commission have set regulations on the mercury emission from the electric utilities. China also pays more and more attention to the mercury emission and starts to sponsor the projects relative to the mercury emission and its control. Mercury emission control technologies may be divided into three classes, i.e., precombustion control, combustion control and flue gas control, among which the flue gas mercury removal technology is most widely used. The existed flue gas pollution control devices such as bag filter, electrostatic precipitator and wet FGD may remove the oxidized mercury from the flue gas. However, they have no obvious removal efficiency on the elemental mercury. The main direction in the development of new mercury removal technology is to transform the element of mercury into oxidized mercury and particulate-bounded mercury, which may be effectively removed. Before the sorbent is used to remove mercury from the flue gas, it needs to be evaluated on a lab-scale device, pilot-scale and full scale reactor or power station. The simulated flue gas composed of mercury vapors from the vapor generator and compressed air was used to conduct the experiment on removal of Hg in the sorbent evaluation test-bed in order to research different sorbents for the mercury removal efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the mercury removal efficiency of activated carbon is 60%; while fly ash is of low cost and its efficiency is limited. Unmodified fly ash adsorption efficiency is from 10% to 20%, and the specific surface area of modified fly ash has been increased a lot, and its adsorption efficiency can reach up to 25%, but it is far from the adsorption efficiency of activated carbon. The activated carbon is with higher mercury removal efficiency than fly ash, but its cost is very high. It is one of the studying directions to find high effective cheap sorbents. © 2010 IEEE.

77956166157	First principle study of the adsorption of mercury on the carbon surface	The interactions of mercury with the carbon surface are investigated by performing the density functional electrical structure calculation. The five different carbon groups bonded with the elemental hydrogen and chlorine are proposed to build the carbon surfaces. The calculations are presented for mercury sorption on both on-top (T) and sixfold-angle (A) sites. The adsorption energy curve reveals that the adsorptive capacity for mercury on the T or A site absorbed on the symmetrical carbon groups can be improved following the increasing size of molecules, which can not be suitable for the unsymmetrical carbon group structures. For the mercury on the A site, the carbon group with the different absorptive positions on the sixfold carbons usually have equal adsorption energy. Even though several carbon groups present the inequable cases, the differences remain a constant value. The conclusion is significant to design and operate the mercury emission control based on the carbon surface. © 2010 IEEE.

77957914116	Bifidobacterium adolescentis supplementation ameliorates Parenteral nutrition-induced liver injury in infant rabbits	Background Parenteral nutrition (PN)-induced liver injury is associated with gut atrophy, and probiotics have demonstrated the ability to stabilize the intestinal microecosystem and offer protection against bacterial translocation from the gut to the liver. Therefore, we hypothesized that enteral Bifidobacterium supplements could alleviate PN-associated liver injury. Methods Three-week-old New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups: control, PN, and PN + Bif group (PN plus enteral feeding 0.5 9 108 Bifidobacterium adolescentis per day). After 10 days, serum levels of liver enzyme and endotoxin were measured, and histology of liver and ileum were performed. Blood and homogenized samples of tissue from the mesenteric lymph nodes, lung, and spleen were cultured for detecting bacteria translocation. Intestinal permeability was determined by sugar absorption test. Results Serum levels of total bilirubin and bile acid were found to be lower in the PN + Bif group, with considerably improved ileum and liver histology (vs. the PN group). The bacterial translocation rate (15.6%), serum endotoxin level (0.11 ± 0.03 EU/ml), and lactulose/mannitol ratio (0.02 ± 0.004) in the PN + Bif group were obviously lower than those of PN group (77.5%, 0.60 ± 0.09 EU/ml, and 0.038 ± 0.008, respectively) and similar to those of the control group (2.8%, 0.09 ± 0.03 EU/ml, and 0.019 ± 0.005, respectively). Conclusions Enteral probiotic supplementation could reduce gut permeability, bacterial translocation and endotoxemia, and thus attenuate PN-associated gut and liver injuries in infant rabbits. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

77958023735	RETRACTED ARTICLE: Study on flyash characteristics and its effect on mercury removal in coal-fired derived flue gas	In this paper, fly ash sampled at ESP inlet and outlet in a coal fired power station was analyzed, and its characteristics and effect on mercury removal were experimentally studied. It shows that particles consisted in the fly ash are mostly smaller than 50-100μm, and some were even smaller than 10μm. The main contents in the fly ash were attained through approximate and ultimate analysis. BET surface area, t-plot external surface area, single point adsorption total volume of pores, cumulative volume of pores, average pore width, and BJH average pore width were studied. This characteristics is the fundamental factors that can explain the effect of fly ash on mercury in the flue gas, and different fly ashes show significant differences in mercury removal. It was found that the fly ash can absorb mercury to a certain extent in the flue gas, mercury removal rate can reach 40% at maximum. About the influence factors, longer residence time and higher injection rate help improving mercury removal. It shows a higher mercury removal efficiency in compressed air than in flue gas. The temperature inside the duct also has effect on the mercury adsorption efficiency, and fly ash has higher adsorption efficiency at lower temperature. © 2010 IEEE.

77958033989	RETRACTED ARTICLE: Study on flow characteristics in a novel multiphase reactor and its effect on mercury removal efficiency in the flue gas	A novel multiphase reactor was established to experimentally study the flow characteristics in the duct at a power station and its effect on the mercury speciation distribution in flue gas and mercury removal efficiency. The simulated flue gas carrying mercury generated with special mercury generator enters into the reactor at different rates to simulate the flow field in different APCDs duct at power station. The studied results have demonstrated that different flow characteristics in the reactor affect the mercury speciation distribution in the flue gas, and it also affects the mercury efficiency of the mercury sorbent and fly ash. The possible reasons are that different flow characteristics makes the contents in the flue gas be with different resident time in the reactor and affects the chemical reaction between the contents with mercury, so that mercury speciation distribution in flue gas changes. The results will not only help understand the principle that flow characteristics affects the mercury speciation distribution and mercury removal efficiency by absorbent and fly ash in the flue gas, but also help improve mercury removal efficiency through optimizing the flow field in the duct so as to reduce mercury pollution emission in the flue gas. © 2010 IEEE.

78649328243	Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia: Four case reports and a review of the literature	Background: Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is a rare digestive disease and most articles on this condition are isolated case reports. Aims: Our purpose is to investigate the clinical characteristics, therapeutic management, and outcome of PIL through case studies. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis and obtained detailed clinical information for four PIL patients treated at our institution. A MEDLINE database search was also performed using the search term "intestinal lymphangiectasia" and all pertinent literature was carefully reviewed. Results: Four children treated in our department showed elevated IgE and a good response to diet intervention. After reviewing the literature, we conducted statistical analysis on the basis of all the cases, with a total of 84 cases. Thirty-eight cases have been reported with diet treatment, 24 (63%) of whom showed apparent improvement in clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters. Four cases (5%) had a malignant transformation of lymphoma, and the average time from PIL onset to lymphoma diagnosis was 31 years (range, 19-45 years). No difference was observed regarding the presence of major clinical manifestations among children and adults. Diet intervention in children was more effective than that in adults. Conclusions: Diet intervention is the cornerstone of PIL medical management, which was found to be more effective in children than in adults. Early diagnosis and treatment of IL is of great importance for effective diet therapy. An elevated IgE level should be monitored periodically since it could be an indication of malignant transformation-lymphoma. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79551549018	Clinical outcomes of glutamine supplementation in neonates	Objective: To assess the clinical outcomes of glutamine supplementation in neonates. Methods: The study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled triaL Totally 100 infants were randomly divided into 5 groups with 20 infants in each group: control group: standard parenteral nutrition (PN); PN1 group: PN supplemented with 0.3 g/ (kg·d) glutamine; enteral nutrition (EN) 1 group: EN supplemented with 0.3 g/ (kg·d) glutamine; PN2 group: PN supplemented with 0.3 g/ (kg·d) glutamine; and EN2 group: EN supplemented with 0.3 g/ (kg·d) glutamine. The primary endpoints were the time to establish full enteral nutrition [defined as receiving 120 ml/ (kg·d) enterally], episodes of gastric residuals, total duration of PN, and mortality. The second endpoints were weight gain and head circumference gain, liver function, renal function, days on ventilator, and length of hospitalization. Results: Time to achieve full enteral nutrition, incidence of gastric residuals, duration of PN, weight gain (g/d), head circumference gain (cm/w), liver function, renal function, and length of hospitalization were not significantly different among all five groups. Days of mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased in PN1 group and PN2 group when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Intention-to-treat analyses showed that, when compared with the control group, PN1 group: RR: 1.053; 95% CI; 0.952-1.164; EN1 group: RR: 1.333, 95% CI: 1.035-1.717; PN2 group: RR: 1.053, 95% CI: 0.952-1.164; EN2 group: RR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.004-1.556. Conclusions: Glutamine supplementation may not be able to decrease the time to achieve full enteral nutrition, the incidence of gastric residuals, and the duration of PN. However, pareneral glutamine supplementation does reduce the days on ventilator in neonates. Also, parenteral glutamine supplementation has no obvious influence on mortality.

79952592914	Study of interdisciplinary specialized mechanical engineering education	A novel teaching method is proposed to design the contents of the interdisciplinary courses for the specialized mechanical engineering education. The paper discusses the necessity of assigning the proper interdisciplinary courses on the analysis of currently increasing mixed-talent requirement in our modern society. The characteristics of interdisciplinary research are elucidated in order to obtain the hints for guiding the reform of teaching method to suit for the new status that occur in the interdisciplinary course. The relationships and intersections among the different majors are regards as the most important factor for teaching the interdisciplinary courses well. Refining the associated knowledge from these intersections is the core task for teachers since these contents are very easy to avoid the intense inner anxiety and conflict for the student due to the difference between the own and other majors. For the teacher, the contents of lessons should be designed on the basic of the specialized skill of student's major and not exceed their knowledge structures on a large degree. Based on this behavior, the detailed knowledge of specialized mechanical engineering is gradually assigned in the classes and terminally the whole specialized industry is learned by the student, which is the desired goal. Finally, the example of electrical machinery is addressed for verifying the effectiveness of the approach of refining the intersections to design the contents and classes. The practical results show that the method proposed in this paper has the high effectiveness on teaching the interdisciplinary specialized mechanical engineering education. In addition, we believe that this schema is also able to be applied for the related interdisciplinary courses. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

It was found that limestone dissolution rate in the presence of citric acid was controlled by mass transfer. As can be seen from the experimental results, in the presence of citric acid, limestone dissolution rate increased with increasing stirring speed and reaction temperature. When pH value was greater than or equal to 5.5, due to the formation of calcium citrate, citric acid would inhibit the dissolution process of limestone. And the inhibition effect was more obvious at higher pH value. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.

Methods: C57BL/6J male mice (aged 6-8 weeks) were randomly assigned to 3 groups: parenteral nutrition (PN), PN with anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody treatment (PN + mAb), and controls. A central venous catheter was inserted for intravenous infusion of a PN solution (PN and PN + mAb groups) or saline (controls) for 7 days. Liver pathology, hepatic biochemical indicators, and serum TNF-α concentrations were analyzed. Levels of hepatic bsep, mdr1a/mdr1b, mdr2, and mrp2 mRNA were also evaluated in each group. Results: The PN group showed significant increases in serum transaminase, direct bilirubin, and bile acids relative to the control group (P <.05). Histopathological changes in this group were consistent with early stage cholestasis. The pathological score and serum alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin levels were improved in the PN + mAb group relative to the PN group (P <.05). The PN group showed significantly lower hepatic bsep, mdr1a/mdr1b, mdr2, and mrp2 mRNA expression than the controls (P <.05), but these were significantly increased compared to the PN group (P <.05). Conclusions: Infliximab administered at a single dose of 5 mg/kg body weight ameliorated the progression of PNALD and improved the expression of hepatic ABC transporter genes. Therefore, anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody may be a beneficial therapy for patients with PNALD. © 2012 The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.

Because of its characteristics, distributed power (DP) can slow down these contradictions, so it develops quickly in China. The DP is mainly used in special situations, temporary electric power consuming, power-peaking adjustment and improvement of safety of the power network, and it also can be a good power supply method for some developing areas in West China, where centralized power supplies are not suitable. On the other hand, the cost of the DP is high, and the introduction of DP may induce voltage fluctuation of the main power network and relative problems. These issues need to be further studied. With the improvement of the DP technologies, devices, and efficiency, its application range will extend to various situations. DP will not only act as an important supplement of the traditional electric power supply mode, but also hold important position in the field of comprehensive energy applications, and it will become an important developing direction.

The computation results agree well with the results in the reference. And the computation accuracy of the LHDS is higher than that of PLDS and UDS. The LHDS can get enough computation accuracy in a big range of velocity. The program of the LHDS is simpler than that of PLDS and slightly more complicated than that of UDS. The computational time of the LHDS is shorter than that of PLDS and nearly equal to that of UDS.

0037425489	Discrete particle simulation and visualized research of the gas-solid flow in an internally circulating fluidized bed	In this paper, the DEM (discrete element method) is used to simulate the gas-solid flow of a two-dimensional internally circulating fluidized bed. Eulerian and Lagrangian methods are used to deal with gas-field and discrete particles, respectively. The gas flow is determined by the local average Navier-Stokes equation, the motion of individual particle is obtained by solving Newton's second law of motion, and particle collisions are taken into account. The simulated results indicate that there is particle circulation from the high-velocity region to the low-velocity region in internally circulating fluidized beds with uneven air distributions; therefore, the mixing characteristics of the bed material are good. Through visualization experiments, we confirm that there is transverse movement of bubbles from the high-velocity side to the low-velocity side in internally circulating fluidized beds. Thus, particles in the trailing vortex of bubbles also move transversely. This is an important factor that results in particle circulation in internally circulating fluidized beds.

84868259679	Progression of basic research and clinical practice for nutrition support in the critically ill neonates	At present, over 1million critically ill newborn infants (including premature neonates, low birth weight babies and those with congenital malformation) each year need medical therapy shortly after birth, and most of them need nutrition support which is not only an essential part of the whole treatment but also important for their later health. Our research group carried out a series of basic and clinical research focusing on nutrition support in critically ill neonate ever since 1985. We found that the energy expenditure in neonates was lower than formula predicted value, and changed the energy recommendation to the value of 60-80 kcal/(kg·d) for parenteral nutrition. We also successfully developed the first domestic pediatric amino acid preparation based on the analysis of serum amino acid characteristics in Chinese neonates. We help to introduce new techniques for nutrition support in neonates, including jejunal puncture ostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for enteral nutrition, as well as the use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters for parenteral nutrition. Liver injury is a severe complication of parenteral nutrition, and our studies revealed that oxidative stress related mitochondrial apoptotic pathway might be an important mechanism, while glutamine showed protective effect not only in animal study but also in our clinical trial. In addition, we successful implemented intestinal rehabilitation therapy in 46 neonates with short bowel syndrome from all around the country, including one case with residual small intestine of only 25 cm.In the year 2005 and 2010, we formulated evidence-based Chinese guidelines of clinical nutrition support in neonates and pediatric patients, which help to improve the application of adequate nutrition support in the field of neonatology and pediatrics. The research achievement won the second prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award.

84871804501	Flow field simulation analysis of the inner stack of coal-fired power plant	The flow field of inner stack of one coal-fired power plant in Shanghai was simulated. The results showed that there was a larger turbulent region at the upper parts of the entrance in the stack. The inner wall at the opposite of the entrance withstands a much greater shock, and this region is badly worn. The speed in the central and upper region is more stable. The stack is basically running in a vacuum state, which contributes to corrosion mitigation. The temperature shows a decrease trend with the increase of height in the range of 10 °C. The temperature of the center part is slightly higher than the ambient part. And with the increase of the stack height, the radial temperature gradient increases. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84871863253	Soil washing and bioremediation of tailing dam wastes	The paper presents that soil washing and bioremediation technologies were employed to treat the contaminated soil. Various works were conduced in parallel with each other and th results of the laboratouy studies were used to determine critical parameters. Four lixiviants, i.e. sulphuric acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid and ethylene diamine acetic acid were tests at three concentration levels respectively. The tests showed that the leaching of the heavy metals increases as the soil porosity increases. Silica sand was added to increase porosity of the contaminated soil. Hightest Mn removal was achieved mainly by sulphuric and oxalic acid at 0.001M at all soil samples. EDTA was significantly efficient in the removal of Ni and Zn. The recovery of heavy metals, particalarly Mn, decreased as the depth of samping increased. Heterogeneous bacteria and filamentous organism plate counts were conduced to evaluate the growth of the bacteria and filamentous organisms in the soil. The results from this study suggest that the leaching of heavy metals from the contaminated soil is to a large extent dependant on the pH of the leaching solution. By increasing the soil's porosity and bioremediating the soil, higher extractions of metals were achieved. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84871893146	Research on the correlation between mercury and sulfur content in coals	To reduce mercury emission in the flue gas at coal-fired power plant, it is very important and meaningful to research the mercury content and the existing status of other elements in coal. In this paper, mercury and sulfur content including their relevant relations of existing speciations from five coal samples were studied. Experimental method was based on U.S. EPA Method 7471 and experimental apparatus was automatic mercury analysis system Hydra AA. The results showed that in these 5 coal samples, the range of mercury content was from 0.284μg/g to 0.663μg/g and the average content was 0.401μg/g. The range of sulfur content was from 0.688% to 5.546% and the average content was 2.30%. The existing status of mercury and sulfur in coal was very complex. Under normal circumstances, when there was high sulfur content in coal, there was also high mercury content. However, the low sulfur coal may be of high mercury content. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84884983000	Weight loss and resting energy expenditure in male patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer	Objectives: Cancer cachexia is associated with impaired nutritional status and systemic inflammation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status and resting energy expenditure (REE) changes in patients with newly detected esophageal cancer, and the influence of weight loss on REE. Methods: Fifty-six patients and 30 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled, and patients were further divided into weight-stable (WS) and weight-loss (WL) subgroups. Body composition, measured REE (mREE), and the ratio of mREE to predicted REE (pREE) by Harris-Benedict formula were assessed. Blood levels of hemoglobin, albumin, prealbumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured in patients. Results: Cancer patients had lower body mass index (BMI) and percentage of fat mass, but higher mREE and percentage of mREE/pREE compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). WS (n=32) and WL patients (n=24) had similar BMI and body composition indices, but the latter had obviously higher mREE, mREE per kilogram body weight (mREE/BW), percentage of mREE/pREE, hs-CRP and IL-6 levels, and lower albumin and prealbumin levels. Percentage of weight loss was positively correlated with REE/BW, hs-CRP, and IL-6 level (r=0.238, P=0.044; r=0.446, P=0.01; r=0.196, P=0.047, respectively). Conclusion: Impaired nutrition status, elevated energy expenditure, and higher inflammation status tend to be apparent in weight-losing patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer, which suggested that early recognition of body weight change and routine nutritional risk screening followed by adequate nutrition intervention should be applied in these patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

0142230019	Novel modified turbulence model and its application for simulation on aerodynamic field in outlet of coaxial swirling burner	In strongly swirling flow, due to interaction between centrifugal force and turbulent pulsation, adverse transfer of energy from turbulent pulsation to average motion is greatly increased. When radial pulsation occurring in the direction of radius increases, centrifugal force does positive work to fluid micro mass of turbulent flow, making its pulsation kinetic energy increase, vice versa. Based on the analyses of effect of centrifugal force, k-ε-cf model, a novel modified k-ε turbulence model considering work done by centrifugal force in turbulent pulsation, is proposed in the present paper. The characteristic parameters in k-ε-cf model are obtained by geometrical average of relevant parameters of big vortex and small eddy, of which frequency of eddy agrees with the experimental data. Aerodynamic field in outlet zone of a coaxial swirling stratified flow burner is numerically simulated. The simulated results with k-ε-cf model agree well with the experimental data and have higher precision than those with standard k-ε model. When tangential velocity meets with certain distribution work done by centrifugal force can be ignored, but in general cases, it should be taken into account to reflect anisotropy of strongly swirling flow.

Eulerian and Lagrangian methods are used to deal with gas-field and discrete particles respectively. The gas flow is determined by local average Navier-Stokes equation. The motion of individual particle is obtained by solving Newton's second law of motion and particles collisions are taken into account. The simulation result indicates that there is clockwise particles circulation in fluidized beds with L-type wind caps. Therefore the transverse mixing characteristic of bed material is good. Through visualized experiments, we observe there is transverse movement of bubbles after bubbles leave out L-type wind caps. So particles in trailing vortex of bubbles also move transversely, this is an important factor that results in particles circulation in fluidized beds with L-type wind caps.

84890076368	Glutamine supplementation in preterm infants receiving parenteral nutrition leads to an early improvement in liver function	Objective: The aim of study was to confirm the protective effects of parenteral glutamine supplementation on liver injury in premature infants and determine how quickly effects became evident. Methods: We performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study to assess the effect of parenteral nutrition (PN) supplemented with glutamine in premature infants. Thirty infants from two children's centers, were randomly assigned to either a control group (Standard PN; n=15) or a glutamine-supplemented group (GlnPN; n=15). The primary endpoint was hepatic function. The secondary endpoints were total duration of PN, weight and head circumference gain, length of hospitalization, and days on a ventilator. Results: The serum level of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) after parenteral nutrition for 14 days was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the control group. But in the glutaminesupplemented group, the serum concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) significantly decreased after PN for 7 days and 14 days (p<0.05), and the level of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) showed no increase. The levels of AKP and GGT were significantly different with time by group interaction. Levels of AKP was higher in control group than glutamine-supplemented group, and GGT level was lower in glutamine-supplemented group compared with controls. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of total duration of PN, weight gain (g/d), increase in head circumference (cm/w), length of hospitalization, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: The longer the duration of parenteral nutrition, the more severe hepatic dysfunction became. Parenteral glutamine supplementation suggested a hepatoprotective effect.

Methods: A total of 15 children with epileptiform waves on EEG in both hemispheres and 18 children as normal controls (NC) matched for age and sex were recruited. Data from DKI for all children were used to characterize non-Gaussian properties. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and mean kurtosis (MK) maps were estimated from the DKI datasets. Voxel-based analyses (VBA) based on these measures were performed and compared between the epilepsy and NC groups. Results: The VBA showed abnormal regions in both white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) in those with epilepsy. Analysis of FA values revealed that the abnormal regions were significant mainly in the left frontal and temporal lobes of the WM. Analysis of MD values revealed that differences were significant mainly in the right hemisphere of the limbic lobe, uncus, parahippocampal region, both in GM and WM of frontal and temporal lobes, and GM of the rectus of the left cerebrum. Finally, analysis of MK values revealed significant differences mainly in WM of the frontal lobes of both cerebrum, and GM and WM of the parietal lobe of the right cerebrum. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that DKI is sensitive for the characterization of diffusion abnormalities in both WM and GM of children with epilepsy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84890830123	Mercury adsorption characteristics of biomass activated carbon	The conditions for preparation of biomass carbon were studied with zinc chloride as an activating agent. Orthogonal optimization design was carried out considering different zinc chloride concentration, carbonizing temperature and time as influential factors, using various biomass material to prepare activated carbon and taking the value of methylene blue adsorption as an optimization index. Then, the biomass activated carbon with better performance was adopted to implement mercury adsorption experiments. The results show that the methylene blue adsorption value of soybean stem activated carbon is 0.15 mg/g, the mercury adsorption capacity in 4 hours is 0.015 mg and the penetration rate is 5.30%, at an optimal condition of 600°C activation temperature, 1.5 hours activation time and 50% zinc chloride concentration. Therefore, the methylene blue adsorption efficiency by activated carbon is different because of the effect of raw materials, the activator concentration, activation time, activation temperature and so on. The mercury adsorption efficiency of soybean straw activated carbon is the highest because of its porosity.

The fly ash samples and the absorption solution after experiment were tested for mercury content. The results showed that different sizes of the original fly ash had different characteristics of photocatalytic removal of mercury. The adsorption of mercury by fly ash was an important condition for the occurrence of photocatalytic effect. When the mercury adsorption capacity of fly ash was stronger, the capacity of photocatalytic removal mercury was also greater. The presence of iron oxide on the fly ash surface can promote the capability of photocatalytic removal of mercury by fly ash. The presence of ultraviolet light can significantly promote Hg

84897119865	Palmitate induces TRB3 expression and promotes apoptosis in human liver cells	Background/Aims: Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) is a major complication for patients who require long-term parenteral nutrition. Treatment options for PNALD are limited and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) is a pseudokinase that modulates many signal transduction cascades and may be involved in the pathogenesis of PNALD. The aim of this study was to examine the role of TRB3 in palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, in the human liver cell line L02. Methods: L02 cells were treated with palmitate, and its effect on cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis and TRB3 expression were assessed. The role of TRB3 was also studied using transient overexpression of TRB3 in L02 cells, as well as its interaction with Akt signaling. Results: We found that palmitate induced ER stress and apoptosis in L02 cells. Palmitate-associated ER stress was accompanied by a significant induction of TRB3 expression at the mRNA and protein level. Overexpression of TRB3 potentiated the deleterious effects of palmitate, which was associated with decreased levels of phospho-Akt. Conclusions: TRB3 is an important mediator of palmitate-induced apoptosis in human liver cells, suggesting that it may also be involved in the molecular mechanism underlying PNALD. © 2014 S.

84918516335	Experimental study on the removal of H	In order to meet requirements of electric power industry for the implementation of sustainable development strategy, clean coal power generation technology should be developed in china. Integrated gasification and combined cycle (IGCC) is regarded as a promising clean coal technology due to its high efficiency and low environmental pollution, it has a broad application prospect in China. In IGCC power plants, coal is converted into a fuel gas, which must be cleaned before its use in the combustion turbine to prevent the gas turbine from corrosion, erosion and fouling, and to minimize the sulfur oxides pollutant emissions to the environment. Specifically, it is necessary to clean-up the syngas exiting the gasifier of primary contaminants such as particulates and sulfur.

Moreover, the relationship between dynamic carrying force and bearing parameters, and the law between static balance position and rotating speed are studied. On the basis of this, the critical velocity 2000 r/min under working condition is found, and the relationship between bearing clearance and critical velocity is also got at the same time. According to the above, the kinematic stability and critical condition are both discussed, and the time histories, phase diagrams, and axis tracing curves are also obtained under non-working and working conditions with the Ronge-Kutta numerical method. The conclusion is that bifurcation behavior occurs when the rotation speed changes from non-working state to working state.
