8744311995	Distribution of MICA microsatellite in 13 population groups of China	The genetic data of MICA microsatellite were obtained by genotyping 577 samples in 13 population groups of China, which are Han-YN, Han-GD, Han-SD, Bai, Dai, Lahu, Li, Naxi, Sala, She,Tu, Wa and Zang-YN, with genescan. Five alleles have been observed in the population groups,which are A4, A5, A5. 1, A6 and A9. A5 allele is the most frequent in all population groups except Lahu and Li, while the most frequent allele for Lahu and Li is A5. 1 and A4 respectively. The second most frequent allele is the A5. 1 in Han-YN, Han-SD, Dai, Naxi, Sala, She, and Wa. The lest frequent allele for Han-YN, Han-GD, Lahu, Naxi, She, Wa is the A6 which is not observed in Li. A4 allele is the lest frequent in Han-SD, Bai, Dai, Sala, Tu, Zang-YN. The results show that the distribution of MICA microsatellite is different in these population groups, and the polymorphism information contents (PIC) of this microsatellite is high. It is a potential useful marker in the study of human origin and migration, personal identification, gene mapping and location, and disease diagnosis.

1642521645	Association of Fcγ receptor IIb polymorphism with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese: A common susceptibility gene in the Asian populations	The association of Fcγ receptor (FcγR) polymorphisms with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been demonstrated in various populations; however, the results have been inconsistent. We recently identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism encoding a non-synonymous substitution, Ile232Thr (I232T), of FCGR2B and its association with SLE in Japanese and in Thais. Multiple functional FcγR genes with polymorphisms (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR3A, and FCGR3B) cluster in 1q23, and some of them are in linkage disequilibrium (LD). To differentiate contributions from multiple-linked loci, comparison of different populations may provide useful information. In this study, we analyzed the above four FCGR polymorphisms of the Chinese patients and controls for the association with SLE. FCGR2A-H131R, FCGR2S-I232T, FCGR3A-F176V, and FCGR3B genotypes were determined in 167 Chinese patients with SLE and 129 healthy controls. Association was examined using case-control analysis. Allele frequencies of FCGR2B-232T and FCGR3A-176F were significantly increased in SLE [odds ratio (OR) = 1.67 and OR = 1.41, respectively]. Interestingly, while these alleles had a tendency of positive LD in the controls, FCGR2B-232T was in positive association with FCGR3A-176V in SLE, suggesting that these two alleles were associated with SLE in an independent manner. Comparison between SLE with and without nephritis indicated significant association of FCGR2B-232T with nephritis (OR = 2.65). When the present results were combined with our previous data on the Japanese and the Thais using meta-analytic methods, highly significant and independent association was observed for FCGR2B and FCGR3A genotypes. These results strongly suggested that FCGR2B is a common susceptibility factor to SLE in the Asians.

21644486225	Regulation of alternative splicing of Bcl-x by IL-6, GM-CSF and TPA	The splicing of many alternative exons in the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is regulated by extracellular factors but the underlying molecular bases remain unclear. Here we report the differential regulation of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing by extracellular factors and their distinct requirements for pre-mRNA elements. In K562 leukemia cells, treatment with interleukin-6 (IL-6) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reduced the proportion of the Bcl-xL variant mRNA while treatment with 12-O- tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) had no effect. In U251 glioma cells, however, TPA efficiently increased the Bcl-xL level. These regulations were also seen for a transfected splicing reporter mini-gene. Further analyses of deletion mutants indicate that nucleotides 1-176 of the downstream intron are required for the IL-6 effect, whereas additional nucleotides 177-284 are essential for the GM-CSF effect. As for the TPA effect, only nucleotides 1-76 are required in the downstream intron. Thus, IL-6, GM-CSF and TPA differentially regulate Bcl-x splicing and require specific intronic pre-mRNA sequences for their respective effects.

33750286157	Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor DNA prime-protein boost strategy to enhance efficacy of a recombinant pertussis DNA vaccine	Aim: To investigate a new strategy to enhance the efficacy of a recombinant pertussis DNA vaccine. The strategy is co-injection with cytokine plasmids as prime, and boosted with purified homologous proteins. Method: A recombinant pertussis DNA vaccine containing the pertussis toxin subunit 1 (PTS1), fragments of the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) gene and pertactin (PRN) gene encoding filamentous hemagglutinin and pertactin were constructed. Balb/c mice were immunized with several DNA vaccines and antigen-specific antibodies anti-PTS1, anti-PRN, anti-FHA, cytokines interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and spleno-cyte-proliferation assay were used to describe immune responses. Results: The recombinant DNA vaccine could elicit similar immune responses in mice as that of separate plasmids encoding the 3 fragments, respectively. Mice immunized with DNA and boosted with the corresponding protein elicited more antibodies than those that received DNA as boost. In particular, when the mice were co-immunized with murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor plasmids and boosted with proteins, all 4 cytokines and the 3 antigen-specific antibodies were significantly increased compared to the pVAX1 group. Anti-PTS1, anti-FHA, IL-4 and TNF-α elicited in the colony stimulating factor (CSF) prime-protein boost group showed significant increase compared to all the other groups. Conclusion: This prime and boost strategy has proven to be very useful in improving the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines against pertussis. © 2006 CPS and SIMM.

33845801731	Protective immunity against Bordetella pertussis by a recombinant DNA vaccine and the effect of coinjection with a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gene	A recombinant pertussis DNA vaccine was described here with its immunogenicity and the ability to induce protection against B. pertussis infection in mice. Three immunodominant antigen gene fragments of pertussis, pertussis toxin subunit 1 (pts1), fragments of pertactin (prn) and filamentous hemagglutinin (fha), were recombined as fragment pts1-prn-fha named ppf, and it was cloned to plasmid pVAX1 as pVAX1/ppf. Compared to those injected with pVAX1, the mice injected with pVAX1/ppf significantly elicited more antigen specific antibody anti-PTS1, anti-PRN, anti-FHA and cytokine IL-10, IFN-γ. When pGM-CSF was coinjected with pVAX1/ppf, the mice showed significantly increases of the three antibodies and cytokine IL-10, IL-4, IFN-γ and TNF-α compared to those injected with pVAX1 only. The mice in group pVAX1/ppf & pGM-CSF, in particular; induced much more anti-PTS1, IL-4 and TNF-α than those in group pVAX1/ppf. In the intracerebral mouse protection test, the mice immunized with pVAX1/ppf or pVAX1/ppf & pGM-CSF induced protection to a lethal dose of B. pertussis. The results indicate that recombinant DNA vaccine and pGM-CSF coinjection can induce protective immunity against B. pertussis, demonstrating a valuable method to prevent pertussis.

34250211432	A Brief Review of Short Tandem Repeat Mutation	Short tandem repeats (STRs) are short tandemly repeated DNA sequences that involve a repetitive unit of 1-6 bp. Because of their polymorphisms and high mutation rates, STRs are widely used in biological research. Strand-slippage replication is the predominant mutation mechanism of STRs, and the stepwise mutation model is regarded as the main mutation model. STR mutation rates can be influenced by many factors. Moreover, some trinucleotide repeats are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases. In order to deepen our knowledge of these diseases and broaden STR application, it is essential to understand the STR mutation process in detail. In this review, we focus on the current known information about STR mutation. © 2007 Beijing Genomics Institute.

37149053976	Construction of haplotype and haplotype block based on tag single nucleotide polymorphisms and their applications in association studies	Human genome has structures of haplotype and haplotype block which provide valuable information on human evolutionary history and may lead to the development of more efficient strategies to identify genetic variants that increase susceptibility to complex diseases. Haplotype block can be divided into discrete blocks of limited haplotype diversity. In each block, a small fraction of "tag SNPs" can be used to distinguish a large fraction of the haplotypes. These tag SNPs can be potentially useful for construction of haplotype and haplotype block, and association studies in complex diseases. There are two general classes of methods to construct haplotype and haplotype blocks based on genotypes on large pedigrees and statistical algorithms respectively. The author evaluate several construction methods to assess the power of different association tests with a variety of disease models and block-partitioning criteria. The advantages, limitations and applications of each method and the application in the association studies are discussed equitably. With the completion of the HapMap and development of statistical algorithms for addressing haplotype reconstruction, ideas of construction of haplotype based on combination of mathematics, physics, and computer science etc will have profound impacts on population genetics, location and cloning for susceptible genes in complex diseases, and related domain with life science etc.

38049074935	Amplification of PRKCI, located in 3q26, is associated with lymph node metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	DNA amplification is one of the mechanisms to activate genes that are implicated in neoplastic transformation and gain of chromosome band 3q26 is a common event in squamous cell carcinomas. The aim of the present work was to identify the specific target gene from four candidates (MDS1, PRKCI, FCT2, and PIK3CA) located on 3q26 amplification in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). To assess the prevalence of copy number gains of putative genes, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied on 108 ESCCs and 9 ESCC cell lines. Our data showed that MDS1 and PRKCI were more frequently gained. Positive correlation was found only for PRKCI between amplification and tumor size (P = 0.043), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015) and clinical stage (P = 0.002). PRKCI gene amplification was highly correlated with protein overexpression (P = 0.009), suggesting that gene amplification is one important mechanism involved in PRKCI overexpression. To investigate further the role of PRKCI alteration in esophageal tumors, a tissue microarray containing samples from 180 ESCCs was used for immunohistochemistry analysis. Statistical analysis revealed that PRKCI overexpression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002) and higher stage (P = 0.004). Performing multivariate logistic regression analysis, a significant association between PRKCI overexpression and presence of lymph node metastasis was found, which was independent of T-stage of the primary tumors (P = 0.004). Our results indicate that PRKCI is an attractive target in the 3q26 amplicon and that it may serve as a molecular marker for metastasis and occult advanced tumor stages in ESCC. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0033358602	Y-chromosome evidence for a northward migration of modern humans into eastern Asia during the last Ice Age	The timing and nature of the arrival and the subsequent expansion of modern humans into eastern Asia remains controversial. Using Y-chromosome biallelic markers, we investigated the ancient human-migration patterns in eastern Asia. Our data indicate that southern populations in eastern Asia are much more polymorphic than northern populations, which have only a subset of the southern haplotypes. This pattern indicates that the first settlement of modern humans in eastern Asia occurred in mainland Southeast Asia during the last Ice Age, coinciding with the absence of human fossils in eastern Asia, 50,000-100,000 years ago. After the initial peopling, a great northward migration extended into northern China and Siberia.

0033365192	Distribution of two HIV-1-resistant polymorphisms (SDF1-3'A and CCR2- 64I) in east Asian and world populations and its implication in AIDS epidemiology	Chemokine receptor CCR2 and stromal-derived factor (SDF-1) are involved in HIV infection and AIDS symptom onset. Recent cohort studies showed that point mutations in these two genes, CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A, can delay AIDS onset ≥16 years after seroconversions. The protective effect of CCR2-64I is dominant, whereas that of SDF1-3'A is recessive. SDF1-3'A homozygotes also showed possible protection against HIV-1 infection. In this study, we surveyed the frequency distributions of the two alleles at both loci in world populations, with emphasis on those in east Asia. The CCR2-64I frequencies do not vary significantly in the different continents, having a range of 0.1-0.2 in most populations. A decreasing cline of the CCR2-64I frequency from north to south was observed in east Asia. In contrast, the distribution of SDF1-3'A in world populations varies substantially, and the highest frequency was observed in Oceanian populations. Moreover, an increasing cline of the SDF1- 3'A frequency from north to south was observed in east Asia. The relative hazard values were computed to evaluate the risk of AIDS onset on the basis of two-locus genotypes in the east Asian and world populations.

Methods: EDTA-blood specimens were collected from the unrelated individuals. The DNA samples were extracted with Chelex method and were amplified by PCR technique. The PCR products were analyzed using both the PAGE horizontal electrophoresis with discontinuous buffer system and the automated fluorescence detection approach. Results: Four STRs consist of simple repeat motifs while one STR contains a complex repeat structure. The STR polymorphisms at all of the five loci have been observed in Chinese Han population. Conclusion: The obtained data are beneficial to understanding the population genetics of the five STR loci in Chinese Han population. As a simple approach, the PAGE horizontal electrophoresis can be employed for typing the five STR markers.

A total of 12 A, 22 B, and 16 DRB1 alleles were found in the Jinuo population, and 10 A, 28 B, and 18 DRB1 alleles were found in the Wa population. The A*110101-B*1502-DRB1*120201 was the predominant haplotype in both the Jinuo and Wa populations; A*110101-B*1301-DRB1*120201 and A*24020101-B*1502-DRB1*120201 were common in the Jinuo population, whereas A*110101-B*1532-DRB1*1504 and A*110101-B*350101-DRB1*1404 were common in the Wa population. Phylogenetic tree and principal component analyses based on HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 allele frequencies suggested that both the Jinuo and Wa populations belong to the Southeast Asian group, whereas Wa population is still maintaining its original genetic character and a great distance from other populations because of a founder effect and subsequent geographic isolation.

38349163814	Chromosome analysis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line KYSE 410-4 by repetitive multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization	Chromosome aberrations are distinctive features of human malignant tumors. Analysis of chromosomal changes can illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of cancer. To establish the technique of multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) for identifying chromosome aberrations in esophageal carcinoma cell line KYSE 410-4, four pools of 6-color whole-chromosome painting probes have been designed and hybridized on the same metaphase spread by four rounds of repetitive FISH. Repetitive 6-color M-FISH was successfully established and the cytogenetic abnormalities in KYSE 410-4 cells were characterized. Chromosome gains occurred at 2q, 3, 8, 17p, and X. An isochromosome 3q was visualized in the cell line, which might be one intermediate mechanism leading to 3p losses and/or 3q gains. Furthermore, 16 structural arrangements were detected, including four derivative chromosomes. The rearrangement of the centromeric regions accounted for approximately 44% of all rearrangements. The results added a more complete and accurate information of the genetic alterations to the classical cytogenetic description of KYSE 410-4 and provided a detailed cytogenetic background data for appropriate use of the cell line. The established 6-color M-FISH was useful for analyzing chromosomes in the whole genome of human tumors. © 2008 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

58249092666	Polymorphic Alu insertions and their associations with MHC class I alleles and haplotypes in Han and Jinuo populations in Yunnan Province, southwest of China	The associations of polymorphic Alu insertions (POALINs) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes enable us to better identify origins and evolution of MHC class I region haplotypes in different populations. For further studying origins and evolution of MHC class I region haplotypes in Han and Jinuo populations in Yunnan Province, we investigated frequencies of five POALINs, their associations with HLA-A and -B, the three-loci POALINs haplotype frequencies and HLA/POALIN four-loci haplotype frequencies within the alpha block of MHC class I region. We found that a strong positive association between AluHG and HLA-A*02 is in Jinuo, but not in Yunnan Han. These results suggest that MHC class I region haplotypes of the two studied populations might derive from different progenitor haplotypes and MHC I-POALINs are informative genetic markers for investigating origins and evolution of MHC class I region haplotypes in different populations. © 2009 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

Methods: The mutations located in exons 2-12 and in parts of introns of G6PD gene were analyzed by amplification refractory mutation system(ARMS), natural and mis-match primer PCR/restrict enzyme, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism(PCR-SSCP) analysis and automatic DNA sequencing. Results: Among these 23 samples, 5 different point mutations in G6PD gene were identified, and they constituted 5 genotypes. There were 7 Han and 3 Dai patients with G487A mutation, 7 cases with both intron 11 T93C and C1311T mutations, 4 cases with intron 5 636 or 637 T→del mutation, 1 case with G871A mutation, and 1 case with G487A/ T93C/C1311T mutation. Two haplotypes, 93C/1311T and 93C/1311T/487A were identified in Yunnan. A strong association was observed between C1311T and the Nla III restriction site produced by intron 11 T93C. The findings of the investigators on IVS-5 636 or 637T→del in Chinese, on G871A in mainland of China, and on G487A in the Han people of Yunnan have not been reported previously. Conclusion: G6PD deficiency is very heterogenous in Yunnan; G487A is one of the common mutations in that province and may be of different origins. Possibly IVS-11 T93C mutation is of non-African origin. IVS-11 T93C and C1311T might jointly result in G6PD deficiency. The above data on G6PD gene mutation types could be useful for clinical diagnosis, prevention of G6PD deficiency, and researches in the origin and migration of minorities in Yunnan or other regions.

77954157738	Nucleotide polymorphism of the TNF gene cluster in six Chinese populations	DNA variants in a 31-kb region of the human major histocompatibility complex, encompassing the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene cluster, were surveyed by direct sequencing of 283 unrelated individuals from six Chinese populations. A total of 273 polymorphic sites were identified, with nearly half of them novel. We observed an excess of rare variants and negative values of selection tests of the region, implying either that these populations experienced a historical expansion or that the surveyed region was subjected to natural selection. Different characteristics of the sequence variation in the six populations outline the genetic differentiation between Northern and Southern Chinese populations. The distributions of recombination rates are similar among all the populations, with variation in the magnitude and/or in the fine location of hot spots. Tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from HapMap (Phase II) CHB data accounted for an average of 64% of common SNPs from the six Chinese populations. We also observed a limited transferability of tag SNPs between Chinese populations on the 31-kb region with an excess of untaggable SNPs and ragged linkage disequilibrium blocks. It suggested that the design and interpretation of future association studies should be more cautious, and that a resequencing approach may refine tag SNP selection on Chinese-specific disease mapping. © 2010 The Japan Society of Human Genetics All rights reserved.

79952403214	CAG-repeat variant in the polymerase γ 3 gene and male infertility in the Chinese population: A meta-analysis	Several studies have reported a relationship between the length of the CAG-repeat in the polymerase γ (POLG) gene and male infertility. However, other studies have not reproduced this result. In our study, the POLG-CAG-repeat length was analyzed in 535healthy individuals from six Chinese Han populations living in different provinces. The frequencies of 10-CAG alleles and genotypes were high (97.38 and 94.13%, respectively), with no significant difference among the six Chinese Han populations. Furthermore, we determined the distribution of the POLG-CAG-repeat in 150 infertile men and 126 fertile men. Our study suggested that the distributions of POLG-CAG-repeat alleles and genotypes were not significantly different between infertile (95.67 and 92.67%, respectively) and fertile men (97.22 and 94.44%, respectively). In a subsequent meta-analysis, combining our data with data from previous studies, a comparison of the CAG-repeat alleles in fertile versus infertile men showed no obvious risk for male infertility associated with any particular allele (pooled odds ratio (OR)0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-1.48). The significance level was not attained with any of the following genetic models: homozygote comparison (not 10/not 10versus 10/10: OR1.34; 95% CI: 0.66-2.72), heterozygote comparison (10/not 10versus 10/10: OR1.04; 95% CI: 0.78-1.38), dominant model comparison (not 10/not 1010/not 10versus 10/10: OR1.08; 95% CI: 0.79-1.47) and recessive genetic comparison (not 10/not 10versus 10/not 1010/10: OR1.31; 95% CI: 0.68-2.55). In conclusion, there is no significant difference of the frequencies of POLG-CAG-repeat variants among six Chinese Han populations, and this polymorphism may not be associated with Chinese male infertility. On the basis of a meta-analysis, there is no obvious association between CAG-repeat variants of the POLG gene and male infertility. © 2011 AJA, SIMM & SJTU. All rights reserved.

84887481622	Correlation between the linguistic affinity and genetic diversity of Chinese ethnic groups	As the world's most populous nation, China exhibits a population with 56 nationalities. We already know the associations between genetic relationship of these ethnic groups in China and their geographic distributions are closely. However, the correlations between genetic diversity and linguistic affinities have still not been fully revealed in China. To investigate these correlations, 31 populations and 1527 samples were chosen, and the languages of this population covered all of the languages spoken in mainland China (including 8 main linguistic families and 16 subfamilies). The genetic polymorphisms of the populations were investigated using 10 autosomal microsatellites. Five ethnic groups, which included 234 samples, were genotyped in this survey, and the data collected from the other 26 populations were obtained from our previous study. An analysis of molecular variance, principal coordinate analysis, clustering analysis using the STRUCTURE and the Mantel test were used to investigate the correlations between genetic diversity and linguistic affinity. These analyses indicated that most populations who speak the same language demonstrate a similar genetic composition, although a few populations deviated from this linkage between genetics and language. The demographic histories of these populations who deviated from this linkage were investigated. Obvious reasons for why evolutionary processes of genetics and linguistics separated in these populations included geographic isolation, gene replacement, language replacement and intermarriage. Thus, we proposed that the consistency of genetic and linguistic evolution is still present in most populations in China; however, this consistency can be broken by many factors, such as isolation, language replacement or intermarriage. © 2013 The Japan Society of Human Genetics All rights reserved.

46749091298	Study on the genetic stability of immortalized cell line of lymphocyte cell transformed by EB virus after long subculture process	Objective: To study the genetic stability of an immortalized cell line transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) after long subculture process. Methods: In the present study, the genetic stability including chromosome diploidy, karyotypes and microsatellite DNA were evaluated with chromosome banding techniques and microsatellite DNA detection. The telomerase activity of the immortalized cell line was detected by using the telomerase assay kit. Results: From passage 1 to 30, there were no change of the diploidy, karyotypes of chromosome and microsatellite DNA, and the telomerase activity is negative. Conclusion: This study indicates that the immortalized cell line remains stable genetically within limited passages.

45549096260	A G-tract element in apoptotic agents-induced alternative splicing	Alternative splicing of a single pre-mRNA transcript can produce protein isoforms that promote either cell growth or death. Here we show that Ro-31-8220 (Ro), an apoptotic agent that inhibits protein kinase C and activates the c-Jun N terminal kinase, decreased the proportion of the cell growth-promoting Bcl-xL splice variant. Targeted mutagenesis analyses narrowed down a critical sequence to a 16-nt G-tract element (Gt16). Transferring this element to a heterologous gene conferred Ro response on an otherwise constitutive exon. The Ro effect was reduced by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, in a concentration-dependent manner. Search in the human genome followed by RT-PCR identified a group of genes that contain similar exonic G-tract elements and are responsive to Ro. Moreover, the Gt16 element also mediates the regulation of alternative splicing by other cell apoptosis-inducers particularly retinoic acid. Therefore, the G-tract element likely plays a role in the apoptotic agents-induced alternative splicing of a group of genes. The functions of these genes imply that this regulation will have impact on cell growth/death. © 2008 The Author(s).

50249090542	Comparative analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome between Tibetan and Han population	Objective: To construct me haplogroup and perform an analysis of mitochondrial whole-genome sequence in Tibetan and Han Chinese. Variations of nucleotide of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were identified and compared between the Tibetan and Han population. Methods: The mtDNA whole sequences of 40 Tibetan and 50 Han individuals were sequenced by an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA automatic sequencer. The sequences were assembled using software phredPhrap16.0, and all assembled sequences were manually verified according to the criterion of rCRS (revised Cambridge Reference Sequence). The haplogroups of mtDNA were constructed using phylogenetic analysis according to the criteria of MLTOMAP by Network meüiod. The data were elucidated by integrated methods. Results: Authors' results showed that all the pooled 90 subjects belonged to the Macrohaplogroup M and N, and were classified into 13 haplogroups. No differences were observed among the haplogroups of the two populations except for M9 haplogroup. A total of 21 variants were detected by comparing the mtDNA whole sequences between Tibetan and Han population; of those, 5 variants have not been reported before. In addition, we constructed the haplotypes of 5 variants harboring the D-loop region, and founded prominent difference in bom supertype 1 and supertype 2 between Tibetan and Han population. Conclusion: The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the Tibetan and Han ethnic groups shared close maternal relationship in origin. The biological implication of the significant variants is worth elucidating; whether they are the results of adaptive selection or neutral selection or pathological variations need to be further studied.

57049179070	Distribution of CCR5-Δ32, CCR2-64I, SDF1-3′A, CX3CR1-249I, and CX3CR1-280M in Chinese populations	Polymorphisms of CCR5, CCR2, SDF, and CX3CR1 were reported to be involved in HIV-1 infection or the development of disease progression to AIDS. Cohort studies showed that CCR5-Δ32, SDF1-3′A, and CCR2-64I were protective, which could provide resistance to HIV-1 infection or delay disease progression, although the effect of SDF1-3′A homozygosity in the later stage of progression to AIDS was still controversial. The two SNPs of CX3CR1-249I and 280M were independent risk factors, which could accelerate the progression to AIDS. In this study, we surveyed the frequency distributions of the five alleles in Chinese populations using PCR and PCR-RFLP. We found that the frequencies of the alleles varied substantially from population to population. We also observed that there was a large discrepancy between these alleles among populations of the north and south. Populations in the same language-speaking family or with the same origin shared similar allele distributions. Furthermore, genotype distributions were found to be in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and a significant linkage disequilibrium was observed between 249I and 280M. The comprehensive genotype analysis of the three-locus CCR5-Δ32, CCR2-64I, SDF1-3′A, and CX3CR1-249I-280M haplotypes for the first time provides host genetic information for future studies of HIV infection and disease progression in Chinese populations. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

65649126333	The association between HLA-A, -B alleles and major histocompatibility complex class i polymorphic Alu insertions in four populations in China	The study of the association between polymorphic Alu insertions [human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Alu] at five loci and HLA class I alleles at two loci allows for better identification of the origins and evolution of HLA class I region haplotypes in different populations. In the present study, we determined the frequencies of five HLA-Alus and their associations with HLA-A and -B alleles in Han, Wa, Maonan, and Jinuo populations. Our results showed a strong association between AluHG insertion and HLA-A*02 in all populations studied; however, the associations between AluHJ insertion and HLA-A*1101 and HLA-A*2402 and AluHF insertion and HLA-A*2601 were only observed in Han. The AluMICB insertion showed a strong association with HLA-B*5502 in Han, Maonan, and Jinuo. HLA-A*0101, HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0203, HLA-A*1101, HLA-A*2402, HLA-A*2601, and HLA-A*3101 alleles were associated with one or more of the three different Alu elements within the alpha block as independent haplotypes, and HLA-A*0101, HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*0203, HLA-A*1101, and HLA-A*2402 alleles were associated with at least two different Alu insertions as a haplotype within the alpha block. We conclude that the HLA class I region haplotypes of the four populations were derived from different progenitor haplotypes, and relatively high rates of recombination between individuals with HLA-A alleles and different HLA-Alus occurred in this region. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A total of 13 A, 26 B, 15 Cw, and 23 DRB1 alleles of HLA were found in FYDH. The frequencies of A*1101, A*0207, A*2402, B*4601, B*1502, Cw*0102, Cw*0801, DRB1*0901, and DRB1*1202 were >10%. The following haplotypes were common with frequencies >5%: three A-B, four Cw-B, two B-DRB1, two A-B-DRB1, three A-B-Cw, two B-Cw-DRB1, and two A-B-Cw-DRB1 phylogenetic tree and multidimensional scaling analysis based on HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 allele frequencies of 18 Han populations suggested that FYDH was an isolated Han population, but the analytic result also provided a suggestion that FYDH was genetically related to Chinese Southern Han. According to the characteristics of the HLA allele and haplotype distributions and significantly reduced allelic and haplotypic diversity in FYDH, we deduced that genetic drift and/or selection and subsequent geographic isolation had influenced the distribution characteristics of the HLA gene in FYDH. In addition, significantly reduced allelic and haplotypic diversity in FYDH makes it an ideal homogenous population and very useful model for future investigations of issues related to immunogenetic diseases in the Han population. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

68249161920	RANTES In1.1C allele polymorphisms in 13 Chinese ethnic populations	Background: The In1.1C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele results in reduced RANTES transcription, which is associated with increased frequency of HIV-1 infection, and rapid progression to AIDS among HIV-1-infected individuals. This study aimed to study the mutant frequency and polymorphism of RANTES in Chinese populations. Methods: The genotypes of RANTES In1.1C were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) with the digestion of restriction endonuclease Mbo II. Results: Of the 617 individuals, 290 (47%) were carriers of the RANTES In1.1C allele, 52 of whom were homozygotes, whereas 238 were heterozygotes. The frequency of the RANTES In1.1C allele in those tested individuals was 0.2840. The frequencies of In1.1C allele varied from 0.07-0.27 in most of the populations in South-west China except for the two Lisu populations, while the frequencies of In1.1C spans from 0.35 to 0.45 in North-west China.

We examined the relationship between DLC1 polymorphisms and HCC risk among Chinese. Methods: Three DLC1 polymorphisms, Ex11 + 255T > G (rs3739298), Ex11-620G > A (rs532841) and IVS19 + 108C > T (rs621554), were genotyped in 434 patients with HCC and 480 controls by PCR-RFLP. The associations with the susceptibility to HCC were evaluated while controlling for confounding factors. Results: We observed significantly increased susceptibility to HCC for the C/C genotype compared with T/T of IVS19 + 108C > T in the HBV carriers (OR = 2.95, 95% CI, 1.65-5.26, P < 0.001). Compared with the haplotype G-A-T (in order of Ex11 + 255T > G, Ex11-620G > A and IVS19 + 108C > T), the haplotype T-G-C was also significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to HCC among HBV carriers (OR = 2.16, 95% CI, 1.08-4.35, P = 0.009). The stratified analysis indicated no modification of the confounding factors on the increased susceptibility to HCC related to the DLC1 polymorphism/haplotype. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that DLC1 genetic polymorphism or haplotype play a role in mediating the susceptibility to HBV-related HCC. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0034486810	Studies on the polymorphism of MICA gene in four Chinese populations	Objective: To understand with greater clearness the genetic polymorphism of (GCT)n repeat of MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA) in some Chinese populations and provide preliminary genetic evidence for the independent origin of Chinese Baima Tibetan (BMT). Methods: ACD-blood or saliva specimens of 411 unrelated individuals from four Chinese populations were collected. A primer pair spanning exon 5 of MICA gene was used to amplify the GCT region. Alleles were detected by PCR and denaturing PAGE. Comparison of the allelic distributions among the four populations was carried out. Results: Five previously reported alleles have been observed in all the four populations, but the allelic distributions are different from one another. The most frequent allele is the A5 in all the four populations (0. 325 in BMT, 0. 345 in Tibetans, 0. 390 in Chengdu Hans and 0. 319 in Qiangs). A5. 1 allele is the second most frequent allele in Chengdu Hans (0. 230) and in Qiangs (0. 293), while the second most frequent alleles for BMT and Tibetans are A4 (0. 254) and A9 (0. 272) respectively. The distribution of alleles in BMT is significantly different from that in the other three populations. Conclusion: Alleles of MICA gene exon 5 are conservative in all populations studied so far. The results suggest that genetically BMT might be an independent ethnic population.

72149083621	Mapping human genetic diversity in Asia	Asia harbors substantial cultural and linguistic diversity, but the geographic structure of genetic variation across the continent remains enigmatic. Here we report a large-scale survey of autosomal variation from a broad geographic sample of Asian human populations. Our results show that genetic ancestry is strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations as well as geography. Most populations show relatedness within ethnic/linguistic groups, despite prevalent gene flow among populations. More than 90% of East Asian (EA) haplotypes could be found in either Southeast Asian (SEA) or Central-South Asian (CSA) populations and show clinal structure with haplotype diversity decreasing from south to north. Furthermore, 50% of EA haplotypes were found in SEA only and 5% were found in CSA only, indicating that SEA was a major geographic source of EA populations.

77955150601	The association and differentiation of MHC class i polymorphic Alu insertions and HLA-B/Cw alleles in seven Chinese populations	We investigated polymorphic Alu insertion (POALIN) frequencies at five loci in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genomic region to determine their allele and haplotype frequencies and associations with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B and -Cw genes in seven different Chinese ethnic populations, the Han, Bulang, Wa, Dai, Maonan, Hani and Jinuo. The POALINs varied in frequency between 0% and 42.3% with significant differences between populations at all of the loci. Each POALIN was in significant linkage disequilibrium with a variety of HLA-B or -Cw four-digit alleles. The percentage association between Alu insertions and the HLA-B or -Cw alleles was calculated in pairwise analyses of haplotypes to show possible crossing over events between loci. The POALIN insertions also helped to further stratify the HLA-B:-Cw haplotypes into different POALIN:HLA-B:HLA-Cw haplotype frequencies. Of the two-locus, five-locus and seven-locus haplotype analyses, the seven-locus haplotypes showed the largest number of differences between the populations. The most common multilocus haplotype in Han was MICB*1:B*4601: Cw*0102:TF*1:HJ*1:HG*2:HF*1 (15.6%) associated with the AluHG insertion, whereas the second most common multilocus haplotype in Han was MICB*1:B*1502:Cw*0801:TF*1:HJ*2: HG*1:HF*1 (11.8%) associated with the AluHJ insertion. This comparative study of multilocus POALINs in the HLA class I region of seven Chinese ethnic populations shows that POALINs alone or together with the HLA class I alleles are informative genetic markers for the identification of HLA class I allele and haplotype lineages and variations such as crossing over events within the same and/or different populations. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this study, we reported HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 alleles and haplotypes in the Bulang and Hani populations of southwestern China using a high-resolution polymerase chain reaction-Luminex (PCR-Luminex) typing method. A total of nine HLA-A, 22 HLA-B, 13 HLA-C and 18 HLA-DRB1 alleles were identified in the Bulang population, and 11 HLA-A, 25 HLA-B, 14 HLA-C and 19 HLA-DRB1 alleles were in the Hani population. Compared with other populations, the predominant A*1101-B*1502-DRB1*1202 haplotype in the Bulang and Hani populations was also common in Jinuo, Wa, Dai, Maonan and Vietnamese populations. The distribution of HLA genes indicate that Bulang and Hani populations belong to the Southeast Asia group and they have maintained their original genetic characteristics and kept a long genetic distance from other populations owing to founder effects and subsequent geographic isolation. In addition, the close relationship among ethnic groups in Yunnan province and the Thai and Vietnamese populations were confirmed, whereas the Mon-Kmer-speaking populations shared other common HLA alleles and haplotypes compared with other linguistic groups. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Methods: Nine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci of the HIF1A gene from three Tibetan groups (Tibet, Qinghai Province and Yunnan Province) were genotyped using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Results: For non-synonymous mutation SNP site, there was no significant difference among the three Tibetan groups, except for SNP rs11549465 between Tibet Tibetan and Yunnan Tibetan, as well as between Qinghai Tibetan and Yunnan Tibetan. Frequencies of genotypes and alleles in rs4899056, rsl957757, rs10873142 and rs3783752 had significant differences between Tibet Tibetan and Yunnan Tibetan, and between Qinghai Tibetan and Yunnan Tibetan (all P<0.05). We also observed that the difference was negatively correlated with the altitude. Conclusion: The results suggested that the HIF1A gene might be under hypoxic selection induced by high altitude in the three groups.

79955509650	Genetic and clinical analysis in a Chinese parkinsonism-predominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 family	Parkinson's disease is a degenerative central nervous system disorder that often impairs motor skills, speech and other functions. We discovered a large Chinese family showing primarily parkinsonism symptoms with autosomal dominant inheritance. Six affected individuals in the family showed typical parkinsonism symptoms, including pill-rolling tremor. Two other affected individuals showed cerebellar ataxia symptoms. A whole-genome scan using the 50K single nucleotide polymorphism array with three different linkage methods detected two positive regions on chromosome 12q24.1 and 5q13.3. The ATXN2 gene, responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) was located precisely in the center of the positive region on chromosome 12. Further analysis of SCA2 revealed heterozygous pathological CAG expansions in the family. The affected individuals symptoms were typical of parkinsonism, but complex. Inverse correlation between CAG repeat size and age of onset is not obvious in this pedigree. This parkinsonism-predominant SCA2 family shared the same disease gene locus with other standard SCA2 families, but it is possible that variations in one or more modifier genes might account for the parkinsonism-predominant SCA2 predisposition observed in this pedigree. © 2011 The Japan Society of Human Genetics All rights reserved.

79955826807	Association of EMILIN1 gene polymorphism with essential hypertension in Mongolian	Objective: To explore the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the elastin microfibril interfacer 1 (EMILIN1) gene and essential hypertension. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in which 201 hypertensive patients and 202 healthy controls in Mongolian population were enrolled, and the genotypes of rs3754734, rs2011616 and rs2304682 loci were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct sequencing techniques. Results: There were significant differences in the frequencies of alleles and genotypes for the rs2304682 between the hypertensives and normotensives in the population(P<0.05). The frequency of the OG haplotype established by rs3754734 and rs2304682 was significantly higher in the hypertensive patients (P<0.05). The frequencies of alleles and genotypes for the rs2304682 also had significant differences between the group with high diastolic blood pressure and normal diastolic blood pressure (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the frequencies of alleles and genotypes for the 3 SNPs between the group with high systolic blood pressure and normal systolic blood pressure (P>0.05). Conclusion: The rs2304682 locus in the EMILIN1 gene, as well as the haplotypes G-G constructed using rs3754734 and rs2304682, may associate with the susceptibility of essential hypertension in the Mongolian population. Also, rs2304682 may associate with the level of the diastolic blood pressure.

KIR/HLA combinations play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. In the current study, 16 KIR genes were analyzed in an isolated Han group living in the Fengyandong (FYDH) region in the Yunnan province of southwest China. The framework KIR genes 3DL2, 3DL3, 3DP1, and 2DL4 were found in all individuals. A total of 22 distinct KIR genotypes were observed, four of which were unknown previously. Genotype 1 (N = 52, 55.9%) was the predominant genotype. Analysis of inhibitory and activating KIR and HLA-C ligands showed that all individuals displayed at least one inhibitory or activating KIR/HLA-C pair. One KIR/HLA-C pair was the most frequent (67/93), followed by two pairs (21/93), and three pairs (6/93). The comparison of KIR and HLA frequencies between FYDH and a local Han population showed that the two populations showed similar frequencies for the KIR genes. In contrast, the distribution of HLA alleles and haplotypes showed significant differences between them. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

79959535947	Distribution of HLA-C genes and HLA C-B, A-C-B haplotypes in Jinuo, Maonan and Wa ethnic populations in southwest China	Objective: To investigate the distribution of human leukocyte antigen(HLA) class I genes and haplotypes in Jinuo, Maonan and Wa ethnic populations in southwest China. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) typing by Luminex was performed to genotype the HLA-C alleles in unrelated healthy individuals in the three populations. HLA C-B, A-C-B haplotypes were computed by combining the previous HLA-A and -B genotyping data using Pypop7. 0 software. Results: Eighteen HLA-C genes were identified in the three populations, with 17, 13 and 15 HLA-C genes in Jinuo, Maonan and Wa populations respectively. The alleles with frequency of more than 10% from high to low were C * 08:01, C * 01:02, C * 03:04 and C* 07:02 in the Jinuo, C * 03:04, C * 01:02, C * 07:02 and C * 08:01 in the Maonan, and C * 12:03, C * 08:01, C * 07:02 and C * 04:01 in the Wa. The predominant HLA A-C-B haplotypes were A * 02:07-C * 01:02-B* 46:01, A* 11:01-C * 08:01-B * 15:02 and A * 11: 01-C*03:04-B* 13:01 in the Jinuo, A* 11:01-C * 03:04-B * 13:01, A * 02:07-C * 01:02-B * 46:01, A* 11:01-C* 08:01-B* 15:02 and A * 02:03-C * 07:02-B * 38:02 in the Maonan, and A* 11:01-0*08:01- B* 15:02, A* 11:01-C * 12:03-B * 15:32 and A * 11:01-C * 04:01-B * 35:01 in the Wa, respectively. Conclusion: There were different characteristics in the distributions of HLA-C genes and HLA C-B, A-C-B haplotypes in the Jinuo, Maonan and Wa populations. However, haplotypes C * 08:01-B * 15:02 and A * 11:01-C* 08:01-B* 15:02 with high frequencies were common in the three populations, which might be the common ancient haplotypes of southern Chinese population. The study of HLA genes and haplotypes in these populations may be of significance in the study of population genetics, transplantation and disease association.

79959560799	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of 5′- untranslated region of GPx4 gene and male infertility	Objective: To study the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx4 or PHGPx) gene and oligo- or asthenozoospermic male infertility. Methods: The 5′-UTR region of the GPx4 gene was amplified from infertile men and controls using the polymerase chain reaction and was analyzed for polymorphisms by direct sequencing. Results: A total of 9 SNPs were present in the cohort, however there were no significant differences in these 9 SNPs between the case and control groups. According to the results of linkage disequilibrium analysis and haplotype construction, one haplotype (rs757229-rs757230-rs4588110-rs3746165- rs3746166: C-G-G-T-A) was present only in the control men, and significant difference was detected (P<0. 01). Conclusion: The SNPs of 5′-UTR region of the GPx4 gene might not be associated with oligo- or asthenozoospermic male infertility. However, the haplotype (rs757229-rs757230-rs4588110- rs3746165-rs3746166: C-G-G-T-A) might be a protective haplotype.

79961032359	Diversity of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor genes in four ethnic groups in China	Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) show extensive variation in terms of gene content and allelic polymorphisms among different populations. The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of KIR genes in the Bulang, Nu, Yugu, and Zhuang ethnic groups, which belong to four different language families in China, and thus to provide basic KIR gene and genotype data for these Chinese ethnic groups. Genotyping of 16 KIR genes was performed in 425 unrelated individuals using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe method with the Luminex MultiAnalyte Profiling System. The four framework KIR genes were detected in all four ethnic groups. The activating KIR genes as well as the inhibitory KIR genes showed extreme diversity among these four populations. A total of 35 distinct KIR genotypes were identified, one of which was previously unknown. The four most common genotypes were identified in all four populations and comprised 66.1~91.1% of all the genotypes. The group A haplotype occurred more frequently than the group B haplotype in the Nu, Yugu, and Zhuang populations, as in other East Asian populations. In contrast, the group A and group B haplotypes occurred equally in the Bulang population. The results of the present study suggested that the KIR genes and genotypes are diverse in these four ethnic groups, and each ethnic group has its own characteristic KIR distribution. The findings with respect to KIR gene diversity in these four populations should provide relevant genomic diversity data for the future study of viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and reproductive fitness. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

79960437783	HLA polymorphism of the Zhuang population reflects the common HLA characteristics among Zhuang-Dong language-speaking populations	A study of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic characteristics in the Zhuang, the largest ethnic population in China, would provide insight into Zhuang history and give a useful tool for disease associations, transplantation, and anthropology. In the present study, we report the comprehensive HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 alleles and haplotypes in the Zhuang population of southern China for the first time. A total of 13 HLA-A, 24 HLA-B, 22 HLA-C, and 18 HLA-DRB1 were identified in 104 Zhuang individuals. The frequencies of HLA-A*11:01, A*02:07, A*24:02, A*02:03, and A*33:03 on A loci, B*15:02, B*58:01, B*46:01, and B*13:01 on B loci, C*03:04, C*08:01, C*01:02, C*03:02, and C*07:02 on C loci, and DRB1*15:01, DRB1*16:02, DRB1*14:01, DRB1*15:02, and DRB1*03:01 on the DRB1 loci were S>10%. The A*33:03-C*03:02-B*58:01- DRB1*03:01 and A*02:07-C*01:02-B*46:01-DRB1*14:01 haplotypes were predominant in the Zhuang. The phylogenetic tree, as well as the analysis of haplotypes, suggested that the Zhuang are genetically similar to southern Chinese populations, especially the Zhuang-Dong language-speaking populations, such as the Bouyei, Dai, and Maonan. Even though the Zhuang and southern Chinese populations shared common alleles and haplotypes, the Zhuang has maintained its unique genetic characteristics. © 2011 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80155139480	Association between diversity of hypoxia at different altitude and the polymorphism of EPAS1 gene	Objective: To study the selection effect of endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1)gene induced by high altitude hypoxia environment. Methods: Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphism sites (SNPs) of the EPAS1 gene were genotyped using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP) in three Tibetan groups (58 samples from Tibetan living in an altitude of about 3700 meters above sea level, 47 from Qinghai province, about 3100 meters above sea level, 43 from Yunnan province, about 2500 meters above sea level), and Han of Shandong (47 samples, about 50 meters above sea level). Results: There were significant differences of most SNP allelic, genotypic and haplotypic frequencies when comparing Han of Shandong, Tibetan of Yunnan with Tibetan of Tibetan and Qinghai. But no difference between Han of Shandong and Tibetan of Yunnan was found. Conclusion: The EPAS1 gene might be under hypoxic selection induced by high altitude.

84555195090	Safety and immunogenicity of inactivated poliovirus vaccine made from sabin strains: A phase II, randomized, positive-controlled Trial	Background. The production of Sabin inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) can reduce biosafety requirements in the posteradication/post-oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) era. We conducted a phase II, randomized, positive-controlled trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Sabin IPV. Methods. The test groups (A, B, and C) received 3 doses of high, middle, and low D antigen (D Ag) of Sabin IPV at ages 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. Infants in 2 control groups, group D and group E, received 3 doses of trivalent OPV and conventional IPV (cIPV), respectively, on the same schedule as that of groups A, B, and C. Serum samples were collected before and 30 days after the administration of the third dose. Results. In total, 500 infants were randomly assigned to 5 groups, and 449 infants completed the vaccine series. No serious adverse events were associated with vaccinations. After 3 doses, the seroconversion rates in groups A, B, C, D, and E were 100%, 97.8%, 96.6%, 100%, and 90.1%, respectively, for type 1 poliovirus; 97.7%, 95.7%, 78.7%, 100%, and 90.1%, respectively, for type 2; and 98.8%, 98.9%, 93.3%, 100%, and 97.8%, respectively, for type 3. Conclusions. Sabin IPV has good safety characteristics. The seroconversion rates for type 1 poliovirus (most appropriate concentration, 15 D Ag units [DU]), type 2 (32 DU), and type 3 (45 DU) Sabin IPV were similar to those of the OPV and cIPV control groups.

84857043377	Differences in mtDNA whole sequence between Tibetan and Han populations suggesting adaptive selection to high altitude	We performed a mitochondrial whole-genome comparison study in 40 Tibetan and 50 Han Chinese. All subjects could be classified into 13 haplogroups pertained to the Macrohaplogroup M and N that pitched different quadrants by principal component analysis. We observed a difference in the M9 haplogroup and identified 18 significant variants by comparing whole sequences between Tibetan and Han populations. Variants in ND2, COX2, tRNA alanine and 12S rRNA were predicted to confer increased protein stability in Tibetans. We compared the base substitutions of nonsynonymous (NS) versus synonymous (S) of 13 protein-encoding genes and found the NS/S values of the ATP6, ATP8, and Cyt b genes were larger (> 1) in Tibetans than that in Han population. Our findings provide clues for the existence of adaptive selection for the ATP6, ATP8, Cyt b, ND2, COX2, tRNA alanine and 12S rRNA genes in Tibetans which likely contributed to adaptation to their specific geographic environment, such as high altitude. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84860286534	Association between Alu insertion polymorphisms and HLA class I alleles in Chinese Lisu and Nu ethnic populations	Objective: To investigate the frequencies of HLA-Alu repeat polymorphisms (AluMICB, AluTF, AluHJ, AluHG and AluHF) in Chinese Lisu and Nu ethnic populations. Methods: The frequencies of HLA-Alu repeat polymorphisms in above populations were determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The associations between HLA-Alu repeat polymorphisms and HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles were also analyzed. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with genetic distance calculated from the frequencies of HLA-Alu repeat polymorphisms. Results: Frequencies of AluTF*2 and AluHF*2 were different between the two populations (P<0.05), while those of other three insertions were similar. The strength of association between HLA-Alus and HLA alleles were different (P<0.05) in the two populations. Although AluMICB*2 were associated with HLA-B*56:01 in both populations, the association was stronger in Lisu population (74.0%) but moderate in Nu population (30.7%). HLA-Alus were associated with particular HLA subtypes, e.g., AluHG*2 with certain HLA-A*02 subtypes. By phylogenetic analysis, Lisu and Nu were clustered together with southern Chinese and Thai populations. Conclusion: The distribution of HLA-Alus and the strength of associations between HLA-Alus and HLA class I alleles have varied between the two populations. Study of this association may facilitate identification of origins, evolution, progenitor haplotypes and recombination within the HLA class I region.

However, the frequencies of AA of -455G/A, T and TT of rs1333040, T and TT of rs10116277 and G and GG of rs2383207 were significantly higher in MI group compared with the controls (P<0.05), whilst the frequencies of CT of rs1333040 and GT of rs10116277 were significantly lower in MI group compared with the controls (P<0.05). Conclusion: Polymorphisms of F VII. F XII, -148C/T of FBG and rs1333049 of 9p21 were not associated with myocardial infarction. Polymorphisms of -455G/A of FBG and rs1333040, rs10116277 and rs2383207 of 9p21 may be associated with MI in ethnic Han Chinese from Yunnan province.

84866763631	Detection and preliminary study of a family carrying a CCR5Δ32 deletional mutation	Objective: To investigate the frequencies of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 gene (CCR5) Δ32 deletional mutation of in Han and Dai populations from Yunnan province. Immortalized cell lines were derived from a family carrying the CCR5Δ32 mutation. Methods: Blood samples of 346 Han and 355 Dai individuals were collected for genotyping. The coding regions of CCR5 gene were amplified with PCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Suspected mutations were verified with DNA sequencing. Immortalized cell lines were constructed by using Epstein Barr virus and cyclosporine A. The difference between the cell lines and original blood samples was verified with PCR. Results: One ethnic Han individual was confirmed to be heterozygous for a deletional mutation by sequencing, which has led to discovery of a family with CCR5Δ32. Nine immortalized cell lines were established from this family, and no difference between the cell lines and original blood samples was detected by PCR. Conclusion: Together with previous reports, this study has indicated a significant difference in CCR5Δ32 among different ethnic groups in China. Established immortalized cell lines can also provide material for future research.

84866883207	Distinct HLA allele and haplotype distributions in four ethnic groups of China	Distinct human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele and haplotype distributions occur in the northern and southern Han populations of China. However, different ethnic groups in China show limited regional distributions for many HLA alleles and haplotypes. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to study the differences in HLA allele and haplotype distribution for northern and southern ethnic groups of China. A total of 428 unrelated individuals from the Lisu, Nu, Tu and Yugur ethnic populations were genotyped for HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 alleles using the PCR-Luminex typing method. The frequencies of HLA alleles and statistically inferred haplotypes were calculated. A total of 29 HLA-A, 54 HLA-B, 27 HLA-C and 41 HLA-DRB1 alleles were spread throughout these four populations with distinct allele and deduced haplotype frequencies between populations. Some alleles and deduced haplotypes exhibited significantly different distributions between northern (Tu and Yugur) and southern groups (Lisu and Nu). A phylogenetic tree and principal component analysis were used to compare the HLA polymorphism between our dataset and 19 other eastern and southeastern Asian populations. This analysis showed that Lisu and Nu belong to a cluster of southern ethnic groups, while Tu and Yugur are most closely related to other northern groups. Thus, distinct ethnic population histories were revealed by analyzing HLA allelic polymorphisms with the HLA profiles of the Lisu and Nu southern Chinese ethnic groups clearly different from the Tu and Yugur northern ethnic groups. The results will be useful for future association studies of infectious disease and contribute toward a more efficient search of organ/tissue matches for transplantation. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84874945070	Distribution of HLA-G 14-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in six Chinese ethnic groups	Summary: Recently, a 14-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (+14 bp/-14 bp) in exon 8 of the Human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) gene has been studied extensively because this polymorphism has been associated with HLA-G mRNA stability and could influence HLA-G mRNA expression. We investigated the distribution of the 14-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in six different Chinese ethnic groups (Bulang, Wa, Hani, Jinuo, Maonan and Zhuang), which originated from three major ancient tribes (Di-Qiang, Baipu and Baiyue) in China. Comparison of the 14-bp insertion frequency in the six groups with other Chinese groups showed marked variation among the three ancient tribes, Di-Qing (0.490-0.534), Baipu (0.470-0.609) and Baiyue (0.280-0.344). Furthermore, the frequencies of the 14-bp insertion were similar in groups that came from the same ancient tribe, which indicated that the individuals who share the 14-bp insertion have the most probably inherited the 14-bp element from a common ancestor. In addition, an intra-tribal comparison of the 14-bp insertion/deletion frequencies between the descendants of the ancient ancestral tribes suggests that population histories or some environmental effects, such as founder effect or isolation, might also influence the distribution. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Methods: A case-control study was carried out on 192 patients of rheumatoid arthritis and 288 healthy controls. Genotypes of rs33996649 and 1858 loci within PTPN22 gene, and rs11203366 and rs874881 loci within PADI4 gene were determined with polymerase chain reaction -restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotypes of rs1635579, rs2428736 and rs2240340 in PADI4 gene were determined with pyro-sequencing. Results: The frequencies of alleles and genotypes of rs2240340 locus in PADH gene showed a significant difference between rheumatoid arthritis and control in Yunnan population (P<0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggested that rs2240340 in PADI4 gene is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in Yunnan.

84876003470	Autosomal STRs Provide Genetic Evidence for the Hypothesis That Tai People Originate from Southern China	Tai people are widely distributed in Thailand, Laos and southwestern China and are a large population of Southeast Asia. Although most anthropologists and historians agree that modern Tai people are from southwestern China and northern Thailand, the place from which they historically migrated remains controversial. Three popular hypotheses have been proposed: northern origin hypothesis, southern origin hypothesis or an indigenous origin. We compared the genetic relationships between the Tai in China and their "siblings" to test different hypotheses by analyzing 10 autosomal microsatellites. The genetic data of 916 samples from 19 populations were analyzed in this survey. The autosomal STR data from 15 of the 19 populations came from our previous study (Lin et al., 2010). 194 samples from four additional populations were genotyped in this study: Han (Yunnan), Dai (Dehong), Dai (Yuxi) and Mongolian. The results of genetic distance comparisons, genetic structure analyses and admixture analyses all indicate that populations from northern origin hypothesis have large genetic distances and are clearly differentiated from the Tai. The simulation-based ABC analysis also indicates this. The posterior probability of the northern origin hypothesis is just 0.04 [95%CI: (0.01-0.06)]. Conversely, genetic relationships were very close between the Tai and populations from southern origin or an indigenous origin hypothesis. Simulation-based ABC analyses were also used to distinguish the southern origin hypothesis from the indigenous origin hypothesis. The results indicate that the posterior probability of the southern origin hypothesis [0.640, 95%CI: (0.524-0.757)] is greater than that of the indigenous origin hypothesis [0.324, 95%CI: (0.211-0.438)]. Therefore, we propose that the genetic evidence does not support the hypothesis of northern origin. Our genetic data indicate that the southern origin hypothesis has higher probability than the other two hypotheses statistically, suggesting that the Tai people most likely originated from southern China. © 2013 Sun et al.

84877629113	Association between polymorphisms of PSMB8, PSMB9 and TAP2 genes with rheumatoid arthritis in ethnic Han Chinese from Yunnan	Objective: To assess the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PSMB8, PSMB9 and TAP2 genes and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in ethnic Han Chinese from Yunnan. Methods: A case-control study was carried out using 177 RA patients and 288 healthy controls. Genotypes of rs2071543, rs55745125 and rs138635403 loci of PSMB8 gene, and rs17587 locus of PSMB9 gene were determined with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). And polymerase chain reaction amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR) was used for typing rs2228396 locus of TAP2 gene. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were calculated. An Epi Info 7 software was used to calculate the Odds Ratio (OR) of above SNPs between the two groups. Results: Allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs138635403 and rs17587 loci have differed significantly between the two groups (P <0.05). The frequency of GG genotype for rs17587 locus was also higher in the RA group (0.672) compared with control group (0.524) (OR= 1.862, 95% CI: 1.261-2.749). Conclusion: Genetic polymorphisms of rs17587 appeared to be associated with RA in ethnic Han Chinese from Yunnan.

84886888793	Mechanism of the apoptosis induction by Flavopiridol synergizes TRAIL in SPC-A1 cell	OBJECTIVE: To study the synergistic mechanism between Flavopiridol (FP) and tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer cell line SPC-A1.METHODS: SPC-A1 cells were treated with FP, TRAIL and FP combined with TRAIL to induce apoptosis. MTT assay was used to measure cell proliferation and viability. Expression of apoptosis related proteins were detected by using Western blotting. RT-PCR was used to measure RNA transcript expression. RESULTS: The cell surviving rates of FP and TRAIL combination treatment group (47.48±1.41)% was significantly lower than that of the 100 nmol/L FP group [(80.26±2.43)%] and 100 ng/mL TRAIL group [(90.49±1.60)%(P=0.000)]. In the combination of TRAIL plus FP treatment group, the expression of anti-apoptotic protein FLIP(4%), XIAP(15%), Mcl-1, and Livin were down-regulated significantly. The expression of Mcl-1 and Livin were under detectable level. Cleaved Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 were increased, and their active fragments were about four times of the control group. The cytochrome c released from mitochondria into cytosol was about 7 times of the control group. However, the Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, and Bcl-xl were not altered by the combination treatment. DR4 mRNA expression was up-regulated by FP treatment and its relative expression level was 2.51±0.14(P<0.05). There were no significantly changes on transcription of Mcl-1, FLIP, XIAP and Livin. The cell survival rates were raised from (58.26±1.75)% up to (88.17±2.65)% (P=0.003) by using Pan-Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, which indicated that the synergistic effect of FP plus TRAIL on apoptosis induction can be inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that FP synergized TRAIL- induced apoptosis in SPC-A1 cell through up-regulating DR4 transcription, down-regulating Mcl-1, FLIP, XIAP, Livin proteins but not their transcripts, as well as increasing Caspase activity and mitochondrial injury. The synergistic effect was associated with amplification of apoptotic signal by both intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (non-mitochondrial) apoptotic signaling pathway.

0039888100	Genetic relationships among six Chinese populations revealed by analysis of 30 autosomal STRs	30 autosomal STRs of 6 Chinese populations (Bai, Naxi, Tu, Sala, Han in Shandong, She) were amplified by multiplex PCRs using fluerescein-labelled primers. Shriver's Dsw was estimated on the basis of the results of the genescanning and genotyping after running unnatural PAGE of the PCRs' products on ABI 377 sequencer. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using Neighbor-Joining and UPGMA method based on Dsw, and then the genetic relationships among them were analyzed referring to some relative informations. Our results indicated that the genetic distance between Sala and Tu is near, 0.033. But the distances between Sala and other four populations are far, over 0.12; Tu is close to Naxi and Shandong Han, and the distances are 0.038, 0.063 respectively; The distance between Bai and Han is the nearest, 0.007, but there is a distance, 0.075, between Bai and Naxi, and a far distance, 0.112, between Bai and Tu; The distance between Naxi and Han is 0.100 and the distances between She and other 5 populations are all over 0.12. In both of the NJ and UPGMA phylogenetic trees, Naxi, Tu and Sala is one cluster and Bai and Han is another cluster. She is a single branch. These results, basically consistent with 6 Chinese populations' geographic distribution and histories, can provide some genetic information to comprehensively study their origin, migration, formation and development with their historical records and archaeological evidence.

Methods Partial genome of a hepatitis A virus, Lü8 strain, was amplified with RT-PCR. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. Results The results showed that the most extensive nucleotide/amino acid homology was identified between Lü8 and HM175/7MK-5 strain with 98%/96% and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Lü8 strain of the hepatitis A virus belonged to genotypes I B. Conclusion Lü8 isolated shows much difference from most other HAV strains which had been reported in China.

84899044968	Association of three polymorphisms in the 3′ untranslated region of the HLA-G gene with systemic lupus erythematosus in a population from Yunnan	Objective: To assess the association of three polymorphisms (14-bpINS/DEL, +3035C/T T +3142C/G) in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of HLA-G gene and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Yunnan. Methods: A case-control study has been carried out on 206 SLE patients and 212 healthy controls. Genotypes of 14-bpINS/DEL (rs1704), +3035C/T (rs17179108) and +3142C/G G loci of 3′UTR of the HLA-G gene were determined with DNA sequencing. Results: Allelic and genotypic frequencies of 14-bpINS/DEL and +3142C/G did not differ significantly between the two groups (P>0.05). The frequencies of +3035T allele was significantly higher in the SLE group compared with the control group (P<0.01, OR = 1.604, 95% CI: 1.186-2.169). With a dominant inheritance model, the odd ratio of dominant genotype (CT+TT) was 2.004 (95% CI: 1.345-2.987, P = 0.0006) in the SLE group. Conclusion: The 14-bpINS/DEL and +3142C/G polymorphisms in the 3′UTR of the HLA-G gene are not associated with susceptibility to SLE in Yunnan, whilst the T allele of +3035C/T may be a risk factor for SLE.

12944305959	Polynesian origins: Insights from the Y chromosome	The question surrounding the colonization of Polynesia has remained controversial. Two hypotheses, one postulating Taiwan as the putative homeland and the other asserting a Melanesian origin of the Polynesian people, have received considerable attention. In this work, we present haplotype data based on the distribution of 19 biallelic polymorphisms on the Y chromosome in a sample of 551 male individuals from 36 populations living in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia. Surprisingly, nearly none of the Taiwanese Y haplotypes were found in Micronesia and Polynesia. Likewise, a Melanesian-specific haplotype was not found among the Polynesians. However, all of the Polynesian, Micronesian, and Taiwanese haplotypes are present in the extant Southeast Asian populations. Evidently, the Y-chromosome data do not lend support to either of the prevailing hypotheses. Rather, we postulate that Southeast Asia provided a genetic source for two independent migrations, one toward Taiwan and the other toward Polynesia through island Southeast Asia.

13144294027	Genetic relationship of populations in China	Despite the fact that the continuity of morphology of fossil specimens of modern humans found in China has repeatedly challenged the Out-of-Africa hypothesis, Chinese populations are underrepresented in genetic studies. Genetic profiles of 28 populations sampled in China supported the distinction between southern and northern populations, while the latter are biphyletic. Linguistic boundaries are often transgressed across language families studied, reflecting substantial gene flow between populations. Nevertheless, genetic evidence does not support an independent origin of Homo sapiens in China. The phylogeny also suggested that it is more likely that ancestors of the populations currently residing in East Asia entered from Southeast Asia.
