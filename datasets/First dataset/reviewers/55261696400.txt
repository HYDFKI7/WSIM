1842588700	Influenza A Virus PB1-F2 Gene in Recent Taiwanese Isolates	Influenza A virus contains eight RNA segments and encodes 10 viral proteins. However, an 11th protein, called PB1-F2, was found in A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1). This novel protein is translated from an alternative open reading frame (ORF) in the PB1 gene. We analyzed the PB1 gene of 42 recent influenza A isolates in Taiwan, including 24 H1N1 and 18 H3N2 strains. One H1N1 isolate and 17 H3N2 isolates contained the entire PB1-F2 ORF of 90 residues, three amino acids (aa) longer than the PB1-F2 of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 at the C terminal. The one remaining H3N2 isolate encoded a truncated PB1-F2 with 79 residues. The other 23 H1N1 isolates contained a truncated PB1-F2 of 57 aa. Phylogenetic analysis of both the HA and the PB1 genes showed that they shared similar clustering of these Taiwanese isolates, suggesting that no obvious reassortment occurred between the two genomic segments.

0029874195	Newly established MST-1 tumour cell line and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte culture from a patient with soft tissue melanoma (clear cell sarcoma) and their potential applications to patient immunotherapy	The establishment and characterisation of paired autologous tumour cell line (MST-1) and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) culture from a tumour mass of a 14-year-old Taiwanese girl with soft tissue melanoma are described. MST-1 cells grown in vitro were heterogeneous in morphology, ranging from floating round cells, loosely attached round/oval or elongated cells with prominent pseudopod-like processes, to well-attached spindle and elongated dendritic cells without obvious pseudopods. Immunostaining revealed that major melanoma-associated antigens, such as S100 protein, HMB-45, melanotransferrin, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan, and the gangliosides GD2 and GD3, were consistently expressed by the tumour tissue, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse xenograft and derived cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis of the tumour DNA content showed an index of 1.8 relative to normal peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA. Chromosome analysis revealed all cells at a hypotetraploid level with several clonal chromosome aberrations, including deletions at 10p and 12q, an addition at 12q, translocations t(1;14) and t(5;6). Electron microscopy showed melanosome structures. This observation and the expression of the major melanoma-associated antigens were all indicative of the melanocytic origin of MST-1 tumour. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) expanded TILs had the predominant CD8

26444603740	Powered instrumentation in the treatment of tracheal granulation tissue for decannulation	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of powered instrumentation tracheal surgery (PITS) in patients with tracheal granulation tissue following tracheostomy that caused or exacerbated airway obstruction and impeded decannulation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review. METHODS: Sixteen patients that accepted PITS for decannulation from tracheal granulation tissue were reviewed. The surgical procedure was performed with the assistance telescope connected to a television monitoring system. The success of PITS was defined as a decannulation for 3 months without a recurrence of airway obstruction. RESULTS: The average operation time was 34 minutes. No complication was met in the perioperative period. Fourteen cases (87.5%) were successfully decannulated within 3 days following PITS. The 2 cases that failed successful decannulation had undergone insertion of a tracheal stent for their hindered tracheal stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results reveal that the new operation modality, PITS, is a safe and simple method for the treatment of tracheal granulation tissue and could be a useful alternative for benign tracheal lesions. © 2005 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, Inc.

2942536151	Prolonged visual disturbance secondary to isolated sphenoid sinus disease	Objectives/Hypothesis: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic sinus surgery in patients with isolated sphenoid sinus disease with visual disturbances of more than 72 hours' duration. Study Design: Retrospective review. Methods: A sequential series of patients with isolated sphenoid sinus disease with visual disturbances who underwent endoscopic surgery performed by the same surgeon between 1995 and 2002 were reviewed. Patients with malignant tumors were excluded from the study. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively to record the effects of this approach on visual acuity and diplopia. Results: The study population included six women and seven men with a mean age of 56.2 years (age range, 31-75 y). Eight eyes had vision loss attributable to compressive optic neuropathy (27%) and optic neuritis (27%); seven eyes with diplopia had abducens palsy (40%) and oculomotor nerve palsy (7%). Sphenoid sinus lesions included sinusitis (38%), mucocele (31%), and aspergillosis (31%). The mean interval between the onset of visual disturbances and surgery was 6.6 months (range, 3 d-3.5 y). Visual disturbances improved in 60% of the patients (P < .01). There was better improvement in diplopia than in vision loss (P < .01). The results of endoscopic sinus surgery for patients with abducens palsy and aspergillosis were excellent (83% and 80%, respectively). Optic neuritis and visual disturbances lasting for more than 6 months were regarded as poor prognostic factors. Conclusion: The study supports the treatment of visual disturbances resulting from isolated sphenoid sinus disease by endoscopic sinus surgery. A timely operation may prevent permanent sequelae.

33646815324	Taste disturbance after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for obstructive sleep apnea	Objectives: This study investigated factors that may attribute to taste disturbance (TD) following uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Study design: This longitudinal intervention study enrolled 108 patients who received UPPP for OSA. Patients who reported TD in the postoperative questionnaire were examined using the three-drop-method gustatory function test (GFT). Results: The GFT revealed that 5 patients (4.6%) reporting TD lost at least one of the four basic tastes 3 months after surgery. Deficiency of sweet sense was the most common type of TD (80%). The use of electrocautery for developing the uvulopalatal flap was the only significant predictor that may attribute to TD (odds ratio: 14.1). Repeating the GFT 9 months after operation showed a restoration of tastes in 4 patients. Conclusions: Development of the uvulopalatal flap using electrocautery may increase the likelihood of postoperative TD. Patients with taste disturbance after UPPP may eventually recover their taste function over time. EBM rating: C-4. © 2006 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

33747185683	Impact of adenotonsillectomy on behavior in children with sleep-disordered breathing	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Children with sleep-disordered breathing may experience behavioral and learning problems such as inattentiveness and hyperactivity. The aim of this study was to measure the impact of adenotonsillectomy on sleep-related adverse events and behavioral problems in children with sleep-disordered breathing. METHOD: This prospective and interventional study enrolled 40 sleep-disordered breathing children (mean age, 8.4 ± 1.6 years) with hypertrophic tonsils and adenoids. All patients completed two polysomnographies, tests of variables of attention (TOVAs), and Child Behavior Checklists, one at baseline and the other 6 months after adenotonsillectomy. RESULTS: The apnea-hypopnea index (P < .001), TOVA scores (P < .001), and 8 of 9 individual domains of the Child Behavior Checklist scores (P < .05) significantly improved after surgery. However, the change in the apnea-hypopnea index was not negatively correlated with TOVA score (r = -0.17, P = .38). CONCLUSION: Adenotonsillectomy could significantly improve behavior (TOVA) scores, but the improvement may not simply be attributable to changes in sleep apnea events. © 2006 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

33846127450	Endoscopic Nd:YAG laser therapy of infantile subglottic hemangioma	Of the many therapeutic modalities that have been developed for infantile subglottic hemangioma (ISH), the most common technique is endoscopic excision with carbon dioxide laser, used alone or combined with other therapeutic techniques. A staged procedure has been proposed as the preferred choice for patients with severe airway obstruction. Nevertheless, ever since the neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was developed, this modality has been considered feasible to treat vascular tumor in the airway due to good hemostasis power. We present two cases of ISH with severe airway obstruction that underwent endoscopic surgery using an one-stage Nd:YAG laser approach. Details of the laser characteristics and surgery techniques are described in this article. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

34548433439	Alleviation of wound pain after surgeries for obstructive sleep apnea	OBJECTIVES: There has been growing awareness that alleviation of wound pain and associated symptoms after obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) surgeries may improve the quality of care. We performed a hospital-based study to compare the effectiveness and safety of two different regimens in the treatment of postoperative pain. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, and parallel-group study. METHODS: Ninety OSA patients were enrolled for surgical treatments in this study. Forty-five patients (group 1) were randomized to receive intravenous ketorolac and another 45 patients (group 2) were given the conventional regimen of oral mefenamic acid and intramuscular meperidine after OSA surgeries for 3 days at hospital. Postoperative discomfort was measured by a self-assessment questionnaire on the 1st and 3rd days after surgery. Any adverse effect of pain treatment was carefully monitored. Patients' satisfaction with postoperative pain treatment was evaluated 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS: On the 1st postoperative day, group 1 patients had a significantly lower mean score in six out of eight pain-related symptoms than group 2 patients had (P < .05). At the 3rd postoperative day, significant differences remained for two symptoms. Group 1 patients were generally more satisfied with their pain treatment than were group 2 patients (P = .01). Increased risk of postoperative bleeding for group 1 was not observed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term administration of intravenous ketorolac is noninferior to the conventional regimen and represents a safe and effective treatment for wound pain, particularly in the 1st day, after OSA surgeries in selected patients. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

This study investigated the incidence of malignant transformation and assessed possible risk factors for laryngeal papillomas. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal study. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive laryngeal papilloma patients were prospectively studied for 5 or more years, and each patient was periodically examined at 3 to 6 month intervals. A detailed epidemiologic questionnaire was administered at the initial visit. After enrollment, tissue obtained during each laryngeal surgery was examined by polymerase chain reaction assay for human papilloma virus (HPV) and typing. RESULTS: During 237 person-years of follow-up, six new, pathologically confirmed cases of laryngeal carcinoma were ascertained (incidence 2.5/100 person-years), and all were associated with HPV-6 or HPV-11. Malignant transformation revealed no correlation with the following: age less than 3 years at diagnosis, sex, history of tobacco use, history of alcohol consumption, family history of laryngeal cancer, or type of laryngeal papilloma. Laryngeal papilloma without demonstrable HPV DNA was the only significant risk factor for malignant transformation (P < .05). The cumulative risk of malignant transformation in subjects without demonstrable HPV DNA was significantly higher than that in HPV-positive patients (relative risk, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-60.3; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high incidence of malignant transformation of laryngeal papilloma was noted in Taiwanese patients. Patients without demonstrable HPV DNA require more frequent follow-up and may benefit from anti-HPV vaccinations. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

40949140220	Nasal surgery for snoring in patients with obstructive sleep apnea	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of nasal surgery to relieve snoring and to identify predictive factors. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective comparative study. METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients (51 males; mean age, 38 yr; body mass index, 25.4 ± 5.2 kg/m) were enrolled. All patients had been previously diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index, 38.5 ± 33.2 events/hr) and symptomatic nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum. Septomeatoplasty alone was the treatment in this study cohort. Snoring was assessed by Snore Outcome Survey (SOS), and nasal obstruction was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and anterior rhinomanometry at baseline and approximately 3 months after nasal surgery. RESULTS: Body mass index remained unchanged (P > .05) after surgery. Significantly improved SOS (P < .001), VAS (P < .001), and total nasal resistance (P = .002) were noted after nasal surgery. Eighty-six percent of patients had improved SOS scores, and average improvement was 46%. Complete relief of snoring was reported by the sleep partners of six (12%) patients. Change in SOS scores (22.5 ± 14.5 vs. 10.1 ± 10.4) significantly differed (P = .01) between tonsil size grade (TON) 0/I and TON II/III groups. Other baseline variables did not significantly differ (P > .05) in SOS score changes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with obstructive sleep apnea suffering from both snoring and nasal obstruction, nasal surgery for deviated septum relieves snoring in 12%. The tonsil size affects the outcome of nasal surgery for snoring. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

79952252546	Post-tonsillectomy pulmonary complication in a patient with tonsillar myeloid sarcoma	Myeloid sarcoma in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) manifesting as a non-healing tonsillar ulcer is an extremely rare occurrence. We report the case of a 57-year-old male smoker with a non-healing tonsillar ulcer who underwent tonsillectomy to rule out tonsillar carcinoma after failed antibiotic therapy. On postoperative day 2, he presented with a temperature of 40°C and white blood cell count of 34700/μL. Antibiotic therapy was begun; however, he died 1 day later due to pulmonary infection and septic shock. Though extremely rare, tonsillar involvement of MDS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a non-healing tonsillar lesion. When definitive diagnosis requires a tissue sample, punch biopsy may be preferable to tonsillectomy in a patient who may be immunocompromised, and appropriate prophylactic antibiotics should be administered. © 2011 The Japanese Society of Hematology.

42449099965	Helicobacter pylori colonization in the larynges of patients with hoarseness	OBJECTIVES: Vocal nodules and polyps are two common noninfectious causes of hoarseness. Patients with persistent hoarseness often require microscopic laryngeal surgery to excise mass lesions of the larynx despite extensive voice resting and modification of voice use behavior. Helicobacter pylori has recently been reported to present in the upper aerodigestive tract. This study applies the rapid urease test to determine the colonization of Helicobacter pylori in surgical specimens of patients with vocal nodules and polyps. METHODS: In this prospective study, 53 consecutive patients with vocal nodules (n = 20) or vocal polyps (n = 33) were investigated from November 2004 to July 2005. Microscopic laryngeal surgery was performed in all cases. Tissue specimens harvested from the larynx were analyzed using the rapid urease test. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 33 females and 20 males with a mean age of 43.1 ± 9.9 years. Thirteen (24.5%) of the 53 patients revealed Helicobacter pylori colonization, and all were histopathologically diagnosed with vocal polyps. The difference in incidence of Helicobacter pylori colonization between vocal nodules and vocal polyps was statistically significant (0% [0/20] vs. 39.4% [13/33], P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori often colonizes in the larynxes of patients with vocal polyps. These results indicate the involvement of Helicobacter pylori in vocal polyps. However, the presence of Helicobacter pylori as an etiologic factor in vocal polyps remains inconclusive. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

42549118218	Improvement in quality of life after nasal surgery alone for patients with obstructive sleep apnea and nasal obstruction	Objective: To evaluate the impact of nasal surgery alone on quality of life (QOL) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and nasal obstruction using generic and disease-specific QOL questionnaires. Design: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Patients: Fifty-one consecutive patients with obstructive sleep apnea (50 men and 1 woman; mean age, 39 years; mean [SD] apnea-hypopnea index, 37.4 [28.9] events/h; and mean ± SD body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 26.0 [3.5]) with symptoms of nasal obstruction due to a deviated nasal septum. Intervention: Septomeatoplasty. Outcome Measures: Surgical outcomes were measured using the Snore Outcomes Survey, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 3 months after surgery. We compared baseline and postoperative scores. Normative SF-36 data obtained from 4591 age- and sexmatched adults were used as references. Results: Nasal obstruction symptoms significantly improved (mean [SD] visual analog scale score, 5.2 [1.4]; P<.001). Assessments also showed significant improvement in the Snore Outcomes Survey (P<.001) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (P<.001) scores and 6 of the 8 SF-36 subscale scores (P<.05). Remarkable improvements were observed in disease-specific Snore Outcomes Survey (by 43.1%), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (by 27.3%), and generic SF-36 role-emotional (by 30.4%) and role-physical (by 20.7%) QOL subscales. The postoperative role-emotional, bodily pain, and social function dimensions of health were indistinguishable from referential population data (P>.05). Conclusions: Correction of an obstructed nasal airway significantly improves disease-specific and generic QOL in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea who also have nasal obstruction symptoms. After nasal surgery, patients may experience greater improvement in snoring and daytime sleepiness than in other generic health status. Our findings substantiate the role of nasal surgery in treating patients with obstructive sleep apnea and nasal obstruction. ©2008 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

4444250596	Functional endoscopic sinus surgery in children using a limited approach	Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the limited approach of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in pediatric patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and to interpret the indications for second-look endoscopy. Designs A retrospective review of medical records of patients who received pediatric FESS between January 1995 and September 2002 and a comprehensive parental questionnaire were used to assess postoperative symptom improvement at a mean postoperative follow-up of 27.2 months after surgery. Setting: A university-affiliated medical center. Patients: We studied 101 patients who received treatment of pediatric CRS refractory to optimal medical treatment Main Outcome Measures: We analyzed preoperative and postoperative nasal obstruction, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, headache, hyposmia, and chronic cough. Interventions: Patients underwent a limited surgical approach of FESS, basically a drainage rather than an extirpation procedure, for the treatment of pediatric CRS refractory to optimal medical treatment. Additionally, 29 patients (28%) underwent second-look endoscopy. Results: The proportions of patients whose symptoms improved were as follows: nasal obstruction, 91%; purulent rhinorrhea, 90%; postnasal drip, 90%; headache, 97%; hyposmia, 89%; and chronic cough, 96%. Of the 101 patients, parents of 87 (86%) were satisfied with the surgery. Conclusions: Our literature review did not reveal any other large series in the Asian population. The limited approach to FESS was effective in treating medically recalcitrant CRS in the children we studied. Second-look endoscopy was indicated for selected cases to ensure the extirpation of residual disease and the patency of ostiomeatal complex and sinus ostia.

4444367041	Use of morphological indicators to predict outcomes of palatopharyngeal surgery in patients with obstructive sleep apnea	There is no consensus on how to quantify the abnormality of upper airway structures in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This research aimed to use morphological indicators as clinical predictors to correlate morphological stage and surgical results in OSA patients. One hundred and five patients with OSA received palatopharyngeal surgery, i.e. extended uvulopalatal flap (EUPF). Morphological indicators including modified Mallampati grade (MMP), tonsil size, and body mass index were used to stage OSA patients preoperatively. Change of respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was used to monitor change of sleep apnea events. Success rates were compared among patients of different morphological stages. One year after EUPF, the success rates of EUPF in stage I, II, and III patients were 100, 92.9 and 61.4%, respectively. Change of RDI was significantly correlated with MMP and tonsil size.

4644252007	Same-stage palatopharyngeal and hypopharyngeal surgery for severe obstructive sleep apnea	Objectives-To investigate surgical outcomes with two types of combined palatopharyngeal and hypopharyngeal surgery for the treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Material and Methods-Twelve consecutive OSA patients with a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 30/h and Fujita type II anatomy were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to their fiberscopic manifestations. Six patients with obstruction at the uvulopalatal complex and tongue base (Group 1) were selected for extended uvulopalatal flap (EUPF) and midline laser glossectomy (MLG). EUPF and laser lingual tonsillectomy were performed in another six patients shown to have obstruction at the uvulopalatal complex and lingual tonsil (Group 2). Polysomnographic parameters included the RDI and minimal oxygen saturation (MSAT). Surgical success was defined as a postoperative RDI of <20/h and a > 50% reduction in the preoperative RDI. Results-Six months postoperatively, 5 patients (83.3%) had responded successfully in Group 1 and none in Group 2. In Group 1 the mean RDI decreased from 50.7 ± 12.6 to 8 ± 14.3 (95% CI 23.0-62.7; p < 0.01) and MSAT increased from 76.3% ± 11.6% to 88.8% ± 3.2% (95% CI -25.9-0.87;p = 0.06). There was no improvement in sleep parameters in Group 2 patients. No persistent nasal regurgitation, swallowing disturbance or change in taste was noted at 1-year follow-up in either group. Conclusions-EUPF combined with MLG improves OSA in Fujita type II patients. The hypertrophic lingual tonsil, although obscure the laryngeal structure, did not contribute significantly to OSA.

64949106522	Survey of short-term patient satisfaction after surgery for obstructive sleep apnea	Background: To investigate the level of satisfaction of patients who received surgery for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: A patient satisfaction survey (PSS) was administered three months after surgery to 76 patients who received either a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) alone, or in combination with a septomeatoplasty (SMP), or a midline laser glossectomy (MLG). Patient satisfaction determinants were also explored. Results: In general, 93.4% of patients rated their overall satisfaction as "excellent" or "very good". High satisfaction levels (excellent + very good 90%) were observed in the dimensions of "professional skill", "personal manner", and "explanation of condition". By contrast, lower satisfaction levels (excellent + very good < 90%) were observed for "perioperative discomfort". There were no significant differences among the UPPP alone, UPPP + SMP, and UPPP + MLG groups for any dimension of satisfaction (p > 0.05).

67349107076	Intracordal fat assessment by 3-dimensional imaging after autologous fat injection in patients with thyroidectomy-induced unilateral vocal cord paralysis	Background: Complications of thyroidectomy are the most frequent cause of unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) in Taiwan. Autologous fat injection for UVCP is a well-established procedure for temporary symptom relief. The aims of this study were to identify the long-term residual fat volume by 3-dimensional computed tomography (3-D CT) and to investigate the voice outcome. Methods: During this cross-sectional study, 28 consecutive patients who had undergone lipoinjection surgery for symptomatic UVCP resulting from thyroidectomy were enrolled. They received 3-D CT evaluations of the larynx and upper airway after lipoinjection surgery to assess the residual fat volume. Results: The mean duration from lipoinjection surgery to 3-D CT study was 26 months (range, 12-58). The mean residual fat volume remained consistent (0.39 ± 0.35 mL; range, 0.01-1.6). The maximal phonation time, s/z ratio, jitter, and harmonic-to-noise ratio were significantly improved during follow-up. Conclusion: Injected fat can survive chronically and provide clinically important improvement in voice in the patients with throidectomy-induced UVCP. © 2009 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

67651173331	Etiologic features in patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis in Taiwan	Background: To develop an updated screening, treatment and follow-up strategy for acquired unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP), this Taiwan study investigated concurrent etiologies in patients treated in a tertiary medical center. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the voice centers of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkuo Medical Center, Taiwan. Outpatient and inpatient medical records of patients with UVFP treated between January, 2002 and March, 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with laryngeal/hypopharyngeal malignancies, those with incomplete examination and follow-up data and those with congenital UVFP were excluded from the study. Results: One hundred sixty-one patients, including 104 females and 57 males, with ages ranging from 15 to 85 years, met the inclusion criteria. One hundred ten patients (68%) had left side UVFP. The causes were iatrogenic in 48%, subclinical tumor in 12%, neck trauma in 7%, radiation effect in 6% and other causes in 5%. Thyroidectomy was the most common surgical cause of UVFP (n = 51). The most common origins of subclinical tumors were the thyroid (n = 8) and lung (n = 6). In patients younger than 30 years, neck trauma was a major cause of UVFP. Conclusions: A tailored management strategy for UVFP is needed because vocal fold immobilization is an important sign of various underlying diseases. Extended follow-up is crucial in idiopathic UVFP due to the risk of undiagnosed subclinical tumor.

67651184151	Sleep-disordered breathing in children	Children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) can manifest a continuum from simple snoring and upper airway resistance syndrome to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with secondary growth impairment, neurocognitive deficits, and less often cardiovascular sequelae. Most children who present with SDB are four to eight years old with variable clinical symptoms at different ages. In general, infants often present with noisy breathing and disturbed nocturnal sleep, toddlers and preschool-aged children with snoring and mouth breathing, and school-aged children with behavioral and dental problems. The pathogenesis of SDB in children remains incompletely understood. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the leading cause of OSA. Other risk factors include allergic rhinitis, craniofacial anomalies, cleft palate following pharyngeal flap surgery, neuromuscular diseases, laryngomalacia, and obesity. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard diagnostic tool. However, great variation exists in the interpretation of PSG and criteria for the definition of pediatric OSA, even though consensus statements have been used to standardize the scoring of summary indices for the disorders. Adenotonsillectomy is the cardinal treatment for pediatric SDB. Rapid maxillary expansion is a useful approach in upper jaw contraction. Distraction osteogenesis has become an acceptable procedure in the treatment of severe maxillomandibular deficiency. Continuous positive airway pressure has been successful in treating intractable or severe OSA in children with other underlying medical disorders and has modified the indications for tracheotomy in pediatric patients with craniofacial anomalies and OSA. Follow-up in children treated for OSA reveals that underlying structural or neuromuscular abnormalities can decrease the response to treatment and obesity may lead to recurrence of OSA later during adolescence.

76149099873	Can nasal surgery improve obstructive sleep apnea: Subjective or objective?	Background: This study assessed changes in sleep-related symptoms and polysomnographic parameters after nasal surgery for nasal obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) adults in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 66 patients with OSA and chronic nasal obstruction were recruited (surgical, n = 44; control, n = 22). Nasal surgery alone was the treatment in surgical patients. Outcomes were measured in a Snore Outcome Survey (SOS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), rhinomanometry, and polysomnographic parameters at baseline and again after 3 months. Results: Significantly improved nasal resistance as measured by the SOS and ESS were found only in the surgical group (all, p < 0.001). Both groups revealed insignificant changes in polysomnographic parameters. The patients with lower body weight index, less daytime sleepiness, and lower tongue position had a better success rate than the others (50% versus 3%; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Although nasal surgery relieved snoring and daytime sleepiness, it had variable effects on polysomnographic parameters. Copyright © 2009, OceanSide Publications, Inc.

Because little is known about the estimated level of exposure to hMPV in Taiwan, data for 1999 are presented. One thousand one hundred twenty sera from otherwise healthy community-based subjects aged 1 month to 99 years were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the proportion of seropositive individuals was 68.1%. Moreover, 53.2% of preschool children were seronegative, whereas 88.3% of school-aged individuals and 93.7% of adults had antibodies to hMPV. In summary, the present study provides an earlier evidence of a high rate of exposure to hMPV characterized the seroprevalence among Taiwanese individuals in 1999. In addition, our findings suggest that preschool children in particular would benefit from vaccination against hMPV. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77951732742	Evaluation of velopharyngeal function after relocation pharyngoplasty for obstructive sleep apnea	Objectives/Hypothesis: To assess if relocation pharyngoplasty (RP) causes velopharyngeal dysfunction in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by evaluating perioperative nasalance, nasality, voice, and articulation. Study Design: Prospective, comparative study. Methods: Twenty-four OSA patients selected for RP (two women and 22 men; mean age, 35 years) were enrolled for the study of velopharyngeal function in speech. The RP procedure involved removal of supratonsillar adipose tissue, preservation of all palatal muscular structure, splinting the lateral pharyngeal wall, and anterior advancing of the soft palate. Measurements of nasalance (vowel /a/, /i/, consonant / m/, oronasal, oral, and nasal texts), nasality (mirrorfogging test, degree of nasality, Gutzmann test and Bzoch hypernasality test), voice (acoustic analysis), and articulation (velar sound) were taken before RP and 3 months after the procedure and compared. Results: Comparative analysis of clinical measures showed that no significant differences were found following RP in nasalance (except for the vowel /a/), nasality, articulation, and voice. The only difference with regard to vowel /a/ showed, instead of an increase, a significant decrease of nasalance from 17.3 ± 10.8 to 11.3 ± 6.7 (P = .004), which may be attributed to the advancing and lifting of the soft palate in RP, leading to relaxation of the levator veli palatine and uvular muscles, which facilitates their contraction in velopharyngeal closure during particular vowel phonation. Conclusions: RP for OSA does not cause velopharyngeal insufficiency in terms of voice, nasality, and articulation in spite of anterior advancement of the soft palate, but does induce a nondetrimental change in nasalance. © 2010 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

78650666512	Long-term language levels and reading skills in mandarin-speaking prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants	The aim of this study was to document receptive and expressive language levels and reading skills achieved by Mandarin-speaking children who had received cochlear implants (CIs) and used them for 4.75-7.42 years. The effects of possible associated factors were also analyzed. Standardized Mandarin language and reading tests were administered to 39 prelingually deaf children with Nucleus 24 devices. The Mandarin Chinese version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was used to assess their receptive vocabulary knowledge and the Revised Primary School Language Assessment Test for their receptive and expressive language skills. The Graded Chinese Character Recognition Test was used to test their written word recognition ability and the Reading Comprehension Test for their reading comprehension ability. Raw scores from both language and reading measurements were compared to normative data of nor- mal-hearing children to obtain standard scores. The results showed that the mean standard score for receptive vocabulary measurement and the mean T scores for the receptive language, expressive language and total language measurement were all in the low-average range in comparison to the normative sample. In contrast, the mean T scores for word and text reading comprehension were almost the same as for their age-matched hearing counterparts. Among all children with CIs, 75.7% scored within or above the normal range of their age-matched hearing peers on receptive vocabulary measurement. For total language, Chinese word recognition and reading scores, 71.8, 77 and 82% of children with CIs were age appropriate, respectively. A strong correlation was found between language and reading skills. Age at implantation and sentence perception scores account for 37% of variance for total language outcome. Sentence perception scores and preimplantation residual hearing were revealed to be associated with the outcome of reading comprehension. We concluded that by using standard tests, the language development and reading skill of Mandarin-speaking children who use CIs from a young age appear to fall within the normal range of their hearing age mates, at least after 4.8-7.4 years of experience. However, to fully evaluate the fine linguistic skills of these subjects, a more detailed study and longer follow-up period are needed. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

79551525412	Critical appraisal and meta-analysis of nasal surgery for obstructive sleep apnea	Background: Nasal surgery is commonly involved in surgical treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of nasal surgery for OSA using evidence-based methodology. Methods: The MedLine database (1999-2009) was searched for original articles published in peer-reviewed journals concerning nasal surgery for snoring/sleep apnea. Data extracted from these articles were reviewed and analyzed using meta-analysis technology. Results: Thirteen articles were critically appraised. Two studies provided control groups and 11 articles (84.6%) consisted of prospective noncontrolled clinical trials (level II in evidence strength). The weighted mean apnea/hypopnea index measured by polysomnography in nine studies decreased from 35.2 ± 22.6 to 33.5 ± 23.8 event/hour after nasal surgery (overall, p = 0.69). The pooled success rate of nasal surgery in treating OSA was 16.7%. Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores in eight studies decreased from 10.6 ± 3.9 to 7.1 ± 3.7 (overall, p <0.001). Nasal surgery for snoring assessed by individual questionnaires and visual analog scale reported significant improvement (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The critical literature appraisal and meta-analyses show that nasal surgery can effectively reduce daytime sleepiness and snoring. However, the efficacy of nasal surgery in treating OSA is limited. Copyright © 2011, OceanSide Publications, Inc.

0036739829	Solitary plasmacytosis of the larynx in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma	Solitary plasmacytosis of the larynx is a clinically unusual event. It may cause hoarseness or airway obstruction and usually needs surgical excision. Plasmacytosis is distinguished from extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) in that the latter primarily involves the head and neck and needs more intensive therapy such as radiotherapy. Many reports have described the histopathology and immunohistochemistry of EMP of the larynx; however, no literature in English has described solitary plasmacytosis of the larynx. We report a 44-year-old female patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and systemic lupus erythromatosus with Sjögren's syndrome. She complained of 1-year period of hoarseness that became exacerbated in the most recent 3 weeks. A wide-base and smooth-surface mass at the left supraglottic area was noted by direct laryngoscope. Computed tomography scan revealed a well-defined radiopaque mass. The histopathology of a specimen excised by carbon dioxide laser-assisted laryngomicrosurgery was interpreted initially as plasmacytoma. Immunohistochemical staining for kappa and lambda light chains demonstrated polyclonal plasma cells, and the definitive diagnosis was plasmacytosis. After 6 months follow-up, the subjective quality of her voice improved. Laryngoscopic examination revealed no evidence of recurrence. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

84862807319	Role of flexible transnasal esophagoscopy and patient education in the management of globus pharyngeus	Background/Purpose: Globus pharyngeus and dysphagia are common complaints of patients referred to ear, nose, and throat (ENT) clinics. We aimed to establish an efficient method to rule out the presence of malignancy in patients with globus pharyngeus and dysphagia. Methods: The use of flexible transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) was evaluated in 30 patients with globus pharyngeus and 6 patients with dysphagia. The patients were immediately informed of the findings on TNE examination, and then treatments were planned. All patients were treated with lansoprazole for 2 weeks and provided education on lifestyle changes at the initial examination and at the 3-month follow-up. Results: The patients reported an improvement in symptoms of globus pharyngeus after treatment (p< 0.001). Follow-up TNE confirmed improvement with less dysphagia, erythema, and vocal cord edema evident (all p< 0.001). Conclusion: The use of TNE and patient education are efficient management strategies for patients with symptoms of globus pharyngeus and dysphagia. © 2012, Elsevier Taiwan LLC & Formosan Medical Association.

84863731680	Human papillomavirus-16 infection in advanced oral cavity cancer patients is related to an increased risk of distant metastases and poor survival	Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an oncogenic virus causing oropharyngeal cancers and resulting in a favorable outcome after the treatment. The role of HPV in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains ambiguous. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of HPV infection on disease control among patients with OSCC following radical surgery with radiation-based adjuvant therapy. Patients and Method: We prospectively followed 173 patients with advanced OSCC (96% were stage III/IV) who had undergone radical surgery and adjuvant therapy between 2004 and 2006. They were followed between surgery and death or up to 60 months. Surgical specimens were examined using a PCR-based HPV blot test. The primary endpoints were the risk of relapse and the time to relapse; the secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival. Results: The prevalence of HPV-positive OSCC was 22%; HPV-16 (9%) and HPV-18 (7%) were the genotypes most commonly encountered. Solitary HPV-16 infection was a poor predictor of 5-year distant metastases (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-8.0; P = 0.005), disease-free survival (P = 0.037), disease-specific survival (P = 0.006), and overall survival (P = 0.010), whereas HPV-18 infection had no impact on 5-year outcomes. The rate of 5-year distant metastases was significantly higher in the HPV-16 or level IV/V metastasis group compared with both the extracapsular spread or tumor depth ≥11-mm group and patients without risk factors (P<0.001). Conclusions: HPV infections in advanced OSCC patients are not uncommon and clinically relevant. Compared with HPV-16-negative advanced OSCC patients, those with a single HPV-16 infection are at higher risk of distant metastases and poor survival despite undergoing radiation-based adjuvant therapy and require a more aggressive adjuvant treatment and a more thorough follow-up. © 2012 Lee et al.

0036812637	Endoscopic sinus surgery for solitary abducens palsy in patients with isolated sphenoid sinus disease: Report of four cases	Solitary abducens palsy secondary to isolated sphenoid sinus disease (ISSD) is rare and early management is important. There is no report regarding the results of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for prolonged abducens palsy due to ISSD. We present four cases of ISSD with solitary abducens palsy that received ESS from 1995 through 2000. The interval between onset of diplopia and ESS was longer than 96 hours (range, 4 days to 42 months). The sphenoid lesions were caused by Aspergillosis in two patients and inflammation in two. Three patients recovered completely from abducens palsy after 4-17 months and had no surgical complications. In conclusion, ESS is a safe and effective treatment for ISSD with abducens palsy. Recovery from abducens palsy is slow and progressive. Improvement of extraocular movement is an early sign of recovery.

0036854405	Laryngomalacia causing sleep apnea in an osteogenesis imperfecta patient	Obstructive sleep apnea is rarely caused by laryngomalacia in adult patients. To our knowledge, laryngomalacia secondary to osteogenesis imperfecta inducing obstructive sleep apnea has not been reported. We present an adult osteogenesis imperfecta patient with obstructive sleep apnea. Oral examination demonstrated an extremely long epiglottis in the oral cavity. Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy revealed that the epiglottis and redundant mucosa of the arytenoids were drawn into the laryngeal inlet during inspiration. Supraglottoplasty with intraoral and laryngoscopic approach was carried out and resulted in marked decreases in snoring, sleep apnea, and daytime sleepiness. In this report, we describe a unique laryngeal manifestation inducing obstructive sleep apnea in an adult with brittle bone disease. The anomaly of laryngeal structure can be corrected by surgical intervention with good response in the sleep-disordered breathing. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

84871759819	Energy Types of Snoring Sounds in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome: A Preliminary Observation	Background: Annoying snore is the principle symptom and problem in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). However, investigation has been hampered by the complex snoring sound analyses. Objective: This study was aimed to investigate the energy types of the full-night snoring sounds in patients with OSAS. Patients and Method: Twenty male OSAS patients underwent snoring sound recording throughout 6 hours of in-lab overnight polysomnogragphy. Snoring sounds were processed and analyzed by a new sound analytic program, named as Snore Map®. We transformed the 6-hour snoring sound power spectra into the energy spectrum and classified it as snore map type 1 (monosyllabic low-frequency snore), type 2 (duplex low-&mid-frequency snore), type 3 (duplex low- & high-frequency snore), and type 4 (triplex low-, mid-, & high-frequency snore). The interrator and test-retest reliabilities of snore map typing were assessed. The snore map types and their associations among demographic data, subjective snoring questionnaires, and polysomnographic parameters were explored. Results: The interrator reliability of snore map typing were almost perfect (κ = 0.87) and the test-retest reliability was high (r = 0.71). The snore map type was proportional to the body mass index (r = 0.63, P = 0.003) and neck circumference (r = 0.52, P = 0.018). Snore map types were unrelated to subjective snoring questionnaire scores (All P>0.05). After adjustment for body mass index and neck circumference, snore map type 3-4 was significantly associated with severity of OSAS (r = 0.52, P = 0.026). Conclusions: Snore map typing of a full-night energy spectrum is feasible and reliable. The presence of a higher snore map type is a warning sign of severe OSAS and indicated priority OSAS management. Future studies are warranted to evaluate whether snore map type can be used to discriminate OSAS from primary snoring and whether it is affected by OSAS management. © 2012 Lee et al.

84872279899	NBI flexible laryngoscopy targeted tissue sampling in head and neck cancer patients with difficult airways	Direct suspension laryngoscopic biopsy of neoplasms in larynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx was an arduous procedure in patients with a history of head and neck cancer and difficult airways. This preliminary study was aimed to report the efficacy and safety of a narrow band imaging-guided biopsy of this category by flexible laryngoscopy. This is a retrospective chart review study conducted in setting of tertiary referral centre. Nineteen consecutive head and neck cancer patients with difficulty in general anesthesia and rigid endoscopic approach due to trismus, craniofacial deformities, and/or limited neck extension after cancer therapy were referred for endoscopic biopsy of their suspicious lesions in larynx, hypopharynx, or parts of oropharynx. Following topical anesthesia, a flexible laryngoscope was introduced through the nose into the pharynx. Under narrow band imaging magnified view, the specified tumor foci were biopsied in an office-based setting. All of the lesions were reached and biopsied to obtain sufficient tissue samples. The procedure took <20 min in every case. Twelve of the 19 pathologic examinations disclosed the malignancies at the first biopsy, and another underwent a second biopsy to prove cancer recurrence. The other six patients with benign lesions received further follow-up for at least 6 months and showed no recurrence. There were no complications associated with the technique. This study introduced that flexible laryngoscopy with narrow band imaging has the advantages of nimbleness, precision, and minimal morbidity. This combined technique may be a safe and promising method for tissue sampling of suspicious recurrence in head and neck cancer patients with difficult airways. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84873522475	Treatment of vallecular cysts in infants with and without coexisting laryngomalacia using endoscopic laser marsupialization: Fifteen-year experience at a single-center	Objective: To share our experience in treating a large cohort of infants with congenital vallecular cysts using endoscopic laser marsupialization. We describe the clinical characteristics of infants with pediatric vallecular cysts and compare these characteristics between infants with and without concurrent laryngomalacia and those who did or did not require preoperative airway support. Methods: Medical records of infants treated for vallecular cyst at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between March 1994 and July 2008 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded and compared. Results: Twenty-eight infants were included in our study: 11 (39.3%) males and 17 (60.7%) females. The incidence of vallecular cyst was 5.3 cases/100,000 live births. Median ages at symptom onset and diagnosis were 3.0 and 40.0 days, respectively. Mean symptom onset to diagnosis interval was 42.4 days. Eighteen (64.3%) infants had coexisting laryngomalacia and 11 (39.3%) required ventilatory support. The number of symptoms decreased in all patients after surgery (median no. symptoms before. =4.5, after. =0.5) and most symptoms were completely resolved within 3 months of surgery. Compared with infants who did not have laryngomalacia, infants with laryngomalacia: were younger at symptom onset (2 vs 10 days); had more symptoms before (5.0 vs 3.5) and after treatment (1.0 vs 0.0); had a longer length of hospital (14.6 vs 9.4 days) stay; and more commonly required airway intervention compared with infants without laryngomalacia (55.6% vs 10.0%: all P<. 0.05). Compared with infants who did not require ventilatory support, those that did: had a shorter interval between symptom onset and diagnosis (31.8 vs 49.3 days); were younger at the age of diagnosis (38.0 vs 49.0 days); had more symptoms before surgery (5.0 vs 4.0); had a higher prevalence of laryngomalacia (90.9% vs 47.1%); had a longer length of hospital (16.4 vs 10.4 days) stay (all P<. 0.05). Conclusions: Our study included a large number of infants with vallecular cyst who were treated with endoscopic laser marsupialization. Of note, we found that a large proportion of infants had coexisting laryngomalacia, which appears to complicate the clinical presentation and management of vallecular cyst. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84879266051	Increasing rates of low-risk human papillomavirus infections in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma: Association with clinical outcomes	Background: Although human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have been causally linked to oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the potential role of low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) types in the pathogenesis of this malignancy remains unclear. Objectives: We sought to investigate the distribution of HPV genotypes and their prognostic significance in OSCC patients treated by radical surgery, either with or without adjuvant therapy. Study design: We studied two non-overlapping OSCC cohorts for the periods 2005-2006 (2005 cohort, n= 204) and 2010-2011 (2010 cohort, n= 206). Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected, and the HPV genotype was determined using PCR plus HPV blot tests. The primary study endpoint was the prevalence of HPV genotypes. The secondary endpoints were the 2-year therapeutic outcomes. Results: The overall prevalence of HPV infections did not differ significantly in the two study cohorts. However, the prevalence of LR-HPV was significantly higher in the 2010 cohort than in the 2005 cohort ( p= 0.002). The overall prevalence of HPV infections was not significantly associated with the 2-year outcomes. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that LR-HPV infection was a predictor of poor 2-year disease-free survival ( p= 0.036, hazard ratio [HR]. = 3.1), disease-specific survival ( p= 0.014, HR. = 3.8), and overall survival ( p= 0.016, HR. = 3.2) in the subgroups of OSCC patients with poor differentiation, pN2 lymph node metastases, or extracapsular spread ( n= 150). Conclusions: LR-HPV infections may have an important role in determining the clinical outcomes of certain OSCC patients bearing specific risk factors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..

84879268213	Environmental Sounds Recognition in Children with Cochlear Implants	The aims of this study were (1) to document the recognition performance of environmental sounds (ESs) in Mandarin-speaking children with cochlear implants (CIs) and to analyze the possible associated factors with the ESs recognition; (2) to examine the relationship between perception of ESs and receptive vocabulary level; and (3) to explore the acoustic factors relevant to perceptual outcomes of daily ESs in pediatric CI users. Forty-seven prelingually deafened children between ages 4 to 10 years participated in this study. They were divided into pre-school (group A: age 4-6) and school-age (group B: age 7 to 10) groups. Sound Effects Recognition Test (SERT) and the Chinese version of the revised Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-R) were used to assess the auditory perception ability. The average correct percentage of SERT was 61.2% in the preschool group and 72.3% in the older group. There was no significant difference between the two groups. The ESs recognition performance of children with CIs was poorer than that of their hearing peers (90% in average). No correlation existed between ESs recognition and receptive vocabulary comprehension. Two predictive factors: pre-implantation residual hearing and duration of CI usage were found to be associated with recognition performance of daily-encountered ESs. Acoustically, sounds with distinct temporal patterning were easier to identify for children with CIs. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ESs recognition is not easy for children with CIs and a low correlation existed between linguistic sounds and ESs recognition in these subjects. Recognition ability of ESs in children with CIs can only be achieved by natural exposure to daily-encountered auditory stimuli if sounds other than speech stimuli were less emphasized in routine verbal/oral habilitation program. Therefore, task-specific measures other than speech materials can be helpful to capture the full profile of auditory perceptual progress after implantation. © 2013 Liu et al.

84884366232	Positional dependency and surgical success of relocation pharyngoplasty among patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea	Objective. To examine the effect of positional dependency on surgical success among patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) following modified uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, known as relocation pharyngoplasty. Study Design. Case series with planned data collection. Setting. Tertiary referred center. Subjects and Methods. Standard nocturnal polysomnography was used to compare the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in different sleep positions before and after relocation pharyngoplasty in 47 consecutive patients with severe OSA (AHI, 59.5 ± 18.2 events/hour; Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] scores, 12.2 ± 4.4) who failed continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Positional (dependency) OSA was defined when the supine:non-supine AHI ratio was >2, otherwise it was defined as nonpositional OSA. Surgical success was defined as a ≥50% reduction in AHI and a postoperative AHI of ≤20 events/hour. Polysomnographic parameters, ESS, and surgical success following surgery were recorded. Results. Of the 47 patients, 27 (57%) had positional OSA and 20 (43%) nonpositional OSA. The nonpositional OSA patients had higher AHI and ESS scores than the positional OSA patients (P = .002 and .104, respectively). Relocation pharyngoplasty significantly improved AHI and ESS scores in both positional and nonpositional OSA groups 6 months postoperatively (P <.05). The overall surgical success rate was 49%; however, positional OSA patients had a significantly higher success rate than nonpositional OSA patients (67% vs 25%, P = .008). Conclusion. The presence of positional dependency at baseline was a favorable outcome predictor of surgical success among severe OSA patients undergoing relocation pharyngoplasty. © 2013 American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

0346328188	Efficacy of radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction of the soft palate in the treatment of snoring	Traditional surgery for snoring often leads to intolerable postoperative pain. A new surgical treatment, radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (RVTR) of the soft palate, was carried out and its effect and safety in the management of snoring were evaluated. Thirty-two patients received a single treatment of RVTR with a mean follow-up period of 4.5 months. All patients were assessed by a questionnaire using the Snore Outcomes Survey (SOS) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Postoperative pain, speech and swallowing disturbances were also evaluated. The postoperative scores of SOS and ESS all significantly improved (p<0.05). Postoperative pain, speech and swallowing disturbances were all mild 1-3 days after treatment. With the success of treatment defined as a postoperative snoring index (SI) of <3 or a reduction of the SI by >5 points by the visual analogue scale, the success rate was 81.3% in patients with a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of <20, and 50% in those with an RDI of >20. We conclude that RVTR of the soft palate is an effective treatment for snoring, resulting in only mild postoperative discomfort. A patient whose RDI was <20 had a higher success rate with a single RVTR treatment.

84891785937	Treatment outcomes of adenotonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea: A prospective longitudinal study	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy (AT) in the treatment of children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a 3-y prospective, longitudinal study with analysis of risk factors of recurrence of OSA. Study Design: An investigation of children (6 to 12 y old) with OSA documented at entry and followed posttreatment at 6, 12, 24, and 36 mo with examination, questionnaires, and polysomnography. Multivariate generalized linear modeling and hierarchical linear models analysis were used to determine contributors to suboptimal long-term resolution of OSA, and Generalized Linear Models were used for analysis of risk factors of recurrence. Results: Of the 135 children, 88 terminated the study at 36 months post-AT. These 88 children (boys = 72, mean age = 8.9 ± 2.7 yersus boys 8.9 ± 2.04 y, girls: 8.8 ± 2.07 y; body mass index [BMI] = 19.5 ± 4.6 kg/m2) had a preoperative mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI0) of 13.54 ± 7.23 and a mean postoperative AHI at 6 mo (AHI6) of 3.47 ± 8.41 events/h (with AHI6 > 1 = 53.4% of 88 children). A progressive increase in AHI was noted with a mean AHI36 = 6.48 ± 5.57 events/h and AHI36 > 1 = 68% of the studied group. Change in AHI was associated with changes in the OSA-18 questionnaire. The residual pediatric OSA after AT was significantly associated with BMI, AHI, enuresis, and allergic rhinitis before surgery. From 6 to 36 mo after AT, recurrence of pediatric OSA was significantly associated with enuresis, age (for the 24- to 36-mo period), postsurgery AHI6 (severity), and the rate of change in BMI and body weight. Conclusions: Adenotonsillectomy leads to significant improvement in apnea-hypopnea index, though generally with incomplete resolution, but a worsening over time was observed in 68% of our cases.

84896726233	Timing of surgical intervention with cochlear implant in patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome	Objectives: (1) To report the speech perception and intelligibility results of Mandarin-speaking patients with large vestibular aqueduct syndrome (LVAS) after cochlear implantation (CI); (2) to compare their performance with a group of CI users without LVAS; (3) to understand the effects of age at implantation and duration of implant use on the CI outcomes. The obtained data may be used to guide decisions about CI candidacy and surgical timing. Methods: Forty-two patients with LVAS participating in this study were divided into two groups: the early group received CI before 5 years of age and the late group after 5. Open-set speech perception tests (on Mandarin tones, words and sentences) were administered one year after implantation and at the most recent follow-up visit. Categories of auditory perception (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) scale scores were also obtained. Results: The patients with LVAS with more than 5 years of implant use (18 cases) achieved a mean score higher than 80% on the most recent speech perception tests and reached the highest level on the CAP/SIR scales. The early group developed speech perception and intelligibility steadily over time, while the late group had a rapid improvement during the first year after implantation. The two groups, regardless of their age at implantation, reached a similar performance level at the most recent follow-up visit. Conclusion: High levels of speech performance are reached after 5 years of implant use in patients with LVAS. These patients do not necessarily need to wait until their hearing thresholds are higher than 90 dB HL or PB word score lower than 40% to receive CI. They can do it "earlier" when their speech perception and/or speech intelligibility do not reach the performance level suggested in this study. © 2013 Ko et al.

Participants: Thirty-five pre-lingually deaf children (age = 10.3 ± 1.6 years; 17 boys and 18 girls) who had used cochlear implants for >2 years and 35 age- and gender-matched controls with normal hearing. Main outcome measures: Through sustained phonation of /a/ and reading of the Hare and Tortoise passage, the subjects' voice quality was analysed with aerodynamics and acoustics. A six-point scale was used for auditory-perceptual evaluation. A Pediatric Voice-Related Quality of Life Survey was filled out by the caregivers. Results: The implanted subjects had significantly lower mean airflow rate (P = 0.006), higher phonation threshold pressure (P < 0.001), higher fundamental frequency variations (P < 0.001) and peak-amplitude variations (P < 0.001), wider fundamental frequency range (P = 0.043), wider speaking intensity range (P = 0.015) and greater perceptual severity level of monotone (P < 0.001), resonance (P < 0.001), loudness (P < 0.001) and strain (P = 0.006) than their normal-hearing peers. Duration of postoperative rehabilitation was an independent predictor of unfavourable mean speaking fundamental frequency (odds ratio = 8.56, P = 0.008). Conclusion: Inadequate postoperative rehabilitation may hinder the normalisation of Mandarin-speaking implantees' voice quality. A multidimensional analysis may precisely evaluate the voice of paediatric implantees; however, the generalisability of these findings requires different forms of validation, including data from other languages and other institutions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84901235472	Comparative effects of snoring sound between two minimally invasive surgeries in the treatment of snoring: A randomized controlled trial	Background: Minimally invasive surgeries of the soft palate have emerged as a less-invasive treatment for habitual snoring. To date, there is only limited information available comparing the effects of snoring sound between different minimally invasive surgeries in the treatment of habitual snoring. Objective: To compare the efficacy of palatal implant and radiofrequency surgery, in the reduction of snoring through subjective evaluation of snoring and objective snoring sound analysis. Patients and Method: Thirty patients with habitual snoring due to palatal obstruction (apnea-hypopnea index ≤15, body max index ≤30) were prospectively enrolled and randomized to undergo a single session of palatal implant or temperature-controlled radiofrequency surgery of the soft palate under local anesthesia. Snoring was primarily evaluated by the patient with a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up visit and the change in VAS was the primary outcome. Moreover, life qualities, measured by snore outcomes survey, and full-night snoring sounds, analyzed by a sound analytic program (Snore Map), were also investigated at the same time. Results: Twenty-eight patients completed the study; 14 received palatal implant surgery and 14 underwent radiofrequency surgery. The VAS and snore outcomes survey scores were significantly improved in both groups. However, the good response (postoperative VAS ≤3 or postoperative VAS ≤5 plus snore outcomes survey score ≥60) rate of the palatal implant group was significantly higher than that of the radiofrequency group (79% vs. 29%, P = 0.021). The maximal loudness of low-frequency (40-300 Hz) snores was reduced significantly in the palatal implant group. In addition, the snoring index was significantly reduced in the radiofrequency group. Conclusions: Both palatal implants and a single-stage radiofrequency surgery improve subjective snoring outcomes, but palatal implants have a greater effect on most measures of subjective and objective snoring. Multi-stage radiofrequency surgery was not tested. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01955083 © 2014 Lee et al.

84905587410	Impact of deferred surgical intervention on the outcome of external laryngeal trauma	Background External laryngeal trauma (ELT) can be a fatal injury. Proper management of ELT significantly affects patient survival and quality of life. The optimal timing of surgical intervention is controversial. In this study, we review the incidence, management, and outcome of ELT and attempt to analyze the risk factors and prognosis of this injury. Methods We conducted retrospective review using prospective data collection from patients with ELT in a level I trauma center from May 2008 to May 2013. We retrieved data regarding the severity of ELT, Injury Severity Score (ISS), New Injury Severity Score (NISS), Reverse Trauma Score (RTS), surgical timing, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), hospital length of stay (HLOS), long-term outcome, and mortality. We analyzed the risk of prolonged hospitalization, adverse outcome, and mortality. Results The 48 patients in this cohort had a mean age of 40.8 ± 19.6 years. Twenty-four patients underwent operation within 48 hours, 10 patients underwent operation after 48 hours, and the other 14 patients did not require surgical intervention. A high NISS and the necessity for operation prolonged the ICU LOS and the HLOS. A high ISS and a low RTS predicted mortality. Initial phonatory impairment and the necessity of surgical intervention increased adverse outcomes. Conclusions In conclusion, ELT leads to high mortality and morbidity. The mortality in our series was related to severe associated injuries and to initial physical decompensation. Proper resuscitation and aggressively physiologic compensation were more important in the initial phase. Deferred treatment was acceptable until the patients were ready for operation. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Published by Elsevier Inc.

84907279932	Audiovisual speech perception at various presentation levels in Mandarin-speaking adults with cochlear implants	Objectives: (1) To evaluate the recognition of words, phonemes and lexical tones in audiovisual (AV) and auditory-only (AO) modes in Mandarin-speaking adults with cochlear implants (CIs); (2) to understand the effect of presentation levels on AV speech perception; (3) to learn the effect of hearing experience on AV speech perception. Methods: Thirteen deaf adults (age = 29.1±13.5 years; 8 male, 5 female) who had used CIs for >6 months and 10 normal-hearing (NH) adults participated in this study. Seven of them were prelingually deaf, and 6 postlingually deaf. The Mandarin Monosyllablic Word Recognition Test was used to assess recognition of words, phonemes and lexical tones in AV and AO conditions at 3 presentation levels: speech detection threshold (SDT), speech recognition threshold (SRT) and 10 dB SL (re:SRT). Results: The prelingual group had better phoneme recognition in the AV mode than in the AO mode at SDT and SRT (both p = 0.016), and so did the NH group at SDT (p = 0.004). Mode difference was not noted in the postlingual group. None of the groups had significantly different tone recognition in the 2 modes. The prelingual and postlingual groups had significantly better phoneme and tone recognition than the NH one at SDT in the AO mode (p = 0.016 and p = 0.002 for phonemes; p = 0.001 and p<0.001 for tones) but were outperformed by the NH group at 10 dB SL (re:SRT) in both modes (both p<0.001 for phonemes; p<0.001 and p = 0.002 for tones). The recognition scores had a significant correlation with group with age and sex controlled (p<0.001). Conclusions: Visual input may help prelingually deaf implantees to recognize phonemes but may not augment Mandarin tone recognition. The effect of presentation level seems minimal on CI users' AV perception. This indicates special considerations in developing audiological assessment protocols and rehabilitation strategies for implantees who speak tonal languages.

0942276155	Endoscopic Surgery for Recurrent Inverted Papilloma	Objectives/Hypothesis: Inverted papilloma of the nose and paranasal sinuses is noted for its high rate of recurrence. The feasibility of endoscopic treatment for inverted papilloma has been shown in the literature; however, reports discussing the efficacy of endoscopic surgery for recurrent diseases are rare. The study determined the effectiveness of endoscopic surgery for recurrent inverted papilloma and described when endoscopic medial maxillectomy was indicated. Study Design: Retrospective. Methods: Seventeen patients with recurrent inverted papilloma were treated over a 10-year period. Krouse's staging system was used for tumor grading. Because of the extent of the tumor in the majority (70.6%) of the patients, en bloc resection could not be regularly achieved; therefore, sequential segmental endoscopic surgery was the chosen treatment. Some diseases that extensively involved the maxillary sinus were treated by the combination of endoscopic medial maxillectomy (EMM) and sequential segmental surgery (SSES) to extirpate the whole disease. Results: Efficacy was evaluated strictly by radiographic study. Successful treatment was accomplished in 14 (82.4%) patients. Three (17.6%) patients had residual disease; each required one revision surgery. None of the patients had recurrence at the time of writing. There were no major complications or associated malignancies encountered in the patients. Conclusion: Endoscopic surgery is an effective treatment for recurrent inverted papilloma. Precise determination of the sites of tumor origin and attachment during the operation is the key to the successful treatment. Recurrent inverted papilloma tends to behave more aggressively and has a higher postoperative recurrence rate than the primary lesion. Stage III disease had a higher recurrence rate (27.3%) than that of other stages (0%).

13644264133	Paranasal sinus involvement in acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hemopoietic malignancy of the bone marrow that rarely invades the sinonasal area. If infiltration of paranasal sinuses occurs, it may lead to rhinosinusitis and orbital complications that need aggressive treatment. In this report, a 26-year-old male patient who had a history of ALL and had one relapse, suffered from rapid progression of right periorbital pain and exophthalmos, which usually presented in patients with orbital complications of sinusitis. A sinus computed tomography showed right maxillary and ethmoid sinus opacification with orbital bone destruction. Urgent endoscopie sinus surgery (ESS) was performed for orbital decompression and histopathologic diagnosis. Pathology revealed lymphoblast infiltration and inflammation of respiratory mucosa. Subsequent bone marrow aspiration cytology confirmed the diagnosis of a second relapse of ALL. Obstructive causes of sinusitis should be evaluated in patients with ALL. ESS has proven to be effective in obtaining tissue for histopathologic diagnosis, and in treating patients with sinusitis with orbital complications.

84924051922	Human papillomavirus 16/18 E7 viral loads predict distant metastasis in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma	Background: Human papillomaviruses (HPV) seem to be related to distant metastasis (DM) in advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether high-risk HPV viral load may predict DM among OSCC patients and stratify patients for risk-adapted treatment. Study design: Viral loads of E7 oncogenes for HPV 16/18 were measured by quantitative PCR tests in paraffin-embedded lesional specimens from 312 OSCC of which the HPV genotypes had been determined previously. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify the independent prognostic factors for 5-year DM and C statistics were further computed. Results: By multivariable analysis, high HPV 16 E7 viral load (≥15.0 copies/genome); high HPV 18 E7 viral load (≥15.0 copies/genome); pathological N2 status (pN2); tumor depth ≥11. mm; extracapsular spread (ECS); and level IV/V metastases were independent risk factors for DM. We further identified three prognostic groups. In the high-risk group (level IV/V metastases or high HPV 16/18 E7 viral load plus pN2, tumor depth ≥11. mm, or ECS), the 5-year distant metastasis rate was 74%. In the intermediate-risk group (high HPV 16/18 E7 viral load, pN2, tumor depth ≥11. mm, or ECS), the 5-year DM rate was 17%. Finally, the 5-year DM rate was 1% in the low-risk group (no risk factors). The value of the C statistics was 0.78. Conclusions: Among OSCC patients, high HPV 16/18 E7 viral load identifies a small subgroup of patients at high-risk of 5-year DM and suggest the need for more intensive treatments and follow-up strategies.
