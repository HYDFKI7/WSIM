84942163395	The potential values of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 in disease diagnosis and risk assessment	BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), as the main binding protein of IGF1, is involved in the regulation of IGF1. OBJECTIVE: To attempt to analyze the relation of IGFBP-3 and various diseases, and to explore the potential values of IGFBP-3 in disease diagnosis and risk assessment. METHODS: Databases of PubMed, Science Direct and Wanfang database were retrieved with key words of “insulin-like growth factors 1; IGFBP-3; cancer; growth hormone deficiency; diabetes; osteoporosis” in English and Chinese, respectively, by screening titles and abstracts to search papers related to IGFBP-3 structure and function as well as relationship of IGFBP-3 with cancer, growth hormone deficiency, diabetes, osteoporosis. Finally, 43 articles were summarized according to inclusion criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In recent years, the relationship between gene of IGFBP-3 and risk of cancer is becoming a hot research topic. The results show that IGFBP-3 is a protective agent of cancer risk, and it is an important factor in evaluating the risk of cancer, exhibiting a potential application value. IGFBP-3 is also associated with growth hormone deficiency and diabetes. In addition, IGFBP-3 can assist IGF-1 to play the regulatory role in bone growth and differentiation, which is closely linked with osteoporosis. Therefore, IGFBP-3 can be a potential predictor for osteoporosis.

20444372350	Functional analysis of helicase gene promoter and homologous region 3 enhancer in Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus	The promoter of the helicase gene, including 510 bp upstream of ATG, was cloned and sequenced, and was found that it had both early and late RNA initiation sites. The initiation codon ATG was deleted by using point mutation. Luciferase gene, as a reporter gene, was fused with the promoter region to construct the plsmid pBmhel510luc. When pBmhel510luc was transfected into Bm-5 and Sf-21 cell lines, the helicase gene promoter was recognized by cellular RNA polymerase and transactivated by viral factors. Baculovirus homologous regions (hrs) act as viral DNA replication start sites, which also have been shown to alter the rate of transcription for cis-linked promoters. BmNPV hr3 was cloned into a downstream site of luc gene, to study the effect of this enhancer on hel510 promoter activity. The transient expression in transfected insect cell lines and silkworm larvae indicated that hr3 could enhance the transcriptional level of hel510 promoter by about 7 000 and 1 000 fold, respectively.

20444417483	Expression of the arrowhead proteinase inhibitor B (API) gene in the silkworm larvae and pupae	The arrowhead proteinase inhibitor B(API) gene was cloned into baculovirus transfer vectors of pBacPAK8 and pOSX, and two recombinant transfer vectors, pBacPAK (API) and pOSX(API), were constructed. Coinfection was accomplished with either one of the recombinant transfer vectors and Bm-BacPAK6 DNA in BmN cells. Then recombinant virus of CrBK9, CrBK10 and BX was selected. API gene was successfully expressed in silkworm larvae and pupae. The recombinant API(rAPI) showed strong inhibitive activity on bovine pancreas trypsin. The inhibiting activity of the expression product was 1.0 × 10

22444433333	Homologous region 3 from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus enhancing the transcriptional activity of heat shock cognate 70-4 promoter from Bombyx mori and Bombyx mandarina in Vitro and in Vivo	The heat shock cognate 70-4 protein gene promoter (HSC70-4p) from Bombyx mori (BmHSC70-4p) is an ideal candidate for the transgenic silkworm due to its high transcriptional activity, and the homologous region 3 from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPVhr3) functions as an enhancer for several promoters. Using luciferase as a reporter gene and transient expression system in vivo and in vitro, we found that BmNPVhr3 can significantly increase the transcriptional activity of BmHSC70-4p and HSC70-4p from Bombyx mandarina (BmandHSC70-4p). Moreover, the transcriptional activity of the combination of BmHSC70-4p and BmNPVhr3 changed with developmental stages and hormone titers. These results suggest that the combination of BmHSC70-4 promoter and BmNPVhr3 enhancer is more effective candidate for the transgene or stable cell expression system in Bombyx mori.

22544457485	Overexpression and characterization of appA phytase expressed by recombinant baculovirus-infected silkworm	An Escherichia coli strain with high phytase activity was screened from pig excreta. The phytase gene, appA, was amplified by PCR technique. To obtain large amounts of appA phytase, the appA gene was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 under the control of the Polyhedrin promoter. The recombinant baculovirus harboring the appA gene was obtained after co-transfection and screening. The early 5th instar larvae of silkworm were infected with the recombinant virus. Using this system, the appA phytase was overproduced up to 7,710 U per ml hemolymph. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the baculovirus-derived appA phytase to be approximately 47 kDa in size. The optimal temperature and pH of the expressed phytase were 60°C and pH 4.5, respectively. The enzymatic activity was increased by the presence of 1 mM Ca

2442450658	A constitutive super-enhancer: Homologous region 3 of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus	Transient expression assays were carried out to assess the transcriptional enhancement from the immediate-early gene (ie-1) promoters by cis-linked Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) homologous region-3 (hr3). The ie-1 promoters were derived from Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and BmNPV. Hr3 was placed downstream of the luciferase (luc) gene, the resulting plasmids were used to transfect the Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-21), Bombyx mori (Bm-5, Bm-N) cell lines and 5th instar silkworm larvae mediated by lipofectin. The results revealed that hr3 could stimulate the transcription of homologous BmNPV ie-1 promoter 1970, 2421, 683, and 1059 folds, and the heterologous AcMNPV ie-1 promoter 6462, 4046, 6980, and 605 folds, respectively. These results implied that hr3 was a super enhancer which could function both in vitro and in vivo. The 30-bp imperfect palindrome in hr3 was proved to be the essential structure for enhancing function of hr3. The utilizing of this promoter-enhancer combination in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) was also carried out to further confirm the function of hr3 enhancer. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

25144518675	Molecular phylogeny of the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, based on the sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b genes	Pupae from the Chinese wild mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mandarina, and 11 representative strains of the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori were selected for preparation of mitochondrial DNA. The 5′-end fragments of cytochrome b genes (Cytb) were generated by polymerase chain reaction products and sequenced directly. The homologous sequences of the Japanese B. mandarina and three strains of B. mori were from the GenBank database. The sequences of the 16 silkworm strains were analysed with DNASTAR software and a phylogenic tree was constructed using PHYLIP software. The result showed that: (i) The sequence divergence between the strains of B. mori and the Japanese B. mandarina was larger (5.4%-5.8%) compared with that between strains of B. mori and the Chinese B. mandarina (0.8%-1.9%). Analysis of clustering also showed that the sequences of B. mori strains and Chinese B. mandarina clustered into group (B group), while that of Japanese B. mandarina (A group) was outside this cluster. This may be evidence for the hypothesis that B. mori originated from Chinese B. mandarina. (ii) Among 14 strains of B. mori, sequence divergence was small and the most divergence was seen between strains Yanhe-1 and Chuxiong, whose sequences branched off from those of the other B. mori strains on the phylogenetic tree. From this and from historical records, we infer that the strains Yanhe-1 and Chuxiong originated independently from southwest China. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

2642580302	Functional analysis of the larval serum protein gene promoter from silkworm, Bombyx mori	The regulation region of larval serum protein gene, Bombyx mori. (BmLSP), consisting of the first intron, the first exon, the central promoter region and 5′-upstream region, is cloned from genomic DNA from the silkworm variety of SujuxMinghu. Using PCR and restriction endonuclease methods, a series of luciferase reporter plasmids, driven by different length of BmLSP promoters, are constructed. Via the transient expression system in BmN cells, the effects of the regulation elements and foreign insect hormones on the BmLSP promoter activity are investigated. The results demonstrate that the promoter activity of BmLSP is 5.8- or 4.4-fold higher than that of BmLSPs whose first intron or the clement in 5′-upstream region harboring the homologous sequence with the first intron of light-chain fibroin gene (EHIF) is deleted, respectively, suggesting that both the first intron and EHIF contain the main positive cis-acting elements. However, the inactive mariner transposable element (MTE) in 5′-upstream region presents a negative effect. Furthermore, the effects of juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) on the BmLSP promoter activity show a typical dose-dependent manner, that is, low concentration treatments increase the BmLSP promoter activity and high concentration treatments decrease it. Meanwhile, insect ecdysone (MH) treatments present no significant effect.

2642583197	Identification of a POU factor involved in regulating the neuron-specific expression of the gene encoding diapause hormone and pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide in Bombyx mori	Diapause hormone (DH) and PBAN (pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide) are two important insect neuropeptides regulating development and reproduction respectively. In the present study, we report two Bombyx mori transcription factors interacting specifically with the promoter of Bom-DH-PBAN (where Bom-DH stands for B. mori DH); we named them DHMBP-1 and -2 (DH-modulator-binding proteins 1 and 2). The developmental changes of DHMBP-1/-2 are closely correlated with that of Bom-DH-PBAN mRNA throughout the pupal stage. Competition assays indicate that DHMBP-1 from Chinese B. mori possesses binding characteristics similar to those of the POU-M1 protein from Japanese B. mori. POU-M1 cDNAs were cloned from various tissues of Chinese B. mori and were found to be distinct from the previously published POU-M1 in amino acid residues 108-136 because of insertion mutations. Owing to this difference in amino acid residues, we named this cDNA POU-M2. Even though POU-M2 differs from POU-M1 at the N-terminal, the POU domain and the binding properties of both POU-M1 and -M2 are the same. Functional analysis showed that overexpression of POU-M2 in the Bombyx cell line BmN activated the promoter of Bom-DH-PBAN, but failed to activate a promoter in which the POU-binding element was mutated. The transcriptional activity of POU-M2 is probably regulated by other factors binding to the upstream of the promoter sequence. We show that the POU-M2-binding site was able to activate the transcription of a heterologous promoter of the gene encoding B. mori larval serum protein. POU-M1 was found to exhibit the same transcriptional activities as POU-M2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that POU-M2 plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the Bom-DH-PBAN gene.

2942530652	Effective expression of human insulin like growth factor-2 in Bombyx mori larvae	AIM: The purpose is to study the efficient expression and production of biologically active recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 2 (rhIGF-2) in the silkworm system by the vector of Bombyx mori Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (BmNPV). METHODS: A full length IGF-2 cDNA with the start codon was inserted into the BmNPV genome under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Silkworm larvae (JY1) were used as hosts for the infection with recombinant BmNPV /IGF-2. rhIGF-2 concentration were detected by ELISA, and Western blot was used to find the size of IGF-2, while MTT pathway was involved to study the bioactivity of rhIGF-2 by stimulation the growth of NIH3T3 cell line. RESULTS: It was found that after 48 h after infection, the concentration of IGF-2 in silkworm hemolymph could be detected (1 μg/ml), while at 72 h after infection, the level of rhIGF-2 was tested for 14.00 μg/ml). Mature rhIGF-2 with a size of 7.0 kD was identified by Western blot analysis. It was also showed that rhIGF-2 has excellent bioactivity by stimulated NIH3T3 cell growth. CONCLUSION: Human IGF-2 was highly expressed by the BmNPV expression vector, and this production showed satisfied results both in bioactivity and immunol activity thus providing a very efficient way to produce soluble and biologically active mature rhIGF-2.

33645243556	High expression of foot-and-mouth disease virus structural protein VP1 in tobacco chloroplasts	A tobacco chloroplast expression vector, pTRVP1, containing the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 gene and the selective marker aadA gene, was constructed and transferred to tobacco by biolistic method. Three resistant lines were obtained through spectinomycin selection, and each transgenic line was subjected to a second round of spectinomycin selection. PCR and PCR southern blot analysis revealed that the VP1 gene had integrated into the chloroplast genome. Western blot and quantification ELISA assays indicated that the VP1 gene was expressed in tobacco chloroplasts and accounted for 2-3% of total soluble protein. This suggested that plant chloroplasts were an efficient expression system for the potential production of recombinant antigens in plants. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

33744521525	Protein-DNA interactions in the promoter region of the gene encoding diapause hormone and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera	Diapause hormone (DH) and pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) are two crucial neuropeptides which regulate insect development and sex pheromone biosynthesis respectively. These peptides are encoded by a single gene, termed DH-PBAN gene. In this study, we characterized the promoter of the DH-PBAN gene in Helicoverpa armigera (Har). Transient transfection assays using a series of stepwise deletion fragments linked to the luciferase reporter gene indicate that the promoter contains multiple regulator domains that can activate and repress reporter gene expression. The fragment spanning -467 to -371 bp of the DH-PBAN promoter is an activator domain of transcription, whereas the region from -965 to -534 bp represses the promoter activity in the insect cell line BmN. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that at least two nuclear protein factors from the nuclear protein extracts of H. armigera suboesophageal ganglion, Har-DHMBP-1 and-2 (DH-modulator-binding protein) can specifically bind to the activating region. Furthermore, we characterized in detail that the nuclear protein factor Har-DHMBP-3 can specifically bind to a classical E-box, CAGCTG localized at positions -360 to -355 bp, a potential site for interaction with basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. Mutation of this E-box results in a significant reduction of the promoter activity, suggesting it can modulate the previously identified activator domain. Taken together, multipartite cis-elements and transcription factors in the DH-PBAN promoter are involved in regulation of the gene expression. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33748055762	Identification and analysis of YELLOW protein family genes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori	Background: The major royal jelly proteins/yellow (MRJP/YELLOW) family possesses several physiological and chemical functions in the development of Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster. Each protein of the family has a conserved domain named MRJP. However, there is no report of MRJP/YELLOW family proteins in the Lepidoptera. Results: Using the YELLOW protein sequence in Drosophila melanogaster to BLAST silkworm EST database, we found a gene family composed of seven members with a conserved MRJP domain each and named it YELLOW protein family of Bombyx mori. We completed the cDNA sequences with RACE method. The protein of each member possesses a MRJP domain and a putative cleavable signal peptide consisting of a hydrophobic sequence. In view of genetic evolution, the whole Bm YELLOW protein family composes a monophyletic group, which is distinctly separate from Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera. We then showed the tissue expression profiles of Bm YELLOW protein family genes by RT-PCR. Conclusion: A Bombyx mori YELLOW protein family is found to be composed of at least seven members. The low homogeneity and unique pattern of gene expression by each member among the family ensure us to prophesy that the members of Bm YELLOW protein family would play some important physiological functions in silkworm development. © 2006 Xia et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33748934999	Expression of human soluble TRAIL in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast	Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces selectively apoptosis in various tumor cells and virus-infected cells, but rarely in normal cells. A chloroplast expression vector, p64TRAIL, containing the cDNA coding for the soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL), was constructed with clpP-trnL-petB-chlL-rpl23-rpl2 as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii plastid homologous recombinant fragments and spectinomycin-resistant aadA gene as a select marker. The plasmid p64TRAIL was transferred into the chloroplast genome of C. reinhardtii by the biolistic method. Three independently transformed lines were obtained by 100 mg/L spectinomycin selection. PCR amplification, Southern blot analysis of the sTRAIL coding region DNA and cultivation cells in the dark all showed that the exogenous DNA had been integrated into chloroplast genome of C. reinhardtii. Western blot analysis showed that human soluble TRAIL was expressed in C. reinhardtii chloroplast. The densitometric analysis of Western blot indicated that the expressed human sTRAIL protein in the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii accounted for about 0.43%-0.67% of the total soluble proteins. These experimental results demonstrated the possibility of using transgenic chloroplasts of green alga as bioreactors for production of biopharmaceuticals. © Science in China Press 2006.

33750471943	The scaleless wings mutant in Bombyx mori is associated with a lack of scale precursor cell differentiation followed by excessive apoptosis	The scaleless wings mutant in Bombyx mori (scaleless, sl) was previously reported morphologically. In the present study, we give data to clarify the mechanism of the mutation at the developmental level. Programmed cell death participates in the wing scale development during early pupal stage, and there are significant differences between that of sl and the wild type (WT) at each phase. Well-differentiated scale precursor cells do not form in sl when they have formed in WT. The peak of Caspase-3/7 activity in sl occurs 1 day later than and ten times as much as that in WT. Apoptotic bodies and DNA ladder studies also show that there is excessive apoptosis in sl early pupal wing. In addition, we have studied Bm-ASH1, an achaete-scute homolog in B.mori, which is thought to play a key role during the development of wing scales, and have found that the gene structure and expression levels of Bm-ASH1 in sl and WT are identical. All the data indicate that the wing scale precursor differentiation mechanism is abnormal in sl, which causes failing determination of scale cells and the downstream symptom of excessive apoptosis. But some of the elements to the scale differentiation circuit, such as Bm-ASH1, still operate in sl. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

Here, we reported a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast expression vector, P64E2, containing classical swine fever virus structural protein E2 gene, which was constructed and transferred to C. reinhardtii by biolistic bombardment method. The transformants were identified by PCR, Southern blotting, Western blotting after selecting on resistant media. ELISA quantification assay showed that the expressed E2 protein accumulated up to 1.5-2% of the total soluble protein. The results of the study on the immunological activity indicated that the protein E2 expressed in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts could elicit animal bodies to produce antibodies against protein E2. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Transformed plants were obtained by selecting on kanamycin-resistant medium strictly and regenerated. The transgenic plantlets were identified by PCR, Southern-blot and the production of fused protein was confirmed and quantified by Western-blot and ELISA assays. The results showed that the fused genes were expressed stablely under the control of specific-tuber patatin promoter.

34548753011	Complete sequence and organization of Antheraea pernyi nucleopolyhedrovirus, a dr-rich baculovirus	Background: The completion and reporting of baculovirus genomes is extremely important as it advances our understanding of gene function and evolution. Due to the large number of viral genomes now sequenced it is very important that authors present significantly detailed analyses to advance the understanding of the viral genomes. However, there is no report of the Antheraea pernyi nucleopolyhedrovirus (AnpeNPV) genome. Results: The genome of AnpeNPV, which infects Chinese tussah silkworm (Antheraea pernyi), was sequenced and analyzed. The genome was 126,629 bp in size. The G+C content of the genome, 53.4%, was higher than that of most of the sequenced baculoviruses. 147 open reading frames (ORFs) that putatively encode proteins of 50 or more amino acid residues with minimal overlap were determined. Of the 147 ORFs, 143 appeared to be homologous to other baculovirus genes, and 4 were unique to AnpeNPV. Furthermore, there are still 29 and 33 conserved genes present in all baculoviruses and all lepidopteran baculoviruses respectively. In addition, the total number of genes common to all lepidopteran NPVs is sill 74, however the 74 genes are somewhat different from the 74 genes identified before because of some new sequenced NPVs. Only 6 genes were found exclusively in all lepidopteran NPVs and 12 genes were found exclusively in all Group I NPVs. AnpeNPV encodes v-trex(Anpe115, a 3′ to 5′ repair exonuclease), which was observed only in CfMNPV and CfDEFNPV in Group I NPVs. This gene potentially originated by horizontal gene transfer from an ancestral host. In addition, AnpeNPV encodes two conotoxin-like gene homologues (ctls), ctl1 and ctl2, which were observed only in HycuNPV., OpMNPV and LdMNPV. Unlike other baculoviruses, only 3 typical homologous regions (hrs) were identified containing 2∼9 repeats of a 30 bp-long palindromic core. However, 24 perfect or imperfect direct repeats (drs) with a high degree of AT content were found within the intergenic spacer regions that may function as non-hr, ori-like regions found in GrleGV, CpGV and AdorGV. 9 drs were also found in intragenic spacer regions of AnpeNPV. Conclusion: AnpeNPV belongs to Group I NPVs and is most similar to HycuNPV, EppoNPV, OpMNPV and CfMNPV based on gene content, genome arrangement, and amino acid identity. In addition, analysis of genes that flank hrs supported the argument that these regions are involved in the transfer of sequences between the virus and host. © 2007 Nie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

35148894379	Immune response in cattle inoculated with the recombinant complete polyprotein of foot-and-mouth disease virus from Bombyx mori larvae	The intact open reading frame (ORF) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) Asia I/XJ strain was amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into the transfer vector pVL1393 to generate plasmid pVL-ORF. Bm-N cells were transfected with pVL-ORF and linearized Bm-BacPAK6 DNA, and the recombinant silkworm baculovirus Bm-ORF containing the full ORF of FMDV was obtained. The results of indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) showed that Bm-ORF could be expressed efficiently in Bm-N cell. After inoculating the early 5th instar larvae of silkworm, the polyprotein of FMDV could be detected by sandwich ELISA and empty capsid-like particles could be observed under the electron microscope. Expression products from silkworm were used as the antigen to immunize the cattle. The specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. The immunized cattle were challenged with the virulent FMDV Asia I/XJ strain, two of the four cattle were completely protected and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the others. The results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit FMDV vaccine. © 2007 Science in China Press.

58949088518	Identification of a novel gene encoding the trehalose phosphate synthase in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera	Trehalose and trehalose metabolism are crucial for insect development. We measured the content of polyhydric compounds in the hemolymph of diapause- and nondiapause-destined individuals of Helicoverpa armigera. We found that the trehalose content is much higher in diapause-destined individuals than that in nondiapause individuals. The activity of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) during H. armigera larval-pupal development is significantly higher in diapause-type individuals and is closely correlated with the changes in the trehalose content. The cDNA encoding TPS, which converts uridine-5′-diphosphoglucose and glucose-6-phosphate to trehalose-6-phosphate, was cloned from the fat body of H. armigera using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The molecular characterization of the cDNA revealed that the mRNA encodes a precursor polypeptide of 826-amino-acid residues, containing Har-TPS at residues 6-507 and a putative trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, which converts trehalose-6-phosphate into free trehalose, at residues 512-783. The Har-TPS precursor polypeptide shows 73% identity with that of Drosophila melanogaster. The presence of a 2.8 kb transcript in the fat body and ovary was detected with a northern blot. The Har-TPS mRNA was detected at high levels in the late stage of sixth larval instar and the early middle stage of diapause-destined pupae, which are most likely to respond the changes in TPS activity and trehalose in the hemolymph. The Har-TPS protein was successfully overexpressed in the Bombyx mori baculovirus expression system, and the catalytic activity of Har-TPS was found to be approximately 5-fold higher in B. mori blood infected by the recombined-baculovirus than the control. When diapause is broken, the trehalose content drops significantly and glucose increases rapidly. These results suggest that trehalose is involved in regulating H. armigera pupal diapause. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

42449139158	Analysis of four achaete-scute homologs in Bombyx mori reveals new viewpoints of the evolution and functions of this gene family	Background: achaete-scute complexe (AS-C) has been widely studied at genetic, developmental and evolutional levels. Genes of this family encode proteins containing a highly conserved bHLH domain, which take part in the regulation of the development of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Many AS-C homologs have been isolated from various vertebrates and invertebrates. Also, AS-C genes are duplicated during the evolution of Diptera. Functions besides neural development controlling have also been found in Drosophila AS-C genes. Results: We cloned four achaete-scute homologs (ASH) from the lepidopteran model organism Bombyx mori, including three proneural genes and one neural precursor gene. Proteins encoded by them contained the characteristic bHLH domain and the three proneural ones were also found to have the C-terminal conserved motif. These genes regulated promoter activity through the Class A E-boxes in vitro. Though both Bm-ASH and Drosophila AS-C have four members, they are not in one by one corresponding relationships. Results of RT-PCR and real-time PCR showed that Bm-ASH genes were expressed in different larval tissues, and had well-regulated expressional profiles during the development of embryo and wing/wing disc. Conclusion: There are four achaete-scute homologs in Bombyx mori, the second insect having four AS-C genes so far, and these genes have multiple functions in silkworm life cycle. AS-C gene duplication in insects occurs after or parallel to, but not before the taxonomic order formation during evolution. © 2008 Zhou et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

48349103233	Expression of foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid proteins in silkworm-baculovirus expression system and its utilization as a subunit vaccine	Background: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that causes severe economic loss in susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. Although the traditional inactivated vaccine has been proved effective, it may lead to a new outbreak of FMD because of either incomplete inactivation of FMDV or the escape of live virus from vaccine production workshop. Thus, it is urgent to develop a novel FMDV vaccine that is safer, more effective and more economical than traditional vaccines. Methodology and Principal Findings: A recombinant silkworm baculovirus Bm-P12A3C which contained the intact P1-2A and 3C protease coding regions of FMDV Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 was developed. Indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD

56149105630	Promoter analysis of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus Ubiquitin gene	The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) ubiquitin gene promoter and the effects of conserved motifs, such as TAAG, TATA, and CAAT, along with baculovirus enhancer homologous region 3 (hr3), on promoter activity. Ubiquitin gene of BmNPV was expressed during the late phase of virus infection. In the presence of viral factors, significant reduction of promoter activity was observed by deletion of -382 to -124 bp upstream of ATG. The fragment between -187 and -383 bp upstream of ATG, including distal TAAG, CAAT motif, and TATA box, could also drive expression of the reporter gene. The mutation of cis-elements TATA boxes and TAAG motifs significantly decreased the promoter's activity, while CAAT mutations enhanced promoter activity by 2-or 3-fold, as compared with the native promoter. In the presence of BmNPV, hr3, both located downstream of the reporter gene of the same vector, and separate vector, could significantly enhance transcription activity of ubiquitin promoter as compared to the control. We concluded that BmNPV ubiquitin gene might be regulated by dual sets of promoter elements, where TAAG and TATA box may positively regulate the expression of ubiquitin, while CAAT motif functions as a negative regulator.

6344226472	The ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase gene promoter from Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus	The ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) gene promoter fragments of different lengths were generated from the genomic DNA of the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) by PCR. After being purified and enzymatic digestion, they were cloned into the pGEM-3Z vector for construction of reporter plasmids pAcegt542-luc, pAcegt309-luc and pAcegt159-luc with the luciferase gene driven by the AcMNPV egt promoter. The results of transient expression in the Spodoptera frugiperda cell line-21 (Sf21) showed that the transcriptional activity of the AcMNPV egt promoter required the transactivation of viral factor(s). The expression of luciferase gene driven by the AcMNPV egt promoter was first detected at 24 h post infection. The egt promoter from the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), closely related to AcMNPV, revealed similar properties to that of the AcMNPV egt promoter. When BmNPV homologous region 3 was subcloned downstream the luciferase gene, the luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid was enhanced by over 1000-fold, but the property of the promoter was not changed. As a substrate of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (EGT), foreign insect ecdysone showed negative effects on egt promoter transcriptional activity. Ecdysone of 1.0-2.0 μm/ml significantly down-regulated the promoter activity. Promoter activities of different lengths showed that an AcMNPV egt promoter fragment of 159 bp has the basal transcriptional activity but it was almost abolished only about 0.2% of that of 309 bp and 542 bp, respectively, and the nucleotide sequence from - 159 to - 309 nt upstream the translation initiation site includes the main cis-acting elements interacting with viral factors.

67449158763	Establishment of a Gene Expression System in Rice Chloroplast and Obtainment of PPT-Resistant Rice Plants	In contrast to the situation of random integration of foreign genes in nuclear transformation, the introduction of genes via chloroplast genetic engineering is characterized by site-specific pattern via homologous recombination. To establish an expression system for alien genes in rice chloroplast, the intergenic region of ndhF and trnL was selected as target for site-specific integration of PPT-resistant bar gene in this study. Two DNA fragments suitable for homologous recombination were cloned from rice chloroplast genome DNA using PCR technique, and the chloroplast-specific expression vector pRB was constructed by fusing a modified 16S rRNA gene promoter to bar gene together with terminator of psbA gene 3′ sequence. Chloroplast transformation was carried out by biolistic bombardment of sterile rice calli with the pRB construct. Subsequently, the regenerated plantlets and seeds of progeny arising from reciprocal cross to the wild-type lines were obtained. Molecular analysis suggested that the bar gene has been integrated into rice chloroplast genome. Genetic analysis revealed that bar gene could be transmitted and expressed normally in chloroplast genome. Thus, the bar gene conferred not only selection pressure for the transformation of rice chloroplast genome, but PPT-resistant trait for rice plants as well. It is suggested that an efficient gene expression system in the rice chloroplast has been established by chloroplast transformation technique. © 2009 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

67650673628	A novel protease-resistant α-galactosidase with high hydrolytic activity from Gibberella sp. F75: Gene cloning, expression, and enzymatic characterization	A novel α-galactosidase gene (aga-F75) from Gibberella sp. F75 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene codes for a protein of 744 amino acids with a 24-residue putative signal peptide and a calculated molecular mass of 82.94 kDa. The native structure of the recombinant Aga-F75 was estimated to be a trimer or tetramer. The deduced amino acid sequence showed highest identity (69%) with an α-galactosidase from Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei), a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 36. Purified recombinant Aga-F75 was optimally active at 60°C and pH∈4.0 and was stable at pH∈3.0-12.0.

70350576445	Construction and application of a baculovirus genomic library	A random genomic library of the baculovirus Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) was constructed and viral factors were identified by screening the regulator(s) for helicase gene expression. DNAs of 238 library plasmids were used to co-transfect with the reporter plasmid, pHp510-luc, in which the luciferase (luc) gene was driven by the bacu-lovirus helicase promoter. Results showed that eight plasmids of the library strengthened the luciferase activity more than 1000-fold. Sequence analyses revealed that all of the eight plasmids contained an intact ie-1 coding region. To confirm the reliability of the screening library, pHp510-luc was co-transfected with the cloned early gene which revealed that the BmNPV IE-1 was the only early factor that could stimulate the helicase promoter. The function analyses suggested that genome-wide screening factors through the library are powerful means to investigate the transcriptional regulation of dsDNA viruses. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen.

70649106967	Homology of dipteran bristles and lepidopteran scales: Requirement for the Bombyx mori achaete-scute homologue ASH2	Lepidopteran wing scales and Drosophila bristles are considered homologous structures on the basis of the similarities in their cell lineages. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying scale development are essentially unknown as analysis of gene function in Lepidoptera is sorely limited. In this study, we used the Bombyx mori mutant scaleless (sl), which displays a nearly complete loss of wing scales, to explore the mechanism of lepidopteran wing-scale formation. We found that Bm-ASH2, one of four Bombyx achaetescute homologs, is highly expressed in early pupal wings of wild-type silkworms, but its expression is severely reduced in sl pupal wings. Through molecular characterization of the mutant locus using luciferase and gel shift assays, genetic analysis of recombining populations, and in vivo rescue experiments, we provide evidence that a 26-bp deletion within the Bm-ASH2 promoter is closely linked to the sl locus and leads to loss of Bm-ASH2 expression and the scaleless-wings phenotype. Thus, the Bm-ASH2 appears to play a critical role in scale formation in B. mori. This finding supports the proposed homology of lepidopteran scales and dipteran bristles and provides evidence for conservation of the genetic pathway in scale/bristle development at the level of gene function.

71549116140	Molecular cloning and expression of a novel protease-resistant GH-36 α-galactosidase from Rhizopus sp. F78 ACCC 30795	A 2,172-bp full-length gene (aga-F78), encoding a protease-resistant α-galactosidase, was cloned from Rhizopus sp. F78 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence shared highest identity (45.0%) with an α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 from Absidia corymbifera. After one-step purification with a Ni-NTA chelating column, the recombinant Aga-F78 migrated as a single band of ∼82 and ∼210 kDa on SDS-PAGE and nondenaturing gradient PAGE, respectively, indicating that the native structure of the recombinant Aga-F78 was a trimer. Exhibiting the similar properties as the authentic protein, purified recombinant Aga-F78 was optimally active at 50°C and pH 4.8, highly pH stable over the pH range 5.0-10.0, more resistant to some cations and proteases, and had wide substrate specificity (pNPG, melidiose, raffinose, and stachyose). The recombinant enzyme also showed good hydrolytic ability to soybean meal, releasing galactose of 415.58 μg/g soybean meal. When combined with trypsin, the enzyme retained over 90% degradability to soybean meal. These favorable properties make Aga-F78 a potential candidate for applications in the food and feed industries. © The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

76449100768	Extremely acidic β-1,4-glucanase,CelA4, from thermoacidophilic Allcyclobacillus sp. A4 with high protease resistance and potential as a pig feed additive	An acidic endo-β-1, 4-glucanase, denoted CelA4 (∼48 kDa), was purified from thermoacidophilic Allcyclobacillus sp. A4. Two internal peptides of CelA4 showed strong sequence identity to the Allcyclobacillus acldocaldarlus cellulase precursor and contained the conserved domain and catalytic region of glycoside hydrolase family 51β-1,4-glucanases, and the N-terminal and three other internal peptides had no close glucanase or cellulase relatives, suggesting that the enzyme might be novel. CelA4 had broad substrate specificity, exhibited maximum activity at 65 °C and pH 2.6, was stable over pH 1.8-7.6, and showed strong resistance to acidic and neutral proteases, notably pepsin. In comparison to the commercial endo-ββ-1,3-1,4- glucanase, CelA4 was more stable, released more reducing sugar from barley β-glucan, and under simulated gastric conditions, decreased the viscosity of barley-soybean feed to a greater extent. These properties make CelA4 a good candidate as a new commercial glucanase to improve the nutrient bioavailability of pig feed. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

76449108319	A new xylanase from thermoacidophilic Alicyclobacillus sp. A4 with broad-range pH activity and pH stability	We have identified a highly pH-adaptable and stable xylanase (XynA4) from the thermoacidophilic Alicyclobacillus sp. A4, a strain that was isolated from a hot spring in Yunnan Province, China. The gene (xynA4) that encodes this xylanase was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. It encodes a 338-residue polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 42.5 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence is most similar to (53% identity) an endo-1,4-β-xylanase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus that belongs to family 10 of the glycoside hydrolases. Purified recombinant XynA4 exhibited maximum activity at 55°C and pH 7.0, had broad pH adaptability (>40% activity at pH 3.8-9.4) and stability (retaining >80% activity after incubation at pH 2.6-12.0 for 1 h at 37°C), and was highly thermostable (retaining >90% activity after incubation at 60°C for 1 h at pH 7.0). These properties make XynA4 promising for application in the paper industry.

77949297717	Baculovirus immediately early 1, a mediator for homologous regions enhancer function in trans	Background. Enhancers are DNA sequences that serve as binding sites for regulatory proteins, and stimulate transcriptional activity independent of their positions and orientations with respect to the transcriptional initiation site. Previous studies considered that baculovirus homologous regions (hrs) function as enhancers in cis. In our study, a plasmid containing homologous region 3 (hr3) enhancer from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) failed to enhance transcription of promoter in other plasmid in co-transfection assays, but strong stimulation occurred when cells were infected by BmNPV Results. The cotransfection results of each BmNPV genomic library plasmid, hr3 plasmid and reporter plasmid showed that there were eight library plasmids stimulated the luciferase gene expression remarkably. Sequencing these plasmids revealed that each of them contained the ie-1 gene. Transfected plasmids, containing ie-1, hr3 and various origin promoter drove reporter gene showed the function was even retained. Cotransfection of hr3 functional dissected fragment and ie-1 revealed that the 30-bp imperfect palindrome destroyed fragment can't enhance reporter gene expression even though transfected with ie-1. Conclusion. IE-1 was the only early factor of BmNPV that could act as a mediator for hr enhancer function in trans and the trans-function was achieved with a broad-spectrum of promoters. The 30-bp imperfect palindrome was the elementary molecular structure by which IE-1 participated in the enhancer function in trans. © 2010 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77952890103	A novel family 9 β-1,3(4)-glucanase from thermoacidophilic Alicyclobacillus sp. A4 with potential applications in the brewing industry	An endo-β-1,3(4)-glucanase gene, Agl9A, was cloned from Alicyclobacillus sp. A4 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. Its deduced amino acid sequence shared the highest identity (48%) with an endo-β-1,4-glucansae from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius that belongs to family 9 of the glycoside hydrolases. The purified recombinant Agl9A exhibited relatively wide substrate specificity, including lichenan (109%), barley β-glucan (100%), CMC-Na (15.02%), and laminarin (6.19%). The optimal conditions for Agl9A activity were pH 5.8 and 55°C. The enzyme was stable over a broad pH range (>60% activity retained after 1-h incubation at pH 3.8-11.2) and at 60°C (>70% activity retained after 1-h incubation). Agl9A was highly resistant to various neutral proteases (e.g., trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, and collagenase) and Neutrase 0.8L (Novozymes), a protease widely added to the mash. Under simulated mashing conditions, addition of Agl9A (20 U/ml) or a commercial xylanase (200 U/ml) reduced the filtration rate (26.71% and 20.21%, respectively) and viscosity (6.12% and 4.78%, respectively); furthermore, combined use of Agl9A (10 U/ml) and the xylanase (100 U/ml) even more effectively reduced the filtration rate (31.73%) and viscosity (8.79%). These characteristics indicate that Agl9A is a good candidate to improve glucan degradation in the malting and brewing industry. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

S27 ACCC 41168 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence shared highest identities of 82% with a putative α-galactosidase from Nocardiopsis dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM 43111 and 46% with a known α-galactosidase from Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIMB 41171, both of which belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 36. The purified recombinant enzyme showed a single protein band of ∼82 kDa on SDS-PAGE and three bands of ∼220, 320 and 480 kDa on non-denaturing gradient PAGE, respectively, indicating its native structure of trimer, tetramer or hexamer. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity at conditions of 35. °C and pH 7.4, similar to the intestinal conditions of mammals and poultry, was resistant to some neutral proteases (α-chymotrypsin, subtilisin A and collagenase), and showed hydrolytic ability to natural substrates, including melibiose, stachyose, raffinose and soybean meal. When combined with intestinal proteases, the enzyme showed higher hydrolytic ability to raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) in soybean product. These favorable properties make the Streptomyces sp. S27 α-galactosidase very prospective in soybean processing for food and feed industries. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We report the characterization of three Superoxide dismutase (sod) genes isolated from a bacterium in the Geobacillus genus. We isolated the bacterium from high-temperature pond mud and used 16S rRNA gene sequence to confirm its identity in the Geobacillus genus. The three genes Mn-sod, Fe/Mn-sod, and Cu/Zn-sod were cloned and analyzed. Their open reading frames are Mn-sod: 615 bp encoding a 204 amino acid protein; Fe/Mn-sod: 1,236 bp encoding a 411 amino acid protein; Cu/Zn-sod: 522 bp encoding a 173 amino acid protein. When these sod genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, only Mn-SOD was able to be purified. The activity of the purified Mn-SOD we got was about 2,730 U/mg.

0036170523	Gonadotropins, via cAMP, negatively regulate GATA-1 gene expression in testicular cells	We and others demonstrated that the mRNAs encoding GATA-binding proteins, GATA-1 and GATA-4, were detected in mouse and rat testis, and in isolated rat Sertoli cells and testicular tumor cell lines derived from Leydig and Sertoli cells. In this study, we investigated the possible effects of gonadotropins and cAMP on the expression of GATA-binding protein genes in testicular cells. Unexpectedly, FSH negatively regulated GATA-1 (but not GATA-4) mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in primary cultures of rat Sertoli cells isolated from 21-d-old animals. GATA-1 mRNA was also negatively regulated by cAMP in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MA-10, a mouse Leydig tumor cell line. When 0.3 mM cAMP was administered to MA-10 cell cultures for 4 h, more than 95% of the GATA-1 mRNA and protein was abolished. The reduction of GATA-1 mRNA by cAMP can be mimicked by treatment with forskolin, which elevates intracellular cAMP levels. The inhibitory effect of cAMP was specific to the GATA-1 gene, given that GATA-4 and α-tubulin mRNA levels were not changed by any of the cAMP treatments. Inhibin α-subunit mRNA, on the other hand, was evidently increased by cAMP treatment in both MA-10 and Sertoli cells. However, inhibin α-subunit mRNA levels were elevated at 60-90 min before the suppression of GATA-1 mRNA detected. The inhibitory effect of cAMP on GATA-1 mRNA and protein was shown to be specific to testicular cells. The GATA-1 mRNA expressed in MEL, a mouse erythroid leukemia cell line, was not affected by cAMP. The reduction of GATA-1 mRNA by cAMP can be prevented when a translational inhibitor, cycloheximide, is added. In summary, we demonstrated that gonadotropins via cAMP negatively regulate the mRNA and protein levels of GATA-1, but not GATA-4, in testicular cells. The inhibitory effect on GATA-1 gene expression was specific to testicular cells and was not observed in erythroid cells.

0036398752	Identification of functional region of helicase gene promoter in Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus	DNA helicases are essential for replication of baculoviruses. It was found that the helicase gene promoter of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus, including 510 bp upstream of ATG, had both early and late RNA initiation sites and could be recognized by cellular RNA polymerase. Transient expression assays in uninfected Sf-21 cells indicated that the helicase gene promoter could be classified as a delayed-early gene promoter. Deletion analysis by PCR showed that the regulation region of its basic transcription was mainly within -510 to -410 bp upstream of ATG. However, the basic activity was still detected with a deletion to -98 bp relative to ATG. In the presence of viral factors, deletion between -510 to -410 bp relative to ATG did not significantly reduce the promoter activity compared to the full-length promoter (510 bp). The remarkable reduction in the promoter activity was observed with continuous deletions. It suggests, therefore, that cis-acting elements responsive to viral factors are mainly located within the range of -410 to -309 bp upstream of ATG.

0036653431	Foreign insect hormones stimulating the transcription of the ie-1 promoter of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus in vivo and in vitro	Via a transient expression assay system, an experimental study was undertaken to characterize the effects of insect ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue on the transient expression of the luciferase gene under the control of the immediate-early gene (ie-1) promoter of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus. The results demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the ie-1 promoter was increased to a certain extent by different insect hormone treatments in uninfected insect cells or fifth instar silkworm larvae transfected with a plasmid containing a luciferase gene driven by the ie-1 promoter. By ecdysone treatment alone, an increase of 5-7 fold was reached in Bm-N, or Bm-5 cells, or in the early developmental stage of fifth instar larvae. By treatment with juvenile hormone analogue alone, about 2-fold, in Bm-N, Bm-5, and Sf-21 cells, or about 5-fold increase in the middle developmental stage of larvae was given, respectively. By co-treatment with ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue, the incease was given between that of ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue treatment alone. In addition, the synergistic effects of foreign/endogenous hormones on the activity of ie-1 promoter are discussed.

79960967321	Alternative splicing of the antitrypsin gene in the silkworm, Bombyx mori	Alternative splicing plays an important role in expanding protein diversity. In the present study, different splice variants of the antitrypsin gene (sw-AT) in the silkworm were identified by bioinformatics analyses using expressed sequence tags and genomic information. Four splice variants were obtained by RT-PCR with suitably designed primers, confirmed by sequencing, and designated as sw-AT-1, sw-AT-2, sw-AT-3, and sw-AT-4. The sw-AT gene contains 10 exons and nine introns. The splice variants differ in exon 9, with sw-AT-1, sw-AT-2, and sw-AT-3 using different versions of the exon, namely exon 9a, 9b, and 9c, respectively. In sw-AT-4, exon 9 consists of the combination of exons 9b and 9c. The expression patterns of the four isoforms in different tissues, at different developmental stages, and under different stress conditions (temperature, starvation, and mycotic infection) were characterized and quantified. The sw-AT isoforms showed tissue-specific expression patterns, with sw-AT-1 present in almost all tissues and sw-AT-4 found in only a few tissues. The four isoforms were predominantly expressed in the fat body, body wall, and testes of larvae, and exhibited similar expression profiles during development of the fat body. Among the stress treatments, low temperature had the greatest effect on isoform expression, and expression was also upregulated with mycotic infection. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

80155133068	Identification and characterization of the DNA replication origin recognition complex gene family in the silkworm Bombyx mori	The ORC (origin recognition complex) binds to the DNA replication origin and recruits other replication factors to form the pre-replication complex. The cDNA and genomic sequences of all six subunits of ORC in Bombyx mori (BmORC1-6) were determined by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and bioinformatic analysis. The conserved domains were identified in BmOrc1p-6p and the C-terminal of BmOrc6p features a short sequence that may be specific for Lepidoptera. As in other organisms, each of the six BmORC subunits had evolved individually from ancestral genes in early eukaryotes. During embryo development, the six genes were co-regulated, but different ratios of the abundance of mRNAs were observed in 13 tissues of the fifth instar day-6 larvae. Infection by BmNPV (B. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus) initially decreased and then increased the abundance of BmORC. We suggest that some of the BmOrc proteins may have additional functions and that BmOrc proteins participate in the replication of BmNPV. ©The Authors Journal compilation ©2011 Biochemical Society.

Heat shock cognate proteins (HSCs) are homologous to heat shock proteins (HSPs) and constitutively expressed. HSCs facilitate correct protein folding and translocation and could be influenced by a variety of extracellular signals. The 1.4 kb long hsc70-4 promoter from Bombyx mori (Bmhsc70-4) was amplified and cloned into the plasmid for driving the luciferase reporter gene. Transient expression assays were carried out to investigate the effects of heat shock treatment, developmental stages, insect ecdysone and juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) on the Bmhsc70-4 promoter activity. The results demonstrate that the Bmhsc70-4 promoter activity was high in BmN cells, Sf21 cells and silkworm larvae at normal temperature.

84865069028	Phylogenetic diversity and environment-specific distributions of glycosyl hydrolase family 10 xylanases in geographically distant soils	Background: Xylan is one of the most abundant biopolymers on Earth. Its degradation is mediated primarily by microbial xylanase in nature. To explore the diversity and distribution patterns of xylanase genes in soils, samples of five soil types with different physicochemical characters were analyzed. Methodology/Principal Findings: Partial xylanase genes of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 were recovered following direct DNA extraction from soil, PCR amplification and cloning. Combined with our previous study, a total of 1084 gene fragments were obtained, representing 366 OTUs. More than half of the OTUs were novel (identities of <65% with known xylanases) and had no close relatives based on phylogenetic analyses. Xylanase genes from all the soil environments were mainly distributed in Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Dictyoglomi and some fungi. Although identical sequences were found in several sites, habitat-specific patterns appeared to be important, and geochemical factors such as pH and oxygen content significantly influenced the compositions of xylan-degrading microbial communities. Conclusion/Significance: These results provide insight into the GH 10 xylanases in various soil environments and reveal that xylan-degrading microbial communities are environment specific with diverse and abundant populations. © 2012 Wang et al.

84865179441	Genomic sequencing and analyses of HearMNPV - A new Multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus isolated from Helicoverpa armigera	Background: HearMNPV, a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV), which infects the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, comprises multiple rod-shaped nucleocapsids in virion(as detected by electron microscopy). HearMNPV shows a different host range compared with H. armigera single-nucleocapsid NPV (HearSNPV). To better understand HearMNPV, the HearMNPV genome was sequenced and analyzed. Methods. The morphology of HearMNPV was observed by electron microscope. The qPCR was used to determine the replication kinetics of HearMNPV infectious for H. armigera in vivo. A random genomic library of HearMNPV was constructed according to the "partial filling-in" method, the sequence and organization of the HearMNPV genome was analyzed and compared with sequence data from other baculoviruses. Results: Real time qPCR showed that HearMNPV DNA replication included a decreasing phase, latent phase, exponential phase, and a stationary phase during infection of H. armigera. The HearMNPV genome consists of 154,196 base pairs, with a G + C content of 40.07%. 162 putative ORFs were detected in the HearMNPV genome, which represented 90.16% of the genome. The remaining 9.84% constitute four homologous regions and other non-coding regions. The gene content and gene arrangement in HearMNPV were most similar to those of Mamestra configurata NPV-B (MacoNPV-B), but was different to HearSNPV. Comparison of the genome of HearMNPV and MacoNPV-B suggested that HearMNPV has a deletion of a 5.4-kb fragment containing five ORFs. In addition, HearMNPV orf66, bro genes, and hrs are different to the corresponding parts of the MacoNPV-B genome. Conclusions: HearMNPV can replicate in vivo in H. armigera and in vitro, and is a new NPV isolate distinguished from HearSNPV. HearMNPV is most closely related to MacoNPV-B, but has a distinct genomic structure, content, and organization. © 2012 Tang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84865279627	Transcriptome analysis of the Silkworm (Bombyx mori) by high-throughput RNA sequencing	The domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a model insect with important economic value for silk production that also acts as a bioreactor for biomaterial production. The functional complexity of the silkworm transcriptome has not yet been fully elucidated, although genomic sequencing and other tools have been widely used in its study. We explored the transcriptome of silkworm at different developmental stages using high-throughput paired-end RNA sequencing. A total of about 3.3 gigabases (Gb) of sequence was obtained, representing about a 7-fold coverage of the B. mori genome. From the reads that were mapped to the genome sequence; 23,461 transcripts were obtained, 5,428 of them were novel. Of the 14,623 predicted protein-coding genes in the silkworm genome database, 11,884 of them were found to be expressed in the silkworm transcriptome, giving a coverage of 81.3%. A total of 13,195 new exons were detected, of which, 5,911 were found in the annotated genes in the Silkworm Genome Database (SilkDB). An analysis of alternative splicing in the transcriptome revealed that 3,247 genes had undergone alternative splicing. To help with the data analysis, a transcriptome database that integrates our transcriptome data with the silkworm genome data was constructed and is publicly available at http://124.17.27.136/gbrowse2/. To our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the silkworm transcriptome using high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. Our data indicate that the transcriptome of silkworm is much more complex than previously anticipated. This work provides tools and resources for the identification of new functional elements and paves the way for future functional genomics studies. © 2012 Li et al.

84865442107	Development of a foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype A empty Capsid subunit vaccine using Silkworm (Bombyx mori) Pupae	Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals that inflicts severe economic losses in the livestock industry. In 2009, FMDV serotype A caused outbreaks of FMD in cattle in China. Although an inactivated virus vaccine has proven effective to control FMD, its use may lead to new disease outbreaks due to a possible incomplete inactivation of the virus during the manufacturing process. Here, we expressed the P1-2A and the 3C coding regions of a serotype A FMDV field isolate in silkworm pupae (Bombyx mori) and evaluated the immunogenicity of the expression products. Four of five cattle vaccinated with these proteins developed high titers of FMDV-specific antibody and were completely protected against virulent homologous virus challenge with 10,000 50% bovine infectious doses (BID

0037223297	Promoter activities in the baculovirus envelope glycoprotein gp64 gene	Baculovirus GP64 envelope glyeoprotein is a specific major component of the envelope of the budded virus and is involved in virus entry into the host cells by endocytosis. For promoter activity analysis in the baculovirus gp64 gene, two DNA fragments containing 437 and 439 bp upstream of 5′ ends of the BmNPV and AcMNPV gp64 ORF were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned, respectively. The sequence analysis indicated that two gp64 genes have both early (CAGT) and late (A/GTAAG) transcriptional start sites. By use of the plasmids with a reporter luciferase gene (Luc) driven by gp64 promoter to transfect insect cells, transient expression assay showed that pBmgp64Luc had high expression levels in permissive Bm-N cells and very low levels in non-permissive Sf-21 cells, while pAcgp64Luc had relatively high expression levels both in permissive Sf-21 cells and in non-permissive Bm-N cells. Furthermore, the transcription of both gp64 promoters appeared to be transactivated by 2.4-4 times in corresponding permissive cells by corresponding viral factors, separately. By inserting BmNPV homologous region-3 (hr3) into the downstream of luciferase reporter gene driven by gp64 promoter, it enhanced transcription from both gp64 promoters by 13-22 times in Bm-N cells and over 7000-14 000 times in Sf-21 cells, respectively. In the presence of BmNPV hr3, correspondingly, the viral factors transactivated the transcriptional activity from two promoters by about 73-78 times in corresponding permissive cells. It suggested that BmNPV hr3 plays an important role in co-activation with viral factors onto the gp64 promoter besides the functions of viral DNA origin and enhancer.

0037766301	Cetyltriethylammonium bromide stimulating transcription of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus gp64 gene promoter mediated by viral factors	To characterize the effects of cetyltriethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the transcription of gp64 promoter from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), the plasmid pBmgp64Luc used in transient expression assay system was constructed by using the luciferase gene as a reporter under the control of BmNPV gp64 promoter. When the Bombyx mori cells (Bm-N) were transfected with the pBmgp64Luc, different treatments were undertaken. We found that the transient expression activity of luciferase could not be augmented directly by CTAB treatment alone, but could be enhanced more than 2 times by BmNPV treatment alone at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. Through co-treatment with 0.1 μg ml

84869753409	High expression of type 0 FMDV target protein by gene replacement in Baculovirus expression vector system	The structural protein VP1 of foot-and-mouth hsease virus (FMDV) play an important role in the construction of a high immunogenic subunit vaccine. The objective of this study was to obtain higher expression of type-0 FMDV target protein, this will provide further experimental evidence through animal immunization. The VP1 which in Bombyx mori Baculovirus recombinant transfer vector pVL-P12A3C of Asia I FMDV was replaced by VP1 of type-0 FMDV and the recombinant plasmid pVL-OP12A3C was created. The Bombyx mori N (Bm-N) cells was co-transfected with pVLOP12A3C and linearized DNA of insect virus expression vector. Inhrect immune fluorescence tests (IFAT) demonstrated that target proteins were expressed. The recombinant virus was used to infect silkworm and the target protein in haemolymph was characterized by western blotting and doubleantibody sandwich Enzyme-linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA) analysis. The results indicated that gene replacement is an effective way to enhance gene expression. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

84870690773	Proteomic analysis of the phenotype of the scaleless wings mutant in the silkworm, Bombyx mori	A scaleless wing mutant of silkworm, Bombyx mori, has much fewer scales than wild type (WT). The scaleless phenotype was associated with tracheal system developmental deficiency and excessive apoptosis of scale cells. In this study, the wing discs proteins of WT and scaleless during pupation were studied using 2-DE and mass spectrometry. Of the 99 identified protein spots, four critical differentially expressed proteins between WT and scaleless were further verified using Q-PCR. At the first day of pupation (P0) in WT, imaginal disk growth factor (IDGF) was upregulated, whereas actin-depolymerizing factor 1 (ADF1) and profilin (PFN), which associated with cellular motility and cytoplasmic extension, were downregulated. We speculated their coaction counteracts the correct organization of the tracheal system in wing disc. Thiol peroxiredoxin (TPx) was upregulated in scaleless at P0, but its mRNA higher expression occurred in the day before pupation (S4). TPx could inhibit the formation of hydrogen peroxide, preventing the release of cytochrome C and activation of the caspase family protease. Its higher expression in scaleless was responsible for the apoptosis of scale cells delayed. The results provide further evidence that the scaleless phenotype was related to the tracheal system developmental deficiency and excessive apoptosis of scale cells. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84872473547	Rabies virus nucleoprotein expressed in silkworm pupae at high-levels and evaluation of immune responses in mice	Rabies is one of the most fatal zoonotic diseases in developing countries, where a safe, cheap and effective vaccine against the disease remains unaffordable. In this paper, we describe a new silkworm-baculovirus expression system to express the nucleoprotein (N) gene of rabies virus and evaluation of the immune response in BALB/c mice. A recombinant baculovirus -rBmNPV(RV-N) carrying the N gene of rabies virus Evelyn Rokitniki Abelseth (ERA) strain was constructed and the N protein expression was evaluated in Bombyx mori (BmN) cells and silkworm pupae by immunofluorescence staining, Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The immune response to vaccines was evaluated based on serum IgG antibody titers and challenge experiments. The study revealed that N protein of rabies virus can be highly expressed in silkworm baculovirus expression system and the vaccine of N antigen presents a promising approach for the prevention of rabies virus. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84884379691	Activation of cAMP-response element-binding protein is positively regulated by PKA and calcium-sensitive calcineurin and negatively byPKC in insect	The cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signal-activated transcription factor implicated in the control of many biological processes. In the current study, we constructed a cAMP response element (CRE)-driven luciferase assay system for GPCR characterization in insect cells. Our results indicated that Gs-coupled Bombyx adipokinetic hormone receptor (AKHR) and corazonin receptor could effectively initiate CRE-driven luciferase transcription, but forskolin, a reagent widely used to activate adenylyl cyclase in mammalian systems, failed to induce luciferase activity in insect cells co-transfected with a CRE-driven reporter construct upon agonist treatment. Further investigation revealed that the specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors exhibited stimulatory effects on CRE-driven reporter transcription, and blockage of Ca

84896878366	Genomic sequence analysis of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus isolated from Australia	The complete genomic sequence of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus from Australia, HearNPV-Au, was determined and analyzed. The HearNPV-Au genome was 130,992 bp in size with a G + C content of 39 mol% and contained 134 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) consisting of more than 150 nucleotides. HearNPV-Au shared 94 ORFs with AcMNPV, HearSNPV-G4 and SeMNPV, and was most closely related to HearSNPV-G4. The nucleotide sequence identity between HearNPV-Au and HearSNPV-G4 genome was 99 %. The major differences were found in homologous regions (hrs) and baculovirus repeat ORFs (bro) genes. Five hrs and two bro genes were identified in the HearNPV-Au genome. All of the 134 ORFs identified in HearNPV-Au were also found in HearSNPV-G4, except the homologue of ORF59 (bro) in HearSNPV-G4. The sequence data strongly suggested that HearNPV-Au and HearSNPV-G4 belong to the same virus species. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

13144279289	A scaleless wings mutant associated with tracheal system developmental deficiency in wing in discs in the silkworm, Bombyx mori	A mutant of Bombyx mori has wings with few scales and is named scaleless. We investigated the morphology of this mutant and found that it had many fewer wing scales than the corresponding wild type (WT) silkworm and that the remaining scales were smaller in shape with fewer furcations. Reciprocal transplantation of wing discs between scaleless and WT revealed that the WT wing disc could develop into a small wing with scales after transplantation into a scaleless larva; however, the scaleless wing disc developed into a small wing without scales in a WT larva. Upon dissection of WT and scaleless wing discs at different stages from the fifth instar larva to adulthood, no obvious differences were found before pupation. However, after pupation, tracheae produced from WT wing veins extended to the lacunae between the veins and formed a network on the second day after pupation, whereas this did not happen in scaleless. At the same time, no marked difference in adult body tracheal development was found between the mutant and wild type. Furthermore, if the surface of a wing disc was cut and its veins injured, the resulting wing also had fewer scales than the corresponding WT. Also, we found that higher partial pressure of O
