84938558299	Search for heavy vector-like quarks coupling to light quarks in proton-proton collisions at √s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	This Letter presents a search for singly produced vector-like quarks, Q, coupling to light quarks, q. The search is sensitive to both charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) processes, pp→Qq→Wqq<sup>'</sup> and pp→Qq→Zqq<sup>'</sup> with a leptonic decay of the vector gauge boson. In 1.04fb<sup>-1</sup> of data taken in 2011 by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy √s=7 TeV, no evidence of such heavy vector-like quarks is observed above the expected Standard Model background.

84938558417	Search for extra dimensions using diphoton events in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector	Using data recorded in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, a search for evidence of extra spatial dimensions has been performed through an analysis of the diphoton final state. The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.12fb<sup>-1</sup> of s=7TeV proton-proton collisions. The diphoton invariant mass (m<inf>γγ</inf>) spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model background. In the large extra dimension scenario of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, the results provide 95% CL lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale between 2.27 and 3.53 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used.

Combining with previously published ATLAS results from the dielectron and dimuon final states, the 95% CL lower limit on the Randall-Sundrum graviton mass for k/M<inf>-1</inf>Pl=0.01 (0.1) is 0.80 (1.95) TeV. © 2012 CERN.

No excess of events was observed above the Standard Model prediction and 95% Confidence Level (CL) upper limits are set on the production cross section for new physics. The limits depend on each model parameter space and vary as follows: Λ<(22-129) fb in the context of a generalised model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GGM) with a bino-like lightest neutralino, σ<(27-91) fb in the context of a minimal model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (SPS8), and σ<(15-27) fb in the context of a specific model with one universal extra dimension (UED). A 95% CL lower limit of 805 GeV, for bino masses above 50 GeV, is set on the GGM gluino mass.

84938558480	Measurement of the t-channel single top-quark production cross section in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	We report a measurement of the cross section of single top-quark production in the t-channel using 1.04 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp collision data at s=7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Selected events feature one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets, exactly one of them identified as originating from a b quark. The cross section is measured by fitting the distribution of a multivariate discriminant constructed with a neural network, yielding σ<inf>t</inf>=83±4(stat.)<inf>-19</inf><sup>+20</sup>(syst.) pb, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the Standard Model. Using the ratio of the measured to the theoretically predicted cross section and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |V<inf>tb</inf>|≫|V<inf>ts</inf>|, |V<inf>td</inf>|, the coupling strength at the W-t-b vertex is determined to be |Vtb|=1.13<inf>-0.13</inf><sup>+0.14</sup>.

9544221653	The new beampipe for the Belle experiment	We have upgraded the beampipe and the silicon vertex tracker of the Belle detector for increased luminosity and to achieve better vertex resolution. The radius of the beampipe was reduced from 2 to 1.5cm to achieve better vertex resolution. In order to reduce the beam background that could accompany the reduction of the beampipe radius, a massive mask made of tantalum and tungsten was placed on each side of the central section. The total weight of them is 40 kg. The maximum radiation dose of the silicon tracker is measured about 80 krad/yr. This is lower than the dose of 100krad per year with the previous beampipe even though the beampipe radius is smaller.

9544229707	Readout, first- And second-level triggers of the new Belle silicon vertex detector	A major upgrade of the Silicon Vertex Detector (SVD 2.0) of the Belle experiment at the KEKB factory was installed along with new front-end and back-end electronics systems during the summer shutdown period in 2003 to cope with higher particle rates, improve the track resolution and meet the increasing requirements of radiation tolerance. The SVD 2.0 detector modules are read out by VAITA chips which provide "fast or" (hit) signals that are combined by the back-end FADCTF modules to coarse, but immediate level 0 track trigger signals at rates of several tens of a kHz. Moreover, the digitized detector signals are compared to threshold lookup tables in the FADCTFs to pass on hit information on a single strip basis to the subsequent level 1.5 trigger system, which reduces the rate below the kHz range. Both FADCTF and level 1.5 electronics make use of parallel real-time processing in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), while further data acquisition and event building is done by PC farms running Linux.

0000937776	Simultaneous measurement of the position and shape of a swimming fish by combining a fringe pattern projection method with a laser scanning technique	A novel scanning fringe projection method is developed to simultaneously measure the variations in both position and shape of a swimming fish. This method combines the commonly used fringe pattern projection method and a laser scanning technique into one optical system. In this new system, one or more reference fringes are generated by an acousto-optic deflector, and laser triangulation is used to determine the order of the reference fringe. These reference fringes are then combined with the conventional fringe pattern, and the fringe order is determined from the reference fringes. The method enables us to simultaneously measure the position and shape of a moving object.

The focus information contained in the laser beam scattered from the sample surface is then transformed into the movement of the spot on a position sensor for detection. The measurement error caused by variations in the shape or intensity of the spot can therefore be reduced. We successfully applied the method to measure the surface shape of a fish scale.

0032048506	Modulation transfer function of photorefractive phase conjugators for two mutually coherent input beams	We investigate theoretically and experimentally the modulation transfer function of a photorefractive phase conjugator for two mutually coherent input beams. The two coherent beams are incident on a crystal and undergo stimulated photorefractive backscattering in different regions, in which the phase conjugations are generated. Then the four waves present in the crystal interact. Due to the unreciprocal energy coupling between different spatial-frequency waves and the directional dependence of the two-wave mixing gain, the output modulation exhibits two values corresponding to one input modulation. The output modulation depends on the input beam ratio, on the backscattering coefficient of the imperfection on the surface of the crystal, and on the crossing angle of the two input beams. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Precise measurements for the femtosecond pulse shapes after propagation of as much as 300 m through air have been made in a semiunderground optical testing tunnel. We observed the pulse splitting and the enhancement of the pulse broadening due to the 100-m propagation in air. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis by use of the HITRAN database at the edge and the center of the water-vapor absorption regions in air. Measured autocorrelation traces are mostly reproduced by those calculated with only the real part (dispersion) of the refractive index modulated by water-vapor absorption lines in air. This fact enables us to conclude that the pulse deformations due to water absorption lines in air are caused mainly by the real part (dispersion), not by the imaginary part (absorption), of the refractive index of air. © 2004 Optical Society of America.

In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium.© 2010 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

At this time, only part of the calorimeter was readout, but since the beginning of 2008, all calorimeter cells have been connected to the ATLAS readout system in preparation for LHC collisions. This paper gives an overview of the liquid argon calorimeter performance measured in situ with random triggers, calibration data, cosmic muons, and LHC beam splash events. Results on the detector operation, timing performance, electronics noise, and gain stability are presented. High energy deposits from radiative cosmic muons and beam splash events allow to check the intrinsic constant term of the energy resolution. The uniformity of the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter response along η (averaged over Φ) is measured at the percent level using minimum ionizing cosmic muons. Finally, studies of electromagnetic showers from radiative muons have been used to cross-check the Monte Carlo simulation. The performance results obtained using the ATLAS readout, data acquisition, and reconstruction software indicate that the liquid argon calorimeter is well-prepared for collisions at the dawn of the LHC era. © 2010 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration.

79960782937	Measurement of underlying event characteristics using charged particles in pp collisions at √s=900GeV and 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	Measurements of charged particle distributions, sensitive to the underlying event, have been performed with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements are based on data collected using a minimum-bias trigger to select proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 900 GeV and 7 TeV. The "underlying event" is defined as those aspects of a hadronic interaction attributed not to the hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest of the proton. Three regions are defined in azimuthal angle with respect to the highest transverse momentum charged particle in the event, such that the region transverse to the dominant momentum-flow is most sensitive to the underlying event. In each of these regions, distributions of the charged particle multiplicity, transverse momentum density, and average p

81555215516	Charged-particle multiplicities in ppinteractions measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC	Measurements are presented from proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of s = 0.9, 2.36 and 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events were collected using a single-arm minimumbias trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are measured. Measurements in different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections. The results are compared to each other and to various Monte Carlo (MC) models, including a new AMBT1 pythia6 tune. In all the kinematic regions considered, the particle multiplicities are higher than predicted by the MC models. The central charged-particle multiplicity per event and unit of pseudorapidity, for tracks with pT < 100 MeV, is measured to be 3.483±0.009 (stat)±0.106 (syst) at s = 0.9 TeV and 5.630±0.003 (stat)±0.169 (syst) at s = 7 TeV. © 2011 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration, published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd for the Institute of Physics and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

8344231671	The data acquisition system of the belle silicon vertex detector (SVD) upgrade	A newly developed data acquisition system (DAQ) for the upgraded silicon vertex detector (SVD2) in the Belle experiment is described. The system consists of 12 PCs connected through PCI I/O boards to 36 flash analog-to-digital converters (FADCs) to read out a system comprising a total of 110 592 strips. It is designed to cope with the increased number of readout channels and the maximum trigger rate of 1 kHz, foreseen in the future operation with higher beam currents. A measurement of the system performance using sparsification algorithm we have developed yields a 1.3-kHz readout rate for a 5% occupancy with less than 5% dead time, which satisfies the requirements on the maximum trigger rate.

The data are selected from pp collisions at ps = 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb-1. The observed data are consistent with expectations from Standard Model processes. Upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the cross section of new sources of same-sign top-quark pair production of 1.4-2.0 pb depending on the assumed mediator mass. Upper limits are also set on the pair-production cross-section for new heavy down-type quarks; a lower limit of 450 GeV is set at 95% confidence level on the mass of heavy down-type quarks under the assumption that they decay 100% of the time to Wt.

Cross sections are measured differentially in terms of Δη<sup>F</sup>, the larger of the pseudorapidity regions extending to the limits of the ATLAS sensitivity, at η = ±4.9, in which no final state particles are produced above a transverse momentum threshold p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf>. The measurements span the region 0 < Δη<sup>F</sup> < 8 for 200 MeV < p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf> < 800 MeV. At small Δη<sup>F</sup>, the data test the reliability of hadronisation models in describing rapidity and transverse momentum fluctuations in final state particle production. The measurements at larger gap sizes are dominated by contributions from the single diffractive dissociation process (pp →Xp), enhanced by double dissociation (pp → XY) where the invariant mass of the lighter of the two dissociation systems satisfies M<inf>Y</inf> < 7 GeV. The resulting cross section is dσ/dΔη<sup>F</sup> ≈1 mb for Δη<sup>F</sup> > 3. The large rapidity gap data are used to constrain the value of the Pomeron intercept appropriate to triple Regge models of soft diffraction. The cross section integrated over all gap sizes is compared with other LHC inelastic cross section measurements.

The observed distributions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and multiplicity are corrected to hadron level in a model-independent way within well-defined phase-space regions. The distribution of the production ratio of Λ̄ to Λ baryons is also measured. The results are compared with various Monte Carlo simulation models. Although most of these models agree with data to within 15% in the KS0 distributions, substantial disagreements are found in the Λ distributions of transverse momentum. © 2012 CERN.

84863116044	A study of the material in the ATLAS inner detector using secondary hadronic interactions	The ATLAS inner detector is used to reconstruct secondary vertices due to hadronic interactions of primary collision products, so probing the location and amount of material in the inner region of ATLAS. Data collected in 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC, with a minimum bias trigger, are used for comparisons with simulated events. The reconstructed secondary vertices have spatial resolutions ranging from ∼ 200μm to 1 mm. The overall material description in the simulation is validated to within an experimental uncertainty of about 7%. This will lead to a better understanding of the reconstruction of various objects such as tracks, leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum. © 2012 CERN.

84864420747	Measurement of the charge asymmetry in top quark pair production in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector	A measurement of the top-antitop production charge asymmetry AC is presented using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb<sup>−1</sup> of pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events are selected with a single lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum and at least four jets of which at least one jet is identified as coming from a b-quark. A kinematic fit is used to reconstruct the tt event topology. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The measured value of AC is AC =−0.019±0.028 (stat.)±0.024 (syst.), consistent with the prediction from the MC@NLO Monte Carlo generator of AC = 0.006±0.002. Measurements of AC in two ranges of invariant mass of the top-antitop pair are also shown.

84864454564	Measurement of tt production with a veto on additional central jet activity in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector	A measurement of the jet activity in tt events produced in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented, using 2.05 fb<sup>-1</sup> of integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The tt events are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two identified b-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central rapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto is presented as a function of this threshold for four different central rapidity interval definitions. An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each rapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are corrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models implemented in MC@NLO, POWHEG, ALPGEN and SHERPA. The experimental uncertainties are often smaller than the spread of theoretical predictions, allowing deviations between data and theory to be observed in some regions of phase space.

No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Excluded mass regions for Majorana and Dirac neutrinos are presented using two approaches for interactions that violate lepton and lepton-flavor numbers. One approach uses an effective operator framework, the other approach is guided by the Left– Right Symmetric Model. The results described in this letter represent the most stringent limits to date on the masses of heavy neutrinos and W<inf>R</inf> bosons obtained in direct searches.

0037086691	A two-color heterodyne interferometer for measuring the refractive index of air using an optical diffraction grating	A new two-color heterodyne interferometer using an optical grating was proposed for measuring the refractive index of air. The heterodyne modulation is realized by moving the diffraction grating. The method allows us to measure the refractive index with high accuracy by using a 1.06 μm YAG laser and its second-harmonic wave because two beams (the fundamental and the second-harmonic wave) are in common path completely. Moreover, good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be obtained by the heterodyne interference. Using the refractive index calculated by Edlén's equation as a reference, that measured by present method was experimentally evaluated having an accuracy of about 1 ×10

In addition, jet-like structure in the events is studied by means of azimuthal distributions of charged particles relative to the charged particle with highest transverse momentum in a selected kinematic region of the event. The results are compared with predictions from tunes of the PYTHIA and HERWIG++ Monte Carlo generators, which in most cases are found to provide a reasonable description of the data.

84876441033	Jet energy measurement with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at √s =7 TeV	The jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb<sup>−1</sup>. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R = 0.4 or R = 0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta pT ≥ 20 GeV and pseudorapidities |η| < 4.5. The jet energy systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations. The jet energy uncertainty is less than 2.5 % in the central calorimeter region (|η| < 0.8) for jets with 60 ≤ pT < 800 GeV, and is maximally 14 % for pT < 30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2 ≤ |η| < 4.5. The jet energy is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon pT, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-pT jets recoiling against a high-pT jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, aiming for an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The systematic uncertainty of the jet energy determined from a combination of in situ techniques is consistent with the one derived from single hadron response measurements over a wide kinematic range. The nominal corrections and uncertainties are derived for isolated jets in an inclusive sample of high-pT jets. Special cases such as event topologies with close-by jets, or selections of samples with an enhanced content of jets originating from light quarks, heavy quarks or gluons are also discussed and the corresponding uncertainties are determined.

84876442054	Performance of the ATLAS trigger system in 2010	Proton-proton collisions at √S = 7 TeV and heavy ion collisions at √SNN = 2.76 TeV were produced by the LHC and recorded using the ATLAS experiment's trigger system in 2010. The LHC is designed with a maximum bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz and the ATLAS trigger system is designed to record approximately 200 of these per second. The trigger system selects events by rapidly identifying signatures of muon, electron, photon, tau lepton, jet, and B meson candidates, as well as using global event signatures, such as missing transverse energy. An overview of the ATLAS trigger system, the evolution of the system during 2010 and the performance of the trigger system components and selections based on the 2010 collision data are shown. A brief outline of plans for the trigger system in 2011 is presented.

84876447844	Single hadron response measurement and calorimeter jet energy scale uncertainty with the ATLAS detector at the LHC	The uncertainty on the calorimeter energy response to jets of particles is derived for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). First, the calorimeter response to single isolated charged hadrons is measured and compared to the Monte Carlo simulation using proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of √s = 900 GeV and 7 TeV collected during 2009 and 2010. Then, using the decay of K<inf>s</inf> and Λ particles, the calorimeter response to specific types of particles (positively and negatively charged pions, protons, and anti-protons) is measured and compared to the Monte Carlo predictions. Finally, the jet energy scale uncertainty is determined by propagating the response uncertainty for single charged and neutral particles to jets. The response uncertainty is 2–5 % for central isolated hadrons and 1–3 % for the final calorimeter jet energy scale.

The data are selected from events collected from pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV by the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb<sup>-1</sup>. The spectra in dilepton invariant mass, missing transverse momentum and jet multiplicity are presented and compared to Standard Model predictions. In this event sample, no evidence is found for contributions beyond those of the Standard Model. Limits are set on the cross-section in a fiducial region for new sources of same-sign high-mass dilepton events in the ee, eμ and μμ channels. Four models predicting same-sign dilepton signals are constrained: two descriptions of Majorana neutrinos, a cascade topology similar to supersymmetry or universal extra dimensions, and fourth generation d-type quarks. Assuming a new physics scale of 1 TeV, Majorana neutrinos produced by an effective operator V with masses below 460 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. A lower limit of 290 GeV is set at 95% confidence level on the mass of fourth generation d-type quarks. Copyright CERN.

84884306084	Luminosity determination in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the LHC	Measurements of luminosity obtained using the ATLAS detector during early running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at √s = 7 TeV are presented. The luminosity is independently determined using several detectors and multiple algorithms, each having different acceptances, systematic uncertainties and sensitivity to background. The ratios of the luminosities obtained from these methods are monitored as a function of time and of μ, the average number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. Residual time- and μ-dependence between the methods is less than 2% for 0 < μ < 2.5. Absolute luminosity calibrations, performed using beam separation scans, have a common systematic uncertainty of ±11%, dominated by the measurement of the LHC beam currents. After calibration, the luminosities obtained from the different methods differ by at most ±2%. The visible cross sections measured using the beam scans are compared to predictions obtained with the PYTHIA and PHOJET event generators and the ATLAS detector simulation. © CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2011.
