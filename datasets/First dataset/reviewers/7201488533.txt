1842738179	Local self-organization of islands in embedded nanodot systems	The strain distribution on the surface of an isotropic spacer layer induced by an embedded island of large base-to-height aspect ratio which deviates significantly from the description of the point force dipole model was analyzed. The strain profile displayed several local maxima above the embedded island, in the regime of small spacer layer thickness. As the base of the embedded island, positions of the strain maximums exhibited the same symmetry and orientation. It was shown that the regions with local strain maxima serve as nucleation centers for growth of surface islands under appropriate growth conditions, resulting in locally well-organized surface islands above the embedded island.

0007783347	Universal level-spacing statistics in quasiperiodic tight-binding models	We studied statistical properties of the energy spectra of two-dimensional quasiperiodic tight-binding models. The multifractal nature of the eigenstates of these models is corroborated by the scaling of the participation numbers with the system size. Hence one might have expected `critical' or `intermediate' statistics for the level-spacing distributions as observed at the metal-insulator transition in the three-dimensional Anderson model of disorder. However, our numerical results are in perfect agreement with the universal level-spacing distributions of the Gaussian orthogonal random matrix ensemble, including the distribution of spacings between second, third, and fourth neighbour energy levels.

31544473805	Localization/quasi-delocalization transitions and quasi-mobility-edges in shell-doped nanowires	We propose a novel concept, namely, shell-doping of nanowires, for control of carrier mobility in nanowires. Different from traditional doping, where dopant atoms are distributed uniformly inside nanowires, shell-doping spatially confines dopant atoms within a few atomic layers in the shell region of a nanowire. Our numerical results based on the Anderson model of electronic disorder show that electrons in a shell-doped nanowire exhibit a peculiar behavior very different from that of uniformly doped nanowires. Beyond some critical doping, electron dynamics in a shell-doped nanowire undergoes a localization/quasi-delocalization transition, namely, the electron diffusion length decreases in the regime of weak disorder but increases in the regime of strong disorder. This transition is a result of the existence of quasi-mobility-edges in the energy pectrum of the system, which can be exploited experimentally through control of electron concentration, carrier density, and degree of disorder. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that while the global biological networks evaluated belong to GOE, removal of interactions between constituents transitions the networks to systems of isolated modules described by the Poisson distribution. Our results indicate that although biological networks are very different from other complex systems at the molecular level, they display the same statistical properties at network scale.

33846060685	Small Si clusters on surfaces of carbon nanotubes	Structures of small Si clusters, Sin, on surfaces of carbon nanotubes have been studied by molecular dynamics simulation. We show that the lowest-energy structures of Sin are three-dimensional clusters rather than thin Si sheets covering the surface of a nanotube. As n increases from 10 to 30, Sin undergoes structural transitions from a tentlike structure (with nanotube surface as its base) to a cagelike structure (without interior atoms) and further to a spherical compact structure (with interior atoms). Our results are different from the structures of small Si clusters found in a free space without Si-nanotube interaction. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

33846530564	Persistent mobility edges and anomalous quantum diffusion in order-disorder separated quantum films	A concept of order-disorder separated quantum films is proposed for the design of ultrathin quantum films of a few atomic layers thick with unconventional transport properties. The concept is demonstrated through studying an atomic bilayer comprised of an ordered layer and a disordered layer. Without the disordered layer or the ordered layer, the system is a conducting two-dimensional (2D) crystal or an insulating disordered 2D electron system. Without the order-disorder phase separation, a disordered bilayer is insulating under large disorder. In an order-disorder separated atomic bilayer, however, we show that the system behaves remarkably different from conventional ordered or disordered electron systems, exhibiting metal-insulator transitions with persistent mobility edges and superdiffusive anomalous quantum diffusion. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33947525532	Molecular dynamics simulation of formation of silicon nanoparticles on surfaces of carbon nanotubes	In this paper, we have studied the formation of silicon nanoparticles on surfaces of carbon nanotubes by molecular dynamics simulation. We found that, due to the Si-nanotube interaction and the enormous curvatures of carbon nanotubes, Si atoms on the surface of a carbon nanotube prefer to form a three-dimensional nanoparticle rather than a thin film covering the nanotube. Small Si nanoparticles have similar atomic structures as are found in Si nanoparticles grown without any substrate. Large Si nanoparticles are elongated in the axial direction of the nanotube and have amorphous network structures of Si, different from the crystalline structure of Si nanoparticles without considering Si-nanotube interaction.

We found that the traditional critical Lindemann parameter for the melting of bulk crystals is not valid for SWNTs. Using the much smaller critical Lindemann parameter for the melting of nanoparticles as a criterion, we show that the melting temperature of perfect SWNTs is around 4800 K. We further show that Stone-Wales defects in a SWNT significantly reduce the melting temperature of atoms around the defects, resulting in the premelting of SWNTs at 2600 K. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

0033185097	Energy levels of quasiperiodic Hamiltonians, spectral unfolding, and random matrix theory	We consider a tight-binding Hamiltonian defined on the quasiperiodic Ammann-Beenker tiling. Although the density of states (DOS) is rather spiky, the integrated DOS (IDOS) is quite smooth and can be used to perform spectral unfolding. The effect of unfolding on the integrated level-spacing distribution is investigated for various parts of the spectrum which show different behaviour of the DOS. For energy intervals with approximately constant DOS, we find good agreement with the distribution of the Gaussian orthogonal random matrix ensemble (GOE) even without unfolding. For energy ranges with fluctuating DOS, we observe deviations from the GOE result. After unfolding, we always recover the GOE distribution.

38549168494	Constructing gene co-expression networks and predicting functions of unknown genes by random matrix theory	Background: Large-scale sequencing of entire genomes has ushered in a new age in biology. One of the next grand challenges is to dissect the cellular networks consisting of many individual functional modules. Defining co-expression networks without ambiguity based on genome-wide microarray data is difficult and current methods are not robust and consistent with different data sets. This is particularly problematic for little understood organisms since not much existing biological knowledge can be exploited for determining the threshold to differentiate true correlation from random noise. Random matrix theory (RMT), which has been widely and successfully used in physics, is a powerful approach to distinguish system-specific, non-random properties embedded in complex systems from random noise. Here, we have hypothesized that the universal predictions of RMT are also applicable to biological systems and the correlation threshold can be determined by characterizing the correlation matrix of microarray profiles using random matrix theory. Results: Application of random matrix theory to microarray data of S. oneidensis, E. coli, yeast, A. thaliana, Drosophila, mouse and human indicates that there is a sharp transition of nearest neighbour spacing distribution (NNSD) of correlation matrix after gradually removing certain elements insider the matrix. Testing on an in silico modular model has demonstrated that this transition can be used to determine the correlation threshold for revealing modular co-expression networks. The co-expression network derived from yeast cell cycling microarray data is supported by gene annotation. The topological properties of the resulting co-expression network agree well with the general properties of biological networks. Computational evaluations have showed that RMT approach is sensitive and robust. Furthermore, evaluation on sampled expression data of an in silico modular gene system has showed that under-sampled expressions do not affect the recovery of gene co-expression network. Moreover, the cellular roles of 215 functionally unknown genes from yeast, E. coli and S. oneidensis are predicted by the gene co-expression networks using guilt-by-association principle, many of which are supported by existing information or our experimental verification, further demonstrating the reliability of this approach for gene function prediction. Conclusion: Our rigorous analysis of gene expression microarray profiles using RMT has showed that the transition of NNSD of correlation matrix of microarray profile provides a profound theoretical criterion to determine the correlation threshold for identifying gene co-expression networks. © 2007 Luo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

34247854786	Surface reconstruction and core distortion of silicon and germanium nanowires	We report the results of molecular dynamics simulations for structures of pristine silicon nanowires and germanium nanowires with bulk cores oriented along the [110] direction and bounded by the (100) and (110) surfaces in the lateral direction. We found that the (100) surfaces for both silicon and germanium nanowires undergo 2 × 1 dimerization while their (110) surfaces do not show reconstruction. The direction of the dimer rows is either parallel or perpendicular to the wire axis depending on the orientation of the surface dangling bonds. The dimer length for Si is in good agreement with the result obtained by first-principles calculations. However, the geometry of Si dimers belongs to the symmetrical 2 × 1 reconstruction rather than the asymmetrical buckled dimers. We also show that surface reconstruction of a small nanowire induces significant change in the lattice spacing for the atoms not on the (100) surface, resulting in severe structural distortion of the core of the nanowire. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

Effects of annealing temperature and coverage of carbon atoms on the formation of graphene have been investigated. We found that two layers of carbon atoms of the 6H-SiC (0001) subsurface after sublimation of Si atoms undergo a transformation from a diamondlike phase to a graphenelike structure at annealing temperature above 1500 K. This transformation temperature is in good agreement with experimental observations. We also found that the formation of graphene structure strongly depends on the number of carbon layers. Two layers of carbon atoms result in large graphene clusters and four layers of carbon lead to the formation of graphene bilayer sheets. However, a single layer of carbon only forms chainlike and ringlike clusters without the hexagonal ordering. Our results provide atomic-level information about the graphitization of the 6H-SiC (0001) surface, which is useful in controlling the growth of graphene sheets. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

84861554058	Work functions of boron nitride nanoribbons: First-principles study	Using first-principles method, we study the work functions and effective work functions of boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) with and without hydrogen decoration. Zigzag BNNRs (ZBNNRs) are typical non-symmetric systems and their work functions and effective work functions are difficult to be determined based on the supercell method due to the gradient potential distribution in the vacuum region. Dipole and potential correction (DPC) are adopted in our present work. By using DPC, we first show that when the tips of SWBNNT(8, 0) (also typical non-symmetric system) are terminated by hydrogen, the work function decreases at the N tip but increases at the B tip. The work functions and effective work functions of the BNNRs with different hydrogen decoration are calculated using the same mehod. We find that the N edge of the full-hydrogen adsorbed ZBNNR (FH-ZBNNR) is a promising field emission candidate due to its low work functions and effective work functions. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

84877751640	Atomic structure and electronic properties of folded graphene nanoribbons: A first-principles study	Folded graphene nanoribbons (FGNRs) have attracted great attentions because of extraordinary properties and potential applications. The atomic structure, stacking sequences, and electronic structure of FGNRs are investigated by first-principle calculations. It reveals that the common configurations of all FGNRs are racket-like structures including a nanotube-like edge and two flat nanoribbons. Interestingly, the two flat nanoribbons form new stacking styles instead of the most stable AB-stacking sequences for flat zone. The final configurations of FGNRs are greatly affected by the initial interlayer distance, stacking sequences, and edge styles. The stability of folded graphene nanoribbon depends on the length, and it can only be thermodynamically stable when it reaches the critical length. The band gap of the folded zigzag graphene nanoribbons becomes about 0.17 eV, which provides a new way to open the band gap. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

By using the Honeycutt and Andersen index (HA index), bond order parameters (BOP) and pair correlation function (PCF), we found that a BCC to defective icosahedra phase transition occurs in the FeCo nanoparticle when Co composition is increased to about 60 at . In the FeNi nanoparticle, three phases have been identified, namely, the BCC phase, the mixed BCC/FCC phase, and the multilayer defective icosahedral phase, which correspond to the Ni compositions of 0-20 at , 20-70 at , and 70-100 at , respectively.

41849124219	Density functional calculation of transition metal adatom adsorption on graphene	The functionalization of graphene (a single graphite layer) by the addition of transition metal atoms of Mn, Fe and Co to its surface has been investigated computationally using density functional theory. In the calculation, the graphene surface supercell was constructed from a single layer of graphite (0001) surface separated by vertical vacuum layers 2 nm thick. We found that the center of the hexagonal ring formed by carbon from graphene is the most stable site for Mn, Fe, Co to stay after optimization. The calculated spin-polarized band structures of the graphene encapsulating the Mn adatom indicate that the conduction bands are modified and move down due to the coupling between the Mn atom and graphene. For Fe adsorbed on the graphene surface, it is semi-half-metallic, and the spin polarization P is found to be 100%. The system of Co adatom on graphene exhibits metallic electronic structure due to the density of states (DOS) peak at the band center with both majority and minority spins. Local density of states analyses indicate a larger promotion of 4s electrons into the 3d state in Fe and Co, resulting in lower local moments compared to an Mn adatom on the graphite surface. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

We further show that premelting occurs in the regions close to the defects with premelting temperatures of 2600 K for the Stone-Wales defect and 3200 K for the cavity defect. The SWNTs with Si impurity defects are thermally stable up to 3800 K.

At T ≥ 3900 K, carbon atoms on the edges of graphene ribbons are gradually replaced by Si atoms. For the graphene ribbons with armchair edges, existence of multiple adsorption sites does not allow growth of chain-like Si nanostructures.

Our results show that the gold nanowire encapsulated in a (8, 8) SWCNT has a cylindrical shape and a helical shell structure. The helical-shell nanowire is thermally stable at temperatures much higher than the melting temperature of its bulk counterpart and is different from the gold nanowire formed in free space without the nanotube envelope. We also found that the spiral nanowire undergoes structural changes at higher temperatures.

In the vicinity of the Fermi level, the electron transmissions from the vertical graphene nanoribbon (GNR) to the two ends of the horizontal GNR are highly asymmetric. The electrons mostly transmit to one horizontal arm while are blocked by the other one. It is originated from the local asymmetric couplings between the intersection of the junction and the two horizontal arms. The asymmetric transport is very robust, even the T-shaped junction has a large size. Thus the asymmetric TGNR can be served as important components of nanocircuits. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

The resonant transmission via the quantum bound state is very sensitive to the size of the junction. The number and also the lifetimes of the quasibound states increase with the size of the Z-shaped junction. Long lifetime bound states which do not induce obvious resonant peaks exist in the junction with a wider or longer zigzag edged GNR.

56349119488	Tunable bandgap structures of two-dimensional boron nitride	Electronic structures of two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h -BN) with different planar strain distributions have been studied using the first principles methods. We found that the 2D h -BN without strain has a large direct bandgap and its bandgap structure strongly depends on the strength and direction of the strain. The bandgap width can be reduced significantly under both symmetrical and asymmetrical strain distributions. Moreover, the bandgap feature exhibits strong anisotropic behaviors. The bandgap remains direct under large symmetrical tensile strain or asymmetrical tensile strain perpendicular to B-N bonds. However, a small amount of symmetrical compressive strain larger than 1.5% or asymmetrical tensile strain parallel to B-N bonds larger than 1.2% turns the direct bandgap into indirect. Our results indicate that optical and electronic transport properties of 2D h -BN can be effectively tuned by applying different planar forces, offering a unique route for designing nanoscale tunable ultrathin optoelectronic devices only one atomic layer thick. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

From the analysis of atomic configurations, two different types of rippled structures in GNRs can be identified, namely, the periodic rippled structure at room temperature or even at lower temperatures and random ripples at high temperatures. The dependence of microscopic roughness of the ripples on temperature and size are studied through analyzing the covalent bonding inhomogeneities in bond-length and bond-angle distributions.

67349244322	The effect of corner form on electron transport of L-shaped graphene nanoribbons	We study transport properties of two L-shaped graphene nanoribbons (LGNRs) with different corner deformation. It is found that the corner geometry of the L-shaped junction has enormous influence on the electron transport around the Fermi energy. As a triangle graphene flake is added to the inside corner of a metallic right-angle LGNR, a gap appears in the conductance, i.e., the properties of the LGNR transform from metallic to semiconducting. However, as a triangle graphene flake is cut from the deformed semiconducting LGNR, resonant peaks via quasi-bound states exist in the original gap of conductance. The LGNR with deformed inside and outside corners is equivalent to a resonant-tunneling transistor. The quasi-bound states inducing the resonant transmission are confined in the L-shaped junction and strongly dependent on the size of the corner. Thus one can tune the transport properties of LGNR by the structural geometry and size. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The simulation results show that the Stone-Wales defect in the surface wall of a multi-wall carbon nanotube vibrates violently, which causes C-C bond breaking and evaporation of atoms along the circumferential directions of the nanotube.

As for SWCNT(10,0), the gold atoms in the composite contacts behave as n-type dopant and depress the Schottky barrier between SWCNT(10,0) and the gold electrode. Moreover, the negative differential resistance characteristics occurs in the devices constructed by gold-SWCNT(10,0) composite contacts. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

78249288127	Electronic properties of disordered bilayer graphene	Based on the Anderson tight-binding model, the electronic properties of disordered bilayer graphene are investigated. Our numerical results show that electrons in bilayer graphene with monolayer disorder (MDBG) exhibit a peculiar behavior that is quite different from that in bilayer graphene with bilayer disorder (BDBG). With the increase of disorder, BDBG becomes an insulating disordered two-dimensional (2D) electron system. In the case of monolayer disorder, however, the energy spectrum has strongly localized tail states and a stable extended central state separated by persistent mobility edges which are independent of the disorder strength. This indicates that a metalinsulator transition occurs in the monolayer disorder structure. This is similar to the case in an orderdisorder separated quantum film. The results could offer useful information for understanding and manipulating the electronic properties of disordered bilayer graphene. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

78349267636	Thermal transport of isotopic-superlattice graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edge	Thermal transport properties of isotopic-superlattice graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edge (IS-ZGNRs) are investigated. We find that by isotopic superlattice modulation the thermal conductivity of a graphene nanoribbon can be reduced significantly. The thermal transport property of the IS-ZGNRs strongly depends on the superlattice period length and the isotopic mass. As the superlattice period length decreases, the thermal conductivity undergoes a transition from decreasing to increasing. This unique phenomenon is explained by analyzing the phonon transmission coefficient. While the effect of isotopic mass on the conductivity is monotone. Larger mass difference induces smaller thermal conductivity. In addition, the influence of the geometry size is also discussed. The results indicate that isotopic superlattice modulation offers an available way for improving the thermoelectric performance of graphene nanoribbons. Copyright © 2009 EPLA.

78649383842	Strain effect on transport properties of hexagonal boron-nitride nanoribbons	The transport properties of hexagonal boron-nitride nanoribbons under the uniaxial strain are investigated by the Green's function method. We find that the transport properties of armchair boron-nitride nanoribbon strongly depend on the strain. In particular, the features of the conductance steps such as position and width are significantly changed by strain. As a strong tensile strain is exerted on the nanoribbon, the highest conductance step disappears and subsequently a dip emerges instead. The energy band structure and the local current density of armchair boron-nitride nanoribbon under strain are calculated and analysed in detail to explain these characteristics. In addition, the effect of strain on the conductance of zigzag boron-nitride nanoribbon is weaker than that of armchair boron nitride nanoribbon. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

It is found that these two kinds of nanoparticles possess a new stable quasicore-shell structure, no matter whether they are in molten or condensed state and whether they are prepared by annealing or quenching. In FeCo (FeNi) nanoparticles of various sizes and atom compositions, the quasicore-shell structure is always preferred, with the shell formed only by Fe atoms and the core formed by randomly distributed Co(Ni) and Fe atoms. We have also investigated the formation mechanism of the quasicore-shell structure by energy difference analysis of the pure and doped icosahedra structure of FeCo and FeNi nanoparticles. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

78650865651	Electron transport in graphene nanoribbons under a central potential modulation	We study electron transport in graphene nanoribbons (GNs) under a one-dimensional central potential. Two kinds of structures are considered: armchair-edged GN (AGN) where a central potential is applied on the central dimer chain, and zigzag-edged GN (ZGN) where a potential is applied on the central zigzag chain. Both nanoribbons show unique electronic structure and interesting transport properties under potential modulation. Without considering edge effect, a metallic AGN is still metallic after potential modulation. However, if the edge effect is considered, an AGN under potential modulation can be either semiconducting or metallic depending on the potential strength. The AGN transits from semiconducting to metallic and then to semiconducting again with the potential increase. As to ZGN, the potential on the central zigzag chain also greatly affect the quantum conductance. A ZGN will transit from metallic to semiconducting as the potential strength exceeds critical value. All transitions of AGN and ZGN are correlated with the localized state on the central potential chain which induces a quantum channel along the chain. © 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

78651331042	Resonant splitting of phonon transport in periodic T-shaped graphene nanoribbons	By using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we study the phonon transport properties in periodic T-shaped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). An interesting resonant phenomenon is found in the phonon transmission of the out-of-plane mode. When the T-shaped GNR includes n constrictions, there are (n-1)-fold resonant splitting peaks in the low-frequency region of the transmission spectrum. The peaks are induced by low quasibound states in which phonons are intensively localized in the stubs. While (n-2)-fold resonant splitting rule occurs at frequency slightly higher than the first threshold frequency. These resonant peaks are originated from high quasibound states in which phonons are mainly localized in the constrictions. To the high quasibound states the constriction acts as a potential well rather than a potential barrier, which is the inverse of the case of the low quasibound states. These resonant splitting peaks in the spectrum of the out-of-plane mode can also be found in the total transmission. Copyright © 2010 EPLA.

78651298532	Ballistic thermal rectification in asymmetric three-terminal graphene nanojunctions	Graphene nanojunctions (GNJs) are important components of future nanodevices and nanocircuits. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we investigate the phononic properties of three-terminal GNJs (TGNJs). The results show that the heat flux runs preferentially along the direction from narrow to wide terminals, presenting an evident ballistic thermal rectification effect in the asymmetric TGNJs. The rectification efficiency is strongly dependent on the asymmetry of the nanojunctions, which increases rapidly with the width discrepancy between the left and right terminals. Meanwhile, the corner form of the TGNJs also plays an important role in the rectification effect. The mechanism of this thermal rectification is explained by a qualitative analysis. Compared to previous thermal rectifiers based on other materials, the asymmetric nanojunctions based on graphene possess much high rectification ratio which can approach about 200%. These indicate that asymmetric TGNJs might be a promising candidate for excellent ballistic thermal (phononic) devices. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

Both [0 1 1̄] and [1̄ 1 1] adsorption orientations of Si(2 1 1) surface are considered. We find that the adsorption energy is determined not only by the edge states of GNRs, but also by the ribbon width and the orientation of the substrate. Bridge and M-shape adsorption configurations appear gradually as the ribbon width increases. The substrate effectively affects the edge states of GNRs and tends to depress the metallic nature of zigzag GNRs (Z-GNRs) and metallize the armchair GNRs (A-GNRs). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79951516250	Effect of triangle vacancy on thermal transport in boron nitride nanoribbons	Recently, triangle vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride is observed experimentally. Using nonequilibrium Green's function method, we investigate thermal transport properties of boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) with a triangle vacancy. The effect of triangle vacancy on the phonon transmission of zigzag-edged BNNRs (Z-BNNRs) is different from that of armchair-edged BNNRs (A-BNNRs). The triangle vacancy induces antiresonant dips in the spectrum of Z-BNNRs. Moreover, the boron-terminated triangle vacancy causes antiresonant zero-transmission dip and the number of the zero-transmission dip increases with the geometrical size of triangle vacancy. For the A-BNNRs with triangle vacancy, except some antiresonant dips, a resonant peak is found in the transmission. The antiresonant and resonant phenomena are explained by analyzing local density of states and local thermal currents. Although the antiresonant dip and the resonant peak are both originated from quasibound states, their distributions of local thermal currents are distinct, which leads to the transport discrepancy. In addition, the thermal conductance of BNNRs decreases linearly with increasing the vacancy size. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79952527168	Thermal transport in L-shaped graphene nano-junctions	By using nonequilibrium Green's function method, the thermal transport properties of L-shaped graphene nano-junctions consisting of a semi-infinite armchair-edged nanoribbon and a semi-infinite zigzag-edged nanoribbon were studied. It is shown that the thermal conductance of the L-shaped graphene nano-junctions depends on the included angles and the widths of the graphene nanoribbons. As the angle of L-shaped graphene nano-junctions increases from 30° to 90° and further to 150°, the thermal conductance obviously increases. For the right-angle L-shape graphene nano-junction, the thermal conductance undergoes a transition with the increasing of the widths of the armchair nanoribbons. The thermal conductance decreases at low temperature region and increases at high temperature region. Meanwhile the thermal conductance of L-shape graphene nano-junction with included angle 150° decreases by increasing the widths of zigzag-edged nanoribbons in both low and high temperature regions. These thermal transport phenomena can be reasonably explained by analyzing the phonon transmission coefficient. We illustrate the mechanisms of thermal transport for different L-shaped graphene nano-junctions. The results provide significant physical models and theoretical basis for designing the thermal devices based on the graphene nano-junctions. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society.

The formation energy of a single layer stacking fault in five typical stacking h-BN (AA, AB, AD, AE and AF) ranges from -58 to 55 meV, which indicates that the stacking fault can be easily introduced into the material. Amazingly, we find that as long as AA, AB, AD and AF stacking h-BN with AE-liked stacking fault they are similar to AE stacking with or without stacking fault behaving as quasi-direct or direct semiconductor. We predict that the AE-liked stacking sequence may be the primary reason for the inconsistency between theoretical and experimental reports according to the type of the band gap of h-BN. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The TMR ratio increases linearly with the increasing uniaxial strain because the increasing uniaxial strain reduces the bandgap of bilayer hexagonal boron nitride gradually. Interestingly, the TMR ratio exceeds 95% when the uniaxial strain increases to 2.51%, which is close to that of the perfect spin filter. Our results indicate that the bilayer hexagonal boron nitride is a promising candidate for the spacer of MTJs. Moreover, its TMR ratio can be linearly modulated by external uniaxial strain. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

79955587605	Surface potentials of few-layer graphene films in high vacuum and ambient conditions	The surface potentials of few-layer graphene (FLG) films in high vacuum and ambient conditions have been investigated by employing electrostatic force microscopy. It is found that the surface potential of FLG films in ambient air has a constant large depression compared to that measured in a high vacuum. Our experimental results indicate that the shift is most likely caused by the presence of ambient adsorbates on the outmost graphene surfaces. The surface potentials increase with the number of graphene layers and approach the bulk value for five or more graphene layers in high vacuum as well as in ambient air. Since the contribution of the surface adsorbates is a constant value, we further show that the thickness dependence of the surface potential can be sufficiently explained by the nonlinear ThomasFermi Theory in both conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79956151468	Spin-polarized transport properties of Fe atomic chain adsorbed on zigzag graphene nanoribbons	The spin-polarized transport properties of Fe atomic chain adsorbed on zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) are investigated using the density-functional theory in combination with the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We find that the Fe chain has drastic effects on spin-polarized transport properties of ZGNRs compared with a single Fe atom adsorbed on the ZGNRs. When the Fe chain is adsorbed on the centre of the ZGNR, the original semiconductor transforms into metal, showing a very wide range of spin-polarized transport. Particularly, the spin polarization around the Fermi level is up to 100%. This is because the adsorbed Fe chain not only induces many localized states but also has effects on the edge states of ZGNR, which can effectively modulate the spin-polarized transports. The spin polarization of ZGNRs is sensitive to the adsorption site of the Fe chain. When the Fe chain is adsorbed on the edge of ZGNR, the spin degeneracy of conductance is completely broken. The spin polarization is found to be more pronounced because the edge state of one edge is destroyed by the additional Fe chain. These results have direct implications for the control of the spin-dependent conductance in ZGNRs with the adsorption of Fe chains. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

0036531423	Novel formation and decay mechanisms of nanostructures on surface	For decades research on thin-film growth has attracted a lot of attention as these kinds of materials have the potential in new generation device application. It is known that the nuclei at initial stage of the islands are more stable than others and certain atoms are inert while others are active. In this paper, we will show that, when a surfactant layer is used to mediate the growth, a counter-intuitive fractal-to-compact island shape transition can be induced by increasing deposition flux or decreasing growth temperature. Specifically, we introduce a reaction-limited aggregation (RLA) theory, where the physical process controlling the island shape transition is the shielding effect of adatoms stuck to stable islands on incoming adatoms. Also discussed are the origin of a transition from triangular to hexagonal then to inverted triangular and the decay characteristics of 3D islands on surface, and connections of our unique predictions with recent experiments. Furthermore, we will present a novel idea to make use of the condensation energy of adatoms to control the island evolution along special direction. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

79956360836	A tale of two mysteries in interstellar astrophysics: The 2175 Å extinction bump and diffuse interstellar bands	The diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are ubiquitous absorption spectral features arising from the tenuous material in the space between stars - the interstellar medium (ISM). Since their first detection nearly nine decades ago, over 400 DIBs have been observed in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range in both the Milky Way and external galaxies, both nearby and distant. However, the identity of the species responsible for these bands remains as one of the most enigmatic mysteries in astrophysics. An equally mysterious interstellar spectral signature is the 2175 Å extinction bump, the strongest absorption feature observed in the ISM. Its carrier also remains unclear since its first detection 46 years ago. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have long been proposed as a candidate for DIBs as their electronic transitions occur in the wavelength range where DIBs are often found. In recent years, the 2175 Å extinction bump is also often attributed to the π-π* transition in PAHs. If PAHs are indeed responsible for both the 2175 Å extinction feature and DIBs, their strengths may correlate. We perform an extensive literature search for lines of sight for which both the 2175 Å extinction feature and DIBs have been measured. Unfortunately, we found no correlation between the strength of the 2175 Å feature and the equivalent widths of the strongest DIBs. A possible explanation might be that DIBs are produced by small free gas-phase PAH molecules and ions, while the 2175 Å bump is mainly from large PAHs or PAH clusters in condensed phase so that there is no tight correlation between DIBs and the 2175 Å bump. © 2011.

We find that SWNTs with gold nanoclusters absorbed on their tips can build an excellent welding contact with gold electrodes. First, gold clusters are placed on open tips of SWNTs and are annealed at 1100 K. Gold atoms enter into the SWNTs and a shell-like helical structure inside the SWNTs and an amorphous structure outside of the SWNTs. Furthermore, the SWNTs absorbed with gold cluster are then placed on surfaces of gold electrodes. After annealing at high temperature, gold atoms absorbed in the SWNTs are redistributed on the surface of the gold electrodes and form excellent welding contact with the electrodes. The best annealing temperature for welding is about 800 K. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society.

The energy gap of graphene only opens at a large nitrogen doping content. For AGNRs, the energy gaps tend to decrease with the N Δ-doping, and an interesting transition from direct to indirect bandgap is observed. Moreover, the effects of N Δ-doping on energy gaps incline to decease with the reduction of the doping content.

Comparing topological approach, the RMT-based hierarchical clustering method is effective in representing not only the strong correlations between genes inside the modules (the modularity and independency of networks), but also the weak correlations between different modules (the hierarchy of networks). We show that missing expression values among microarray dataset should not be neglected, and different imputation methods result in different performances. We suggest LLS to estimate missing values for better performance in accuracy and stability. Based on the RMT, the random noises are separated from DLBCL gene expression data. We use normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) ratio method to identify a transition zone of NNSDs, and for DLBCL networks it is [0.71, 0.84]. © 2011 J. Chen, et al.

The gas molecules absorbed on the three-nitrogen vacancies lead to sharp resonant peaks on conductance, while those absorbed on the four-nitrogen vacancies lead to anti-resonant dips. Each kind of gas molecule can be detected by its own unique (different energy) resonant peaks (or dips).

It is found that each approach can reach a second energy minimum if exchanging the used methods during the geometrical relaxation. One corresponds to the relaxed lattice constant c = 2.560 Å, another corresponds to the relaxed lattice constant c = 2.450 Å, but they are in different energy order. For (2, 2) single walled carbon nanotube with lattice constant c = 2.560 Å, band structures obtained from two methods both indicate a small energy gap existing near the Fermi level. However, both pseudo-potential and all-electron calculations indicate the vanishing of energy gap in the case of lattice constant c = 2.45 Å.

The transmission coefficients around the Fermi level only slightly decrease when the bending angle further increases to 72.5°. Moreover, ZGNRs under the longitudinal strain show the same transmission conductance around the Fermi level as that of the flat one.

From an analysis of the atomic configurations, two types of microscopic corrugations are identified, namely periodic ripples at room temperature and random ripples at high temperature. Two different kinds of ripple morphologies, each with a periodic structure, occur in the monolayer graphene due to the existence of a coincidence lattice between graphene and the SiC terminated surface (Si- or C-terminated surface). The effect of temperature on microscopic ripple morphology is shown through analysing the roughness of the graphene. A temperature-dependent multiple bonding conjugation is also shown by the broad distribution of the carbon-carbon bond length and the bond angle in the rippled graphene on the SiC surface. These results provide atomic-level information about the rippled graphene layers on the two polar faces of the 6H - SiC substrate, which is useful not only for a better understanding of the stability and structural properties of graphene, but also for the study of the electronic properties of graphene-based devices. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

We investigate the thermal transport property of graphyne nanoribbons (GYNRs) by using the nonequilibrium Green's-function method. The thermal conductance of GYNRs is only approximately 40% that of graphene nanoribbons. A distinct width dependence of the thermal property is observed in GYNRs as well. The conductance of armchair-edged GYNRs (A-GYNRs) shows a linear width dependence, while a steplike width dependence is displayed in the conductance of zigzag-edged GYNRs (Z-GYNRs). Moreover, the conductance of an A-GYNR is larger than that of a Z-GYNR of the same width, indicating obvious anisotropic transport in graphyne (twice that in graphene). In addition, the thermal transport in graphyne family nanoribbons is also explored. The results show that the conductance of graphyne family nanoribbons is insensitive to the acetylenic linkages, but depends on the number of benzene rings. These findings could offer useful guidelines for the design and performance improvement of the graphyne-based nanodevices. © 2012 American Physical Society.

By using the Green's function method, we calculate the conductances of ZGNRs with two different stacked-type GFs. It is found that the coupling effect between ZGNRs and GFs can induce dips at the conductance profiles in two different stacked-types. For both stacked-types, the dips far away from the Fermi level are nearly overlapped. However, the position of conductance dip near the Fermi level depends on the stacked-type. In addition, we discuss the effect of geometric size of GF on the electronic transport property. The results show that with the increase of the size of GF, the dips far away the Fermi level in two stacked-types gradually move toward the Fermi level, while the discrepancy of the dips near the Fermi level is much evident. Our results indicate that the stacked GFs can effectively tune the electronic transport of ZGNR. © Chinese Physical Society.

The results show that, the damage of the bombardment on the graphene sheet depends not only on the incident energy but also on the particle flux density of Argon atoms. To compare and analyze the effect of the incident energy and the particle flux density in the Argon-atom bombardment, we defined the impact factor on graphene sheet by calculating the broken-hole area. The results indicate that, there is an exponential accumulated-damage for the impact of both the incident energy and the particle flux density and there is a critical incident energy ranging from 20-30 eV/atom in Argon-atom bombardment. Different configurations, such as sieve-like and circle-like graphene can be formed by controlling of different particle flux density as the incident energy is more than the critical value. Our results supply a feasible method on fabrication of porous graphene-based materials for gas-storages and molecular sieves, and it also helps to understand the damage mechanism of graphene-based electronic devices under high particle radiation.

84863350872	Transport properties of hybrid graphene/graphane nanoribbons	The transport properties of hybrid nanoribbons constructed by substituting zigzag graphane nanoribbons into zigzag graphene nanoribbons are investigated using the first-principles calculations and non-equilibrium Green's function. The transport properties of the hybrid systems are improved due to the appearance of transport platform with nontrivial conductance around the Fermi level. This enhancement attributes to the extra bands induced by the substituted graphane nanoribbons. Moreover, this enhancement is sensitive to the position and concentration of the substituted graphane nanoribbons in the system. Our results indicate that such hybrid system is an effective approach to modulate the transport properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84863362707	Dynamical behavior of the kink motion in carbon nanotubes	By performing molecular dynamics calculations, we studied the motion of the kink between two carbon nanotubes. Based on the sequential evaporation of the most energetic carbon atom, our calculations show that the kink has complex longitudinal and spiral motions, in good agreement with the experiments. The kink moves towards the nanotube of larger diameter, resulting in an overall diameter shrinking of the nanotubes without inducing any disorder or damage. The kink motions are found to be dependent on the chirality of the nanotubes. The kink connecting two zigzag nanotubes can have either a pseudoclimb or a spiral motion, while the kink between the armchair nanotubes has an interesting spiral motion with periodic split and recombination of the topological defects. © 2012 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84863478215	Growth mechanism of ring shaped nanostructures self-assembly upon droplet epitaxy	A quantitatively kinetic model has been established to address the self-assembly of the ring shaped nanostructures upon the droplet epitaxy via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The theoretical predictions about the temperature and As flux dependences of the self-assembly of the ring shaped nanostructures were in well agreement with recent experiments. It was found that the morphological evolution of the ring shaped nanostructures was attributed to the cooperation of the enhanced diffusion barriers of free Ga atoms in the inner ring region and the effects of the surface reconstruction around the Ga droplets during the arsenization step. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84863989606	New superhard carbon phases between graphite and diamond	Two new carbon allotropes (H-carbon and S-carbon) are proposed, as possible candidates for the intermediate superhard phases between graphite and diamond obtained in the process of cold compressing graphite, based on the results of first-principles calculations. Both H-carbon and S-carbon are more stable than previously proposed M-carbon and W-carbon and their bulk modulus are comparable to that of diamond. H-carbon is an indirect-band-gap semiconductor with a gap of 4.459 eV and S-carbon is a direct-band-gap semiconductor with a gap of 4.343 eV. The transition pressure from cold compressing graphite is 10.08 GPa and 5.93 GPa for H-carbon and S-carbon, respectively, which is in consistent with the recent experimental report. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84864208544	Z-BN: A novel superhard boron nitride phase	A superhard boron nitride phase dubbed as Z-BN is proposed as a possible intermediate phase between h-BN and zinc blende BN (c-BN), and investigated using first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory. Although the structure of Z-BN is similar to that of bct-BN containing four-eight BN rings, it is more energetically favorable than bct-BN. Our study reveals that Z-BN, with a considerable structural stability and high density comparable to c-BN, is a transparent insulator with an indirect band gap of about 5.27 eV. Amazingly, its Vickers hardness is 55.88 GPa which is comparable to that of c-BN. This new BN phase may be produced in experiments through cold compressing AB stacking h-BN due to its low transition pressure point of 3.3 GPa. © 2012 the Owner Societies.

84864590316	Enhanced thermoelectric properties in hybrid graphene/boron nitride nanoribbons	The thermoelectric properties of hybrid graphene/boron nitride nanoribbons (BCNNRs) are investigated using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach. We find that the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) can be remarkably enhanced by periodically embedding hexagonal BN (h-BN) into graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). Compared to pristine GNRs, the ZT for armchair-edged BCNNRs with width index 3p+2 is enhanced 10-20 times, while the ZT of nanoribbons with other widths is enhanced by just 1.5-3 times. As for zigzag-edge nanoribbons, the ZT is enhanced 2-3 times. This improvement comes from the combined increase in the Seebeck coefficient and the reduction in the thermal conductance outweighing the decrease in the electrical conductance. In addition, the effect of the component ratio of h-BN on the thermoelectric transport properties is discussed. These results qualify BCNNRs as a promising candidate for building outstanding thermoelectric devices. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84865058582	Transport properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons with oxygen edge decoration	Using the density functional theory in combination with the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we investigate the transport properties of zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with oxygen edge decoration (passivated by the ketone (CO) or ether (C-O-C), denoting as ZGNR-CO and ZGNR-C2O, respectively). We find that both ZGNR-CO and ZGNR-C2O induce the semiconductor-metal transition and enhance the transmission conductance within 'transparent' electrodes. However, sandwiched by Au (111) electrodes, AuZGNR - COAu enhances the transport properties while AuZGNR - C2OAu depresses the transport properties in comparison with AuZGNR - HAu. It is found that the transport properties of the edge oxidized ZGNRs within Au (111) electrodes depend on the electronic states around the Fermi level which determine the number of the effective transport channels. The states of AuZGNR - COAu are delocalized on the edge oxygen atoms as well as the inner edge carbon atoms, introducing extra transport channels. Moreover, in comparison with AuZGNR - HAu, the effective transport channels of AuZGNR - COAu increase at given applied bias. However, the states of AuZGNR - C2OAu are localized on the ribbon, blocking the effective transport channels. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84867168273	Electronic properties of disordered bilayer hexagonal boron nitride quantum films	Based on the Anderson tight-binding model, the electronic properties of disordered bilayer hexagonal boron nitride quantum films are investigated. Our numerical results show that the electrons in a disordered bilayer hexagonal boron nitride quantum film are localized, presenting an insulating property. However, for the monolayer disordered bilayer hexagonal boron nitride quantum film, the energy spectrum has persistent mobility edges which are independent of the disorder strength. This indicates that a metal-insulator transition occurs in the monolayer disorder structure. This is similar to the case in an order-disorder separated quantum film. The results could offer useful information for understanding and manipulating the electronic properties of bilayer hexagonal boron nitride quantum films. ©2012 Chinese Physical Society.

84867169291	Helicities and thermostabilities of Ni nanowires in the carbon nanotubes	Molecular dynamics calculations are performed to study the structures of armchair carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulating Ni nanowires and their helicities and thermal stabilities are discussed. It is found that Ni nanowires are of multiple helical tubular structure and each layer is composed of several Ni atom chains. Different layers of Ni nanowires have different helicities and the helicities of Ni nanowires in the inner layer are greater than those of the outer one. What is more, the helicity will be greatest when the number of the Ni atom chains is an integer multiple of three. As the increases of the diameters of the CNTs, the helicities of Ni nanowires change periodically. The structure and helicity only have tiny variations even at high temperature as the CNTs can protect the Ni nanowire. ©2012 Chinese Physical Society.

84867285103	Structure, stability, and motion of dislocations in double-wall carbon nanotubes	In this paper, a novel double-wall carbon nanotube (DWCNT) with both edge and screw dislocations is studied by using the molecular dynamics (MD) method. The differences between two adjacent tubule indexes of armchair and zigzag nanotubes are determined to be 5 and 9, respectively, by taking into account the symmetry, integrality, and thermal stability of the composite structures. It is found that melting first occurs near the dislocations, and the melting temperatures of the dislocated armchair and zigzag DWCNTs are around 2600 K - 2700 K. At the pre-melting temperatures, the shrink of the dislocation loop, which is comprised of edge and screw dislocations, implies that the composite dislocation in DWCNTs has self-healing ability. The dislocated DWCNTs first fracture at the edge dislocations, which induces the entire break in axial tensile test. The dislocated DWCNTs have a smaller fracture strength compared to the perfect DWCNTs. Our results not only match with the dislocation glide of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in experiments, but also can free from the electron beam radiation under experimental conditions observed by the high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), which is deemed to cause the motion of dislocation loop. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84869108401	Structure, stability and electronic properties of tricycle type graphane	We propose a new allotrope of graphane (named as 'tricycle') with equivalent 4up/2down UUUDUD hydrogenation in each six-carbon ring, which can be considered as the combination of previously proposed 3up/3down chair graphane and stirrup graphane. We find that tricycle graphane is more stable than stirrup graphane and its negative Gibbs free energy (-91 meV/atom) is very close to that of the most stable chair one (-103 meV/atom). Investigations on its vibrational property confirm its dynamical stability. Such a new two-dimensional hydrocarbon may be produced in the process of graphene hydrogenation with a relatively high probability due to its remarkable stability.

84868380109	Size effect of half-metallic properties of BN/C hybrid nanoribbons	Based on the first-principle calculations performed by Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP), we report the size limitation of half-metallic properties in hybrid zigzag BCN nanoribbons. Both boron-carbon (B-C) and nitrogen-carbon (N-C) interfacial hybrid zigzag BCN nanoribbons are considered. We find that all hybrid systems establish antiferromagnetic ground states. Moreover their electronic properties are mainly determined by the carbon rather than boron nitride segments. Transitions between semiconductor, half-metal and metal can be realized in both systems as the width of the carbon segment increases. However, the half-metallic property can only exist in the systems for which the zigzag carbon chain is less than 6 and 9 for B-C and N-C interfacial systems, respectively. As long as the carbon segment is wider than the above sizes, the systems behave as metals. This effect derives from the electron or hole doping of carbon on the BN segment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84870431622	Electron transport in folded graphene junctions	Using Green's function method, electron transport in graphene folding junctions (GFJs) are studied. All of these junctions are bilayer structures with AA or AB stacking. As for the AA-stacking GFJs, their transport properties are strongly dependent on the edge form and folding angle. The armchair GFJs (AGFJs) with a folding angle of 60° have high reflection to electrons, while those with a folding angle of 120° are nearly reflectionless and transparent. The zigzag GFJs (ZGFJs) show an opposite transport behavior: The junctions with a folding angle of 60° are nearly transparent while those of folding angle 120° have high reflection. As for the AB-stacking GFJs, their transport properties are insensitive to the edge form or folding angle, and all junctions exhibit less reflection to electrons. In addition, interesting edge states different from those in the unfolded nanoribbons are found in the GFJs. Our results indicate that GFJs can be served either as resistors for tuning attenuation of currents or as interconnects for changing directions of current in all graphene-based nanoelectronics. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84871337973	Continuously tunable thermal conductance in arched graphene nanoribbons	The thermal transport in arched graphene nanoribbons is investigated by using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. It is found that the thermal conductance can be modulated controllably and reversibly by varying the geometry and number of arches, while the tuning range can be up to 80% of the flat graphene nanoribbons. The analysis of force constant reveals that the reduction of thermal conductance mainly originates from the phonon scattering by the structural deformation. The interesting findings indicate that the arched graphene nanoribbons can be utilized as thermal conductance modulators and may have great potential applications for nanoscale thermal management. © 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

It is found that the Au/ZGNR junction behaves as a typical diode with Schottky barrier at the contact. Our results indicate that although the oxidization at the contact slightly influences the Schottky barrier, the I -V characteristic is effectively modulated. Such effect derives from the impact of the oxidization on the coupling between the ZGNRs and Au electrode.

Especially, the responsivity and external quantum efficiency are found to be about 95.8 mA/W and 26.2%, respectively, for incident wavelength of 455 nm at 0.8 V bias voltage.

84874544525	Nanoindentation models and Young's modulus of monolayer graphene: A molecular dynamics study	We studied the nanoindentation of monolayer graphene by molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the response of graphene to indentation is deflection dependent. In small deflection range, the response obeys point load model, while large-deflection indentation follows the sphere load model. Hence, we proposed to make sectional fittings and use different response models in different deflection ranges. In this way, a consistent Young's modulus is obtained that is almost independent of the size ratio of intender to graphene and the pretensions of graphene. The calculated Young's modulus is about 1.00 TPa, in good agreement with the experiments. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.

The electronic properties of the rippled graphene have been investigated using first-principles calculations. Compared with flat graphene, there is a band gap opening in rippled graphene. Generally, the value of energy gaps increases as the height of ripples increase, but it decreases as the range of ripples enlarges. The maximum value of energy gaps in rippled graphene can reach several hundred meV, which turns rippled graphene into a good semiconductor. As a result, the magnitude of energy gaps can be tuned effectively by controlling the range and height of ripples in graphene. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

In this paper, we have reviewed recent advances in searching for superhard phases of carbon from a segment combination view and find that they can be divided into two groups: (i) combinations of segments from cubic-diamond and hexagonal-diamond with 5-6-7 carbon rings and (ii) combinations of segments from hexagonal-diamond and mutated hexagonal-diamond with 4-6-8 carbon rings. Finally, an additional example of extending these allotropes of carbon to their corresponding boron nitride counterparts has been discussed. © 2012 Allerton Press, Inc.

84875134605	Structure and electronic properties of Au intercalated hexagonal-boron- nitride/graphene bilayer	Based on density functional calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of Au-intercalated hybrid bilayer composed of a single layer of hexagonal-boron-nitride (h-BN) and a single layer of graphene. Focusing on Au substituted doping in the h-BN layer, we find that the C-C bond length in the lower graphene layer has only minor changes, which implies that the lower graphene layer in the h-BN/graphene bilayer keeps well the original C lattice. Our results show that the Au-doped h-BN/graphene bilayer structure is stable with Au atom tightly confined in a small region between the upper and lower layers, with an estimated energy barrier of about 1.94 eV for the Au dopant to diffuse to the lower graphene layer. Semiconductor to metallic change is found due to the generation of localized mid-states near the Fermi level arising from the hybridization between the occupied states of the Au atom and the B, C and N atoms in the h-BN/graphene hybrid bilayer. Charge transfer occurs from Au dopant to both h-BN layer and graphene layer, increasing the carrier density in the ultra-thin atomic hybrid bilayer. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84875622635	Studies on electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons with pore defects	In practical applications of graphene-based electronic devices, they may have some pore defects under energetic particle bombardment, or chemical corrosion, which will inevitably affect their electrical properties. These problems have recently aroused great concern and interest. In this paper, we systematically study the influence of shape (tripartite, tetragonal and hexagonal) of hole defect on the electrical property of zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR). The results show that the influence of the shape of the pore defects on the conductance and current characteristics of ZGNRs is significant, whicl may result from electron scattering for the different shapes of the poredefect boundary. In addition, due to defects in suspension adsorbed hydrogen or nitrogen atoms, caused by defects of the pore shape changes, it also affects the electrical properties of ZGNRs. This study will supply valuable theoretical guidances for graphene-based electronic device failure analysis and the design of the graphene pore structure. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

84875030493	Cr-K emission line as a constraint on the progenitor properties of supernova remnants	We perform a survey of the Cr, Mn, and Fe-K emission lines in young supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku. The Cr and/or Mn emission lines are detected in 3C 397 and 0519-69.0 for the first time. We also confirm the detection of these lines in Kepler, W49B, N103B, and Cas A. We derive the line parameters (i.e., the line centroid energy, flux, and equivalent width (EW)) for these six sources and perform a correlation analysis for the line center energies of Cr, Mn, and Fe. Also included in the correlation analysis are Tycho and G344.7-0.1 for which the Cr, Mn, and Fe-K line parameters were available in the literature through Suzaku observations. We find that the line center energies of Cr correlate very well with that of Fe and that of Mn. This confirms our previous findings that Cr, Mn, and Fe are spatially co-located, share a similar ionization state, and have a common origin in the supernova nucleosynthesis. We find that the ratio of the EW of the Cr emission line to that of Fe () provides useful constraints on the SNR progenitors and on the SN explosion mechanisms: for SNRs with γ

84875831846	R-graphyne: A new two-dimensional carbon allotrope with versatile Dirac-like point in nanoribbons	A novel two-dimensional carbon allotrope, rectangular graphyne (R-graphyne) with tetra-rings and acetylenic linkages, is proposed by first-principles calculations. Although the bulk R-graphyne exhibits metallic property, the nanoribbons of R-graphyne show distinct electronic structures from the bulk. The most intriguing feature is that band gaps of R-graphyne nanoribbons oscillate between semiconductor and metallic states as a function of width. Particularly, the zigzag edge nanoribbons with half-integer repeating unit cell exhibit unexpected Dirac-like fermions in the band structures. The Dirac-like fermions of the R-graphyne nanoribbons originate from the central symmetry and two sub-lattices. The extraordinary properties of R-graphyne nanoribbons greatly expand our understanding of the origin of Dirac-like points. Such findings uncover a novel fascinating property of nanoribbons, which may have broad potential applications for carbon-based nanoscale electronic devices. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The high strength and flexibility of the nanofiber fabrics are beneficial for alleviating the structural deformation and facilitating ion transports throughout the whole composited electrodes. Due to the absence of binder, the less weight, higher energy density, and excellent electrical conductivity anodes can be attained.

84879694592	Edge-adsorption of potassium adatoms on graphene nanoribbon: A first principle study	Using density-functional theory calculations, we studied the electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with potassium (K) atoms adsorption on the edges of GNRs. Our simulations showed that the electronic structure of the armchair GNR (AGNR) is changed from semiconductor to metal due to the charge transfer from potassium adatoms to the edge carbon atoms. It was observed in AGNR that the K adatom edge-adsorbed system is always nonmagnetic and the interaction between the K adatom and AGNR is purely ionic. In zigzag GNR (ZGNR), we found that K edge-adsorption will suppress the magnetic moment at the impurity site and its vicinity while keeping well the edge structure of ZGNR. We also found that if selectively introduce K impurities asymmetry in two sides of the ZGNR, a ferromagnetic state can be created, while it is antiferromagnetic in pristine. Our results suggest that the electronic properties of GNR can be effectively modulated by K edge-adsorption, and that the alkali-metal edge-adsorbed GNRs can serve as potential materials in nanoelectronics and spintronics. ©2013 Elsevier B.V.

84881192064	Carbon nanotube oscillators encapsulating a platinum nanocluster: A molecular dynamics study	Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study carbon nanotube (CNT) oscillators that encapsulate an oscillating platinum nanocluster. Our calculations show that the nanocluster has a nearly constant motion except at the two ends of CNT, where the nanocluster is accelerated due to the potential gradient between its parts that are outside and inside the CNT. The oscillation frequency ω is found to increase with the temperature below 400 K and almost does not vary between 400 and 800 K. The calculated Lindemann index and radial distribution indicate that the platinum cluster starts to melt at 800 K and hence ω decreases and fluctuates considerably with the temperatures higher than 800 K. The relation between ω and the number of atoms n in platinum cluster is also studied. It is found that ω first decreases with n. When n exceeds a threshold value, the part of nanocluster running beyond the ends of CNT is deformed evidently, leading to fluctuations of ω with n. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the transmission conductance of (5,5) BN/C nanotube heterostructure is not only continually depressed as the BNNT region increases but also the drop of the conductance is uniform in the energy window (-1.43 eV, 1 eV), which leads to linear I-V dependence for the systems when the bias is within this energy range.

84883290435	Thermoelectric properties of gamma-graphyne nanoribbons and nanojunctions	Using the Nonequilibrium Green's function approach, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of gamma-graphyne nanostructures. Compared with the graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), gamma-graphyne nanoribbons (GYNRs) are found to possess superior thermoelectric performance. Its thermoelectric figure of merit Z T is about 3∼13 times larger than that in the GNRs. Meanwhile, the results show that the thermoelectric efficiency of GYNRs decreases as the ribbon width increases, while it increases monotonically with temperature. For the gamma-graphyne nanojunctions (GYNJs), the value of Z T increases dramatically as the width discrepancy between the left and right leads becomes more obvious. This improvement is mainly originated from the fact that the enhanced thermopower and degraded thermal conductance (including the electron and phonon contributions) outweigh the reduction of electronic conductance. Moreover, it is found that the thermoelectric behavior of GYNJs also depends on the geometric shape, which is explained by analyzing the unique width distribution of phonon contributed thermal conductance of GYNRs. These findings qualify gamma-graphyne as a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications and provide useful guideline for enhancing the thermoelectric performance in experiment. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Our results show that it is very difficult to transform narrow AGNRs directly from semiconductor to spin gapless semiconductors (SGS) by applying magnetic fields. However, as a uniaxial strain is exerted on the nanoribbons, the AGNRs can transform to SGS by a small magnetic field. The combination mode between magnetic field and uniaxial strain displays a nonmonotonic arch-pattern relationship. In addition, we find that the combination mode is associated with the widths of nanoribbons, which exhibits group behaviors. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

Besides, a specific capacity of about 207 mAh/g is retained even at a current density as high as 1600 mA/g, exhibiting high reversibility and good capacity retention. Our results suggest that the composite of bi-component MZO hollow microspheres embedded in RGO will be promising electrode materials for low-cost, environmentally friendly and high-performance LIBs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

84893280777	One-step hydrothermal fabrication and enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of CdMoO<inf>4</inf>/CdS hybrid materials	A series of CdMoO<inf>4</inf>/CdS hybrid composites were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities of the CdMoO<inf>4</inf>/CdS hybrid materials compared with CdMoO<inf>4</inf> microspheres and dendritic CdS nanostructures were evaluated by rhodamine B (RhB) decomposition under sunlight irradiation. The results revealed that the as-prepared CdMoO<inf>4</inf>/CdS hybrid composites showed superior photocatalytic activities for the degradation of RhB under sunlight irradiation, especially compared with dendritic CdS decorated with 22% CdMoO<inf>4</inf> microspheres. The superior photodegradation performance of the as-prepared CdMoO<inf>4</inf>/CdS hybrid composites can be ascribed to the presence of CdMoO<inf>4</inf> as an electron acceptor which improves the effective charge separation in CdS. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84893285043	Carbon matrix/SiNWs heterogeneous block as improved reversible anodes material for lithium ion batteries	A novel carbon matrix/silicon nanowires (SiNWs) heterogeneous block was successfully produced by dispersing SiNWs into templated carbon matrix via a modified evaporation induced self-assembly method. The heterogeneous block was determined by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra and scanning electron microscopy. As an anode material for lithium batteries, the block was investigated by cyclic voltammograms (CV), charge/discharge tests, galvanostatic cycling performance and A. C. impedance spectroscopy. We show that the SiNWs disperse into the framework, and are nicely wrapped by the carbon matrix. The heterogeneous block exhibits superior electrochemical reversibility with a high specific capacity of 529.3 mAh/g in comparison with bare SiNWs anode with merely about 52.6 mAh/g capacity retention. The block presents excellent cycle stability and capacity retention which can be attributed to the improvement of conductivity by the existence of carbon matrix and the enhancement of ability to relieve the large volume expansion of SiNWs during the lithium insertion/extraction cycle. The results indicate that the as-prepared carbon matrix/SiNWs heterogeneous block can be an attractive and potential anode material for lithium-ion battery applications. © 2014 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

84896385556	Electrochemically reduced graphene oxide with porous structure as a binder-free electrode for high-rate supercapacitors	A binder-free electrode is prepared by directly depositing electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) on the metal current collector. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectrum have been used to demonstrate the effective reduction of graphene oxide on the electrode, and the porous structure of the ERGO film was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of ERGO were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical measurements showed that the binder-free ERGO electrode had high specific capacity, good cycle stability, as well as excellent high-rate capability. The specific capacitance of the constructed electrode was 131.6 F g

84896398514	Synthesis of CdS/ZnO/graphene composite with high-efficiency photoelectrochemical activities under solar radiation	A novel ternary CdS/ZnO/graphene composite has been successfully prepared by loading ZnO and CdS nanoparticles in graphene nanosheets via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The microstructures and properties have been examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS), transmission electron microscopy, Raman and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The characterization results reveal that the crystalline of the composite is very well, the graphene sheets were tightly coated with ZnO and CdS nanoparticles, and the light-harvesting was effectively strengthened. Taking photoelectrochemical test, the ternary CdS/ZnO/graphene composite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with its foundation matrix binary composites and pure ZnO and CdS. The improved photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the enhanced light absorption, the extremely efficient charge separation, as well as superior durability of the ternary composite. It is proposed that graphene-based composites by coupling graphene to suitable, multiple semiconductors can not only greatly improve the capacity for photocatalytic, but also expand the exploration and utilization of graphene-based nanocomposites for energy conversion. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84897462858	One-step electrochemical deposition of nickel sulfide/graphene and its use for supercapacitors	In this current work, the electrochemical co-deposition of nickel sulfide/electrochemically reduced graphene oxide(ERGO) nanocomposites is presented. During the electrochemical process, the graphene oxide nanosheets loose their hydrophilicity and precipitate onto the electrode. In the meantime, nickel sulfide is also electrochemically deposited on the electrode. The porous structure with ERGO covered by nickel sulfide, which facilitates the charge and ion transport in the electrode, has been observed by a scanning electron microscope. The cycle voltammetry curves as well as the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the nickel sulfide/ERGO nanocomposites exhibit distinct pseudocapacitive characteristic. The nanocomposites maintain 66.8% of the initial specific capacitance for the first 500 cycles, and only 4.6% loss of the specific capacitance is experienced for the further 1500 cycles, evidently showing a relatively high cycling stability. The results suggest that the nickel sulfide/ERGO is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

84900436636	Quantum confinement in graphene quantum dots	By performing density functional theory calculations, we studied the quantum confinement in charged graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which is found to be clearly edge and shape dependent. It is found that the excess charges have a large distribution at the edges of the GQD. The resulting energy spectrum shift is very nonuniform and hence the Coulomb diamonds in the charge stability diagram vary irregularly, in good agreement with the observed nonperiodic Coulomb blockade oscillation. We also illustrate that the level statistics of the GQDs can be described by a Gaussian distribution, as predicted for chaotic Dirac billiards. The charge stability diagram (left) and the Gaussian distribution of the width of the Coulomb diamonds (right), indicating the nonperiodic Coulomb blockade oscillation in GQD due to quantum confinement. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84899787923	Size and boundary scattering controlled contribution of spectral phonons to the thermal conductivity in graphene ribbons	Although graphene holds great promise in thermal applications owing to its superior thermal conductivity, an intriguing question remains as to which polarizations and frequencies are dominant in its heat conduction. In this work, by incorporating the direction-dependent phonon-boundary scattering and the special selection rule for three-phonon scattering into the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we systematically investigate the relative contributions from longitudinal-acoustic, transverse-acoustic, and out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) branches to the thermal conductivity of graphene ribbons, focusing on the effects of their size and temperature. We find that the relative contribution from ZA branch to heat conduction increases with decreasing the size, specularity parameter, and temperature of graphene ribbons. Our analysis reveals that this change arises from the huge difference in the phonon dispersion and in the phonon mean free path of Umklapp process between in-plane and out-of-plane branches. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84902324298	Modulation of the electron transport properties in graphene nanoribbons doped with BN chains	Using density-functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method, the electron transport properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) doped with BN chains are studied by systematically calculating the energy band structure, density of states and the transmission spectra for the systems. The BN chains destroyed the electronic transport properties of the ZGNRs, and an energy gap appeared for the ZGNRs, and displayed variations from a metal to a wide-gap semiconductor. With an increase in the number of BN chains, the band gap increased gradually in the band structure and the transmission coefficient decreased near the Fermi surface. Additionally, the doping position had a significant effect on the electronic properties of the ZGNRs. © 2014 Author(s).

84907342976	Carbon kagome lattice and orbital-frustration-induced metal-insulator transition for optoelectronics	A three-dimensional elemental carbon kagome lattice, made of only fourfold-coordinated carbon atoms, is proposed based on first-principles calculations. Despite the existence of 60° bond angles in the triangle rings, widely perceived to be energetically unfavorable, the carbon kagome lattice is found to display exceptional stability comparable to that of C60. The system allows us to study the effects of triangular frustration on the electronic properties of realistic solids, and it demonstrates a metal-insulator transition from that of graphene to a direct gap semiconductor in the visible blue region. By minimizing s-p orbital hybridization, which is an intrinsic property of carbon, not only the band edge states become nearly purely frustrated p states, but also the band structure is qualitatively different from any known bulk elemental semiconductors. For example, the optical properties are similar to those of direct-gap semiconductors GaN and ZnO, whereas the effective masses are comparable to or smaller than those of Si. © 2014 American Physical Society.

0842265030	Replication and alignment of quantum dots in multilayer heteroepitaxial growth	We propose a model to elucidate the self-organization process of islands in multilayer heteroepitaxial growth. The model is based on the preferential nucleation and growth of islands in regions of tensile strain in the total strain field on a spacer-layer surface induced both by embedded islands and by growing surface islands. Surface islands nucleate at the regions of tensile strain induced by embedded islands. The islands grow in size and induce increasingly large compressive strain on the spacer-layer surface. A surface island reaches a stable size after the total strain field around it becomes compressive. The model predicts that islands in successive layers not only form ordered columns but also show uniform distributions of island size and spacing, in agreement with experimental observations. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
