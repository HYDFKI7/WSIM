80052237959	Modification of poly(lactic acid)/poly(propylene carbonate) blends through melt compounding with maleic anhydride	Maleic anhydride (MA) is incorporated into poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) blends to modify its properties through melt compounding. It is interesting to note that the toughness of PLA/PPC blends can be improved by 1355% while the strength is almost kept constant by adding very low content (as low as 0.9%) of MA into the blends. However, higher MA content in the blends leads to decrease in strength and further increase in toughness indicating an obvious plasticizing effect, while MA is shown to have no effect on the toughness of neat PLA. Rheological, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) studies have been carried out to understand the above results. It is believed that the improvement in mechanical performance originated from the largely retained molecular weight of PPC and improved interfacial interaction after processing. And relative large amount of MA in the blends is shown to mainly plasticize the PPC phase rather than the PLA phase. Such an effective method could provide PLA based biodegradable polymer blends with novel properties for industrial applications. © BME-PT.

84866599889	Surface phase separation, dewetting feature size, and crystal morphology in thin films of polystyrene/poly(ε-caprolactone) blend	Thin films of polystyrene (PS)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) blends were prepared by spin-coating and characterized by tapping mode force microscopy (AFM). Effects of the relative concentration of PS in polymer solution on the surface phase separation and dewetting feature size of the blend films were systematically studied. Due to the coupling of phase separation, dewetting, and crystallization of the blend films with the evaporation of solvent during spin-coating, different size of PS islands decorated with various PCL crystal structures including spherulite-like, flat-on individual lamellae, and flat-on dendritic crystal were obtained in the blend films by changing the film composition. The average distance of PS islands was shown to increase with the relative concentration of PS in casting solution. For a given ratio of PS/PCL, the feature size of PS appeared to increase linearly with the square of PS concentration while the PCL concentration only determined the crystal morphology of the blend films with no influence on the upper PS domain features. This is explained in terms of vertical phase separation and spinodal dewetting of the PS rich layer from the underlying PCL rich layer, leading to the upper PS dewetting process and the underlying PCL crystalline process to be mutually independent. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84887410651	Fabrication of highly stretchable conductors via morphological control of carbon nanotube network	Stretchable conductors, which can keep their excellent electrical conductivity while highly stretched, have been investigated extensively due to their wide range of applications in flexible and stretchable electronics, wearable displays, etc.; however, their preparation is often complicated and expensive. Herein, an efficient method to prepare high performance stretchable conductors through morphological control of conductive networks formed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in an elastomer matrix is reported. It is observed that an interface-mediated method could be used to align randomly oriented filler during stretching and to induce buckling of CNTs during relaxation. Further morphological studies indicate the possible formation of a wavy CNT structure induced by cyclic pre-straining. Subsequent thermal annealing is observed to collapse the oriented network and improve the local contacts between conductive networks. Through such a simple procedure, a conductivity of nearly 1000 S m

84897068408	Progress on the morphological control of conductive network in conductive polymer composites and the use as electroactive multifunctional materials	Since the emergence of large aspect ratio and multifunctional conductive fillers, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplates, etc., conductive polymer composites (CPCs) have attracted increasing attention. Although the morphological control of conductive networks in CPCs has been extensively investigated as an important issue for the preparation of high performance CPCs, recent extensive progress has not been systematically addressed in any review. It has been observed that the morphological control of conductive networks during the preparation of CPCs has crucial influence on the electrical properties of these composites. Several methods have been shown to be able to control the network structure, and thus, tune the electrical properties of CPCs, including the use of shear, polymer blends, thermal annealing, mixed filler, latex particle etc. Moreover, many novel and exciting applications have been extensively investigated for CPCs, such as stretchable conductor, electroactive sensors, shape memory materials and thermoelectric materials, etc. Therefore, the morphological control of conductive network in CPCs is reviewed here. Issues regarding morphology characterization methods, morphological control methods, resulted network morphology and electrical properties are discussed. Furthermore, the use of CPCs as electroactive multifunctional materials is also reviewed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84907983449	Towards high-performance poly(l-lactide)/elastomer blends with tunable interfacial adhesion and matrix crystallization via constructing stereocomplex crystallites at the interface	In this work, we report a facile strategy to prepare super-tough and heat-resistant poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) blends by constructing stereocomplex (sc) crystallites with dual interfacial adhesion enhancer/matrix crystallization accelerator functionality at the interface of the blends of PLLA/ethylene copolymer. To exploit the dual functionality, poly(d-lactide) grafted ethylene-acrylic ester copolymer (EMA-g-PDLA) capable of collaborating with the PLLA matrix to form the sc crystallites was first prepared via melt coupling reaction between end groups (carboxyl and hydroxyl) of PDLA and excess epoxy group of EMA-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (EMA-GMA). During subsequent melt-blending of PLLA with the prepared EMA-g-PDLA, sc crystallites are formed at the interface. The results show that, compared with PLLA/EMA-GMA and PLLA/EMA-g-PLLA blends, injection molded PLLA/EMA-g-PDLA blends have much higher impact toughness and heat resistance because the interface-localized sc crystallites can induce substantial enhancement in both interfacial adhesion and matrix crystallinity. More interestingly, by modulating the amount of sc crystallites at the interface of the blends, optimum impact toughness can be achieved due to the optimization of interfacial strength and matrix crystallinity. This work provides a new concept for the fabrication of high-performance PLLA blends by tailoring matrix and interface properties with the aid of sc crystallites.

71949108768	New understanding in tuning toughness of β-polypropylene: The role of β-nucleated crystalline morphology	It is widely believed that the trigonal β-form is favorable and effective for toughening isotactic polypropylene (iPP). Therefore, β-form content should be achieved as high as possible to realize excellent toughness in iPP. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the connection between crystallites might mainly determine the toughness of iPP instead of the β-crystal content. A new rare earth nucleator (WBG) was used to generate the rich β-crystalline structure in the compression-molded bars that were fabricated upon different molten temperatures (Tf). Interestingly, the increase in tensile elongation can be as large as 8 times for increased Tf. The polymorphic composition and overall crystallinity of β-nucleated iPP are almost independent ofTf. Nevertheless, the β-nucleated crystalline morphology has completely changed. Three types of β-crystalline morphology, namely, β-spherulite, β-transcrystalline entity, and "flower"-like agglomerate of β-crystallites, are sequentially obtained with increasing Tf. From the morphological point of view, the connection between the crystallites in "flower"-like agglomerate is significantly better than that for the crystallites generated under lower Tf. Therefore, it is concluded that the formation of β-nucleated iPP provides very good toughness only with sufficient connection between the crystallites. The result of this study clearly verifies the importance of crystal morphology on tuning the toughness of iPP. It provides important information for potential industrial applications. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

The concept is based on a bicomponent tape (or fibre) construction consisting of a highly oriented polymer core and a conductive polymer composite (CPC) skin based on a polymer with a lower melting temperature than the core, enabling thermal annealing of these skins to improve conductivity through a dynamic percolation process while retaining the properties of the core and hence those of the tape (or fibre). The percolation threshold in the CPC skins of the highly drawn conductive bicomponent tapes could be decreased from 5.3 to 1.1 wt.-% after annealing. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

74349087701	Synergistic reinforcement of highly oriented poly(propylene) tapes by sepiolite nanoclay	This paper reports the properties of highly oriented nanocomposite tapes based on isotactic PP and needle-like sepiolite nanoclay, obtained by a solid state drawing process. The intrinsic 1D character of sepiolite allows its exploitation in 1D objects, such as oriented polymer fibres and tapes, where it can be uniaxially oriented upon drawing. A synergistic increase in mechanical properties is presented for highly drawn tapes (γ ≤ 20) and low filler loadings (≤2.5 wt.-%), which can not be simply explained by micromechanical composite models. Instead, mechanical properties are intimately related to the dispersion state of the nanoclays in PP, the rheological properties of the nanocomposites and the polymer morphology. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

75149161633	Hierarchical structure of injection-molded bars of HDPE/MWCNTs composites with novel nanohybrid shish-kebab	Injection-molded products usually show hierarchical structure from skin to core due to the existence of shear gradient and temperature gradient. Investigating the hierarchical structure is helpful to better understand the structure-property relationship of injection-molded sample, which is important for design and preparation of polymer products with high performance. In this work, the hierarchical structures of injection-molded bars of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composite were explored by examining the microstructure and crystal morphology, layer by layer, along the sample thickness, using SEM, DSC and 2D-WAXS. To enhance the shear effect, a so-called dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) technique was used to prepare the molded bar with high orientation level. Interestingly, SEM revealed that in the skin and core zones, the lamellae of PE anchored randomly on the surface of MWCNTs, while well-defined nanohybrid shish-kebab (NHSK) entities, in which fibrillous carbon nanotubes (CNTs) act as shish while HDPE lamellae act as kebab, exist in the oriented zone. The changed NHSK crystal structure along the thickness direction of molded bar is considered as due to the shear gradient and thermal gradient in injection molding. And the underlying origin of in situ formation of NHSK under shear effects is discussed based on experimental observations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77249119158	Effect of thermal annealing on the electrical conductivity of high-strength bicomponent polymer tapes containing carbon nanofillers	A new concept is described that creates highly oriented multifunctional polymer nanocomposite tapes (or fibres) that combine high stiffness and strength with good electrical properties and a low percolation threshold of conductive nanofillers. The concept is based on a bicomponent construction consisting of a highly oriented polymer core together with conductive polymer composite skins based on a polymer with lower melting temperature than the core. This construction allows for a thermal annealing process that can be applied selectively to the skins to improve their conductivity through a kinetic re-aggregation process while retaining the mechanical properties of the core and hence those of the overall tape or fibre. In the current study this generic concept was applied to bicomponent tapes based on a polypropylene homopolymer core and a multi-wall carbon nanotube or carbon black filled polypropylene copolymer skin. The conductivity of the bicomponent tape containing 5.3 wt.% of MWNTs in its outer skins increased from 1.3E-6 to 1.5 S/cm after annealing while the percolation threshold in the copolymer skins of highly drawn bicomponent tapes could be decreased from 5.3 to 1.1 wt.%. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the lowest percolation threshold reported in literature for highly drawn polymer nanocomposites fibres or tapes. In fact, the percolation threshold is as low as 0.1 wt.% when considered on the overall tape as the conductive skins account for only 10% of the total volume of these bicomponent tapes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77951208798	The water absorption behaviour of all-polypropylene composites and its effect on mechanical properties	Woven fabric based self-reinforced polypropylene (SRPP) or all-polypropylene (all-PP) composite laminates based on co-extruded tapes were analysed for water uptake and the effect that this had on mechanical properties. Comparisons were made to a commercial glass mat reinforced PP (GMT) and natural fibre mat reinforced PP (NMT). Although the all-PP composites described in this paper can show significant water uptake through the presence of voids between tapes in the crimp region, the amount of which depends on the fabric architecture and level of consolidation, and their mechanical properties are seen to be largely unaffected by water absorption, even after freezing and thawing. Conversely, the NMT used in this investigation demonstrated significant mechanical degradation with increasing water uptake. Crown Copyright © 2010.

Morphological control of the conductive network formed by nanofillers is realized by solid-state drawing and annealing.

A fine SK structure is achieved through melt spinning. High density polyethylene and pristine CNTs were first compounded in an extruder. The compound was then spun into fibers with different draw ratios with the aid of a capillary rheometer. The crystalline structure and mechanical behavior were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering, polarized Raman spectroscopy, and tensile testing. An increase in tensile strength as high as 3 times has been achieved in the fiber. The formation of SKs is considered as the main mechanism responsible for the enhanced interfacial interaction and excellent tensile property. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

A simple approach based on the time-temperature superposition applied to the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube (CNT) percolating in a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) melt was also developed to predict the conductivity of the nanocomposite fibres. The observation of Arrhenius dependence of zero-shear viscosity and the assumption of simple inverse proportionality between the variation of conductivity, due to network formation, and viscosity allow a universal plot of time variation of conductivity to be composed, which is able to predict the conductivity of the extruded fibres. The same TPU/CNT fibres were also demonstrated to possess good strain sensing abilities, which makes them good candidates for applications in smart textiles. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Different melt processing conditions are used to dilute the master batch produced by melt process or in situ polymerization. Both MWCNTs and carboxyl group functionalized MWCNTs (MWCNTs-COOH) are compounded with PA6 at different loadings (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 wt %) to study the effect of chemical modification of MWCNTs on the mechanical properties of the final composites. It is demonstrated that chemical modification of MWCNTs has a positive effect on the strength of the composites as an increase of 5-10 MPa was observed. More importantly, a near 5 MPa increase in strength and more importantly, a maximum of 138% increase in strain at break were observed for the composites produced by in situ polymerization, indicating a toughening and strengthening effect of CNT on the composites. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79952749576	Vertical phase separation and liquid-liquid dewetting of thin PS/PCL blend films during spin coating	Thin films of an amorphous polymer, polystyrene (PS), and a crystalline polymer, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), blend were prepared by spin coating a toluene solution. Surface chemical compositions of the blend films were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the surface and interface topographical changes were followed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). By changing the PS concentration and keeping the PCL concentration of the solution at 1 wt %, a great variety of morphologies were constructed. The results show that the morphology of the blend films can be divided into three regions with increasing PS concentration. In region I, PS island domains are embedded in PCL crystals when the PS concentration is lower than 0.3 wt % and the size of the PS island increases with increasing PS concentration. In region II, holes with different sizes surrounded by a low rim are obtained when the concentration of PS is between 0.35 and 0.5 wt %. After selectively washing the PS domains, we studied the interface morphology of PS/PCL and found that the upper PS-rich layer extended into the bottom PCL layer, forming a trench surrounding the holes. In region III, an enriched two-layer structure with the PS-rich layer on top of the blend films and the PCL-rich crystal layer underneath is obtained when the concentration of PS is higher than 0.5 wt %. Last, the formation mechanism of the different surface and interface morphologies is further discussed in terms of the vertical phase separation to a layered structure, followed by liquid-liquid dewetting and crystallization processes during spin coating. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

Morphological observations of PLLA crystallites were conducted on a polarized optical microscopy equipped with a hot stage under crossed polarizers. PLLA shows a spherulitic crystal morphology and the crystal morphology for nucleated PLLA is clearly different from that of PLLA-0 and dependent on the loading levels of TMC-328 in PLLA. The results also show that only a fraction of TMC-328 molecules self-organize into some fine fibrils, and no stable physical network is formed upon cooling. The morphology of TMC-328 in PLLA melt varies with the increase of its concentrations, inducing three characteristic crystal morphologies.

79952512769	Improved thermal stability and mechanical properties of poly(propylene carbonate) by reactive blending with maleic anhydride	To extend the application of a carbon dioxide sourced environmental friendly polymer: poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC), a small amount of maleic anhydride (MA) was melt blended to end-cap with PPC to improve its thermal stability and mechanical properties. Thermal and mechanical properties of end-capped PPC were investigated by TGA, GPC, mechanical test, and DMA. TGA and titration results demonstrate that PPC can be easily end-capped with MA through simple melt blending. TGA results show that the thermal degradation temperature of PPC could be improved by around 140°C by adding MA. GPC measurement indicates that the molecular weight of PPC can be maintained after blending with MA, where pure PPC experiences a dramatic degradation in molecular weight during melt process. More importantly, the tensile strength of PPC after blending with MA was found to be nearly eight times higher than that of pure PPC. It has approached the mechanical properties of polyolefin polymers, indicating the possibility of replacing polyolefin polymers with PPC for low temperature applications. The method described here could be used to extend the applications of PPC and fight against the well known global warming problem. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79954440962	Effect of whiskers nucleation ability and shearing function on the interfacial crystal morphology of polyethylene (PE)/raw whiskers composites	In this work, in order to investigate the combined effect of whiskers nucleation ability and shearing function on the interfacial crystal morphology of HDPE/raw whiskers composites, two different types of raw whiskers (SMCW and BW) with different diameter distribution and HDPE composites were firstly prepared by melt blending and then subjected to both traditional and dynamic injection molding. The results indicated that the nucleation ability of SMCW on HDPE crystallization is much better than BW. Furthermore, the small diameter whisker shows the better nucleation ability than the large diameter whisker. For samples prepared by traditional injection molding, the better the nucleation ability of the whisker, the more dense the HDPE crystal lamellae can epitaxially grow on its surface. However, after introducing shearing function, even for large diameter BW whisker with weak nucleation ability, a large number of HDPE crystal lamellae could be epitaxially grown on the surface of the whisker. As a consequence, the interfacial adhesion and mechanical properties of the composites are significantly improved by introducing shear function. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79955464406	New insight on the annealing induced microstructural changes and their roles in the toughening of β-form polypropylene	Large amount of work has been reported on the annealing of polypropylene (PP) and the related changes in mechanical properties. However, the structure-property correlations and the physical origin of annealing induced microstructural evolution are still not very clear. In this work, taking β-form PP (β-PP) as example, the microstructural changes induced by annealing were investigated from macromolecular to crystalline lamellae level with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, conventional differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), temperature-modulated DSC (TMDSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Besides mobile amorphous fraction (MAF), the role of rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) in toughening PP is particularly taken into consideration. It is shown that annealing increases the chain mobility in MAF and decreases it in RAF. Such an effect is believed to be mainly associated with the formation of looser MAF and more RAF by the microstructural re-arrangement involving conformational ordering of partial amorphous chain segments and a significant interlamellae thickening. A thorough analysis of structure-property relationship through observing plastic deformation behaviors by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and estimating stress transmission between crystalline and amorphous phases, suggests that both MAF and RAF play important role on toughening β-PP. They can promote the initiation of microvoids effectively upon deformation by reducing the stress transmission. As a result, large-scale plastic deformation is triggered. This work is important and provides a new insight into the mechanisms of microstructural evolution and subsequent improvement in impact toughness during annealing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Interestingly, the impact toughness of β-nucleated PPR after annealing at low temperature (0 °C) was almost five times as high as that of the virgin PPR without annealing. The crystalline structure, supermolecular structure, phase morphology, the relaxation of chain segments and fracture behavior of matrix were investigated to explore the toughening mechanism related to the β-modification and annealing. It was found that annealing improved the mobility of chain segments in amorphous phase as well as the strength of ligament of PPR matrix with profuse β crystals having the intrinsic low plastic deformation resistance, responsible for the superior toughness achieved.

Before melt extrusion, solid-state iPP powders and MWNTs were pre-mixed upon high-speed rotating. By this way, the dispersion extent of nanotubes was significantly improved as comparing to the common one-step melt extrusion strategy. As validated by scanning electron microscopy, most of MWNTs exist as a form of filament bundles with size of hundreds nanometers; no obvious agglomerate was found even at high MWNTs content, 5%. The improvements of the major mechanical properties and electric conductivity were much efficient for the composites obtained via the two-step process of rotating solid-state mixing (RSSM)- plus-melt extrusion. The tensile strength, Young's modulus and impact strength at 5% MWNTs content were enhanced for 35%, 42% and 45%, respectively, indicating an excellent strength-rigidity-toughness balance, which was hardly achieved in polyolefin/carbon nanotubes composite. It is believed that the method developed in this study is so far the most effective and convenient for efficiently dispersing nanotubes into the nonpolar, intractable thermoplastics and resulting in good properties, among a variety of fabrication method suggested in the previous researches. Importantly, the used RSSM equipment is a kind of frequently used dispersion machine, thus it has tremendous potential to be applied in industrial producing immediately. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A significant decrease in the tensile strength and Young's modulus was observed with increasing injection speed. In order to investigate the mechanism behind this decrease, the orientation, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, melt flow rate, crystallinity and crystal morphology of HDPE were characterized using two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction (2D-WAXD), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), capillary rheometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. It is demonstrated that the orientation, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, melt flow rate and crystallinity have no obvious change with increasing injection speed. Nevertheless, the content of extended chain crystals or large folded chain crystals was found to decrease with increasing injection speed. Therefore, it is concluded that the decrease in tensile properties is mainly contributed by the reduced content of extended chain crystals or large folded chain crystals. This study provides industry with valuable information for the application of high speed injection molding. © Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

80053051330	Cooperative effect of shear and nanoclay on the formation of polar phase in poly(vinylidene fluoride) and the resultant properties	The polar crystalline phase is the most important crystal mode for poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF); its high content is urgently desired in the large-scale processing fabrication likes injection-molding. In this study, we proposed a convenient pathway to achieve large amount of polar phase in injection-molding part through cooperation of exerting oscillatory shear field and adding nanoclay. The effects of these two factors on the polymorphic composition were well demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The increment of polar phase content was limited when shear field was solely imposed or only less amount of nanoclay, 1 wt%, was added. Whereas, by simultaneously exerting shear field and adding 1 wt% nanoclay, an extremely high polar phase fraction was achieved. So a positive cooperative effect of shear and nanoclay on the formation of polar phase can be proved absolutely. The simultaneously exerting shear and adding nanoclay leaded to not only high content of polar phase but also highly oriented structure. With this unique structure, an order-of-magnitude increase in the ductility (elongation) as well as good piezoelectric property has been achieved for the molded parts of PVDF/nanoclay nanocomposites. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, rapid cellular uptake with reduced toxicity remains a great challenge for efficient and safe delivery. In this study, we first use gemini quaternary ammonium (GQA) as a cell internalization promoter to enhance the cellular uptake of drug nanocarriers. It is found that a twenty times faster cell internalization could be achieved by introducing GQA into biodegradable multiblock polyurethane nanomicelles, as confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. Meanwhile, an added methoxyl-poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) outer corona could protect these cationic micelles from cytotoxicity at high concentrations, as verified by methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Moreover, GQA not only acts as an enhancer for rapid cellular entry, but also plays an important role in controlled self-assembly and high drug loading capacity.

Polypropylene chains are covalently grafted onto the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in order to improve their interaction with the polymer matrix. It is observed that functionalization of CNTs improves their dispersion and increases the interfacial bonding between CNTs and polymer matrix. The functionalized CNTs are selectively distributed in the continuous polypropylene phase. The size of the dispersed elastomer phase decreases after the addition of CNTs. Functionalized CNTs act as a nucleating agent and increase the crystallinity of the polypropylene. More importantly, an important increase in impact strength, stiffness and toughness can be achieved through introducing functionalized CNTs.

80054040059	Extension-induced mechanical reinforcement in melt-spun fibers of polyamide 66/multiwalled carbon nanotube composites	In this work, polyamide 66 (PA66) and its composites with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were melt spun into fibers at different draw ratios. PA66 fibers at high draw ratio demonstrate a 40% increase in tensile strength, 66% increase in modulus and a considerable increase in toughness. It is demonstrated that this reinforcement can be mainly attributed to high-draw-ratio-induced good dispersion and orientation of MWNTs, particularly the enhanced interfacial adhesion between MWNT and matrix thanks to interfacial crystallization. Our work provides a simple but efficient method to achieve good dispersion and strong interfacial interaction through melt spinning.

80054884063	Effect of film thickness on morphological evolution in dewetting and crystallization of polystyrene/poly(ε-caprolactone) blend films	In this Article, the morphological evolution in the blend thin film of polystyrene (PS)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was investigated via mainly AFM. It was found that an enriched two-layer structure with PS at the upper layer and PCL at the bottom layer was formed during spinning coating. By changing the solution concentration, different kinds of crystal morphologies, such as finger-like, dendritic, and spherulitic-like, could be obtained at the bottom PCL layer. These different initial states led to the morphological evolution processes to be quite different from each other, so the phase separation, dewetting, and crystalline morphology of PS/PCL blend films as a function of time were studied. It was interesting to find that the morphological evolution of PS at the upper layer was largely dependent on the film thickness. For the ultrathin (15 nm) blend film, a liquid-solid/liquid-liquid dewetting-wetting process was observed, forming ribbons that rupture into discrete circular PS islands on voronoi finger-like PCL crystal. For the thick (30 nm) blend film, the liquid-liquid dewetting of the upper PS layer from the underlying adsorbed PCL layer was found, forming interconnected rim structures that rupture into discrete circular PS islands embedded in the single lamellar PCL dendritic crystal due to Rayleigh instability. For the thicker (60 nm) blend film, a two-step liquid-liquid dewetting process with regular holes decorated with dendritic PCL crystal at early annealing stage and small holes decorated with spherulite-like PCL crystal among the early dewetting holes at later annealing stage was observed. The mechanism of this unusual morphological evolution process was discussed on the basis of the entropy effect and annealing-induced phase separation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

83255186281	The variable role of clay on the crystallization behavior of DMDBS-nucleated polypropylene	The effect of clay on the nucleating behavior of 1,3:2,4-bis(3,4- dimethylbenzylidene) sorbitol (DMDBS) in cryatallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) was investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic rheology and polarized light microscopy (PLM). It is interesting to note that the incorporation of layered clay nanoparticles into DMDBS-nucleated iPP may induce a synergetic nucleation effect while the DMDBS content is below 0.1 wt%, otherwise it restricts the crystallization rate prominently as the DMDBS content increases up to 0.3 wt%, which has exceeded the content threshold to yield a nucleating agent (NA) network. As shown by dynamic rheological investigations, the clay nanoparticles demonstrate an obstructive effect of disturbing the consistency of DMDBS fibrils network. Moreover, to further demonstrate the importance of NA network formation in the crystallization of iPP, we used another NA named HPN-20e, which can not form network structure at all over the concentration studied, for comparison. In this case, the nucleated-crystallization rate is independent on the addition of clay nanoparticles, as the nucleating mechanism is an individual nuclei manner without NA network forming. © Chinese Chemical Society.

81855221788	Tailoring toughness of injection molded bar of polypropylene random copolymer through processing melt temperature	In this study, a facile route to realize the superior toughness of injection molded polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) is reported. The toughness of PPR is increased about twofold when the processing melt temperature increases from 180 to 250 °C. Systematic and detailed structural characterizations have been carried out to establish the structure-property relationships by using polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared microscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis. It is found that increasing the melt temperature is beneficial for the coalescence of rubbery domains and enhanced molecular mobility which are mainly responsible for the improvement in toughness. Other factors, such as molecular orientation, crystallinity and so on, seem to have little effect. The vital role of enhanced molecular mobility in improving toughness is further demonstrated by the annealing of injection molded samples at elevated temperature, i.e. 110 °C. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

82755188992	Synergistic effect in conductive networks constructed with carbon nanofillers in different dimensions	Herein, investigation on synergistic effect during network formation for conductive network constructed with carbon nanofillers in different dimensions is conducted. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and carbon black (CB) are employed as conductive fillers in this system. Morphological control of the conductive network is realized by adjusting the ratio between different fillers. Classical percolation threshold theory and adjusted excluded volume theory are used to analyze the electrical percolating behavior of these systems. It is observed that the percolation threshold of hybrid fillers filled conductive polymer composites (CPCs) is much lower than that of MWNTs or CB filled CPCs, and it can be reduced from 2.4 to 0.21 wt% by replacing half of the MWNTs with CB. Possible mechanism of this phenomenon is discussed together with morphological observation. A model is proposed to understand the mechanism of the percolation behavior in the composites containing various proportions of nanofillers. Our work is important for the design and preparation of low cost conductive polymer composites with novel electrical property. © BME-PT.

82155178782	Dependence of mechanical properties on β-form content and crystalline morphology for β-nucleated isotactic polypropylene	As part of a continuous effort to develop high performance isotactic polypropylene (iPP) based on β-form crystalline and morphological change induced by rare earth nucleator (WBG), various WBG contents (from 0.025 to 1.0wt%) were adopted to prepare β-nucleated iPP at a fixed final molten temperature (240°C) in this study. The crystallinity, polymorphic composition, and crystalline morphology were inspected in detail by a series of crystallographic characterizations, including calorimeter, X-ray diffraction, polarized light microscopy (PLM), and electron microscopy. Furthermore, the self-organization and re-crystallization behavior of β-nucleating agent occurred during cooling was characterized by rheometry. Finally, the dependence of mechanical properties, including tensile strength, elongation at break, and impact strength, on WBG content was discussed based on the variations in β-form content and crystalline morphology. Interestingly, it is found that while the WBG content is below 0.1wt%, the toughness of β-nucleated iPP increases with increase in WBG content due to additional β-form content; as the WBG content is in range of 0.1-0.5wt%, the toughness increases at a lower rate with increase in WBG content due to β-crystalline morphological change. However, a decrease in toughness is observed while nucleator content is above 0.5wt% as WBG remains undissolved in iPP upon the adopted processing conditions. The result of this study provides valuable information for potential industrial applications. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84855417446	Effect of annealing on the microstructure and mechanical properties of polypropylene with oriented shish-kebab structure	Annealing is thought to be an effective method to promote chain rearrangement in semicrystalline polymers and improve their physical properties. However, little attention has been paid to the annealing of flow-oriented semicrystalline polymers despite its importance in polymer processing. In this work, the microstructural evolution of injection-moulded polypropylene with an oriented shish-kebab structure upon annealing has been explored with differential scanning calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis. The results show that annealing gives rise to a chain rearrangement in both the crystalline and amorphous phases. Accompanied by the growth and perfecting of the kebabs, relaxation of the initially oriented chains in the amorphous phase is observed. Then, the relationship between the structure and the resulting mechanical properties is established. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

84856700465	The interfacial enhancement of LLDPE/whisker composites via interfacial crystallization	Interfacial interaction plays a key role in the preparation of high performance polymer composites. In this work, in order to explore the possibility to enhance the interfacial interaction via interfacial crystallization of polymer matrix onto the filler surface, interfacial crystallization structure and mechanical properties of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE)/whisker composites were investigated. The composites were firstly prepared by melt compounding, followed by processing in both traditional and dynamic injection molding. DSC, WAXD, SEM were used to characterize the interfacial crystallization structure. And the mechanical properties were measured by tensile testing. An imperfect shish-calabash structure, with whisker served as shish, and irregular LLDPE spherulite as imperfect calabash, was formed during common injection molding processing. Such a structure was considered as the main reason for the strong interfacial adhesion and the obviously improved tensile strength and modulus. Furthermore, introducing shear could cause the formation of relatively perfect shish-calabash structure, leading to the stronger interfacial adhesion. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84859758572	Acid-modified carbon nanotubes distribution and mechanical enhancement in polystyrene/elastomer blends	The incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is expected as an effective path for tailoring mechanical properties of polymer blends. In this study, acid-modified multiwalled CNTs (A-MWCNTs) were introduced into polystyrene/maleic anhydride-g-(styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene) (PS/SEBS-MA) blends. By altering the mass ratio of PS/SEBS-MA from 80/20 to 60/40, the biphase structure of blend was changed from sea-island-like type to quasi co-continuous structure, of different mechanical behaviors. In 80/20 mass ratio, the impact strength was improved while the tensile strength was unchanged with increasing A-MWCNTs content, whereas a simultaneously toughening and strengthening effect was achieved for the compound with 60/40 mass ratio. Scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and rheological measurements were carried out to detect the distribution of A-MWCNTs in the blends. The results demonstrated as increasing the nanotube loading from 0 to 3 wt%, A-MWCNTs might gradually migrate into continuous PS phase in 80/20 mass ratio, due to the low content of SEBS-MA, while they were totally packed in SEBS-MA region within the entire loading range used in 60/40 mass ratio due to its high content of SEBS-MA.

The resistance per meter coated yarn decreased with increasing CNT concentration in the CPC coating, while in the case of a homogeneous coating, the CPC concentration in the coating solution did not have a significant effect on the resistance per meter coated yarn. Upon cyclic loading, the strain sensing behaviour showed partial recovery of resistance in the first loading cycle, while good reversibility was observed a number of cycles, giving these materials good potential as sensors for smart textiles. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84862798109	Unusual rheological characteristics of polypropylene/organoclay nanocomposites in continuous cooling process	The cooling process of isotactic polypropylene (iPP)/organoclay nanocomposites was followed by dynamic rheometry. Contrasting to typical linear increment of log G' with decreasing temperature (log G' ∝ 1/T) occurred on the melts for neat iPP and nanocomposites with small amounts of organoclay, an unusual rheological behavior was identified for composites with relative high organoclay content (≥5 wt %) as that: increasing of log G' positively deviates to linear relation during cooling within certain high temperature region, thus yields an additional enhancement in viscoelastic properties. Furthermore, such unusual rheological phenomenon was found to be strongly impacted by initial dispersion level of organoclay, cooling rate, and construction of organoclay network. The origin of this unusual rheological phenomenon could be cautiously explained as due to the existence of unstable state of organoclay nanostructure, which could go further intercalation or exfoliation in some high temperature ranges. This might be a new rheological character and is meaningful for understanding the essentially structural behavior of polymer/layered clay nanocomposites, particularly containing mesoscopic clay network. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84862826115	Exploring temperature dependence of the toughening behavior of β-nucleated impact polypropylene copolymer	In this study, the effects of α- and β-nucleating agents (α-NA and β-NA) on the toughening behavior of impact polypropylene copolymer were ascertained with respect to three test temperatures (23, 0 and -15 °C). The addition of α-NA impacted the toughness slightly for all test temperatures. However, the tendency of impact strength vs. β-NA content at 0 °C significantly differs from that of the other two temperatures. Importantly, a close correlation between toughness at 0 °C and chain mobility of the amorphous portion has been well revealed for the first time by achieving a linearly fitting between impact strength at 0 °C and β-relaxation peak intensity in DMA spectrum. A comparative investigation between the situations containing α-NA or β-NA offers new insights into the physical origin of the toughening behavior for a multiphase multicomponent polyolefin system. The chain mobility of matrix amorphous portion plays a dominant role on toughening. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84862234804	Anisotropic dewetting holes with instability fronts in ultrathin films of polystyrene/poly(∈-caprolactone) blend	A crystalline polymer poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) with molecular weight 50000 g/mol was introduced into PS film with different molecular weight to explore the morphology of the growing holes in dewetting of the blend films. Dendritic crystal analogue of the diffusion-controlled finger-like crystal of the pure PCL film with a flat-on lamellae thickness about 11 nm is obtained, and it shows that most parts of that film is occupied with dendritic crystals. While PCL has polar interaction with the mica substrate, it is stable for molten PCL layer on the mica. The anisotropic dewetting process indicates the wetting ability and stability of the blend films on the substrate are anisotropic. The changes of the PS molecular weight causes the different distribution of PS within the blend films, which combines with the different stability of liquid PS on liquid PCL leading to the different dewetting process for the blend films.

84863126998	Tailoring impact toughness of poly(L-lactide)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PLLA/PCL) blends by controlling crystallization of PLLA matrix	Melt blending poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) with various biodegradable polymers has been thought to be the most economic and effective route to toughen PLLA without compromising its biodegradability. Unfortunately, only very limited improvement in notched impact toughness can be achieved, although most of these blends show significant enhancement in tensile toughness. In this work, biodegradable poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was used as an impact modifier to toughen PLLA and a nucleating agent was utilized to tailor the crystallization of PLLA matrix. Depending on the nucleating agent concentrations in the matrix and mold temperatures in injection molding, PLLA/PCL blends with a wide range of matrix crystallinity (10-50%) were prepared by practical injection molding. The results show that there is a linear relationship between PLLA matrix crystallinity and impact toughness. With the increase in PLLA crystalline content, toughening becomes much easier to achieve. PLLA crystals are believed to provide a path for the propagation of shear yielding needed for effective impact energy absorption, and then, excellent toughening effect can be obtained when these crystals percolate through the whole matrix. This investigation provides not only a new route to prepare sustainable PLLA products with good impact toughness but also a fresh insight into the importance of matrix crystallization in the toughening of semicrystalline polymers with a flexible polymer. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84863733397	An environmentally friendly and fast approach to prepare reduced graphite oxide with water and organic solvents solubility	In this paper, reduced graphite oxide (RGO) was prepared using thiourea dioxide as reductant and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as stabilizer. Thiourea dioxide, a cheap and nontoxic industrialized material, was demonstrated to be an efficient reducing agent for graphite oxide (GO) in this paper. Ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy results revealed that the reduction of GO could be readily achieved in 10. min, a reaction time which is much shorter than those required in common reduction reactions. The procedures of reduction including the by-products are all nontoxic, thus it is absolutely environmentally friendly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that thiourea dioxide was successfully used to prepare RGO. Moreover, the stabilizer, PVP, which could be easily absorbed onto the surface of RGO, provided RGO with good water and organic solvents solubility, with low conductivity though. However, by controlling the content of PVP, RGO with balanced solubility and conductivity can be obtained. The resultant RGO could be used as nanofillers to prepare conductive materials and biomaterials with potential applications as electrical devices or biosensors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84863533637	Morphology and mechanical properties of poly(ethyleneoctene) copolymers obtained by dynamic packing injection molding	The morphology and mechanical properties of poly(ethylene-octene) copolymers (POE) obtained by dynamic packing injection molding were investigated by mechanical tests, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical tests found that only POE with low octene content and high molecular weight show apparent response for external shear field. Further investigation has been done by DSC, FT-IR, and SEM in order to make clear the reason of that phenomenon. Finally, the hypothetical mechanism of POE microstructure formation under shear field has been proposed. For POE with low octene content and high molecular weight, orientation degree and mechanical properties both increase substantially under shear field. For POE with low octene content and low molecular weight, orientation degree and crystallinity increase under shear field, but it is not dramatically benefit for the mechanical properties. For POE with high octene content and high molecular weight, the shear field has little effect on the morphology and mechanical properties. © 2012 Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84864810045	Superior reinforcement in polyamide 1010/multiwalled carbon nanotube composites realized by high-rate drawing and incorporation of compatibilizer	To realize the full potential of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polymer/CNT nanocomposites, many complicated chemical treatments have been developed to modify the CNTs. Nevertheless, the reinforcing efficiency is still not satisfactory in most cases. In this study, a dramatically improved mechanical enhancement is obtained for polyamide 1010/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites simply by exerting high-rate drawing and incorporating a commercially available compatibilizer. For the fibers prepared at high draw ratio, their tensile strength and modulus are improved by 137 and 132%, respectively, through adding only 0.5 wt% MWNTs. In particular, the increase in strength is at a very high level for the case of non-covalent interaction since CNTs could be stretched to failure according to theoretical calculation. It is demonstrated that this reinforcement is mainly attributed to the compatibilizer inducing good dispersion, and the high-rate drawing inducing strong interfacial interaction and orientation of MWNTs. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.

84865575536	Utilizing real and statistically reconstructed microstructures for the viscoelastic modeling of polymer nanocomposites	In this paper, we present a new approach to finite element modeling of a nanoparticle filled polymer system that utilizes the actual and statistically reconstructed microstructures of the material. Typically, description of polymer nanocomposites for microstructure generation is difficult given the high degrees of freedom inherent in the location of each nanoparticle. The lack of true microstructure utilization hinders our ability to understand the interaction between the nanoparticle and polymer, which cannot easily be deconvoluted from experiments alone. We consider here a material system of carbon black particle fillers dispersed in synthetic natural rubber. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images are first taken of these carbon black-rubber composites samples and then transformed into binary images. The binary images from either a microscope image of original specimens or microstructure reconstruction according to the material statistical description are used as geometric inputs for the finite element model along with experimentally determined viscoelastic properties of pure rubber. Simulations on the viscoelastic properties of the rubber composites are performed through ABAQUS. The simulated results are then compared with composite viscoelastic data in both frequency and temperature domains. The comparison shows that for the specific rubber/CB composite discussed in this paper, the thickness being 25. nm and relaxation time being 32 times that of matrix polymer provide the best approximations for the properties of interfacial polymer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84865613789	Realizing the enhancement of interfacial interaction in semicrystalline polymer/filler composites via interfacial crystallization	Polymer/filler composites have been widely used in various areas. One of the keys to achieve the high performance of these composites is good interfacial interaction between polymer matrix and filler. As a relatively new approach, the possibility to enhance polymer/filler interfacial interaction via crystallization of polymer on the surface of fillers, i.e., interfacial crystallization, is summarized and discussed in this paper. Interfacial crystallization has attracted tremendous interest in the past several decades, and some unique hybrid crystalline structures have been observed, including hybrid shish-kebab and hybrid shish-calabash structures in which the filler served as the shish and crystalline polymer as the kebab/calabash. Thus, the manipulation of the interfacial crystallization architecture offers a potential highly effective route to achieve strong polymer/filler interaction. This review is based on the latest development of interfacial crystallization in polymer/filler composites and will be organized as follows. The structural/morphological features of various interfacial crystallization fashions are described first. Subsequently, various influences on the final structure/morphology of hybrid crystallization and the nucleation and/or growth mechanisms of crystallization behaviors at polymer/filler interface are reviewed. Then recent studies on interfacial crystallization induced interfacial enhancement ascertained by different research methodologies are addressed, including a comparative analysis to highlight the positive role of interfacial crystallization on the resultant mechanical reinforcement. Finally, a conclusion, including future perspectives, is presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84866418452	Enhancement of β-nucleated crystallization in polypropylene random copolymer via adding isotactic polypropylene	Polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) is one of important polypropylene types for the application fields needing for excellent toughness. Because of the random copolymer chain configuration, the polymorphic behavior of PPR is difficult to be altered even by adding β-nucleating agent (β-NA). In this study, a promising method was developed by adding isotactic polypropylene (iPP) into PPR/β-NA blend, which has leaded to a surprising enhancement in the β-crystallization capability of PPR. At the optimal component condition, the β-crystal content of PPR can reach the highest level of 92 % and the β-crystallization capability is improved by 56%. As a result of high β-crystal contents, a superior mechanical toughness has been attained. On the other hand, the fractional crystallization experiment suggests that the stereoregular chains of iPP could assist the formation of primary β-nuclei at the very early stage of crystallization. This special crystallization event dominates the final polymorphic composition in PPR. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that impact polypropylene copolymer (IPC) can be used to substitute iPP for the improvement of β-crystal content of PPR. This provides a huge possibility to improve the low temperature properties of PPR to enlarge its applications. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84867273578	Dynamic percolation in highly oriented conductive networks formed with different carbon nanofillers	Dynamic percolation in highly oriented conductive networks formed with different carbon nanofillers is investigated during disorientation upon annealing. Conductive networks are constructed by solid-state drawing, subsequent annealing, and using fillers with different dimensions (multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) black (CB)) in a bicomponent tape. Interestingly, it is observed that a less entangled network work is formed by mixed filler containing CB; consequently, this result in an accelerated dynamic percolation process and reduced activation energy of such process. Three different analytical approaches have been utilized to analyze this interesting behavior. It is concluded that the dynamic percolation process in highly oriented conductive polymer composites filled with MWCNTs can indeed be accelerated by the addition of CB, since less entangled networks are formed in a hybrid filler system compared with MWCNTs alone. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

In particular two nanofillers - differing in shape and electrical properties - are used in conjunction with MWCNTs: an electrically conductive CB and an insulating needle-like nanoclay, sepiolite. The ternary nanocomposites were manufactured in a number of forms (extruded pellets, filaments and compression moulded films) and their morphological and electrical properties characterised as function of time and temperature. The presence of both secondary nanofillers is found to affect the formation of a percolating network of MWCNTs in TPU, inducing a reduced percolation threshold and tuneable strain sensing ability.

Such a combination of conductive fillers is rarely used for CPCs in the literature. To characterize the strain-sensing properties of these fibers, both linear and dynamic strain loadings are carried out. It is noted that a higher metal content in the fibers results in higher strain sensitivity. These strain-sensing results are discussed through a morphological study combined with a model based on the classic tunneling model of Simmons. It is suggested that a high tunneling barrier height is preferred in order to achieve higher strain sensitivity.

84872970370	Combined effect of β-nucleating agent and multi-walled carbon nanotubes on polymorphic composition and morphology of isotactic polypropylene	The effects of nucleating duality, imposed by a mixed nucleating agent (NA) system containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and a rare earth (WBG), on the crystallization behaviors of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) including the peak temperature of crystallization (Tcp), polymorphic composition, and crystalline morphology, were probed in detail by calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and polarized light microscopy. In such mixed nucleating agent system, MWCNTs is active filler to induce a-nucleation for iPP, while WBG serves as bnucleating agent. When the WBG content was low (0.05%), the crystals of WBG were as a form of individual isotropic dendrite, and the enhancement of Tcp was achieved by the incorporation of MWCNTs. As the WBG content was high as 0.1%, a percolated NA network consisted of needlelike crystals of WBG yielded before nucleating the prevalent crystallization of iPP. In this case, the addition of MWCNTs has no obvious effect on Tcp. However, by varying the mass proportion of MWCNTs/ WBG, the polymorphic composition was adjusted significantly, indicating a nucleation competition between MWCNTs and WBG. Although the competitive growth existed between α-crystals nucleated by MWCNTs and β-crystals nucleated by WBG, the formation of primary bcrystallite was always prior to the α-nucleated crystallization, as confirmed by crystalline morphology. These findings are useful for developing a new pathway to prepare iPP-based composite with good mechanical property via the addition of mixed nucleating system containing active inorganic filler and β-Nucleating agent. © Akademiai Kiado, Budapest, Hungary 2011.

84879464384	Synergistic effects of β-modification and impact polypropylene copolymer on brittle-ductile transition of polypropylene random copolymer	In this work, the synergistic effects of β-modification and impact polypropylene copolymer (IPC) on brittle-ductile (B-D) transition behavior of polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) have been investigated. It is interesting to find that adding both IPC and β-nucleating agent into PPR has three effects: (i) leading to a significant enhancement in β-crystallization capability of PPR, (ii) contributing to the shift of B-D transition to lower temperatures, (iii) increasing the B-D transition rate. The reason for these changes can be interpreted from the following two aspects. On one hand, the transition of crystalline structure from α-form to β-form reduces the plastic resistance of PPR matrix, thus causing the initiation of matrix shear yielding much easier during the impact process. On the other hand, the well dispersed rubbery phase in IPC with high molecular mobility at relatively low temperatures is beneficial to the shear yielding of PPR matrix and, subsequently, the great improvement in impact toughness of the ternary blends.

84879518587	Towards tunable sensitivity of electrical property to strain for conductive polymer composites based on thermoplastic elastomer	The use of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) as strain sensors has been widely investigated and various resistivity-strain sensitivities are desirable for different applications. In this study, the use of mixed carbon fillers and functionalized carbon nanotubes was demonstrated to be vital for preparing thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based strain sensors with tunable sensitivity. To understand the strain sensing behavior, we carried out scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), mechanical test, and rheology-electrical measurement. Hybrid fillers of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and carbon black (CB) could reduce the entanglement in conductive network structure, thus increase the resistivity-strain sensitivity. Furthermore, incorporation of additional functionalized MWNTs in the CPCs could enhance the interfacial interaction between nanofillers and TPU, leading to further increase in sensitivity. Through such a simple method, strain sensors could be efficiently fabricated with large strain-sensing capability (strain as large as 200%) and a wide range of strain sensitivity (gauge factor ranging from 5 to 140238). Finally, the exponential revolution of resistive response to strain was fitted with a model based on tunneling theory by Simmons. It was observed that the change in tunneling distance and the number of conductive pathways could be accelerated significantly by adjusting conductive network structure and interfacial interaction.

84884286362	Effect of surface wettability on transparency in different water conditions	Water droplets or films which are formed according to surface wettability show different effects on surface transparency. The effects of surface wettability on transparency in different water conditions are worth investigating because the surface usually suffers from the variable environmental water conditions. Herein, superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces, with negligible differences of physical structure but great differences of chemical composition, are used to investigate for the first time the relationship between surface wettability and transparency in four water conditions, including ambient condition, liquid water, boiling water steam, and ambient conditions after freezing at -4 C for 1 week. The transparency of the superhydrophobic surface is only about 5% lower in 550 nm light wavelength than that of the superhydrophilic surface in ambient conditions, but it is about 24% lower than that of the superhydrophilic surface in liquid water. When the surfaces are exposed to boiling water steam and ambient conditions after freezing at -4 C for 1 week, the superhydrophobic surface also shows lower transparency than the superhydrophilic surface because of increased fogging. However, the transparency shows little difference when the fog evaporates completely. The relationship revealed between surface wettability and transparency in different water conditions will be beneficial in choosing suitable wettability surfaces to satisfy the needed transparency in actual applications. Graphical Abstract: The effect of surface wettability on transparency has been quantitatively studied with a commercial UV-Vis spectrometer in ambient conditions (a, air) and in liquid water (a, water), and qualitatively studied with the fogging phenomenon in boiling water steam (b) and in ambient conditions after freezing at -4 C for 1 week (c) for hydrophilic glass substrates (left in b and c), superhydrophobic surfaces (middle in b and c), and superhydrophilic surfaces (right in b and c).[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2013 American Coatings Association & Oil and Colour Chemists' Association.

84886241917	Anisotropic multilayer conductive networks in carbon nanotubes filled polyethylene/polypropylene blends obtained through high speed thin wall injection molding	To prepare composites with anisotropic conductive networks, electrical conductive polymer composites (CPCs) consisting of polypropylene (PP) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) filled polyethylene (PE) are fabricated through high speed thin-wall injection molding. Morphological study demonstrates that CNTs are localized in PE phase while the alternating multilayer structure with different polymer phases elongated as well as conductive network oriented parallel to flow direction is observed. To form such alternating layered structure, the dispersed phases are firstly deformed into discontinuous layers, and finally further deformed into wide and regular continuous alternating layers. In term of the mechanism behind this, the good viscosity match, low interfacial tension between different polymer components, short relaxation time and high shear rate are thought as important issues. The anisotropic conductive behavior of these CPCs, i.e. conductive in longitudinal (parallel to flow direction) and transverse (perpendicular to flow direction) direction but non-conductive in thickness direction, is contributed by the insulating PP layer which cuts off the conductive networks in the core layer. More importantly, much better electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding ability is obtained for these CPCs with alternating multilayer conductive networks comparing with the same polymer blends with isotropic conductive networks, despite of the fact that much lower resistivity is obtained for the later. This indicates great potential of these anisotropic CPCs for electronic applications. Moreover, this study has shed some light on the potential use of such alternating multi-layered structure to prepare a range of multi-functional materials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84891359363	Selective localization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in thermoplastic elastomer blends: An effective method for tunable resistivity-strain sensing behavior	Conductive network morphology and interfacial interaction play important roles in determining resistivity-strain (ρ- ε) sensing behavior of conductive polymer composites (CPCs). In this work, thermoplastic elastomer blends consisting of poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) block polymer (SBS) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were fabricated via different melt processing procedures, which could tune the above two issues simultaneously by selectively localizing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in SBS, TPU and both in SBS and TPU, respectively. It is observed that the composite fibers with selectively localized MWCNTs show distinct different ρ- ε sensing behavior. Work of adhesion calculation suggests stronger interfacial interaction between MWCNTs and SBS, however, wetting coefficient calculation indicates slightly better wetting of MWCNTs with TPU. Because of such stronger interaction and poorer dispersion, the composite fiber with MWCNTs distributed in SBS exhibits higher ρ- ε sensitivity than its counterpart with MWCNTs distributed in TPU, and with MWCNTs distributed in both phases, the ρ- ε sensitivity lies in between. Moreover, the ρ- ε sensing behavior was fitted with a model based on tunneling theory by Simmons. It is suggested that the change in tunneling distance and the number of conductive pathways could be accelerated significantly under strong interfacial interaction. This study could offer a new pathway and provide a guideline for the preparation of high-performance CPC resistivity-strain sensors with tunable sensitivity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84898622786	Significantly improving oxygen barrier properties of polylactide via constructing parallel-aligned shish-kebab-like crystals with well-interlocked boundaries	Recently, some attempts have been made to enhance the gas barrier properties of semicrystalline polymers by precisely controlling the arrangement of their impermeable crystalline lamellae. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve regular arrangement of the lamellae along the direction perpendicular to the gas diffusion path, especially using conventional polymer processing technologies. This work presents a novel and simple strategy to dramatically improve oxygen barrier performance of biobased and biodegradable polylactide (PLA) through constructing parallel-aligned shish-kebab-like crystals with well-interlocked boundaries with the aid of a highly active nucleating agent. The nucleating agent was introduced into PLA by melting compounding and the sheet-like specimens were fabricated by compression molding. We demonstrate that the fibrillar nucleating agent dispersed in PLA melt can serve as shish to induce the change of crystallization habit of PLA from isotopic spherulitic crystals to unique shish-kebab-like crystals and the shear flow in the compression molding can induce the highly ordered alignment of the nucleating agent fibrils as well as the subsequent shish-kebab-like crystals along the direction parallel to the sheet surface. More importantly, the growing lamellae are found to interpenetrate and tightly interlock with each other at the boundary regions of the shish-kebab-like crystals in the later stage of the crystallization, forming a densely packed nanobrick wall structure to prevent gas molecules from permeating through the crystals and thus imparting the PLA sheets with unprecedentedly low oxygen permeability. This work provides not only a successful example of preparing semicrystalline polymer with super gas barrier properties by tailoring crystal superstructure but also a promising route to rapidly fabricate high-performance food packaging materials via industrially meaningful melt processing. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84900818166	In situ polymerised polyamide 6/sepiolite nanocomposites: Effect of different interphases	The success of a polymer/clay nanocomposite depends from a number of factors including the intrinsic properties of the clay, nanofiller dispersion and orientation, matrix/filler interactions, etc. This manuscript focuses on the effect of matrix/filler interphases on the final physical properties of nanocomposite. Two PA6/sepiolite nanocomposites masterbatches are prepared via in situ polymerisation and then diluted via melt-compounding to different filler contents: one based on unreactive pristine sepiolite and another based on reactive amino-silane functionalised sepiolite. This offers a unique comparison opportunity, in which only the latter nanocomposite has PA6 molecules grafted directly from the sepiolite clay. Both nanocomposites are characterised in terms of morphology, thermal behaviour, semi-static tensile tests and dynamic mechanical tests. Interestingly, the grafted-from nanocomposites presented an enhanced strain at break and work of fracture, up to 100% in correspondence of 5 wt.% of filler, which is explained by the presence of a "soft" interphase. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84900856774	Formation of conductive networks with both segregated and double-percolated characteristic in conductive polymer composites with balanced properties	Morphological control of conductive networks involves the construction of segregated or double-percolated conductive networks is often reported to reduce the electrical percolation threshold of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) for better balance among electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, and filler content. Herein, the construction of conductive networks with both segregated and double-percolated characteristics is achieved based on polypropylene (PP)/polyethylene (PE) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs were firstly dispersed in PE; then PE/CNTs were compounded with PP particles well below the melting temperature of PP. It is observed that the percolation threshold (p

84902080034	Transcrystalline formation and properties of polypropylene on the surface of ramie fiber as induced by shear or dopamine modification	The key for fiber reinforced polymer composites is the interfacial interaction between fiber and polymer matrix. The crystallization of polymer on the surface of fiber as a possible way to enhance the interfacial interaction has received increasingly attention. In this work, the transcrystalline (TC) formation and properties of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) on ramie fiber surface, as induced either by fiber pulling or by dopamine modification, were investigated and compared. It was found that the growth rate of shear induced TC is faster than that obtained via dopamine modification. There exists α-β crystal form transition in the TC formation process as induced by pulling while only α-crystal form is obtained via dopamine modification. By using both dopamine modification and fiber pulling, a formation of TC with two step growth was observed for the first time: the first step growth has much enhanced rate than that induced by fiber pulling, and second step growth has the same rate with that induced by dopamine modification. Thus a unique TC structure was obtained, with α-crystal form presented in the inner layer and the outer layer, and β-crystal form in between. The result from single fiber fragmentation test indicated that interfacial shear stress (IFSS) between iPP and ramie fiber for dopamine modification induced TC is much higher than that of shear induced TC. Our work provides guidance for the preparation of polymer/fiber composites with enhanced interfacial interaction via formation of TC layer by using shear or fiber surface modification. © 2014 The Authors.

84902294440	Towards tunable resistivity-strain behavior through construction of oriented and selectively distributed conductive networks in conductive polymer composites	The resistivity-strain behavior of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) has gained intense interest due to its importance for various applications. The resistivity of CPCs often increases substantially and linearly under strain. To achieve constant resistivity under strain, a large filler content and special network configuration are often required. And a tunable step-wise resistivity-strain behavior has yet to be reported. Herein, a new method combining polymer blends and pre-stretching is introduced to modify the resistivity-strain behavior of CPCs based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/polyolefin elastomer (POE) with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) selectively incorporated in the TPU phase. Depending on the compositions of blends and the intensity of pre-stretching, various interesting resistivity-strain behaviors have been achieved. The resistivity can be either linearly increasing or constant. Interestingly, two-stepwise resistivity-strain behavior has been achieved, with first an increase then a constant value. To understand this unique phenomenon, the phase morphology and conductive network structure are systematically characterized. It is observed that the orientation of MWCNTs is strongly correlated with overall resistivity. Finally, a mechanism involving fibrillization and "slippage" between conductive phases is proposed to explain the resistivity-strain dependency. This study provides guidelines for the preparation of high performance strain sensors as well as stretchable conductors. 2014 This journal is © the Partner Organisations.

84903957043	Synergistic effects in ternary polymer nanocomposites	In this paper, the electrical properties of ternary nanocomposites based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are studied. In particular two nanofillers - differing in shape and electrical properties - are used in conjunction with MWNTs: an electrically conductive CB and an insulating needle-like nanoclay, sepiolite. The ternary nanocomposites were manufactured in a number of forms (extruded pellets, filaments, and compression moulded films) and their morphological and electrical properties characterised as function of time and temperature. The presence of both secondary nanofillers is found to affect the formation of a percolating network of MWNTs in TPU, inducing a reduced percolation threshold and tuneable strain sensing ability. These ternary nanocomposites can find application as conductive and multi-functional materials for flexible electronics, sensing films and fibres in smart textiles.

84903976291	Spraying layer-by-layer poly(vinyl alcohol) - Graphene oxide nanocomposites	A bottom-up approach for poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) - graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites using a spraying method is presented. Very simple and versatile, spraying allows to build-up uniform multilayered composite films with good structural control of each layer. 150 bi-layers were deposited to create a semi-transparent film with improved mechanical properties at a loading of 5.4 wt.% GO. The Young's modulus and strength of these films doubled or nearly doubled which is believed to be due to the nanoscale hierarchical organization of the composite incorporating the 2D nanofiller, and hydrogen bonding between the PVA and the GO sheets.

The review introduces issues related to the preparation of CNT-polymer fibres and orientation of CNTs, necessary to fully exploit the mechanical and electrical properties of CNT-polymer fibres. It is demonstrated that CNTs have great potential for a wide range of applications. Their large aspect ratio, excellent electrical conductivity and ultra-high mechanical properties make them outstanding candidates to be multi-functional nanofillers for polymer fibres. © 2011 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

84907764690	The resistivity-strain behavior of conductive polymer composites: Stability and sensitivity	The use of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) for strain sensing applications has attracted intense interest lately. The stability and sensitivity of resistivity-strain behaviour are thought to be important issues, but systematic investigations are missing. Herein, the resistivity-strain behavior in terms of stability and sensitivity of CPCs based on poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS) containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are studied. It is demonstrated that the preparation method has an important influence on the resistivity-strain behavior of these CPCs. Under linear uniaxial strain, the sensitivity increases with decreasing filler content for both composites, showing higher strain sensitivity near the percolation threshold. Moreover, a higher and wider range of sensitivities is obtained for SBS/MWCNT composites from melt mixing. Under dynamic strain, resistivity downward drifting and shoulder peaks are shown for composites from melt mixing, while linear relationships and reversible resistivity in every cycle are observed for composites from solution mixing, showing good electromechanical consistency, stability and durability. From the TEM, rheology, SEM, SAXS, Raman microscopy and analytical modeling studies, the difference in morphology is thought to be responsible for such resistivity-strain behavior. As more disordered and less densely packed conductive networks in melt-mixed CPCs are more easily destroyed under strain, evenly distributed and densely packed networks in solution mixed CPCs are more stable during cyclic stretching. Finally, human knee motions have been detected using these CPCs, demonstrating a potential application of these CPCs as movement sensors.

84907821715	Enhancing the melt stability of polylactide stereocomplexes using a solid-state cross-linking strategy during a melt-blending process	Stereocomplexation between poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(d-lactide) (PDLA) provides a feasible route for improving the performance of polylactide (PLA), including mechanical strength, thermal stability and hydrolysis resistance. In recent years, several effective methods have been developed to prepare polylactide stereocomplexes (sc-PLA) from commercially available, linear, high-molecular-weight PLLA and PDLA. However, it is still a big challenge to attain pure sc-PLA in the melt-processed products because the prepared sc-PLA has a very poor melt stability, that is the ability to trigger the reformulation of stereocomplex (sc) crystallites after complete melting is significantly depressed, resulting in the formation of mixed homochiral (hc) and sc crystallites. Here we present a facile strategy to fabricate sc-PLA with good melt stability by low-temperature (180 °C) melt-blending of equimolar PLLA and PDLA in the presence of a trace amount (0.1-0.5 wt%) of a cross-linker. During the blending process, sc crystallites form rapidly, followed by a slight cross-linking of PLLA and PDLA chain couples in the mobile amorphous phase, whereas the chain couples in the crystalline phase hardly participate in the cross-linking reaction. The exclusive cross-linking of PLA chains in the amorphous phase not only allows for the introduction of abundant cross-linking points at the ends of the chain couples to prevent them from completely decoupling upon melting but also retains large amounts of long crystallizable PLA segments existing in the initially formed sc crystallites to impart the resulting sc-PLA with an excellent recrystallization ability upon cooling. The formation or reformulation of sc crystallites in the continuous melting and recrystallization process is found to be perfectly reversible, without any trace of hc crystallites. This journal is
