9544225087	Classifying G-protein coupled receptors with bagging classification tree	G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a key role in different biological processes, such as regulation of growth, death and metabolism of cells. They are major therapeutic targets of numerous prescribed drugs. However, the ligand specificity of many receptors is unknown and there is little structural information available. Bioinformatics may offer one approach to bridge the gap between sequence data and functional knowledge of a receptor. In this paper, we use a bagging classification tree algorithm to predict the type of the receptor based on its amino acid composition. The prediction is performed for GPCR at the sub-family and sub-sub-family level. In a cross-validation test, we achieved an overall predictive accuracy of 91.1% for GPCR sub-family classification, and 82.4% for sub-sub-family classification. These results demonstrate the applicability of this relative simple method and its potential for improving prediction accuracy. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1842863622	Parasitism of Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) by a pupal endoparasitoid, Pteromalus puparum (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae): Effects of parasitization and venom on host hemocytes	In contrast to the situation with egg-larval and larval endoparasitic wasps, little is known about the effects of pupal endoparasitoids and their secretions on the hemocytes of their insect hosts. This study focuses on the pupal endoparasitoid, Pteromalus puparum, and its host, the small white butterfly, Pieris rapae. Parasitism by P. puparum, resulted in a significant increase in the total number of host hemocytes up to day five after parasitization. From day one to day four after parasitization, the percentage of plasmatocytes significantly decreased, and the proportion of granular cells increased. Moreover, from 12 h to day three after parasitization, hemocyte mortality in parasitized pupae was noticeably higher. When P. rapae pupae were parasitized by adult females of P. puparum irradiated by γ-ray (pseudoparasitization), it was clear that the treated wasps could induce similar hemocyte changes. However, such phenomena did not occur in punctured host pupae (mimic-parasitization). After treatment with P. puparum venom, both the percentages of spreading plasmatocytes and encapsulated Sephadex G-25 beads were lessened significantly in vitro. Electron microscopy analysis and visualization of hemocyte F-actin with phalloidin-FITC showed that hemocytes treated with venom had a rounded configuration and neither spread nor extended pseudopods, while there was no marked alteration of hemocyte cytoskeletons after venom treatment. The results suggested that venom of P. puparum could actively suppress the hemocyte immune response of its host, but not by destroying the host hemocyte cytoskeleton. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

20144389935	Noggin and bFGF cooperate to maintain the pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells in the absence of feeder layers	Human embryonic stem (hES) cells are typically maintained on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders or with MEF-conditioned medium. However, these xenosupport systems greatly limit the therapeutic applications of hES cells because of the risk of cross-transfer of animal pathogens. Here we showed that the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist noggin is critical in preventing differentiation of hES cells in culture. Furthermore, we found that the combination of noggin and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was sufficient to maintain the prolonged growth of hES cells while retaining all hES cell features. Since both noggin and bFGF are expressed in MEF, our findings suggest that they may be important factors secreted by MEF for maintaining undifferentiated pluripotent hES cells. Our data provide new insight into the mechanism how hES cell self-renewal is regulated. The newly developed feeder-free culture system will provide a more reliable alternative for future therapeutic applications of hES cells. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

21244504303	Discovering possible context dependences around SNP sites in human genes with Bayesian network learning	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are loci on the genome where different alleles are observed in the population. It has been observed that there might be some patterns or context dependences in the sequence segments adjacent to SNPs sites. Discovering such dependences is very important for understanding possible origins of SNPs in evolution. We collected 519,767 biallelic SNPs of human in gene regions from HGBASE and separated them in 6 groups according to the types of alleles at the SNP loci. Bayesian network structure learning technique is applied to discovery of possible dependences in sequence segments around these sites as well as in reference sequences collected as comparison. Noticeable probabilistic correlations among some loci were detected in all the 6 SNP groups and nothing significant was found in the reference sequences. The dependence relations found with different SNP groups are different. These putative context dependences around SNP sites provide important hints for further analyzing SNP-related sequences patterns. The work also illustrates the powerfulness of the Bayesian network method as a tool for biological sequence analysis. © 2004 IEEE.

22744454129	Comparative venom toxicity between Pteromalus puparum and Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) toward the hemocytes of their natural hosts, non-target insects and cultured insect cells	Crude venoms from two parasitoid species, Pteromalus puparum and Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) were assayed for biological activities toward hemocytes from two species of their natural hosts and eight species of their non-natural hosts as well as two lines of cultured Lepidoptera cells, respectively. By inhibiting the spreading and viability of insect hemocytes, the venom from P. puparum displayed significantly higher activities toward plasmatocytes and granular cells from both larvae and pupae of two natural hosts, Pieris rapae and Papilio xuthus, and lower activity toward those from Spodoptera litura, Musca domestica and Sarcophaga peregrina. However, no effect was found towards any type of hemocytes from other five insects tested, namely, Ectropis oblique, Galleria mellonella, Sesamia inferens, Bombyx mori and Parnara guttata. In contrast, the venom from N. vitripennis showed a narrower range of targeted insects. It appeared to have highly adverse effects on the spreading and viability of plasmatocytes and granular cells only from the natural hosts, M. domestica and S. peregrina, little toxicity to cells from P. rapae and P. xuthus, and no effect on any of the other insects tested. Pteromalus puparum venom also apparently presented a high ability to block the spreading of Tn-5B1-4 cells derived from Trichoplusia ni, and high cytotoxicity to the cells and Ha cells derived from Helicoverpa armigera. Nasonia vitripennis venom, however, only had a marked lethal effect to Ha cells. In addition, the possibility that the host range of a defined parasitoid could be assessed using our method of treating hemocytes from candidate insects with venom in vitro, and the potential of our venoms tested in the development of bio-insecticides, insect-resistant transgenic plants, are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

23944525307	Inferring protein-protein interactions from messenger RNA expression profiles with SVM	In post-genomic biology, researchers in the field of proteome focus their attention on the networks of protein interactions that control the lives of cells and organisms. Protein-protein interactions play a useful role in dynamic cellular machinery. In this paper, we developed a method to infer protein-protein interactions based on the theory of support vector machine (SVM). For a given pair of proteins, a new strategy of calculating cross-correlation function of mRNA expression profiles was used to encode SVM vectors. We compared the performance with other methods of inferring protein-protein interaction. Results suggested that, through five-fold cross validation, our SVM model achieved a good prediction. It enables us to show that expression profiles in transcription level can be used to distinguish physical or functional interactions of proteins as well as sequence contents. Lastly, we applied our SVM classifier to evaluate data quality of interaction data sets from four high-throughput experiments. The results show that high-throughput experiments sacrifice some accuracy in determination of interactions because of limitation of experiment technologies. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

Because of their involvement in many physiological and pathological processes, the development of methods to infer the different NR subfamilies has become an important goal in biomedical research. In this paper we introduce a sequence-based computational approach-Support Vector Machine to classify the 19 subfamilies of NRs. We use 4-tuple residue composition instead of dipeptide composition to encode the NR sequences. The overall predictive accuracy about 96% has been achieved in a five fold cross-validation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

Here we report a novel chemical-defined medium using DMEM/F12 supplemented with N2, B27, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [termed NBF]. This medium can support prolonged self-renewal of hESCs. hESCs cultured in NBF maintain an undifferentiated state and normal karyotype, are able to form embryoid bodies in vitro, and differentiate into three germ layers and extraembryonic cells. Furthermore, we find that hESCs cultured in NBF possess a low apoptosis rate and a high proliferation rate compared with those cultured in MEF-CM. Our findings provide a novel, simplified chemical-defined culture medium suitable for further therapeutic applications and developmental studies of hESCs. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33745220960	Vip3A is responsible for the potency of Bacillus thuringiensis 9816C culture supernatant against Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exigua	Culture supernatant of Bacillus thuringiensis 9816C had high toxicity against Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exigua. However, it lost insecticidal activities after being bathed in boiling water for 5 min. Acrystalliferous mutants of Bt9816C (Bt9816C-NP1 and Bt9816C-NP2) cured of its endogenous plasmids no longer possessed vip3A gene and toxicity. The 89 kD protein which existed in Bt9816C supernatant disappeared in the two mutants' supernatant; nevertheless, the two mutants still exhibited hemolytic and phospholipase C activity as Bt9816C did. The vip3A gene of Bt9816C, vip3Aa18, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Bioassay demonstrated that the recombinant E. coli had high toxicity against S. exigua. Taken together, it suggested that Vip3A protein was responsible for the toxicity of Bt9816C culture supernatants. Copyright © 2006 by The Microbiology Research Foundation.

33846103746	Construction and evaluation of intracerebral capsular hemorrhage model in rats	Background: A stable and exact animal model is the necessary tool and basis for studying hemorrhagic cerebrovascular diseases. Objective: To establish and evaluate the intracerebral capsular hemorrhage models in rats. Design: A randomized and controlled animal experiment. Setting: Second Hospital Affiliated to Xuzhou Medical College; First Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University. Materials: This experiment was carried out in the animal experimental center of Nanjing Medical University during May to November 2002. Totally 35 SD rats were randomized into two groups: experimental group (n=30) and sham-operation group (n=5). Methods: 1 Autoblood was injected into the intracerebral capsule of rats to create intracerebral capsule hemorrhage models with stereotaxy in the experiment group. 2 Scoring was conducted according to 5-point neurological scoring criteria from ZeaLonga, somatic sensation and motor function of rats were observed. 3 Somatosensory evoked potential(SEP) of rats was detected pre- and post-operation under anesthetic state. 4 After determination of SEP, the rats were sacrificed under anesthetic state. Brains were taken out to made slices, then sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Changes in haematoma and histomorphology were observed at the largest focus under optical microscope. Main Outcome Measures: 1 Nerve function scoring; 2 Latent period of various waves of SEP; 3 Observation of brain tissue morphology. Results: Totally 35 rats entered the stage of result analysis. 1 Appearance of obvious paralysis of the rats suggested the modeling was successful. The successful rate of this experiment was 93.3% (28/30). Significant difference existed in neurological scoring between experimental group [(2.74±0.46) points] and sham-operation group (0 point)(P < 0.05). 2 SEP showed that the latent periods of various waves of experimental group after operation were significantly delayed than those before operation and those of sham-operation group [P1: (15.72±0.78) Ms, (10.69±0.52) Ms, (10.73±0.48) ms; N1: (17.95±1.27) ms, (13.21±1.31) ms, (13.34±1.27) ms; N2: (21.16±1.62) ms, (15.42±1.46) ms, (15.58±1.44) ms;N3: (24.86±1.58) ms, (18.72±1.76) ms, (18.99±1.67) ms,P< 0.05]. 3 In the sham-operation group, a few red blood cells were scattered in the peripheral area of needle channel were found, but hemorrhagic focus was not; In the experimental group, irregular or oval blood clots presented in the left internal capsule area. In about a low-fold visual field, brain tissue in the surrounding of hemorrhagic focus was loosened and swelled, and pathological changes were obviously severer than those in the sham-operation group. Conclusion: Intracerebral capsular hemorrhage induced by injection of autoblood with stereotaxy is more close to clinical situation, and it is easy to operate and has good reproducibility.

33846813657	Induction of oligodendrocyte differentiation by Olig2 and Sox10: Evidence for reciprocal interactions and dosage-dependent mechanisms	Recent studies have suggested that oligodendrocyte development is likely to be under the control of a hierarchy of lineage-specific transcription factors. In the developing mouse spinal cord, expression of Olig2, Sox10 and Nkx2.2 is sequentially up-regulated in cells of oligodendrocyte lineage. These transcription factors play essential roles in oligodendrocyte specification and differentiation. However, the regulatory relationship and functional interactions among these transcription factors have not been determined. In this study, we systematically investigated the function and hierarchical relationship of Olig2, Sox10 and Nkx2.2 transcription factors in the control of oligodendrocyte differentiation. It was found that over-expression of Olig2 is sufficient to induce Sox10, Nkx2.2 and precocious oligodendrocyte differentiation in embryonic chicken spinal cord. Sox10 expression alone is also sufficient to stimulate ectopic oligodendrocyte differentiation and weakly induce Nkx2.2 expression. Although genetic evidence indicated that Sox10 functions downstream of Olig2, Sox10 activity can modulate Olig2 expression. In addition, we presented evidence that the control of oligodendrocyte differentiation by Olig2, Sox10 and Nkx2.2 is a dosage-dependent developmental process and can be affected by both haploinsufficiency and over-dosage. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

34247172579	Regulation of apoptosis and differentiation by p53 in human embryonic stem cells	The essentially infinite expansion potential and pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) makes them attractive for cell-based therapeutics. In contrast to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), hESCs normally undergo high rates of spontaneous apoptosis and differentiation, making them difficult to maintain in culture. Here we demonstrate that p53 protein accumulates in apoptotic hESCs induced by agents that damage DNA. However, despite the accumulation of p53, it nevertheless fails to activate the transcription of its target genes. This inability of p53 to activate its target genes has not been observed in other cell types, including mESCs. We further demonstrate that p53 induces apoptosis of hESCs through a mitochondrial pathway. Reducing p53 expression in hESCs in turn reduces both DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as spontaneous apoptosis. Reducing p53 expression also reduces spontaneous differentiation and slows the differentiation rate of hESCs. Our studies reveal the important roles of p53 as a critical mediator of human embryonic stem cells survival and differentiation. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

34447136291	A genome-wide survey of alternative translational initiation events in Homo sapiens	Alternative translational initiation is an important mechanism to increase the diversity of gene products. Although some of alternative translational initiation events have been reported, such information remains anecdotal and does not allow for any generalizations. The number of the known alternative translational initiation genes is so few that we know little about its mechanism. There is a great demand to discover more alternative translational initiation genes. However, it is arduously time-consuming to discover novel alternative translational initiation genes by the experimental method. Therefore we systematically analyzed protein sequences available in public database and predicted 1237 protein clusters as potential alternative translational initiation events. We concluded that about 8%-10% of human genes have alternative translational initiation sites. The results significantly increased the number of alternative translation initiation events and indicated that alternative translation initiation is an important and general regulation mechanism in the cellular process. © 2007 Science in China Press.

34447512703	Use of magnetic stimulation to elicit motor evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, and H-reflexes in non-sedated rodents	Assessment of locomotor function of rodents may be supplemented using electrophysiological tests which monitor the integrity of ascending and descending tracts as well as the focal circuitry of the spinal cord in non-sedated rodents. Magnetically induced SSEPs (M-SSEPs) were elicited in rats by activating the hindpaw using magnetic stimulation (MS). M-SSEP response latencies were slightly longer than those elicited by electrical stimulation. M-SSEPs were eliminated following selective dorsal column lacerations of the spinal cord, indicating that they were transmitted via this tract. Magnetically induced motor evoked potentials (M-MEPs) were elicited in mice following transcranial MS and recorded from the gastrocnemius muscles. M-MEPs performed on myelin deficient mice demonstrated longer onset latencies and smaller amplitudes than in wild-type mice. Magnetically induced H-reflexes (MH-reflexes) which assess local circuitry in the lumbosacral area of the spinal cord were performed in rats. This response disappeared following an L3 contusion spinal cord injury, however, kainic acid (KA) injection at L3, known to selectively destroy interneurons, caused a shorter latency and an increase in the amplitude of the MH-reflex. M-SSEPs and MH-reflexes in rats and M-MEPs in mice compliment locomotor evaluation in assessing the functional integrity of the spinal cord under normal and pathological conditions in the non-sedated animal. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

After an increased number of case reports, the characteristic age group and sex distribution of abdominal cocoon have changed. Although the etiology is unknown, congenital malformation is implicated as the causative factor in the two patients in this report. Although preoperative diagnosis is a matter of challenge and usually made at laparotomy, our experience suggests that computed tomographic evidence of clustered small bowel loops encased by a thin membrane-like sac is a characteristic preoperative finding in patients with abdominal cocoon.

38649089487	Emodin-induced generation of reactive oxygen species inhibits RhoA activation to sensitize gastric carcinoma cells to anoikis	RhoA is a critical signaling molecule regulating a variety of cellular processes, such as cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, and apoptosis. It is recently considered responsive to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nevertheless, how RhoA regulates anoikis, a detachment-initiated apoptosis, and how this regulation is affected by ROS are not clear. The present study investigated the role of RhoA in apoptosis/anoikis in gastric cancer cells and the changes of RhoA and anoikis under oxidative stress. Immunohistochemistry showed that RhoA expression was upregulated in the primary gastric carcinoma compared with normal gastric mucosa. Overactivation of RhoA by transfection with the V14RhoA mutant prevented gastric cancer line SGC-7901 cells from arsenic-induced apoptosis and conferred anoikis resistance through, at least in part, promoting formations of F-actin fibers and focal adhesion. Oxidative stress caused by emodin, an ROS producer, in combination with arsenic trioxide (ATO) led to RhoA inactivation that triggered structural disruption of focal adhesion complex and eventually resulted in anoikis, and these effects could be partially reversed by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). In conclusion, activation of RhoA is required for the maintenance of anoikis resistance phenotype of gastric cancer cells, and oxidative stress might be a therapeutic strategy for the inhibition of RhoA in cancer cells.

40249093059	A core Klf circuitry regulates self-renewal of embryonic stem cells	Embryonic stem (ES) cells are unique in their ability to self-renew indefinitely and maintain pluripotency. These properties require transcription factors that specify the gene expression programme of ES cells. It has been possible to reverse the highly differentiated state of somatic cells back to a pluripotent state with a combination of four transcription factors: Klf4 is one of the reprogramming factors required, in conjunction with Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc. Maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells requires Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc, but Klf4 is dispensable. Here, we show that Krüppel-like factors are required for the self-renewal of ES cells. Simultaneous depletion of Klf2, Klf4 and Klf5 lead to ES cell differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to microarray assay reveals that these Klf proteins share many common targets of Nanog, suggesting a close functional relationship between these factors. Expression analysis after triple RNA interference (RNAi) of the Klfs shows that they regulate key pluripotency genes, such as Nanog. Taken together, our study provides new insight into how the core Klf circuitry integrates into the Nanog transcriptional network to specify gene expression that is unique to ES cells.

31944443120	Alteration of protein subcellular location and domain formation by alternative translational initiation	Alternative translation is an important cellular mechanism contributing to the generation of proteins and the diversity of protein functions. Instead of studying individual cases, we systematically analyzed the alteration of protein subcellular location and domain formation by alternative translational initiation in eukaryotes. The results revealed that 85.7% of alternative translation events generated biological diversity, attributed to different subcellular localizations and distinct domain contents in alternative isoforms. Analysis of isoelectric point values revealed that most N-terminal truncated isoforms significantly lowered their isoelectric point values targeted at different subcellular localizations, whereas they had conserved domain contents the same as the full-length isoforms. Furthermore, Fisher's exact test indicated that the two ways-targeting at different cellular compartments and changing domain contents-were negatively associated. The N-term truncated isoforms should have only one way to diversify their functions distinct from the full-length ones. The peculiar consequence of subcellular relocation as well as change of domain contents reflected the very high level of biological complexity as alternative usage of initiation codons. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

84888015350	Reciprocal modulation between microglia and astrocyte in reactive gliosis following the CNS injury	Reactive gliosis, also known as glial scar formation, is an inflammatory response characterized by the proliferation of microglia and astrocytes as well as astrocytic hypertrophy following injury in the central nervous system (CNS). The glial scar forms a physical and molecular barrier to isolate the injured area from adjacent normal nervous tissue for re-establishing the integrity of the CNS. It prevents the further spread of cellular damage but represents an obstacle to regrowing axons. In this review, we integrated the current findings to elucidate the tightly reciprocal modulation between activated microglia and astrocytes in reactive gliosis and proposed that modification of cellular response to the injury or cellular reprogramming in the glial scar could lead advances in axon regeneration and functional recovery after the CNS injury. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Markers of oxidative damages, inflammation, and vascular remodeling were observed by immunohistochemical staining after 3 days and 1, 3, and 8 weeks after IH exposures. Endogenous MT was induced after 3 days of IH but was significantly decreased after 8 weeks of IH. Compared with the wild-type mice, MT knock-out mice exhibited earlier and more severe pathogenic changes of oxidative damages, inflammatory responses, and cellular apoptosis, as indicated by the significant accumulation of collagen, increased levels of connective tissue growth factor, transforming growth factor β 1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1,3-nitrotyrosine, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in the aorta. These findings suggested that chronic IH may lead to aortic damages characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, and MT may play a pivotal role in the above pathogenesis process.

43949142773	Could calcitonin be a useful therapeutic agent for trigeminal neuralgia?	Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has been recognized as one of the most common neurovascular syndromes caused by the vascular contact of the trigeminal nerve in its root entry zone (REZ) with a branch of the superior or anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, leading to a demyelinization of trigeminal sensory fibers within either the nerve root or, less commonly, the brainstem. There is a lack of certainty regarding the aetiology and pathophysiology of TN, therefore the treatment of trigeminal neuropathic pain disorders continues to be a major therapeutic challenge. The identification of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of these disorders is important. Calcitonin (especially intranasal) provides an interesting analgesic effect in a series of painful conditions including reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, adhesive capsulitis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, vertebral crush fractures and metastasis, phantom limb pain, etc. Exogenous calcitonin is thought to cross the blood-brain barrier and to accumulate slowly in the brain, inducing analgesia once sufficient receptors are occupied. We hypothesize that calcitonin may has anti - trigeminal neuralgia properties.

53349096952	Effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 on pituitary tumor transforming gene in glioma C6 cells	Objective: To investigate the effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) in glioma C6 cells. Methods: Glioma C6 cells were divided into four groups: A group, treated without IGF-1; B group, treated with 0.1 ng/mL dose of IGF-1; C group, treated with 1 ng/mL dose of IGF-1; D group, treated with 10 ng/mL dose of IGF-1. PTTG mRNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting was used to detect the expression of PTTG protein. Results: The expressions of PTTG mRNA were 1.370 ± 0.212, 2.198 ± 0.354, 3.452 ± 0.332, and 4.576 ± 0.387 respectively in the four groups, and there was a significantly difference between any two groups (P < 0.01). The protein expressions of PTTG in the four groups were 1.407 ± 0.334, 1.813 ± 0.465, 2.412 ± 0.576, and 3.128 ± 0.665 respectively, and there was a significantly difference between any two groups (P < 0.01). Conclusion: IGF-1 can up-regulate the expression of PTTG significantly in dosage-dependent manner. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.

64549151575	Identification and characterization of a chitinase-produced bacillus showing significant antifungal activity	Strain MY75 is a gram-positive, aerobic, endospore-forming bacterium that can secrete high levels of extracellular chitinase (4.645 U/ml) when chitin powder exists as an inducer. This strain was identified as Bacillus licheniformis using the Biolog MicroLog microbial identification system and sequence analysis of 16S rDNA, gyrA and rpoB genes. Strain MY75 has the ability to inhibit the growth of Gibberella saubinetii and Aspergillus niger, two major pathogenic fungi in agriculture, and to restrain their spore germination completely. The chitinase was proved to play an important role in the strain's antifungal activity. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

64749107750	Inhibition of Behcet's disease by calcitonin	Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by relapsing oral aphthous and genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, erythemanodosum and folliculitis-like lesions of the skin, arthritis, and central nervous system involvement. Its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated but the etiology is accepted to be multifactorial, therefore the treatment of Behcet's disease continues to be a major therapeutic challenge. The identification of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of these disorders is important. Calcitonin (CT), a peptide hormone secreted in response to hypercalcemia, has the dual effect of inhibiting osteoclast recruitment as well as their resorptive activity. A number of reviews have concluded that salmon calcitonin is safe and effective in the treatment of osteoporosis. Calcitonin abrogated the stimulating effect of RANKL or prednisolone; similar results were obtained with OPG. Additionally, the analgesic activity of salmon calcitonin has been shown in several controlled prospective double-blind studies to improve pain. Exogenous calcitonin is thought to cross the blood-brain barrier and to accumulate slowly in the brain, inducing analgesia once sufficient receptors are occupied. Since CT could antagonize resorptive and analgesic activity by competitively binding to CTR and has been considered as a specific antagonist, we postulate that the CT could function as a novel agent to inhibit BD. In our opinion, if the hypothesis proved to be practical, CT could be widely used in clinical settings to treat BD. © 2009.

68149145797	Derivation and characterization of hepatic progenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells	The derivation of hepatic progenitor cells from human embryonic stem (hES) cells is of value both in the study of early human liver organogenesis and in the creation of an unlimited source of donor cells for hepatocyte transplantation therapy. Here, we report for the first time the generation of hepatic progenitor cells derived from hES cells. Hepatic endoderm cells were generated by activating FGF and BMP pathways and were then purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting using a newly identified surface marker, N-cadherin. After co-culture with STO feeder cells, these purified hepatic endoderm cells yielded hepatic progenitor colonies, which possessed the proliferation potential to be cultured for an extended period of more than 100 days. With extensive expansion, they co-expressed the hepatic marker AFP and the biliary lineage marker KRT7 and maintained bipotential differentiation capacity. They were able to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, which expressed ALB and AAT, and into cholangiocyte-like cells, which formed duct-like cyst structures, expressed KRT19 and KRT7, and acquired epithelial polarity. In conclusion, this is the first report of the generation of proliferative and bipotential hepatic progenitor cells from hES cells. These hES cell-derived hepatic progenitor cells could be effectively used as an in vitro model for studying the mechanisms of hepatic stem/progenitor cell origin, self-renewal and differentiation. © 2009 Zhao et al.

70349114302	A genome-wide screen for spatially restricted expression patterns identifies transcription factors that regulate glial development	Forward genetic screens in genetically accessible invertebrate organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster have shed light on transcription factors that specify formation of neurons in the vertebrate CNS. However, invertebrate models have, to date, been uninformative with respect to genes that specify formation of the vertebrate glial lineages. All recent insights into specification of vertebrate glia have come via monitoring the spatial and temporal expression patterns of individual transcription factors during development. In studies described here, we have taken this approach to the genome scale with an in silico screen of the Mahoney pictorial atlas of transcription factor expression in the developing CNS. From the population of 1445 known or probable transcription factors encoded in the mouse genome, we identify 12 novel transcription factors that are expressed in glial lineage progenitor cells. Entry-level screens for biological function establish one of these transcription factors, Klf15, as sufficient for genesis of precocious GFAP-positive astrocytes in spinal cord explants. Another transcription factor, Tcf4, plays an important role in maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitors. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.

70449534874	Efficient generation of hepatocyte-like cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells	Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells, and can proliferate intensively and differentiate into a variety of cell types. However, the hepatic differentiation of human iPS cells has not yet been reported. In this report, human iPS cells were induced to differentiate into hepatic cells by a stepwise protocol. The expression of liver cell markers and liver-related functions of the human iPS cell-derived cells were monitored and compared with that of differentiated human ES cells and primary human hepatocytes. Approximately 60% of the differentiated human iPS cells at day 7 expressed hepatic markers alpha fetoprotein and Alb. The differentiated cells at day 21 exhibited liver cell functions including albumin Asecretion, glycogen synthesis, urea production and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. The expression of hepatic markers and liver-related functions of the iPS cell-derived hepatic cells were comparable to that of the human ES cell-derived hepatic cells. These results show that human iPS cells, which are similar to human ES cells, can be efficiently induced to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells. © 2009 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

72449121822	Could MTA be a novel medicine on the recurrence therapy for GCTB?	Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a benign locally aggressive bone tumor with a shown clinical behavior of local recurrences and rare distant metastases. Surgical treatment of GCTB is associated with high morbidity, and local recurrence. Due to the high rate of pulmonary metastases recurrent GCTB may be considered as a severe disease. If the tumor reaches close to the articulating surface a subchondral bone graft can be performed without risking a higher recurrence rate. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been widely used to repair various kinds of tooth perforations. MTA is a powder aggregate containing mineral oxides with a good biological action and may facilitate the regeneration of the periodontal ligament and formation of bone. MTA used was able to induce bone regeneration and had its action optimized. Study has showed that, in the presence of MTA, cells grow faster and produce more mineralized matrix gene expression in osteoblasts. We hypothesize that MTA may has anti-recurrence properties. For the clinical point of view, we can apply MTA in the GCTB to induce bone production, then to inhibit the recurrent of the cases. MTA may be the therapy of choice for primary as well as recurrent giant cell tumors of bone. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

74049139078	Purification and partial characterization of a 36-kDa chitinase from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. colmeri, and its biocontrol potential	Chitinase A (ChiA) produced by Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. colmeri 15A3 (Bt. 15A3) was expressed in Escherichia coli XL-Blue. The ChiA was purified using Sephadex G-200 and its molecular mass was estimated to be 36 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Detection of chitinase activity on SDS-PAGE after protein renaturation indicated that the molecular mass of the protein band expressing chitinase activity was approximately 72 kDa. This suggests that the dimeric form of ChiA is the enzymatically active form when glycol chitin is used as a substrate. ChiA has optimal activity at 50 °C and retains most of its activity between 20 and 60 °C. The optimum pH for ChiA activity is pH 5.0, and the enzyme is active between pH 4.0 and 8.0. The enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by Ag

76549125423	Co-localization of Nkx6.2 and Nkx2.2 homeodomain proteins in differentiated myelinating oligodendrocytes	Recent studies have suggested that Nkx6.2/Gtx and Nkx2.2 homeodomain transcription factors are involved in the regulation of oligodendrocyte maturation and/or myelination which occur predominantly in postnatal stages. However, their cellular specificity in postnatal central nervous system has not been characterized and their dynamic expressional relationship during oligodendrocyte lineage progression has not been determined. Here we report that both Nkx2.2 and Nkx6.2 are selectively expressed in Olig2+ cells of oligodendrocyte lineage in postnatal spinal cords. Although Nkx6.2 is specifically expressed in the APC+ mature oligodendrocytes, Nkx2.2 is initially expressed in differentiating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) but quickly down-regulated as OPCs undergo terminal differentiation. Intriguingly, Nkx2.2 expression is up-regulated in mature myelinating oligodendrocytes at later stages. The co-expression of Nkx2.2 and Nkx6.2 transcription factors in myelinating oligodendrocytes suggests their functional interactions in the regulation of myelin sheath formation and/or maintenance. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77950847851	Modeling co-expression across species for complex traits: Insights to the difference of human and mouse embryonic stem cells	Complex interactions between genes or proteins contribute substantially to phenotypic evolution. We present a probabilistic model and a maximum likelihood approach for cross-species clustering analysis and for identification of conserved as well as species-specific co-expression modules. This model enables a "soft" cross-species clustering (SCSC) approach by encouraging but not enforcing orthologous genes to be grouped into the same cluster. SCSC is therefore robust to obscure orthologous relationships and can reflect different functional roles of orthologous genes in different species. We generated a time-course gene expression dataset for differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, and compiled a dataset of published gene expression data on differentiating human ES cells. Applying SCSC to analyze these datasets, we identified conserved and species-specific gene regulatory modules. Together with protein-DNA binding data, an SCSC cluster specifically induced in murine ES cells indicated that the KLF2/4/5 transcription factors, although critical to maintaining the pluripotent phenotype in mouse ES cells, were decoupled from the OCT4/SOX2/NANOG regulatory module in human ES cells. Two of the target genes of murine KLF2/4/5, LIN28 and NODAL, were rewired to be targets of OCT4/SOX2/NANOG in human ES cells. Moreover, by mapping SCSC clusters onto KEGG signaling pathways, we identified the signal transduction components that were induced in pluripotent ES cells in either a conserved or a species-specific manner. These results suggest that the pluripotent cell identity can be established and maintained through more than one gene regulatory network. © 2010 Cai et al.

77950364568	Generation of homogeneous PDX1+ pancreatic progenitors from human ES cell-derived endoderm cells	One key step in producing insulin-secreting cells from human embryonic stem (hES) cells is the generation of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (PDX1)-expressing pancreatic progenitor cells. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) has important roles in pancreas development and is widely used to induce pancreatic differentiation of ES cells. When RA was added directly to the activin A-induced hES cells, <20% cells were positive for the pancreatic marker PDX1, whereas the other cells were mainly hepatic cells. We found that when the activin A-induced hES cells were replated and seeded at low cell densities, the addition of RA induced significant pancreatic differentiation and over 70% of cells in culture expressed PDX1. When the endodermal cells were isolated with the surface marker CXCR4 from the activin A-induced culture and further differentiated with RA, a homogeneous PDX1

79851498839	Essential expression and inducible synthesis polymorphism of chitinase in Bacillus thuringiensis	Chitinases were produced by a lot of microorganisms. Chitinase gene expression in most of the chitinase producing bacteria was inducible by chitin. Low levels of chitinase were observed in the presence of glucose. To date, however, the regulation of such chitinase gene in Bacillus thuringiensis had not been well studied. In this paper, all 77 Bacillus thuringiensis strains were grown in the medium with or without chitin. We measured quantitatively the chitinase activity of the cultures. Moreover, we investigated the suppressive effect of glucose on chitinase of 4 strains. Also we studied the relationship between chitin induction and glucose suppression on chitinase. This investigation demonstrated that all tested B. thuringiensis strains could produce chitinase without chitin. After induction, the chitinolytic activity of 31 tested strains had no obvious response to the inducer, whereas 44 stains increased in different degree. Among these strains, most of them did not markedly increase the levels of chitinase, and many stains simultaneously displayed the expression mode of inducible and constitutive. The glucose inhibited the inductive effect of chitin, but it could not inhibit the basal expression of chitinase. Two strains No.38 and No.75 belonged to different expression types. But we just found several different bases in the regulatory region of chitinase genes chiA and chiB from them. © 2010 CJB, All rights reserved.

79961088496	Rapid growth of a hepatocellular carcinoma and the driving mutations revealed by cell-population genetic analysis of whole-genome data	We present the analysis of the evolution of tumors in a case of hepatocellular carcinoma. This case is particularly informative about cancer growth dynamics and the underlying driving mutations. We sampled nine different sections from three tumors and seven more sections from the adjacent nontumor tissues. Selected sections were subjected to exon as well as whole-genome sequencing. Putative somatic mutations were then individually validated across all 9 tumor and 7 nontumor sections. Among the mutations validated, 24 were amino acid changes; in addition, 22 large indels/copy number variants (>1 Mb) were detected. These somatic mutations define four evolutionary lineages among tumor cells. Separate evolution and expansion of these lineages were recent and rapid, each apparently having only one lineage-specific protein-coding mutation. Hence, by using a cell-population genetic definition, this approach identified three coding changes (CCNG1, P62, and an indel/fusion gene) as tumor driver mutations. These three mutations, affecting cell cycle control and apoptosis, are functionally distinct from mutations that accumulated earlier, many of which are involved in inflammation/immunity or cell anchoring. These distinct functions of mutations at different stages may reflect the genetic interactions underlying tumor growth.

84856032920	Mouse intermittent hypoxia mimicking apnoea of prematurity: Effects on myelinogenesis and axonal maturation	Premature babies are at high risk for both infantile apnoea and long-term neurobehavioural deficits. Recent studies suggest that diffuse structural changes in brain white matter are a positive predictor of poor cognitive outcomes. Since oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination, axon development, and synapse formation mainly occur in the third trimester of gestation and first postnatal year, infantile apnoea could lead to and/or exaggerate white matter impairments in preterm neonates. Therefore, we investigated oligodendroglia and axon development in a neonatal mouse model of intermittent hypoxia between postnatal days 2 and 10. During critical phases of central nervous system development, intermittent hypoxia induced hypomyelination in the corpus callosum, striatum, fornix, and cerebellum, but not in the pons or spinal cord. Intermittent hypoxia-elicited alterations in myelin-forming processes were reflected by decreased expression of myelin proteins, including MBP, PLP, MAG, and CNPase, possibly due to arrested maturation of oligodendrocytes. Ultrastructural abnormalities were apparent in the myelin sheath and axon. Immature oligodendrocytes were more vulnerable to neonatal intermittent hypoxia exposures than developing axons, suggesting that hypomyelination may contribute, at least partially, to axonal deficits. Insufficient neurofilament synthesis with anomalous components of neurofilament subunits, β-tubulin, and MAP2 isoforms indicated immaturity of axons in intermittent hypoxia-exposed mouse brains. In addition, down-regulation of synapsin I, synaptophysin, and Gap-43 phosphorylation suggested a potential stunt in axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. The region-selective and complex impairment in brain white matter induced by intermittent hypoxia was further associated with electrophysiological changes that may underlie long-term neurobehavioural sequelae.

84859907605	Tcf7l2 is tightly controlled during myelin formation	Recent, studies have shown that Tcf7l2, an important transcription factor in Wnt pathway, plays critical roles in oligodendrocyte development. In this article we report a study showing that Tcf7l2 is under tight regulation during myelin formation. We have found that during early development, Tcf7l2 mRNA appears much earlier than the protein, suggesting a regulation at the translational level. We induced demyelination in a mouse model by a dietary toxin, where remyelination followed after a few weeks, and found that Tcf7l2 protein was expressed specifically during the active remyelination phase. Similarly, in human patients with demyelination diseases, Tcf7l2 protein expression was specifically promoted in regions undergoing active remyelination. During remyelination, Tcf7l2 was only expressed in non-dividing oligodendrocyte precursors and was associated with modest levels of nuclear beta-catenin. We also documented that Tcf7l2 could form protein complex with Olig2, but not with Olig1. Our data showed that during myelin formation, Tcf7l2/beta-catenin is regulated temporally, spatially, and also at levels of expression. These data suggest a key role for Tcf7l2 in myelination/remyelination processes via a tightly controlled activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the interaction with Olig2. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84862811704	The direct repeat sequence upstream of Bacillus chitinase genes is cis-acting elements that negatively regulate heterologous expression in E. coli	To explore the influence of the direct repeat sequence (DRS) in Bacillus chitinase genes on heterogonous expression in Escherichia coli, we cloned and sequenced the entire open reading frame (ORF) and upstream sequences of the chitinase B (chiB) and chitinase MY75 (chiMY75) from Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus licheniformis. A pair of 8-bp DRS was found upstream of each chi gene. Chi ORFs with a series of truncated DRS were cloned and transformed into E. coli XL-Blue. The activity of the transformants without the DRS were significantly higher in chitinase assays than transformants containing the DRS. SDS-PAGE showed that part and full deletion of the DRS increased chi gene expression by approximately 1.7 and 3.8-fold, respectively. Northern blotting revealed deletion of the DRS regions increased chiB and chiMY75 mRNA expression. Specific binding of DNA-binding factors in the E. coli cell lyaste was observed to both the chiB and chiMY75 promoter regions and DRS elements. This is the first investigation to demonstrate that heterologous expression of Bacillus chi genes in E. coli is negatively regulated by their upstream DRS regions, which act as cis-acting elements. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Sixty SD rats were randomly allocated into a normal control group, a SAH group, a solvent group, and a melatonin group. A rat model of SAH was inducted by injecting autologous blood into prechiasmatic cistern. The melatonin was injected intraperitoneally once (15 mg/kg) in the rats of melatonin group immediately after modeling, and the same amount of drug was given again at 24 hours. Melatonin was alternated by the equal volume of 10% ethanol (15 mL/kg) in the solvent group, the others management were the same with the melatonin group. The normal control group did not give any treatment. Neurological score was assessed 2 days after surgery; synchrotron radiation angiography (SRA) and pathological examination (HE staining) were used to observe in vivo rat intracranial vascular changes and the diameter of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) at day 3. Results: Circled digit oneThe neurobehavioral score in the melatonin group was 15.3 ± 2.9, it was higher than 11.8 ± 2.3 in the SAH group and 11.6 ± 3.4 in the solvent group (all P < 0.05), however, they were all lower than 18 in the normal control group (P < 0.05). Circled digit twoThe ACA diameter was measured by SRA technique, the melatonin group was 304 ± 60 μm. There was significant difference as compared to the 215 ± 36 μm in the SAH group and 211 ± 40 μm in the solvent group (P < 0.05), however, they still lower than 349 ± 26 μm in the normal control group (P < 0.05). Circled digit threePathology measurements of the ACA diameter in the melatonin group was 185 ± 34 μm, in the SAH group was 101 ± 20 μm, and in the solvent group was 103 ± 19 μm. There were significant differences (P < 0.05); However they were all lower than 216 ± 10 μm in the normal control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Melatonin may significantly alleviate SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm. SRA is a novel technique that may directly evaluate the SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm of rats in vivo.

84862291064	Cardiac response to chronic intermittent hypoxia with a transition from adaptation to maladaptation: The role of hydrogen peroxide	Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent respiratory disorder of sleep, and associated with chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Experimental evidence indicates that CIH is a unique physiological state with potentially adaptive and maladaptive consequences for cardio-respiratory homeostasis. CIH is also a critical element accounting for most of cardiovascular complications of OSA. Cardiac response to CIH is time-dependent, showing a transition from cardiac compensative (such as hypertrophy) to decompensating changes (such as failure). CIH-provoked mild and transient oxidative stress can induce adaptation, but severe and persistent oxidative stress may provoke maladaptation. Hydrogen peroxide as one of major reactive oxygen species plays an important role in the transition of adaptive to maladaptive response to OSA-associated CIH. This may account for the fact that although oxidative stress has been recognized as a driver of cardiac disease progression, clinical interventions with antioxidants have had little or no impact on heart disease and progression. Here we focus on the role of hydrogen peroxide in CIH and OSA, trying to outline the potential of antioxidative therapy in preventing CIH-induced cardiac damage. © 2012 Xia Yin et al.

However, little information is available regarding the regulation of chitinase gene expression in Bt. In this study, a shuttle promoter-probe vector was constructed incorporating the thermostable β-galactosidase gene bgaB of B. stearothermophilus as the reporter for the study of Bt promoters. Using this plasmid, the activity of the chiA gene promoter in Bt was investigated. Deletion analysis of the putative chiA promoter region revealed that the sequence located ̃ 75 bp DNA from positions -116 to -42, with respect to the translation start site, is the core promoter of chiA gene. Furthermore, a site for chitin induction was identified near position -36. This site for negative regulation was indicated downstream of the RNA polymerase binding sites of the promoter of chiA. The expression of chiA started in cell grown for about 6 h and reached the maximum after 60 h of incubation. Induction of chiA expression by chitin was demonstrated by an increase in β-galactosidase activity of ̃ 2.5-fold. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

Variant sequencing-based approaches for identifying deletions have been developed, but their powers to detect those deletions that affect medium-sized regions are limited when the sequencing coverage is low.Results: We present a cost-effective method for identifying medium-sized deletions in genomic regions with low genomic coverage. Two mate-paired libraries were separately constructed from human cancerous tissue to generate paired short reads (ditags) from restriction fragments digested with a 4-base restriction enzyme. A total of 3 Gb of paired reads (1.0× genome size) was collected, and 175 deletions were inferred by identifying the ditags with disorder alignments to the reference genome sequence. Sanger sequencing results confirmed an overall detection accuracy of 95%. Good reproducibility was verified by the deletions that were detected by both libraries.Conclusions: We provide an approach to accurately identify medium-sized deletions in large genomes with low sequence coverage. It can be applied in studies of comparative genomics and in the identification of germline and somatic variants. © 2013 Gong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Methods: U251MG and U87MG human glioma cell lines were treated with GA and growth and proliferation were investigated by MTT and colony formation assays. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V FITC/PI flow cytometry, mitochondrial membrane potential assays and DAPI nuclear staining. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and GFP-LC3 localisation were used to detect autophagy. Western blotting was used to investigate the molecular changes that occurred in the course of GA treatment. Results: GA treatment significantly suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation, induced apoptosis in U251 and U87MG glioblastoma cells in a timeand dose-dependent manner. GA treatment also lead to the accumulation of monodansylcadaverine (MDC) in autophagic vacuoles, upregulated expressions of Atg5, Beclin 1 and LC3-II, and the increase of punctate fluorescent signals in glioblastoma cells pre-transfected with GFP-tagged LC3 plasmid. After the combination treatment of autophagy inhitors and GA, GA mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death was further potentiated. Conclusion: Our results suggested that autophagic responses play roles as a self-protective mechanism in GA-treated glioblastoma cells, and autophagy inhibition could be a novel adjunctive strategy for enhancing chemotherapeutic effect of GA as an anti-malignant glioma agent.

84877696605	Sperm, but not oocyte, DNA methylome is inherited by zebrafish early embryos	5-methylcytosine is a major epigenetic modification that is sometimes called "the fifth nucleotide." However, our knowledge of how offspring inherit the DNA methylome from parents is limited. We generated nine single-base resolution DNA methylomes, including zebrafish gametes and early embryos. The oocyte methylome is significantly hypomethylated compared to sperm. Strikingly, the paternal DNA methylation pattern is maintained throughout early embryogenesis. The maternal DNA methylation pattern is maintained until the 16-cell stage. Then, the oocyte methylome is gradually discarded through cell division and is progressively reprogrammed to a pattern similar to that of the sperm methylome. The passive demethylation rate and the de novo methylation rate are similar in the maternal DNA. By the midblastula stage, the embryo's methylome is virtually identical to the sperm methylome. Moreover, inheritance of the sperm methylome facilitates the epigenetic regulation of embryogenesis. Therefore, besides DNA sequences, sperm DNA methylome is also inherited in zebrafish early embryos. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84879335644	Melatonin mitigate cerebral vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage: A study of synchrotron radiation angiography	Cerebral vasospasm (CV) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating and unsolved clinical issue. In this study, the rat models, which had been induced SAH by prechiasmatic cistern injection, were treated with melatonin. Synchrotron radiation angiography (SRA) was employed to detect and evaluate CV of animal models. Neurological scoring and histological examinations were used to assess the neurological deficits and CV as well. Using SRA techniques and histological analyses, the anterior cerebral artery diameters of SAH rats with melatonin administration were larger than those without melatonin treatment (p < 0.05). The neurological deficits of SAH rats treated with melatonin were less than those without melatonin treatment (p < 0.05). We concluded that SRA was a precise and in vivo tool to observe and evaluate CV of SAH rats; intraperitoneally administration of melatonin could mitigate CV after experimental SAH. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.

As an effective interventional technique, ultrasound (US) could be a potentially feasible approach to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver therapeutic agents into the brain. Areas covered: This article reviews up-to-date ultrasound-mediated strategies in opening the brain barriers for drug brain delivery. The mechanisms and problems of these approaches are discussed, as well as the challenges and potentials associated with the ultrasound-mediated strategies that are currently available or under development. Expert opinion: Despite recent successes in opening the blood brain barrier (BBB) via microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound, the exact mechanisms of how the barrier is disrupted, remains unknown. A complete understanding of the mechanisms involved in the ultrasound-mediated disruption of the BBB and improving the efficiency of drug delivery to targeted brain regions can greatly facilitate the successful development and translation of the technology. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

MEP responses were recorded biweekly from postnatal (PN) week 1 to week 9 (adult). MEP latencies in PN week 1 rats averaged 23.7 ms and became shorter during early maturation, stabilizing at 6.6 ms at PN week 4. During maturation, the conduction velocity (CV) increased from 2.8 ± 0.2 at PN week 1 to 35.2 ± 3.1 mm/ms at PN week 8. Histology of the spinal cord and sciatic nerves revealed progressive axonal myelination. Expression of the oligodendrocyte precursor markers PDGFRα and NG2 were downregulated in spinal cords, and myelin-relevant proteins such as GalC, CNP, and MBP increased during maturation. Oligodendrocyte-lineage markers Olig2 and MOG, expressed in myelinated oligodendrocytes, peaked at PN week 3 and were downregulated thereafter. A similar expression pattern was observed in neurofilament M/H subunits that were extensively phosphorylated in adult spinal cords but not in neonatal spinal cords, suggesting an increase in axon diameter and myelin formation. Ultrastructural morphology in the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) showed axon myelination of the VLF axons (99.3%) at PN week 2, while 44.6% were sheathed at PN week 1. Increased axon diameter and myelin thickness in the VLF and sciatic nerves were highly correlated to the CV (rs > 0.95). This suggests that MEPs could be a predicator of morphological maturity of myelinated axons in descending motor tracts. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84890026959	Determination of genomic copy number alteration emphasizing a restriction site-based strategy of genome re-sequencing	Motivation: Copy number abbreviation (CNA) is one type of genomic aberration that is often induced by genome instability and is associated with diseases such as cancer. Determination of the genomewide CNA profile is an important step in identifying the underlying mutation mechanisms. Genomic data based on next-generation sequencing technology are particularly suitable for determination of high-quality CNA profile. Now is an important time to reevaluate the use of sequencing techniques for CNA analysis, especially with the rapid growth of the different targeted genome and whole-genome sequencing strategies. Results: In this study, we provide a comparison of resequencing strategies, with regard to their utility, applied to the same hepatocellular carcinoma sample for copy number determination. These strategies include whole-genome, exome and restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. The last of these strategies is a targeted sequencing technique that involves cutting the genome with a restriction enzyme and isolating the targeted sequences. Our data demonstrate that RAD sequencing is an efficient and comprehensive strategy that allows the cost-effective determination of CNAs. Further investigation of RAD sequencing data led to the finding that a precise measurement of the allele frequency would be a helpful complement to the read depth for CNA analysis for two reasons. First, knowledge of the allele frequency helps to resolve refined calculations of allele-specific copy numbers, which, in turn, identify the functionally important CNAs that are under natural selection on the parental alleles. Second, this knowledge enables deconvolution of CNA patterns in complex genomic regions. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

84894142222	Identification of an antifungal bacillus strain and studies on its antifungal active ingredients	Strain NK-2 which has broad spectrum of antifungal activity against eight kinds of phytopathogenic fungi was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens by analysis of partial 16S rDNA, gyrA gene, and rpoB gene sequences. The crude protein, obtained from NK-2 culture, exhibited inhibitory activity on mycelial growth and conidial spore germination of Fusarium oxysporum. The crude proteins were further purified by Sephadex G-200 and the antifungal fraction was checked by SDS-PAGE. The putative active protein was then analyzed by Tandem mass spectrum. The result revealed that the target protein was high similar to protein YhfE from B. amyloliquefaciens FZB 42. Then we cloned the yhfE (GenBank accession: HM143898) from NK-2 genome and expressed it in Escherichia coli BL21. The purified recombinant YhfE protein could also inhibit the spore germination and mycelial growth of F. oxysporum. We have found for the first time, to our knowledge, that YhfE has antifungal activity. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84900322139	Gelatin nanostructured lipid carriers-mediated intranasal delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor enhances functional recovery in hemiparkinsonian rats	Lipid nanoparticles with solid matrix have been given increasing attention due to their biodegradable status and ability to entrap a variety of biologically active compounds. In this study, new phospholipid-based gelatin nanoparticles encapsulating basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were developed to target the brain via nasal administration. Treatment effects were assessed by quantifying rotational behavior, monoamine neurotransmitter levels and tyrosine hydroxylase expression in 6-hydroxydopamine induced hemiparkinsonian rats. The gelatin nanostructured lipid carriers (GNLs) were prepared by a water-in-water emulsion method and then freeze-dried. The GNLs possessed better profile than gelatin nanoparticles (GNs), with particle size 143. ± 1.14. nm and Zeta potential - 38.2. ± 1.2. mV. The intranasal GNLs efficiently enriched exogenous bFGF in olfactory bulb and striatum without adverse impact on the integrity of nasal mucosa and showed obvious therapeutic effects on hemiparkinsonian rats. Thus, GNLs are attractive carriers for nose-to-brain drug delivery, especially for unstable macromolecular drugs such as bFGF. From the Clinical Editor: This team of authors reports the development of phospholipid-based gelatin nanoparticles encapsulating basic fibroblast growth factor to target the brain via intranasal administration. A rat model of hemiparkinsonism was applied demonstrating a good safety profile and an obvious therapeutic effect. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84899096445	Metallothionein prevents intermittent hypoxia-induced cardiac endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell death likely via activation of Akt signaling pathway in mice	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, an adaptive response normally, causes apoptotic cell death under pathological conditions. Cardiac ER stress and associated cell death involve in the inflammatory responses that often cause cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Here we examined whether chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) induces cardiac ER stress and associated cell death along with inflammatory response and if so, whether these effects can be affected by transgenic overexpression or deletion of metallothionein gene (MT-TG or MT-KO). IH exposures for 3 days to 4 weeks significantly increased cardiac ER stress and apoptosis, shown by the increased expression of GRP78, ATF6 and CHOP, the activation of caspase-12 and capase-3, and the decreased Bcl2/Bax expression ratio, predominantly in the 3rd week of IH exposures. These effects were significantly exacerbated in MT-KO mice, but completely prevented in MT-TG mice. In vitro mechanistic study with H9c2 cardiac and primary neonatal cardiomyocytes showed that MT protection from ER stress-induced apoptosis was mediated by up-regulating Akt phosphorylation since inhibition of Akt phosphorylation abolished MT's protection MT from ER stress and apoptosis. These findings suggest that chronic IH is able to induce cardiac ER stress, cell death and inflammation can be prevented by MT, probably via up-regulation of Akt function. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84900411054	Current approaches to enhance CNS delivery of drugs across the brain barriers	Although many agents have therapeutic potentials for central nervous system (CNS) diseases, few of these agents have been clinically used because of the brain barriers. As the protective barrier of the CNS, the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier maintain the brain microenvironment, neuronal activity, and proper functioning of the CNS. Different strategies for efficient CNS delivery have been studied. This article reviews the current approaches to open or facilitate penetration across these barriers for enhanced drug delivery to the CNS. These approaches are summarized into three broad categories: noninvasive, invasive, and miscellaneous techniques. The progresses made using these approaches are reviewed, and the associated mechanisms and problems are discussed. © 2014 Lu et al.

84899647110	Postoperative hemorrhage in an elderly patient with a glioblastoma multiform and a calcified chronic subdural hematoma	Background: Cases with brain tumor and subdural hematoma are rare; surgical management of the elderly patients with a glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and a chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) can be intractable.Case description: We report a 77-year-old patient, who had a left front lobe GBM and a giant, calcified, left frontoparietaloccipitotemporal CSDH. The patient recovered well from anesthesia after removal of the GBM and CSDH. However, the patient developed severe hemiplegia and aphasia because of the in-situ hemorrhage 1 day later. Laboratory tests indicated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) leading to the postoperative hemorrhage. The patient was left with hemiparesis and alalia after the in-situ hematoma evacuation.Conclusions: We presume elderly patients have a higher incidence of postoperative hemorrhage in residual intracranial cavity owing to higher possibility to get DIC. A less aggressive surgical management could be a more appropriate choice. © 2014 Cai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84904770801	Anti-inflammatory activity of extracts of Bushen-Qiangdu-Zhilv decoction, a Chinese medicinal formula, in M1-polarized RAW264.7	Background: Bushen-Qiangdu-Zhilv Decoction (BQZ) is one of famous traditional Chinese medical formula for treating ankylosing spondylitis (AS). However, the mechanisms underlying effects of BQZ remains unknown. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1, play an important role in AS. We therefore evaluated if BQZ could affect the expression of these cytokines. Methods: Crude extracts were prepared and fractioned with petroleum ether (PE), ethyl acetate (EA), n-butanol (BU) and finally water (ACE). The stability of the extracts was confirmed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. M1-polarized RAW264.7 was induced and subsequently treated with BQZ extracts. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed to measure mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-1. Results: It was found that TNF-α could be significantly suppressed by ACE extracts, whereas IL-1 was dramatically inhibited by BU extracts, which was further confirmed by dose-dependent experiments. Importantly, MTS assays showed that both ACE and BU extracts had a low cytotoxicity.Conclusion: Altogether, our study indicates that BQZ decoction exerts anti-AS effects via its anti-inflammatory activity and may have a low side-effect. Further analysis of the extracts of BQZ decoction could lead to a discovery of some novel drugs adding to therapeutic strategy for AS patients.

84904133191	Dynamic monitoring of wetland cover changes using time-series remote sensing imagery	Time-series remote sensing data, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data hold considerable promise for investigating long-term dynamics of land use/cover change (LUCC), given their significant advantages of frequent temporal coverage and free cost. However, because of the complex ecological environment of wetlands, the applicability of these data for studying temporal dynamics of wetland-related land-cover types is limited. This is especially so for the Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, which has active seasonal and inter-annual dynamics. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the suitability of MODIS 250-m maximum value composite (MVC) vegetation indexes (VIs) for dynamics monitoring of the Poyang Lake. We applied a time-series 16-day MODIS NDVI from 2000 to 2012 and developed a method to classify wetland cover types based on timing of inundation. We combined techniques of applying iterative self-organizing data analysis (ISODATA) with varying numbers of clusters and a transformed divergence (TD) statistic, to implement annual classification of smoothed time-series NDVI. In addition, we propose a decision tree based on features derived from NDVI profiles, to characterize phenological differences among clusters. Supported by randomly generated validation samples from TM images and daily water level records, we obtained a satisfactory accuracy assessment report. Classification results showed various change patterns for four dominant land cover types. Water area showed a non-significant declining trend with average annual change rate 33.25km

84905963343	Exome sequencing identifies frequent mutation of MLL2 in non-small cell lung carcinoma from Chinese patients	Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with an estimated 1.4 million deaths each year. Here we report whole-exome sequencing of nine tumor/normal tissue pairs from Chinese patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). This allows us to identify a number of significantly mutated genes in NSCLC, which were highly enriched in DNA damage repair, NF-κ B pathway, JAK/STAT signaling and chromatin modification. Notably, we identify a histone-lysine methyltransferase gene, namely, MLL2, as one of the most significantly mutated genes in our screen. In a following validation study, we identify deleterious mutations of MLL2 in 12 out of 105 (11.4%) NSCLC patients. Additionally, reduced or lost expression of MLL2 was commonly observed in tumor tissues as compared with paired adjacent non-tumor tissues regardless of mutation status. Together, our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in Chinese NSCLC and supports the role of MLL2 mutation in the pathogenesis of the disease.

11044238816	Characterization of melanin produced by a wild-type strain of Bacillus thuringiensis	Bt L-7601 is a UV resistant wild-type strain, which belongs to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. dendrolimus serotype H4a4b. It was isolated from nature, and produced a dark brown pigment during the exponential phase of growth. Bt L-7601 had the ability to produce pigment in a general nutrition-abundant medium, which had no L-tyrosine. The pigment was identified as melanin based on chemical testing, its light absorbance, and FT-IR analysis. Bt L-7601 has a strong resistance to UV light. After 30 min irradiation its survival rate was 17 times higher than that of the strain B. thuringiensis subsp. colmeri 15A3, which had no pigment. Results of the bioassays of residual insecticidal activity of Bt formulation with and without pigment produced by Bt L-7601 against larvae of Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exigua after exposure to UV irradiation showed that the pigment is an excellent UV protective agent for the insecticidal proteins.

84922002676	Characterization of regulatory regions involved in the inducible expression of chiB in Bacillus thuringiensis	Expression of the chiB gene from Bacillus thuringiensis Bti75 was defined as inducible by the use of transcriptional fusions with the bgaB reporter gene. The transcription start site of the chiB gene was identified as the C base located 132 base pairs upstream of the start codon. Analysis of 5′ and 3′ deletions of the chiB promoter region revealed that the sequence from position −192 to +36 with respect to the transcription start site was necessary for wild-type levels of inducible expression of the chiB gene. The minimal promoter region for the expression of chiB gene was identified as the sequence from position −100 to +12. Furthermore, a 16-bp sequence (designated dre) downstream of the minimal promoter region of chiB was shown to be required for chitin induction. To confirm the function of this 16-bp sequence, 25 base substitutions were introduced into the dre site. Most of the mutations resulted in constitutive expression, or the efficiency of induction decreased. All mutations identified the dre sequence as a critical site for the inducible expression of chiB. In addition, the dre site was shown to interact with a sequence-specific DNA binding factor of strain Bti75 cultured in the absence of the inducer.
