84929741982	A partial-state observer for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems	In this paper, we consider input-affine invertible MIMO nonlinear systems which can be transformed into a special normal form by means of the structure algorithm. The normal form highlights a partial state, a subset of state variables, which plays in this setting a role similar to that of the outputs and its derivatives in a SISO system. It is shown that, if a system in this class can be asymptotically stabilized by means of a static feedback from that partial state, then semiglobal stabilization can be achieved via dynamic feedback driven by the output of the system. The dynamic feedback in question is based a (non-trivial) extension to MIMO systems of the standard high-gain observer.

16644388607	Dynamic modeling and simulation of a commercial naphtha catalytic reforming process	A first principles-based dynamic model for a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) platforming process, the UOP commercial naphtha catalytic reforming process, is developed. The lumping details of the naphtha feed and reaction scheme of the reaction model are given. The process model is composed of the reforming reaction model with catalyst deactivation, the furnace model and the separator model, which is capable of capturing the major dynamics that occurs in this process system. Dynamic simulations are performed based on Gear numerical algorithm and method of lines (MOL), a numerical technique dealing with partial differential equations (PDEs). The results of simulation are also presented. Dynamic responses caused by disturbances in the process system can be correctly predicted through simulations.

20144364503	Characteristics of tailings from metal mines in Hunan Province, China	The tailing soils were from 10 mining areas in Hunan Province. To predict the potential impact of tailings on nearby environments, the characteristics such as the pH value, loss on ignition, cation exchange capacity, and the concentration and speciation of heavy metals in the tailings were investigated. Based on these characteristics, the pollution index and danger index were calculated so as to evaluate the priorities of remediation. The results show that the concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn exceed the tolerable levels of the phytotoxicity in the most tailings. The large proportion of heavy metals exists in the form of residual fraction in most tailings, followed by sulfides/organic and Fe/Mn oxide fractions, and a little in the exchangeable and carbonate fraction. The calculated pollution indices for the tailing samples range from 1.41 to 83.42, which indicates that all the tailings contain heavy metals at a level that causes toxicity to the ecosystem. The danger indices for the tailing samples range from 0.06 to 387.00. The highest value of the danger indices is that of Yongzhou sample, reaching 387.00; the lowest one is that of Xikuangshan sample, only 0.06. Considering the results of pollution index and danger index in combination, the priority of remediation is determined to be Yongzhou, Baoshan, Xiangtan and Lengshuijiang.

24344461860	Fuzzy neural networks based excitation system and governor models	Modeling of excitation system and governor system is vital in power systems calculation. In order to solve some non-linear and uncertain problems, fuzzy neural network (FNN) is proposed in this paper. It is the combination of the fuzzy theory and neural network technology. Developed by steep algorithm, the learning algorithms of FNN are discussed detailed in this paper, so how and why can FNN have both the advantage of fuzzy theory and neural network technology is answered in this paper. Further more, an excitation system model and a governor system models based on FNN, which can be used for on-line and off-line analysis and control respectively, are used to check the performance of FNN. The simulation results demonstrate that the excitation system model and the governor system model based on FNN can give precise estimation of practical system.

3142638959	Effect of pH on cadmium adsorption by red soil	To study the effect of pH on Cd adsorption and species, the red soil was taken as adsorbent. The curve of Cd adsorbed vs pH shows three stages, namely, the adsorption amount increasing slowly at low pH, then increasing quickly with the rise of pH, and reaching the maximum amount at high pH. The result of theoretical analysis on precipitation reactions indicates that the precipitation reaction is controlled by carbonate until pH is a bit higher than 11. The adsorption data at different pH values and initial Cd(II) concentrations were fitted by a linear least squares technique, to the Langmuir, Frundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms, and the results show that Langmuir isotherm is the best which can well describe the adsorption behavior of Cd in red soil. At last, a pH-dependent model of adsorption isotherms of Cd was established by substituting the fitting results obtained from experimental data for the parameters in Langmuir equation.

Using GIS analysis tools and five assessment criteria, China's terrestrial ecosystems and their distribution areas for priority conservation are proposed based on the data of Vegetation in China, China's Wetlands and Atlas of China's vegetation. The criteria include "Dominant ecosystems in the eco-region", "Ecosystems with special climatic, geographic and soil features", "Ecosystems endemic to China", "Ecosystems with extremely rich species", and "Ecosystems with special habitats". Results indicate that China's terrestrial ecosystems can be divided into 683 types, 135 of which are of high priority, including 75 forest ecosystems, 27 wetland ecosystems, 8 shrub ecosystems, 12 steppe ecosystems, 6 meadow ecosystems and 7 desert ecosystems. According to the distribution of priority ecosystems, 18 areas were selected as the center ones for the entire priority ecosystems. These areas should be considered primarily jn the conservation of China's terrestrial ecosystems. This research will contribute to configuration of China's nature reserves and improve the effectiveness of China's biodiversity conservation.

33746374718	Cr(VI) reduction by Bacillus sp. isolated from chromium landfill	Five chromate-reducing strains were isolated from the chromium landfill and two of them, XW-2 and XW-4 were identified as Bacillus sp. The strain of XW-4 was selected to study the resistance to Cr(VI) and its ability to reduce Cr(VI). The strain was found to tolerate Cr(VI) concentration as high as 100 mg/l, but the cells growth was affected by the presence of Cr(VI), especially at the concentration of 100 mg/l. The experiments also demonstrated that toxic Cr(VI) was reduced effectively into comparatively less toxic Cr(III) by the strain of Bacillus sp., XW-4, and bacterial Cr(VI) reduction was enhanced significantly by addition of glucose. The optimum initial pH for Cr(VI) reduction was 9 and final pH value of 5-6 was observed for initial pH 4-10. The cells reduced Cr(VI) more efficiently at 37 °C, compared with that at 20 and 47 °C. Within the same incubation time, more amount of Cr(VI) was reduced at higher initial Cr(VI) concentration ranging from 10 to 80 mg/l. Bacterial Cr(VI) reduction was not influenced by NO

Effects of pH, initial concentration, contact time, temperature and agitation rate on the biosorption of Cd(II) and Zn(II) ions were studied. The optimum adsorption pH value for Cd(II) and Zn(II) were 4.0 and 6.0. The best temperature and agitation rate were in the range of 25-30°C and 120 r/min for all metal ions. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum uptake capacities of Cd(II) and Zn(II) ions are 15.50 mg/g and 23.70 mg/g at initial concentrations of 75 mg/L and 150 mg/L, respectively. Biosorption equilibrium is established within 24 h for cadmium and zinc ions. The adsorption data provide an excellent fit to Langmuir isotherm model. The results of the kinetic studies show that the rate of adsorption follows the pseudo-second order kinetics.

33747382464	Designing a conservation plan for protecting the habitat for giant pandas in the Qionglai mountain range, China	Population viability of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is threatened by small population sizes in scattered isolated habitat areas. Designing a conservation plan for protecting and connecting the fragmented habitat will improve the chances for survival of this endangered species. For such a plan, this study assessed the overall habitat suitability for the species in the Qionglai mountain range (Sichuan, China) using Landsat TM imagery acquired in 2001, geographical data, field surveys, and information acquired in previous researches. Results show that the habitat is separated by roads and rivers, as well as by human settlements and cropland areas, into four main habitat blocks. Overlapping these four habitat blocks with the current nature reserve network reveals that only 36% of the total habitat is protected within nature reserves. Thus, the current nature reserve network is failing to preserve essential habitat for dispersal and genetic exchange. In this study, five key areas and four linkage areas were identified and suggested as nature reserves and/or corridors. These areas, together with the six currently established nature reserves in the mountain range, will form a conservation unit for facilitating the exchange of giant panda individuals among previously isolated habitat blocks. Policies recently implemented by the Chinese government, including the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), could aid in the formation of such a conservation unit. © 2006 The Authors.

33751360973	CCR3 monoclonal antibody inhibits airway eosinophilic inflammation and mucus overproduction in a mouse model of asthma	Aim: To explore the effect of a rat anti-mouse CC-chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3) monoclonal antibody (CCR3 mAb) on airway eosinophilia and mucus overproduction in asthmatic mice. Methods: An asthma model was sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin (OVA) in male C57BL/6 mice. Asthmatic mice were given dual administration (intraperitoneal injection and aerosol inhalation) of CCR3 mAb or nonspecific rat IgG (ns-IgG). The number of total and differential inflammatory cells in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was counted. Eosinophils number, the goblet cell percentage (GCP) and airway mucus index (AMI) were measured in the lung tissues. Interleukin (IL)-5 levels in the BALF were examined. The expression of MUC5AC and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA in the lung tissues was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results were compared among the groups. Results: CCR3 mAb significantly suppressed the increased eosinophils in the BALF and lung tissues in OVA-challenged mice compared with ns-IgG-treated mice. IL-5 levels in the BALF in CCR3 mAb and ns-IgG administration mice exhibited no obvious changes relative to OVA-challenged asthmatic mice. CCR3 mAb reduced the increased GCP and AMI after OVA challenge and decreased the enhanced expression of MUC5AC and EGFR mRNA in lung tissues in asthmatic animals. Conclusion: CCR3 mAb can significantly inhibit airway eosinophilia and mucus overproduction in asthmatic mice. Blockage of CCR3 may represent a new strategy to asthma therapy. © 2006 CPS and SIMM.

33750917293	Remediation of oily soil in gas station using humic acid as surfactant	The compared research on remediations of oily soil in gas station by using humic acid, biosurfactant (rhamnolipid) and synthetic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfonate, SDS) respectively was made. The results show that three surfactant solutions can remove significant amount of oil from soil compared with water alone. Rhamnolipid performs excellently with a maximum removal of 61.4%, the performance of humic acid is almost the same as SDS, with a maximum removal of 56.6% and 57.1%, respectively. Meanwhile surfactant solution concentration and oily soil type both have great effect on soil washing, the oil removal is increased with the increase of mass concentration of solution when mass concentration of solution is not above CMC, but when it is beyond the CMC, oil removal do not show further enhancement. Three surfactant solutions remove more oil from fresh soils than from weathered soil. Hence, the use of solutions of natural HAs appears as a better choice for soil washings of highly oil-polluted-soils due to their additional capacity to promote microbial activity in contrast to synthetic surfactants.

33846224828	Kinetic and equilibrium studies of Cr(VI) biosorption by dead Bacillus licheniformis biomass	Many studies have been carried out on the biosorption capacity of different kinds of biomass. However, reports on the kinetic and equilibrium study of the biosorption process are limited. In our experiments, the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution was investigated in a batch system by sorption on the dead cells of Bacillus licheniformis isolated from metal-polluted soils. Equilibrium and kinetic experiments were performed at various initial metal concentrations, pH, contact time, and temperatures. The biomass exhibited the highest Cr(VI) uptake capacity at 50°C, pH 2.5 and with the initial Cr(VI) concentration of 300 mg/g. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were considered to identify the isotherm that could better describe the equilibrium adsorption of Cr(VI) onto biomass. The Langmuir model fitted our experimental data better than the Freundlich model. The suitability of the pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order kinetic models for the sorption of Cr(VI) onto Bacillus licheniformis was also discussed. It is better to apply the pseudo second-kinetic model to describe the sorption system. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

33847020800	Effect of solids concentration on removal of heavy metals from mine tailings via bioleaching	Mining of mineral ore and disposal of resulting waste tailings pose a significant risk to the surrounding environment. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility to remove heavy metals from mine tailings with the use of bioleaching and meanwhile to investigate the effect of solids concentration on removal of heavy metals from mine tailings by indigenous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and the transformation of heavy metal forms after the bioleaching process. This work showed the laboratory results of bioleaching experiments on Pb-Zn-Cu mine tailings. The results showed that 98.08% Zn, 96.44% Cu, and 43.52% Pb could be removed from mine tailings by the bioleaching experiment after 13 days at 1% (w/v) solids concentration and the rates of pH reduction, ORP rise and sulfate production were reduced with the increase of solids concentration, due to the buffering capacity of mine tailing solids. The results also indicated that solid concentration 1% was found to be best to bacterial activity and metal solubilization of the five solids concentration tested (1%, 2%, 5%, 8% and 10%) under the chosen experimental conditions. In addition, the bioleaching had a significant impact on changes in partitioning of heavy metals. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

35548950923	Carbon discharge through municipal solid waste in Haikou, China	With rapid urban development, municipal solid waste (MSW) has become a pressing issue. Estimation of carbon discharge through municipal solid waste provides a way to assess environmental load of solid waste from the viewpoint of the carbon cycle. With few studies on carbon flow in urban ecosystems, this research contributes to urban carbon research and provides insights into human impacts on the carbon cycle. Based on a comprehensive fieldwork investigation of a typical Chinese tourist city - Haikou City, Hainan Island - the characteristics of MSW carbon discharge and human activities that influenced it were analysed. The results indicated that, in 2001, the total carbon discharge from 261.9 Gg of MSW was 105.1 GgC per year, and 174.6 kgC per capita per annum. Carbon is discharged in the form of food scraps (24%), plastics (20%), wood (17%), fabrics (14%), paper (13%), and dust and stone (12%). If landfill received all the waste, 4.7% of MSW carbon would be transformed into methane, with a value of 4.9 GgC. Between 1991 and 1999, Haikou's per capita MSW carbon discharge increased by 59.9%, and total MSW carbon discharge increased by 124.9%. MSW carbon discharge in Haikou is significantly affected by the growth of residential expenditure and urbanisation. Local characteristics of tourism also influence Haikou's MSW carbon discharge, not only in terms of its yearly variation, but also its monthly variation. Integrating data on carbon discharge with carbon consumption will provide a systematic view of the carbon metabolism in urban ecosystems, and further insights into the generation of urban environmental pollution.

38949095302	Variation of carbon storage by different reforestation types in the hilly red soil region of southern China	Reforestation is a mitigation option to reduce increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels as well as its predicted climate change. As a result, several forestry-based carbon storage projects have been introduced in many countries. To quantify the dynamics of ecosystem carbon allocation as affected by different forest management practices, we measured the above- and belowground biomass accumulation over 14 years, as well as the tissue carbon concentrations of trees in four different types: three monospecific plantations of slash pine (Pinus elliottii) (SPP), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) (CFP), and tea-oil camellia (Camellia oleifera) (TCP) and one natural secondary forest (NSF) (Pinus massoniana and Cyclobalanopsis glauca). A regression equation was constructed using the diameter at breast height/basal diameter (DBH/BD) and elements of total tree biomass. The equation was subsequently utilized to estimate tree carbon storage. The carbon storage of understory, forest floor, and soil components was also estimated. Results indicated that NSF stored significantly more carbon (141.99 t/ha) than SPP (104.07 t/ha), CFP (102.95 t/ha), and TCP (113.09 t/ha). Most of the carbon was found in the soil pool (60.30% in SPP, 70.42% in CFP, 63.87% in TCP, and 59.36% in NSF). In addition, more than 60% of the soil carbon storage at 0-100 cm depth was stored in the upper 40 cm. With the exception of trees, each component of NSF, including the understudy, forest floor, and soil, possessed significantly higher carbon storage than that of the three plantations (p < 0.05). Soil surface disturbance during forest management practices was one of the main factors reducing the soil and understory carbon storage of tree plantation stands. These results suggest that natural restoration is a superior approach for increasing the carbon storage potential in the hilly red soil region in reforestation projects compared to plantations. In addition, reducing soil surface disturbance during forest management practices might also play an important factor in improving carbon sequestration potential in above tree plantations. © 2007.

59049087719	Fairness norm and natural resources conservation: An experimental study in Wolong nature reserve	The policy of family-contracted natural forest conservation has recently made remarkable progress in protecting the habitats of giant pandas in Wolong Nature Reserve. However, the optimal outcome could not be derived from rational motivations, as the fairness norm potentially catalyzed the cooperation in the program. To verify this prediction, we undertook field experiments based on one-shot anonymous Ultimatum Games with the local people in the reserve. Subjects' behaviors in the games were recorded and compared with rational expectations. The results lend support to the hypothesis with a total of fair or hyper-fair offers from 96.9% of the proposers. The responders' reluctance to reject low offers, in addition to the information they provided in the post-game interviews indicate that the evolution of the local fairness norm was based on reputation rather than costly punishment. The result unveils a key factor to the success of the forest conservation in Wolong, and demonstrates the effectiveness of facilitating the participation and cooperation of the local community in the natural resource conservation by crowding in the fairness norm. The study also draws attention to the evolution of social capital for sustainable development of social-ecological systems.

59049091330	Fairness norm and natural resources conservation: A theoretical study based on evolutionary game model	Due to the concern with the "tragedy of the commons", the capacity of community governance is usually underrated in natural resource management such as the natural forest conservation. Nevertheless, the recent studies indicated that the individual's behavior is bounded-rational and follows social norms such as fairness. In this study, we developed a mathematical model based on evolutionary game theory and behavioral economics, simulated the evolutionary dynamics of the strategies the local people could choose in the context of family-contracted natural resource conservation, and analyzed the role that the fairness norm could play in the conservation program. The result indicated that the rational players are not able to sustain a high level of cooperation for conservation when the material subsidy is only limited and comparable to the costs needed for monitoring; in contrast, improved level of cooperation is possible if the local people comply with the fairness norm, and the convergent equilibrium is determined by the proportion of the players who highly regard the value of fairness. The result in theory predicted the availability of facilitating the participation and cooperation of the local community in the common resource conservation by crowding in the fairness norm with the ecological compensation policies.

Studies on the characteristics of plant species composition in the built-up areas, however, are hampered by a lack of basic field-based investigation. In this article, the plant species composition in the built-up areas of Beijing, China, is investigated using abundant field observations. The origin of species, chorological spectra, life forms and plant communities were determined. The characteristic species in each type of green space were determined by k-means classification, and urban plant communities were identified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Plant species composition in the built-up areas was further compared with that in natural mountain floras in Beijing to reveal the differences in life form composition and chorological spectra, and the coincidence of species in the two communities. A total of 618 plant species belonging to 349 genera and 103 families were identified. Our results revealed wide chorological spectra with trees dominated by deciduous species. Although native plant species were widely distributed, 53% of the plant species were aliens, among which 67% were introduced from America and other Asian countries. Furthermore, the characteristics of the plant species composition in the built-up areas are significantly different from those of the natural habitats. Our results highlight the dramatic changes in characteristics of plant species composition in the built-up area of Beijing. Several suggestions are proposed to increase the diversity of native species through the planning and management of green spaces. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Initially, a switching model is utilized to describe these network-induced imperfections, which can be denoted as three switching subsystems. Furthermore, in the case of packet dropout, the first-order holder (FOH) is constructed to make the controller use the previous state. A full-order filter is designed to estimate the output signal of the NCS. Based on the employed appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and auxiliary slack matrices, sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs), which can ensure the resulting filtering error dynamical system is bounded and satisfies a prescribed H<inf>∞</inf> disturbance attenuation in a fixed finite-time interval. Subsequently, a numerical example is exploited to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed filter design method.

Simulation indicates that the range of model error within which this system is stable is easy to be derived by using this necessary and sufficient condition.

The study demonstrated that the Cr(VI) can be effectively reduced to Cr(III) by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effects of the factors affecting Cr(VI) reduction rate including carbon source type, pH, initial Cr(VI) concentration and amount of cells inoculum were thoroughly studied. Malate was found to yield maximum biotransformation, followed by succinate and glucose, with the reduction rate of 60.86%, 43.76% and 28.86% respectively. The optimum pH for Cr(VI) reduction was 7.0, with reduction efficiency of 61.71% being achieved. With the increase of initial Cr(VI) concentration, the rate of Cr(VI) reduction decreased. The reduction was inhibited strongly when the initial Cr(VI) concentration increased to 157 mg/L. As the amount of cells inoculum increased, the rate of Cr(VI) reduction also increased. The mechanism of Cr(VI) reduction and final products were also analysed. The results suggested that the soluble enzymes appear to be responsible for Cr(VI) reduction by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the reduced Cr(III) was not precipitated in the form of Cr(OH)

A Gaussian mixture density can be viewed as a contaminated Gaussian density with respect to each Gaussian component in the mixture. A component may not be well represented when the data is analyzed from a mixture density. In this article, Gaussian mixture density modeling and decomposition with weighted likelihood is studied. Then based on the Gaussian mixture density decomposition (GMDD) algorithm and weighted likelihood equations (WLEs), a new algorithm, called weighted Gaussian mixture density decomposition (WGMDD) algorithm is proposed. The WGMDD algorithm is effective and robust. It produces estimates with low bias and mean square error, and makes the applications of GMDD algorithm more extensive and more exact.

44249097584	Harmonic modeling of electric loads based on Instantaneous Symmetrical Components	Aiming at the shortage of conventional methods for harmonic load modeling, a new method based on Instantaneous Symmetrical Components (ISC) is used for three-phase load modeling. Firstly ISC is used to obtain the instantaneous symmetrical components of voltage and current, and these components are used in the calculation of the symmetrical component model parameters-resistance, inductance, capacitance and a harmonic instantaneous current source, which are all connected in parallel. Then a mathematical load model in the form of phase coordinates is obtained, which can be linked with the equations of distribution system when harmonic analysis occurs in frequency domain. The proposed approach is suitable for all types of modeling three-phase loads, and the developed load model can be used in either sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal analysis of electrical energy systems in the domain of time or frequency. Furthermore, this method is simple and quick in computing, and it is applicable for online calculation. At last, this load modeling technique based on ISC is applied to three-phase unbalanced and distorted loads. The simulation results indicate that, by using the ISC method, both symmetric and asymmetric load models can be obtained regardless of the harmonic content of the load, and the proposed method has great validity and accuracy.

44749084224	Impacts of reforestation approaches on runoff control in the hilly red soil region of Southern China	Vegetation structure and soil properties are not only correlated with forest management practices, but also affect soil and water loss significantly. To estimate the long-term influences of regenerating forest cover on soil and water loss from degraded land, the runoff and soil loss in the context of different forest restoration approaches, including a control plot (CL) and plantations of slash pine (Pinus elliottii), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), tea-oil camellia (Camellia oleifera), and natural secondary forest, were monitored in runoff plots over a 4-year period (2000-2003) in a hilly red soil region in Southern China. Relevant ecological factors and management intensity, were also measured. The results indicated that the four forest restoration approaches decreased surface runoff by 63.0-88.1% and soil erosion by 75.5-97.1% compared to the control. Moreover, runoff and soil erosion in tea-camellia plantation (TCP) and natural secondary forest (NSF) plots were significantly lower than with other treatments. Canopy cover, litter fall, plant roots, plant life forms, soil properties, and vegetation structure are important ecological factors that determine the magnitude of soil loss. Vegetation structure and plant life forms are the main factors reducing surface runoff and the movement of sediments. Effective control of soil and water loss in NSF and TCP are closely related to multiply stratified communities and the presence of specific plant life forms (the herbaceous keystone species Dicranopteris linearis), respectively. In addition, the above mentioned factors were sensitive to forest management patterns, including improper mechanical cultivation. Management practices should attempt to minimize disturbances to these factors to control runoff and soil erosion in each forest management unit. In particular, mechanical cultivation should loosen the soil around the base of a tree only, instead of over the entire ground surface, in the early stages of forest restoration. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

45749144325	Ecological quality of Beijing urban area from 1996 to 2005	From the aspects of four ecological themes, i.e., ecological element, ecological process, ecological function and ecological destruction, an indicator framework including 16 indicators was developed to make an integrated assessment on the ecological quality of Beijing urban area. The weights of the indicators were determined by the methods of entropy weight, optimal state weight, and worst state weight, and the ecological element index (EEI), ecological process index (EPI), ecological function index (EFI), ecological destruction index (EDI), and composite ecological index (CEI) were computed by a weighted sum method and served as effective tools for analyzing the evolvement of the ecological quality of Beijing urban area from 1996 to 2005. The results showed that during the period of 1996-2005, the EEI of Beijing urban area did not display visible improvement and maintained a low level, far from the ideal state. The EPI and EFI increased dramatically, and approached to the ideal state in 2005. The EDI fluctuated within a low level, far from ideal state, and did not show an evolutionary trend. The CEI improved year after year, but was still low and did not reach the ideal state. The EPI, EFI, and CEI increased rapidly with economic development when the GDP per capita was less than US $ 3 000, but the decrease was decelerated after the GDP exceeded US $ 3 000. The EEI and EDI were less affected by economic development, but mainly restrained by the natural conditions and global and regional eco-environmental evolvement.

The effect of artificial measurement noise on the identified results was also discussed. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed method is insensitive to the measurement noise and is of very good accuracy.

47549107502	Multi-objective optimization design of robust PID based on pseudo-parallel SPEA2 algorithm	It is often very difficult for current PID optimization methods to take account of system's requirement for quickness, reliability and robustness. To solve this problem, a multi-objective optimization design method was proposed. Under the precondition of guaranteeing the robust performance of the system, the minimum of overshoot, rise time and setting time were taken as the sub-objectives. Then SPEA2 and PGA were combined to reach the final conclusion. This method can obtain uniformly distributed Pareto-optimal solutions and has good convergence and powerful optimization capability. The satisfactory solution is selected in Pareto optimum set according to the system's requirement, which provides an effective tool for measuring the performance of quickness, reliability and robustness. The superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method are supported by simulation results.

Rice straw was found to promote the reduction of Cr(VI), and accelerate the decrease of Cr(VI) and available chromium content in soil. The water soluble chromium content and exchangeable chromium content were both lower in soil amended with rice straw than those in soil without rice straw, but the content of precipitated chromium and chromium bound to organic matter were both higher in soil with rice straw, compared with those in soil without rice straw. The effects of rice straw on the microbial activity in Cr(VI)-amended soil were also studied. The soil respiration intensity and microbial number were higher in soil amended with rice straw than those in soil without rice straw, indicating that the addition of rice straw alleviates the inhibitory effect of Cr(VI) on microorganisms in soil.

54549119232	The effect of protecting species diversity in Southwest China	Establishment of nature reserves is one of the best ways to protect species biodiversity. The effect of protecting species was analyzed in this study by selecting 40 important and typical nature reserves in Southwest China with the aim of providing evidence for the management on nature reserves. Main results were as follows: (1) The number of wild animals and plants species protected in reserves increased logarithmically with the increase of nature reserves. By this way the total number of wild vertebrates protected in nature reserves of the Southwest were estimated as 2426, occupying 38.2 percent of total wild vertebrates species in China. (2) Wild higher plants species protected in nature reserves of the Southwest were 20965, which were almost 70 percent of total wild higher plants species in China. (3) It showed that the number of plant and animal species protected in reserves was positively linearly related to the area of reserves when below 1.5 million ha, and almost kept unchanged above that area. This indicates that the habitats of other endemic wild species beyond the species in the existing reserves should be considered in the establishment of new nature reserves. (4) The total number of China's important species protected in the reserves of Southwest China was also established: wild animals protected were 119, of which 42 were in Class I and 77 were in Class II, taking 46.3% of total national important animal species in China. The wild plants protected were 138, of which 29 in Class I and 109 in Class II, occupying 54.3% of total national important plant species.

Then the improved strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) combined with the parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) is used to identify the parameters. Compared with the conventional one, the proposed algorithm has such features as fast convergence and powerful optimization capability. It can obtain multiple sets of parameters for load modeling, which makes it convenient for customers to choose an appropriate solution according to their own specific demands.

64049090270	Image retrieval approach based on intuitive fuzzy set combined with genetic algorithm	Aiming at shortcomings of traditional image retrieval systems, a new image retrieval approach based on color features of image combining intuitive fuzzy theory with genetic algorithm is proposed. Each image is segmented into a constant number of sub-images in vertical direction. Color features are extracted from every sub-image to get chromosome coding. It is considered that fuzzy membership and intuitive fuzzy hesitancy degree of every pixel's color in image are associated to all the color histogram bins. Certain feature, fuzzy feature and intuitive fuzzy feature of colors in an image, are used together to describe the content of image. Efficient combinations of sub-image are selected according to operation of selecting, crossing and variation. Retrieval results are obtained from image matching based on these color feature combinations of sub-images. Tests show that this approach can improve the accuracy of image retrieval in the case of not decreasing the speed of image retrieval. Its mean precision is above 80%. © A paper published in JBIT is protected by copyright.

64549114037	Species composition and spatial structure of plants in urban parks of Beijing	By the method of stratified random sampling, the species composition and spatial structure of the plants in 53 parks in Beijing urban area were investigated, aimed to provide basic information for the protection of plant diversity in the parks and the management of the parks. A total of 492 plant species belong to 96 families and 283 genera were recorded. Based on the data of 21 investigation items about the trees, shrubs, and grasses in the study area and related statistical analyses , the plant structural patterns commonly seen in the green space of the parks of Beijing urban area were introduced. Among the plants in the parks, native species occupied 53. 86% of the total. The chorological composition of the genera embraced broad kinds of geographical elements in China, and the predominance of dominant plants was remarkable. In most green patches of the parks, herbaceous species were more abundant and had higher coverage, shrubs had relatively low coverage and were less beneath tree canopy, and trees and shrubs had lower species richness and density. The canopy breadth and the diameter of breast height of trees as well as the breadth of shrubs and the heights of trees and shrubs were basically at the second grade, but the canopy structure of the trees were better, with good conditions of sunlight and growth. The crown missing of the shrubs was relatively low. It was suggested from correlation analyses and document survey of Beijing parks construction history that park landscape design, alien species introduction, and cultivation management were the main factors affecting the species composition and spatial structure of the plants in Beijing urban parks.

65549088052	Eco-environmental sustainability assessment of each province in China	Agenda 21 emphasizes the role of local authorities as an important resource in pursuit of sustainability. Key aspects in this process are the collection of information about the state of the environment and the integration of this information at the various levels of local governance to highlight useful patterns for policy planning. As it is very difficult to evaluate the environmental performance on the grounds because of too many environmental indicators, i. e. too much information, we should reduce the number of indicators by aggregating them to one or several composite environmental indexes to make the environmental information more accessible. Based on "naturally occurring state; human pressures; environmental effects; and social responses" four environmental sustainability themes, this paper developed an indicator system including ten contributing factors and twenty-eight indicators for assessing the environmental sustainability of each province in China. In this categorical system, indicator weight was determined through analytic hierarchy processes and expert survey methods. Four sub-indices-including natural state index (NSI), human pressure index (HPI), environmental effect index (EEI), and social response index (SRI)-were aggregated through additive weighting method. Then, the composite environmental sustainability index (CEI) of each province was calculated by averaging the grey relation performance correlations between the four sub-indices and their hypothetical ideal point. Higher values of CEI demonstrated that the environment of a local province is more sustainable. At the same time, indicators in each theme were analyzed by correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) in search of meaningful underlying variables which derive regional differentiation of each sub-index. Finally, the paper conducted a cluster analysis, which identifies statistically related groups of provinces based on the similarity of sub-indices, a step that would likely prove very helpful in identifying appropriate provinces against which local environmental sustainability and policies can be benchmarked and compared. The results demonstrated that in each province there were obvious regional differentiations of natural conditions, human pressures, environmental effects, and social responses. The NSI in each province of East and South China was greater than West and North China, a result that was mainly determined by rainfall, air temperature, water-resource index and rate of forest cover in each province. The HPI in each developed province of Eastern China was greater than in poor provinces of Central and Western China, which demonstrated significant positive correlations with economic level, namely the GDP per capita in each province. The EEI in Northwest China was greater than for other regions, and it is negatively correlated with NSI; in regions with a poor natural state, little human pressure would lead to significant ecological effects. The SRI did not show any obvious special differentiation rules - that is, economic growth would promote social response, but wasn't decisive factor; and social response also influenced by national policy and local development strategy. Eco-environmental sustainability in each province was determined by NSI, HPI, EEI and SRI. Through grey correlation analysis of the four sub-indices, this paper developed the CEI of each province. According to 2003 data, Hainan Province, Yunnan Province, Guangxi Autonomous Region, and Jiangxi Province rate at the top ranks of CEI. These four regions are endowed with good natural states, less human pressure, unapparent eco-environmental effects, and high social responses. At the bottom ranks of CEI are four Autonomous Regions-Neimengu, Ningxia, Tibet and Sinkiang-with poor natural states and serious eco-environmental effects, along with Shanghai Municipality which exhibits high human pressure and serious eco-environmental effects. The cluster analysis classed thirty-one provinces into six groupings which could be seen as having observable similarities and thus representing a useful point of departure for policy comparisons.

64949161996	Speciation of chromium in soil inoculated with Cr(VI)-reducing strain, Bacillus sp. XW-4	Cr(VI)-amended soil was inoculated with Cr(VI)-reducing strain, Bacillus sp. XW-4 and incubated at 28 °C in an incubator. Cr(VI) reduction, available Cr and Cr fraction in soils were studied. The results show that addition of Bacillus sp. XW-4 can promote Cr(VI) reduction, but inoculation of this strain has a negative effect on the decrease of available Cr content in soil. In controls (without this strain) amended with 100 and 200 mg/kg of Cr(VI), Cr(VI) contents decrease to about 41 and 92 mg/kg respectively after incubation of 4 d, while in soil inoculated with XW-4, Cr(VI) contents decrease to about 18 and 60 mg/kg, respectively. The content of available Cr in soils with inoculation of XW-4 is higher than that in controls. Chromium is partitioned into water soluble Cr, exchangeable Cr, precipitated Cr, Cr bound to organics and residual Cr. The highest content of Cr is observed in residual form and water soluble Cr is not detected for all treatments after 42 d, but the soils inoculated with Bacillus sp. XW-4 contain higher content of exchangeable Cr and lower content of precipitated Cr than the soil without the inoculum. Inoculation of Bacillus sp. XW-4 can increase chromium activity in soils. © 2009 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

67651045893	New load modeling approach during asymmetric disturbance and its engineering application	The main obstacle to the wide application of the measurement-based load modeling approach (MBLMA) lies in the serious insufficiency of the effective data provided by disturbance normally occurring in a power system. This is because the currently used MBLMA can only identify the load parameters from three-phase symmetric disturbance. But most of the faults occurring in a power system are asymmetric, and it is hard to get permission to do field test. An approach to load dynamic modeling during asymmetric disturbance (LMAD) is proposed. The problem of insufficient data is solved by applying Park's equations in solving the induction motor's dynamic process. And the problem of divergence in MBLMA is solved with the modified immune algorithm in the optimization of the model parameters instead of the least square estimation (LSE) method. Finally, the identified load model's influence on the critical clearing time (CCT) in Shanghai Power Grid is discussed.

67650217508	Simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation in pure cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCTCC AB91095	Simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation were investigated in a reactor containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCTCC AB91095. Phenol was used as carbon source. P. aeruginosa utilized metabolites formed during phenol degradation as energy source for Cr(VI) reduction. Cr(VI) inhibited both Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation when Cr(VI) concentration exceeded the optimum value (20 mg/L), whereas phenol enhanced both Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation below the optimum initial concentration of 100 mg/L. Cr(III) was the predominant product of Cr(VI) reduction in cultures after incubation for 24 h. Both Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation were influenced by the amount of inocula. The concentration of Cr(VI) and phenol declined quickly from 20, 100 to 3.36, 29.51 mg/L in cultures containing of 5% (v/v) inoculum after incubation for 12 h, respectively. The whole study showed that P. aeruginosa is promising for the reduction of toxic Cr(VI) and degradation of organic pollutants simultaneously in the mineral liquid medium. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The 535 nature reserves had an average score of 51. 95, and 69. 35% of them had a score less than 60, illustrating that the general management level of our nature reserves was relatively low. There was a significant difference (P<0. 01) in the scores of management effectiveness among the nature reserves of different class and established at different time, i. e. , the higher class and the longer establishing time, the higher score of management effectiveness. However, no significant differences (P >0. 05) were observed in the scores among the reserves with different area and type. The average scores of management base, management mechanism, management behavior, and management effectiveness were 1.55, 1.44, 1.52, and 1.90, respectively. The indices (management of protection targets, condition assessment, reserve boundary, resource management, and management agency) had the highest average scores, while equipment use and maintenance, community co-management, budget sources, budget expending and management, and management system and regulations had the lowest ones. The management system for China nature reserves had been generally established, the major targets and their values had been successfully protected, but there were still many problems in the management of China nature reserves, such as management mechanism and management base construction. To improve the management effectiveness, some countermeasures should be taken, e. g. , establishing rational distribution and management mechanisms of budgets, strengthening ability construction, and promoting community participation.

70349305059	Proposed procedure in designing and planning stratified random selection investigation of urban vegetation	Systematic design and planning of investigation processes is the fundamental guarantee of successful vegetation survey and scientific data analysis. Urban plants are under intense disturbance by human activities, and the resulted urban style of vegetation structure and open space composition makes the detailed planning of vegetation investigation become undoubtedly necessary. However, for such an important issue, few studies have been reported. As a most commonly used method of urban vegetation investigation, stratified random selection investigation is the topic of this paper. Based on enormous publications and practical experiences, the authors proposed the systematic processes of investigation planning, with the details and points of attention for field work of urban vegetation survey introduced. The main body of urban vegetation investigation was divided into three parts, i. e. , sampling design, plots design, and field work details. Sampling design was mainly concerned with the boundary and size of research area, stratification rules, and distribution principles for sampling efforts; plot design involved the determination of sampling unit and plot size; and field work details mainly involve a list of specific items to be investigated, processes to be conducted, apparatus to be prepared, staffs to be coordinated, and other details to ensure the accuracy and precision of the data and the smooth going of the investigation.

77549085776	Sampling adequacy estimation for plant species composition by accumulation curves-A case study of urban vegetation in Beijing, China	Species accumulation curves are commonly used to evaluate sampling adequacy under natural conditions, but their performance in urban conditions still requires examination. The built-up area of Beijing, was chosen as a case study, and specific insight was gained into accumulation curves of plant species composition. The characteristics examined were plant species richness, percentage of alien plant species, chorotypes percentage (assemblages of species with similar geographical ranges), and the importance value of the dominant tree species. We showed: (1) the plant species accumulation curves significantly fitted the power function relationship, but the curves were nowhere near any asymptote, and the traditional method to locate an adequate sampling effort were found to be invalid in this case; (2) to evaluate the sampling adequacy for plant species composition, it was more appropriate to use the coefficient of variation for the first-order jackknife estimator as a substitute for species richness; (3) accumulation curves for the importance value of the dominant tree species, the curves for the percentage of alien species, and the curves for chorotypes percentages showed different accumulation trends compared to that of species richness. However, because they reached a steady state much sooner than species richness, the sampling effort required for adequate estimation of these indexes was generally below that for species richness. As shown in this study of a relatively complex species composition in the urban condition, the accumulation curves of different characteristics of a subject are a promising way to estimate sampling adequacy for complex research subjects. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we analyzed the habitat suitability for giant pandas in the Minshan Mountains, China, using the ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) method, and then evaluated the current conservation status of this endangered species. The results showed that (1) giant pandas were distributed in a narrow altitudinal range in which vegetation cover was dominated by coniferous forest, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaf forest, and deciduous broadleaf forest with scattered bamboo understory, and (2) roads and human settlements had strong negative effects on the panda habitat selection. According to habitat analysis, the total habitat area of giant panda in the Minshan Mountains was 953,173 ha, which was fragmented into 12 habitat units by major roads, rivers, and human settlements. The habitat of the mid-Minshan was less fragmentized, but was seriously fragmented in the north. The panda population size estimation showed that 676 individuals inhabited the study area, and 94.53% of them were in the mid-Minshan, but small panda populations less than 30 individuals inhabited the isolated and fragmented habitat patches in the north. The nature reserves in the Minshan Mountains have formed three conservation groups, which covered 41.26% of panda habitat and protected 70.71% of panda population of the study area, but there still exists two conservation gaps, and the connectivity among these reserves is still weak. Due to habitat isolation and extensive human disturbances, giant pandas in the north (i.e., Diebu, Zhouqu, and Wudou) are facing threats of local extinction. In order to protect pandas and their habitats in this area, some effective conservation approaches, such as establishing new reserves in gap areas, creating corridors among patches, and seasonally controlling traffic flux in key roads, should be implemented in the future to link these isolated habitats together. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.

77955313994	Mapping understory vegetation using phenological characteristics derived from remotely sensed data	Understory vegetation is an important component in forest ecosystems not only because of its contributions to forest structure, function and species composition, but also due to its essential role in supporting wildlife species and ecosystem services. Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of understory vegetation is essential for management and conservation. Nevertheless, detailed information on the distribution of understory vegetation across large spatial extents is usually unavailable, due to the interference of overstory canopy on the remote detection of understory vegetation. While many efforts have been made to overcome this challenge, mapping understory vegetation across large spatial extents is still limited due to a lack of generality of the developed methods and limited availability of required remotely sensed data. In this study, we used understory bamboo in Wolong Nature Reserve, China as a case study to develop and test an effective and practical remote sensing approach for mapping understory vegetation. Using phenology metrics generated from a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we characterized the phenological features of forests with understory bamboo. Using maximum entropy modeling together with these phenology metrics, we successfully mapped the spatial distribution of understory bamboo (kappa: 0.59; AUC: 0.85). In addition, by incorporating elevation information we further mapped the distribution of two individual bamboo species, Bashania faberi and Fargesia robusta (kappa: 0.68 and 0.70; AUC: 0.91 and 0.92, respectively). Due to its generality, flexibility and extensibility, this approach constitutes an improvement to the remote detection of understory vegetation, making it suitable for mapping different understory species in different geographic settings. Both biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat management may benefit from the detailed information on understory vegetation across large areas through the applications of this approach. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77955095825	Range-wide analysis of wildlife habitat: Implications for conservation	The range-wide habitat status of many endangered species is unclear. We evaluated the status and spatial distribution of the habitat of the endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) across its entire geographic range (i.e., six mountain regions located in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, China) by integrating field and remotely sensed data to develop a habitat distribution model. Results suggest that current suitable habitat corresponds to ca. 1/4 of the habitat baseline (i.e., maximum amount of habitat possible). The highest proportion of suitable habitat relative to the baseline is in the Qinling mountain region. Overall, around 40% of the suitable habitat is inside nature reserves, but the proportion of habitat inside them varied among different mountain regions, ranging from ca. 17% (Lesser Xiangling) to ca. 66% (Qinling). The habitat model also predicted the occurrence of potentially suitable habitat outside the currently accepted geographic range of the species, which should be further evaluated as potential panda reintroduction sites. Our approach is valuable for assessing the conservation status of the entire habitat of the species, for identifying areas with significant ecological roles (e.g., corridors), for identifying areas suitable for panda reintroductions, and for establishing specific conservation strategies in different parts of the giant panda geographic range. It might also prove useful for range-wide habitat analyses of many other endangered species around the world. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that zinc and lead in the sediments were partly dissolved by three LMWOA solutions under different concentrations in batch experiment. The leaching of heavy metals from two sediments followed the descending order: citric acid > malic acid > tartrate acid (for zinc); citric acid > tartrate acid > malic acid (for lead). The leaching concentrations of heavy metals in solution were enhanced with the increasing of LMWOA concentration and the decreasing of pH value. In addition, all LMWOAs leached more heavy metals than inorganic salt did. The leaching capability under the condition of LMWOAs followed the order: zinc > lead.

78650633488	Evaluation of consistency of tongue and pulse signs observed by traditional Chinese medicine clinicians	Objective: To evaluate the consistency of tongue manifestation and pulse condition observed by traditional Chinese medicine clinicians. Methods: Field investigation and direct inquiry were performed in the study. Two physicians from the same department judged tongue manifestation and pulse condition independently. The consistency among observers was assessed by means of Kappa statistics. Results: A total of 55 patients were included in the study. There were 13 inconsistent cases (23. 6%) in tongue body observation and 7 cases (12.7%) in form of the tongue observation. The observation consistency of tongue body (Kappa=0. 649) and form of the tongue (Kappa=O.752) were good. There were 24 inconsistent cases (43.6%) in tongue fur observation, the consistency of which was moderate (Kappa=O. 525). There were 22 inconsistent cases (40%) in pulse condition diagnosis, the diagnosis consistency of which was also moderate (Kappa=O.562). Conclusion: Observation and diagnosis consistency of tongue manifestation and pulse condition were moderately the same between different clinicians. By analyzing the reasons of inconsistency, it is necessary to improve the consistency in three aspects, such as the detailed-oriented criterion, the attitude of researchers and better training of researchers.

Moreover, the security, economy and cleanliness for smart grids are evaluated with quantitative indices such as active power loss, emission pollution and voltage stability. Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) model is integrated with the traditional optimal power flow (OPF) model in algorithm presented in this paper, and the impact of large-scale wind power integration on power systems is considered. Taking the above-mentioned indices as optimization objectives, the algorithm adopts strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) to get solution for the optimization model. It is shown that the algorithm enables multi-objective optimization and multiple aspects for monitoring in smart grids. Therefore, it provides new thoughts for monitoring in smart grids.

79952722039	Designing regional nature reserves group: The case study of Qinling Mountain Range, China	Formulation of nature reserves groups is one of important approach for optimizing the spatial patterns of nature reserves, and improving the effect of nature reserves network. In this study, based on habitat evaluation and connectivity analysis, the approach and method for optimizing spatial patterns and function zoning of reserves was analyzed using the case study of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) reserves in Qinling mountains range. Results showed that, 17 panda nature reserves were established or in establishment, which almost formed a reserves group and covered 50% of panda habitat. But 3 reserves in the east were isolated from the others, and core zones of the 17 reserves were isolated into 20 parts. This pattern will reduce the effect of reserves systems in protecting pandas and other endangered species. For optimizing the spatial patterns of the nature reserves, new reserves including Xushui River and Jingjiliang were proposed, and the number of core zones was suggested to 4 parts according to the spatial distribution of panda population. Besides, three linkage areas were proposed for facilitating the pandas exchange and movement among different populations. The study is expected to provide a scientific basis for nature reserves construction in this mountain range, and to benefit the establishment of nature reserves group in other places and the optimization of entire nature reserves systems in China.

79952749138	Assessment of the effectiveness of nature reserve management in China	Assessing the management effectiveness of nature reserves is an effective way to promote management quality and achieve management targets. Using a questionnaire developed by the World Bank (WB) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as a tool for tracking management effectiveness, we carried out a survey in 535 nature reserves in China to assess the management status quo in 2005. The results indicated that the indices related to management regulation, infrastructure and equipment, monitoring and evaluation, budget and community involvement produced relatively lower scores, while the indices related to management of protection targets and resources, setup of management agency and reserve boundary had better performances. The independent variables of reserve class, time since establishment, distribution region, economic condition and staff number exhibited strong correlations with the effective management of nature reserves. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to measure the association between the 3 assessment indices representing management effectiveness and other 28 assessment indices. Among these 28 assessment indices, the indices of personnel management, resource management, monitoring and evaluation, and management plan had more effects on the management effectiveness of nature reserves than other indices. When the most pressing management issues and influence factors have been identified, countermeasures can be implemented to improve the management of nature reserves. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79952488289	Impacts of human activities on the hydrology of Baiyangdian Lake, China	Baiyangdian Lake is the biggest natural freshwater wetland in North China Plain. It provides important ecosystem services such as water regulation and supply, reed production and biodiversity protection. Baiyangdian Lake, however, was threatened by lack of freshwater in recent decades. In this paper, the hydrological changes of the lake were quantified using historical data of water level and groundwater table, and satellite images. In addition, the relationship between water level and socioeconomic development of the basin was investigated. The result revealed a significant decreasing trend of water level in the lake. Water level and groundwater table of Baiyangdian Lake decreased rapidly, caused by the great increase of water withdrawal and consumption due to socioeconomic development in the basin. In particular, population growth and the expansion of irrigated agriculture were two major contributors to the decline of water level and groundwater table. While precipitation was positively correlated with water level, it has less impact on water level and groundwater table than human activities. The diversion of water to the lake raised the water level temporarily and had significant benefits on the wetland ecosystem. The best way to solve ecological problems of Baiyangdian Lake, however, is to control the growth of population, adjust the industrial structure, control land use conversion and improve water use efficiency at the basin scale. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79952755158	Latitudinal gradient in beta diversity of forest communities in America	Beta diversity is an important component of biological diversity, measuring compositional change in species assemblages across temporal and spatial scales. Understanding spatial variation in beta diversity and the underlying mechanism(s) has become the focus of biodiversity studies in recent years. Although many studies have proved latitudinal gradient in species richness, whether beta diversity shows latitudinal trends still remain controversial. In the present study, we accessed the latitudinal gradient in beta diversity at community level. We selected inventory data of 131 0.1 ha forest plots from South and North America, including various types of forest communities. These forest plots were a subset of 226 mature forest plots which were systematically gathered by late Alwyn H. Gentry during 22 years. We formulated two theoretical frameworks to facilitate the analyses. First, since species range size generally increase with latitude, there will be more obvious overlapping in species distribution toward the pole; this in turn will lead to latitudinal gradient in beta diversity. Second, since latitudinal decline in species richness at larger spatial grain is more abrupt than that at smaller spatial grain, the discrepancy in species richness of different spatial grains (beta diversity) will decrease with latitude. To catch more information of spatial variation in species composition within communities, we used both multiplicative and additive Partitioning methods to calculate beta diversity. Simple correlation and regression were used to test the relationships between latitude and species diversity. The results showed that (1) beta diversity increased significantly along with decreasing latitude, respective which Partitioning method was used. Generally, beta diversity in tropical and subtropical forests was comparable, and was much higher than that of temperate forests. This pattern can be easily derived by the latitudinal decrease in species range size measured by mean number of subplots occupied by all species within community, and the differences between regression slopes of species richness against latitude at larger and smaller grains; (2) gamma diversity of the studied communities was mainly contributed by beta diversity, with an average of 78. 2%. Along with increasing latitude, the relative contributes of beta diversity to total gamma diversity decreased significantly; (3) beta diversity in south hemisphere was relatively higher than that of north hemisphere. This might respect the regional differences in the histories of species evolution and environmental changes. In addition, we discussed the proper usage of multiplicative and additive Partitioning methods. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to test latitudinal gradient in beta diversity of forest ecosystems at community level. The results of our study have important implications for not only understanding the determinants of spatial variation in biodiversity but also for biodiversity conservation.

79955090873	Effects of natural disasters on conservation policies: The case of the 2008 wenchuan earthquake, China	Abstract Conservation policies are increasing in response to human-induced ecosystem degradation, but little is known about their interplay with natural disasters. Through an analysis of satellite imagery and field data we evaluated the impacts of a devastating earthquake on forest recovery and avoided forest loss estimated to have been obtained by two of the largest conservation programs in the world. Results show that more than 10% of the forests in Wenchuan County, Sichuan province, China were immediately affected by the 2008 earthquake, offsetting some gains in forest cover observed since the enactment of the conservation programs. But without the enactment of these conservation programs, the combined effects of human disturbance and earthquake-induced landslides could have severely reduced the region's forest cover. The continuation-and enhancement-of incentives for participation in conservation programs will be important for reducing the environmental impacts of the combined effects of human disturbance and natural hazards not only in the study area but also in many disaster-prone regions around the world. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2011.

79955950875	Relative importance of water, energy, and heterogeneity in determining regional pteridophyte and seed plant richness in China	Environmental variables, such as ambient energy, water availability, and environmental heterogeneity have been frequently proposed to account for species diversity gradients. How taxon-specific functional traits define large-scale richness gradients is a fundamental issue in understanding spatial patterns of species diversity, but has not been well documented. Using a large dataset on the regional flora from China, we examine the contrast spatial patterns and environmental determinants between pteridophytes and seed plants which differ in dispersal capacity and environmental requirements. Pteridophyte richness shows more pronounced spatial variation and stronger environmental associations than seed plant richness. Water availability generally accounts for more spatial variance in species richness of pteridophytes and seed plants than energy and heterogeneity do, especially for pteridophytes which have high dependence on moist and shady environments. Thus, pteridophyte richness is disproportionally affected by water-related variables; this in turn results in a higher proportion of pteridophytes in regional vascular plant floras (pteridophyte proportion) in wet regions. Most of the variance in seed plant richness, pteridophyte richness, and pteridophyte proportion explained by energy is included in variation that water and heterogeneity account for, indicating the redundancy of energy in the study extent. However, heterogeneity is more important for determining seed plant distributions. Pteridophyte and seed plant richness is strongly correlated, even after the environmental effects have been removed, implying functional linkages between them. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating biological traits of different taxonomic groups into the studies of macroecology and global change biology. © 2011 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

79956280978	The application of Ecological-Niche factor analysis in giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat assessment	Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) is a multivariate approach to study species geographic distribution on a large scale with only presence data. It was widely applied in many fields including wildlife management, habitat assessment and habitat prediction. In this paper, this approach was applied in habitat suitability assessment for giant pandas in Pingwu county, Sichuan province, China. With giant pandas presence data and remote sensing data, panda habitat suitability in this county was evaluated based on ENFA model, and spatial distribution pattern of nature reserves and conservation gaps were then evaluated. The results show that giant pandas in this county prefer the high elevation zones (> 2128m) dominated by coniferous forest, mixed coniferous and broadleaf forest,and avoid deciduous broadleaf forest and shrubs. Pandas avoid staying at habitats with human disturbances. Farmland is a major factor threatening panda habitat. Panda habitat is mainly distributed in northand west of Pingwu with atotal area of 234033 ha (106345 hafor suitable and 127688 ha for marginally suitable). Three nature reserves located in Pingwu, cover 49.2% of total suitable habitat and 45.6% of total marginally suitable habitat. Although 47.2% of panda's habitat was under protection in reserves, the connectivity between reserves is weak and a conservation gap existed in the north part of Pingwu. Thus, a new nature reserve in Baima and Mupi should be established to link the isolated habitats.

79958274663	Nature reserve group planning for conservation of giant pandas in North Minshan, China	Formation of nature reserve groups (NRGs) is an important approach for optimising spatial patterns in nature reserves and for improving the efficiency of nature reserve networks. In this study, based on habitat evaluation and connectivity analysis, the approach and method for optimising spatial patterns and functional zoning of reserves were analysed using the case study of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) reserves in North Minshan. Results indicated that five panda nature reserves had been established, which formed a reserve group and covered 48.4% of panda habitat and three of five population components. Although the nature reserves were connected to each other, core zones were divided into seven isolated areas. These divisions can reduce the efficiency of protecting giant pandas in reserve systems. To optimise spatial patterns in nature reserves, one new reserve is proposed and it is recommended that core zones be expanded and merged into two areas, in accordance with the spatial distribution of the panda population. Three linkage areas are also proposed-for facilitating panda exchange and movement among different populations. The study is expected to provide a scientific basis for planning the development of nature reserves in this mountain range, to promote the establishment of nature reserve groups in other areas, and to optimise entire nature reserve systems in China. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

We summarized activity rate (% of time active) and level (horizontal direction/ vertical direction ranging from 0 to 255) across different times of day and across individuals and compared activity level to both solar radiation and air temperature. The results showed that the mean activity rate of the pandas was 68.05%. Activity rate (70.86%) and level of the pregnant panda (23.82±0.30/ 17.63±0.22) was higher than the other two (70.55%, 14.71±0.17/ 13.52±0.15 and 62.76%, 17.74±0.23/ 13.61± 0.18). There were three activity peaks at 6:00-7:00, 18:00-21:00 and 23:00-3:00, and a marked rest period at 9:00-12:00. Activity rate (68.32%) and level during the day (19.59±0.20/ 15.45±0.15) was higher than in the night (67.67%, 17.63±0.19/ 14.21±0.15). The effect of solar radiation was significantly negatively and linearly related to the daily activity level of the study pandas (r = -0.822, P<0.001), however, the air temperature was not linearly related to circadian activity level.

83555165081	Evaluating the efficacy of zoning designations for protected area management	Protected areas worldwide are facing increasing pressures to co-manage human development and biodiversity conservation. One strategy for managing multiple uses within and around protected areas is zoning, an approach in which spatial boundaries are drawn to distinguish areas with varying degrees of allowable human impacts. However, zoning designations are rarely evaluated for their efficacy using empirical data related to both human and biodiversity characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of zoning designations, we developed an integrated approach. The approach was calibrated empirically using data from Wolong Nature Reserve, a flagship protected area for the conservation of endangered giant pandas in China. We analyzed the spatial distribution of pandas, as well as human impacts (roads, houses, tourism infrastructure, livestock, and forest cover change) with respect to zoning designations in Wolong. Results show that the design of the zoning scheme could be improved to account for pandas and their habitat, considering the amount of suitable habitat outside of the core zone (area designated for biodiversity conservation). Zoning was largely successful in containing houses and roads to their designated experimental zone, but was less effective in containing livestock and was susceptible to boundary adjustments to allow for tourism development. We identified focus areas for potential zoning revision that could better protect the panda population without significantly compromising existing human settlements. Our findings highlight the need for evaluating the efficacy of zoning in other protected areas facing similar challenges with balancing human needs and conservation goals, not only in China but also around the world. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on data from 85 long-term daily monitoring cities in China, air quality as evaluated by AOFDAQ-A (Annual Occurrence Frequency of Daily Air Quality above Level III), was correlated to socio-economic variable groups of urbanization, pollution and environmental treatment by variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning methods. We found: (1) the three groups explained 43.5% of the variance in AOFDAQ-A; (2) the contribution of "environmental investment" to AOFDAQ-A shown a time lag effect; (3) "population in mining sector" and "coverage of green space in built-up area" were respectively the most significant negative and positive explanatory socio-economic variables; (4) using eight largest contributing individual factors, a linear model to predict variance in AOFDAQ-A was constructed.

84862806825	Relationship between floristic similarity and vegetated land surface phenology: Implications for the synoptic monitoring of species diversity at broad geographic regions	Assessing species composition and its changes through time across broad geographic regions is time consuming and a difficult endeavor. The synoptic view provided by imaging remote sensors offers an alternative. But while many studies have developed procedures for assessing biodiversity using multi- and hyper-spectral imagery, they may only provide snapshots at particular months/seasons due to the seasonal variability of spectral characteristics induced by vegetated land surface phenologies. Thus, procedures for remotely assessing biodiversity patterns may not fully represent the biodiversity on the ground if vegetated land surface phenologies are not considered. Using Mantel tests, ordinarily least square regression models and spatial autoregressive models, we assessed the relationship between floristic diversity and vegetated land surface phenologies, as captured by time series of vegetation indices derived from data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The relationship was calibrated with data from temperate montane forests of the Qinling Mountains region, Shaanxi Province, China. Our results show that floristically similar areas also exhibit a comparable similarity in phenological characteristics. However, phenological similarity obtained using the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), a spectral vegetation index found to be not only sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content but also linearly related with the relative content of foliar anthocyanins, exhibited the strongest relationship with floristic similarity. Therefore, analysis of the temporal dynamics of pigments through the use of satellite-derived metrics, such as VARI, may be used for evaluating the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of species composition across broad geographic regions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862811064	Spatial pattern of greenspace affects land surface temperature: Evidence from the heavily urbanized Beijing metropolitan area, China	The urban heat island describes the phenomenon that air/surface temperatures are higher in urban areas compared to their surrounding rural areas. Numerous studies have shown that increased percent cover of greenspace (PLAND) can significantly decrease land surface temperatures (LST). Fewer studies, however, have investigated the effects of configuration of greenspace on LST. This paper aims to fill this gap using Beijing, China as a case study. PLAND along with six configuration metrics were used to measure the composition and configuration of greenspace. The metrics were calculated based on a greenspace map derived from SPOT imagery, and LST data were retrieved from Landsat TM thermal band. Ordinary least squares regression and spatial autoregression were employed to investigate the relationship between LST and spatial pattern of greenspace using the census tract as the analytical unit. The results showed that PLAND was the most important predictor of LST. A 10 % increase in PLAND resulted in approximately a 0. 86 °C decrease in LST. Configuration of greenspace also significantly affected LST. Given a fixed amount of greenspace, LST increased significantly with increased patch density. In addition, the variance of LST was largely explained by both composition and configuration of greenspace. The unique variation explained by the composition was relatively small, and was close to that of the configuration. Results from this study can expand our understanding of the relationship between LST and vegetation, and provide insights for improving urban greenspace planning and management. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84862306643	Development of EAS RF tag quality online detection sensor	The double coil sensor based on mutual inductance coupling principle was developed in order to detect performance parameters of electronic article surveillance (EAS) radio frequency (RF) tag. The physical model and dynamic mathematical model of detection sensor were constructed according to the results of analysis for the model of EAS RF tag. Then the frequency response characteristic of the sensor was analyzed. The double coil with parallel structure was proposed in order to make the electromagnetic field evenly distributed around the tag detection region, and to facillitate the continuous online detection of the tag. Effect of the number of turns in the coil and spatial structure parameters on sensitivity was tested based on circuit parameters simulation analysis, and all parameters of the sensor were determined. The detecting results indicate that the sensor has high detection precision, stable property and fast response, which can meet the online detection requirements of EAS RF tag performance parameters.

84863777901	Generalized guaranteed cost control with D-stability and multiple output constraints	This paper is concerned with the problem of robust generalized guaranteed cost control with D-stability and multiple output constraints for a class of linear uncertain systems. Being a combination of output performance indices, a generalized cost function is considered to the linear polytopic uncertain systems described in a unified framework. The aim is to design a state feedback controller, such that the closed-loop system is robust D-stable, and the upper bound of the generalized cost function is as small as possible subject to multiple output constraints. Based on parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions, convex conditions for the existence of such controllers are presented in terms of linear matrix inequality. The proposed approach shows a unified treatment of the linear systems in the differential, shift, and delta domains. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the design method. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84864042640	Effects of different grassland restoration approaches on soil properties in the southeastern Horqin sandy land, northern China	In the semi-arid Horqin sandy grassland, continuous grazing has led to decreased ground cover. The bare land surface is then directly exposed to strong wind erosion, leading to desertification. Different restoration approaches have been used to recover these desertified sandy grasslands. This study compared soil properties subjected to different grassland restoration approaches, i.e., three restoration treatments and an unrestored control: FG, grassland enclosed by sheltering forest (Populus×beijingensis); MG, artificially sparse Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica grassland; UG, artificially sparse Ulmus pumila grassland; CK, desertified grassland. Soil samples were taken from depths of 0-20cm, and physical (i.e., bulk density, particle size distribution, waterholding capacity, total porosity), chemical (i.e., pH, soil organic matter, total N, total P, total K, available N, available P, available K, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Ca

84864188641	A review of research on the development of instruments for therapeutic efficacy evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine	OBJECTIVE: Due to the differences between Chinese and Western cultures, Chinese version of foreign research instruments may not be totally applicable for use in evaluating the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Great efforts have been made by Chinese researchers to develop scales for evaluation of the therapeutic effects of TCM. This study aims to understand the current situation of research in the development of evaluation instrument in TCM. METHODS: Database searches of Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database and Chinese Scientific Journals Database were undertaken to identify published studies with the purpose of developing instruments in assessing the effectiveness of TCM, including papers regarding the construction of conceptual framework of instrument, item generation and selection and the evaluation of measurement properties. RESULTS: A total of 60 pieces of literature involving 36 instruments were included. The first article on the development of each of the instruments was published between 2005 and 2011 and the instruments were used in many kinds of medical conditions, including cardiocerebrovascular, respiratory, digestive and infectious diseases. The number of items ranged from 10 to 52. Of the 36 instruments, 13 (36. 1%) defined the hypothesized concepts measured by the instrument, 30 (83. 3%) reported the domains of the questionnaires before measurement property testing and all of them were multidomain. Of 32 studies regarding item selection and the instrument's property evaluation, 14 (43.8%) articles reported the administration mode, 24 (75 %) reported response option types, and 10 (31. 5%) provided scoring algorithm for the scale, but none of these 32 studies specified the recall period. In 29 studies aiming at testing instrument's measurement property, 28 articles tested the Cronbach's a coefficient of the full scale and/or subscales, and retest reliability was also detected in 15 studies. Twenty-seven studies evaluated the construct validity by exploratory factor analysis and among them there were two studies applying confirmatory factor analysis. Content validity, responsiveness and feasibility of instruments were assessed in 11, 16 and 16 studies, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in recent years many instruments have been developed in an attempt to evaluate the therapeutic effects of TCM, but some problems still exist in their practical implementation, including negligence in outlining the hypothesized concepts of the TCM instruments and in the reporting of instrument's content validity such as administration mode, scoring and recall period. Some instrument attributes and testing methods were misunderstood and/or misused. Revision of instruments is rarely carried out, though the development of an instrument is an iterative process. Researchers should have a thorough understanding of the general procedure and steps before starting to develop an instrument.

84866538256	Computational linear dynamics for sensor deployments toward leakage detection in offshore pipelines	Leakage detection in offshore pipeline transport is much more challenging than that in ground fluid transport systems due to the lack of measurements along the pipelines. The linear dynamics is considered using the transmission line model, and then we compare the frequency responses of the transfer functions are obtained via both the finite difference method and PDE Laplace transform. The simulation result shows the effectiveness of the finite dimensional models which can approximate the original linearized model accurately in low frequencies. Due to the scarcity of the sensors in the SCADA (the supervisory control and data acquisition) systems of offshore pipelines, a novel integrated drifting sensor solution is proposed for this type of detection problem and a brief introduction to the data assimilation framework is given.

84868662725	Damage identification in a coupled rod system from measured dynamic responses	A new damage identification method for a coupled rod system with close and repeated natural frequencies is presented. The equation of motion for the coupled system is established from finite element analysis. The dynamic responses of the system are obtained from state-space method. And the dynamic responses of the system are used for damage detection. The local damage of the system is modeled by a reduction in the elemental tensile stiffness. The dynamic response sensitivity with respect to the damage parameter (elemental tensile stiffness) is then derived. In the inverse analysis, the local damages in the system are identified from dynamic response sensitivity-based finite element model updating method. It is found that the local damage(s) can be identified successfully from several dynamic response measurements. The effect of artificial measurement noise on the identified results is also discussed. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed method is insensitive to the measurement noise and with very good accuracy. This shows that the proposed method has the potential for real application.

84869112910	The role of fairness norms the household-based natural forest conservation: The case of Wolong, China	The shadow of "the tragedy of the commons" with its popularized assumption of selfish individual behavior concerns policy-makers, and consequently the cooperative capability of local communities in common resource management is usually underrated. Nevertheless, here we propose a hypothesis, based on a game theory model, that the social norm of fairness rather than self-interest might motivate cooperation in natural resource conservation by discounting the utility gain from illegal logging at the cost of another household's subsidy loss. In Wolong Nature Reserve of China, a recent household-based natural forest conservation program has led to remarkable progress in protecting the habitat of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) with low monitoring pressure. We undertook experiments based on a one-shot Ultimatum Game to test the prevalence of the norm of fairness in the local communities. Most proposers in the experiments showed strong preferences for fair offers in spite of the responders' reluctance to reject low offers, and the result contradicted the expectation of pure self-interest. Taking into account the norm of fairness, the prediction of the model is consistent with the local performance of the household-based conservation policy. It highlights the potential of local social norms to facilitate participation and cooperation by the local community in common natural resource conservation. © 2010.

This paper presents the applications of hysteretic optimization (HO) being a recent proposed physical principle inspired intelligent optimization solution for a 3D protein folding problem with lattice model. According to the characteristics of 3D protein folding model, the four key ingredients of HO approach, namely dynamics, distance, reference states and point of avalanche, are well defined. A proposed modified HO algorithm is successfully implemented for studies on 3D protein folding problems. Furthermore, the benchmark based numerous simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed HO method, and the relationship between the HO parameter setting and the resulting performance. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84871900541	Promoting influence of organic carbon source on chromate reduction by bacillus sp	The effect of different organic carbon sources on Cr(VI) reduction by Bacillus sp. was investigated. Three organic compounds, malate, succinate and glucose were tested in Cr(VI) reduction experiments. The results demonstrated that three organic compounds all significantly enhanced Cr(VI) reduction. The enhancing degree of these three organic compounds was observed as malate>glucose>succinate, although the cell growth in succinate-added medium was similar to that in malate-added medium and was apparently higher than that in glucose-added medium. Addition of glucose resulted in decrease of pH and increase of redox potential, while addition of malate or succinate resulted in increase of pH and decrease of redox potential during Cr(VI) reduction. Cr(VI) was reduced by liquid culture metabolite when glucose was added in liquid medium, but not reduced by liquid culture metabolite when malate or succinate was applied in liquid medium for bacterial cultivation. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84872194640	The dynamics of spatial and temporal changes to forested land and key factors driving change on Hainan island	The ecological functions of natural forests are quite different from the functions of rubber and pulpwood plantations. The change from natural forest to plantations is the main form of human-driven landscape change on Hainan Island. The development of Hainan Island has undergone a series of phases which have included the common environmental stresses caused by the expansion of industry and agriculture. These include the expansion of agricultural cultivation, enlargement of rubber plantations and efforts to develop the landscape in harmony with ecological needs; as well as phases of exploration, experimentation and the implementation of untested land management methods. In the current efforts to develop the land using ecologically sound techniques, the local people and government are paying more attention to various human impacts on ecosystems. Research is very important in these efforts to use ecologically sound construction and development techniques designed to limit human impacts on the natural environment. Therefore, it is necessary to study the key factors and dynamic characteristics of both natural forest and rubber and pulpwood plantations to produce needed social and economic development in an ecological sustainable manner. We analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics and the forces driving landscape scale change during the last two decades. This study is based on the spatial distribution of natural forests as well as rubber and pulpwood plantations along with other types of land use using data from 1988 (when Hainan Province was formally established), 1998 (when the Province was first promoted as an ecological province) and 2008. The results provided four findings. First, from 1988 to 1998 the total area of natural forest on the island increased significantly from 78. 37×10

84874593223	Ecosystem services valuation and its regulation in Baiyangdian baisn: Based on InVEST model	Ecosystem services are benefits humans derive from natural ecosystems, which include provisioning services, regulating services, supporting services and cultural services. However, ecosystem services are undergoing degradation with the population growth and economic development. Moreover the increase of ecosystem provisioning services usually is at the expense of the other services, especially the regulating services. One of the great challenges faced by the decision-makers was that how to tradeoff the multiple ecosystem services through the informed management. We map seven ecosystem services (agricultural production, biodiversity conservation, water conservation, soil retention, carbon sequestration, water provisioning and pollination) in Baiyangdian watershed and analyze their tradeoffs based on the scenario analysis by using InVEST models, which enable decision-makers to assess the tradeoffs associated with alternative choices and to identify areas where investment in natural capital can enhance human development and conservation in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. The results showed that the western and northern areas provided higher services in biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, soil retention and water conservation than other areas, while the eastern and southern area provided higher services in N/ P retention and pollination in Baiyangdian watershed. Under sloping land conservation scenario, N/ P retention services increase greatly, however agricultural production decreases and carbon sequestration service is lower than that under conservation scenario. Under conservation scenario, the services in water provisioning, N/ P retention and carbon sequestration increase with no impact on agricultural production. Our research presents an initially analytical framework for integrating direct benefits and ecosystem regulating services in policy design. InVEST models provide an effective approaches to map and tradeoff ecosystem service bundle, and then provide informed management for decision-makers.

Based on matrix theory, a sufficient condition of D-stability for the uncertain time-delay system of delta operator is derived based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. A design method for the state-feedback robust reliable controller is developed for a class of uncertain time-delay systems of delta operator, which are with actuator failure and sensor failure. Using the controller, the poles of the closed-loop time-delay system of delta operator are displaced inside a specified disk on the complex plane for all admissible uncertainties and faults. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the availability of the design method.

84880757117	Stability analysis of networked control systems with round-robin scheduling and packet dropouts	In this paper, the stability of networked control systems (NCSs) with communication constraints at both channels is investigated. A Conventional Round-Robin Scheduling (CRRS) is applied to deal with the communication constraints issue for its simple structure. Furthermore, a Dynamic Round-Robin Scheduling (DRRS), which can preserve the controllability and the detectability of the systems, is considered. For the unreliable communication channels, two independent homogeneous Markov chains are selected to model the packet dropouts phenomenon in the sensor-to-controller (S/C) channel and the controller-to-actuator (C/A) channel. According to the periodic property of the Round-Robin Scheduling (RRS), an auxiliary system with augmented Markov chain is established by the lifting technique to facilitate the stability analysis of the closed-loop system. A necessary and sufficient condition of the exponential mean-square stability for the NCSs is derived. Two illustrative examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability analysis method. © 2013 The Franklin Institute.

However, many adaptive control schemes developed for such systems require their parameters to be slowly time-varying. This paper presents an adaptive modular control scheme for parametric strict feedback nonlinear time-varying systems. The parameters considered include continuously time-varying or discontinuous piece-wise constant parameters and they are not necessarily restricted to be slowly time-varying or infrequent jumping. It is shown that the proposed control scheme can guarantee the uniform boundedness of all closed-loop system signals. The performance of the tracking error in the mean square sense with respect to the parameter variation rate is also established. © 2013 AACC American Automatic Control Council.

0242364269	General matrix perturbation method for complex modes using singular value decomposition	A good understanding of the dynamic behavior of a structure under vibration and the ability to perform dynamic analysis is of vital importance for a designer. To satisfy a variety of requirements of structural dynamics, quite often in the dynamic design of structural systems, a so-called iterative design or reanalysis is generally carried out until a satisfactory outcome is achieved. A simple and general matrix perturbation method is proposed for the system dynamic reanalysis with complex modes. This method is developed by performing a sub-space condensation and by using the singular value decomposition of complex matrix. The first and second perturbation formulas are derived. The present method is universally applicable to systems with all the three cases of complex eigenvalues: distinct, repeated and closely spaced complex eigenvalues but complete modal expansion is not used. Illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the validity of this proposed technique. Three examples corresponding to the three cases of complex eigenvalues show that the present method is very effective.

84889632435	Gross ecosystem product: Concept, accounting framework and case study	Ecosystem products and services are essentials for human survival and development. Gross ecosystem product (GEP) is defined as total values of ecosystem products and services for human welfare and sustainable development. GEP mainly refers to the total value of direct and indirect use values of ecosystem goods and services, including ecosystem provision value, ecological regulation services value and ecological culture services value. The purposes of GEP accounting are to analyze and evaluate the total of economic value supporting for human survival and well-being. There are three basic tasks in GEP accounting, including functional value accounting, figuring out prices and economic value accounting of the ecosystem products and services. Accounting of GEP can be used to reveal the ecosystem contributions to economic and social development and human welfare, analyze the ecological linkages between regions, and assess the effectiveness and benefit of ecosystem conservation. In this paper, GEP of Guizhou Province was accounted as a case study. The evaluation results showed that the GEP of Guizhou in 2010 was 200134.6 million Yuan, the GEP per capita was 57526 Yuan, which was 4.3 times that of the GDP and per capita GDP. The study suggested that, ecosystems played a great role in supporting economic and social development of Guizhou. GEP accounting provides an instrument to understand and assess efficiency and effectiveness of ecosystem protection management and restoration.

84893019140	Value assessment of the function of the forest ecosystem services in Chongqing	Forest ecosystem provides mankind with many important products and services. However, man is not fully aware of the significance its services. Consequently, man has exploited the forest resources predatorily and managed them extensively, which in turn leads to the decrease of the size of forest and the weakening of the various services provided by the forest ecosystem. According to the characteristics and structure of the forest ecosystem of Chongqing, this paper divides the forest ecosystem services into four categories-provisioning services, regulating services, supporting services and cultural services. Taking the year of 2006 as the base year, this paper assesses seven ecosystem services provide by Chongqing forest ecosystem and evaluates qualitatively their economic values with recourse to market value method and production cost method. The research findings are as follows: the provisioning services of forest products have increased 45.82%, from 3.514 billion yuan in 2006 to 5.124 billion yuan in 2011. Forest carbon storage totals 62902000 tons, nearly an increase of 1million tons from the year of 2006. The water conservation value of the forest ecosystem in Chongqing is 97.711 billion yuan in 2006, whereas it reaches 103.632 billion yuan in 2011, an increase of 5.921 billion yuan. The erosion control capacity and quantity have also increased. The climiate regulation value has increased to 91.344 billion yuan in 2011 from 95.930 billion yuan in 2006, a net increase of 4.586 billion yuan. The total value of landscape tourism was 45.06 billion yuan in 2006, whereas it has increased to 70.2billion yuan in 2011. the net increase was 6.834billion yuan. Therefore, it is safe to say that the Project of Forest Chongqing has brought limited direct economic value, but it has contributed tremendous to the development of tourism in Chongqing. In terms of types of services, the value order goes as follows: Water Conservation>climate regulation>Landscape Tourism >Biodiversity Conservation> Soil Conservation>Carbon Sequestration. Since the forest ecosystem of Chongqing is highly valuable, more effort should be made to make people aware of the significance of the forest ecosystem. The research findings of the paper can provide scientific basis for the management, protection and compensation of ecosystem.

84893052662	Evaluating conservation effectiveness of nature reserves established for surrogate species: Case of a giant panda nature reserve in Qinling Mountains, China	Many nature reserves are established to protect the habitat needs of particular endangered species of interest but their effectiveness for protecting other species is questionable. In this study, this effectiveness was evaluated in a nature reserve network located in the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China. The network of reserves was established mainly for the conservation of the giant panda, a species considered as a surrogate for the conservation of many other endangered species in the region. The habitat suitability of nine protected species, including the giant panda, was modeled by using Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and their spatial congruence was analyzed. Habitat suitability of these species was also overlapped with nature reserve boundaries and their management zones (i.e., core, buffer and experimental zones). Results show that in general the habitat of the giant panda constitutes a reasonable surrogate of the habitat of other protected species, and giant panda reserves protect a relatively high proportion of the habitat of other protected species. Therefore, giant panda habitat conservation also allows the conservation of the habitat of other protected species in the region. However, a large area of suitable habitat was excluded from the nature reserve network. In addition, four species exhibited a low proportion of highly suitable habitat inside the core zones of nature reserves. It suggests that a high proportion of suitable habitat of protected species not targeted for conservation is located in the experimental and buffer zones, thus, is being affected by human activities. To increase their conservation effectiveness, nature reserves and their management zones need to be re-examined in order to include suitable habitat of more endangered species. The procedures described in this study can be easily implemented for the conservation of many endangered species not only in China but in many other parts of the world. © 2014 Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84894772352	Effect of organic carbon source on chromate reduction by Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Batch experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of two organic carbon sources, malate and glucose on Cr(VI) reduction by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pH, redox potential and cell growth during Cr(VI) reduction were measured to analyze the difference in the effect of these two organic carbon sources. The results demonstrated that both of malate and glucose promoted bacterial Cr(VI) reduction and malate was better than glucose. The reduction efficiency increased with supplementation of glucose and malate by 16.34% and 25.72%, respectively. The cell growth was obviously higher with addition of malate than addition of glucose. Addition of glucose resulted in the decrease of pH and increase of redox potential in culture medium, while the trend of pH and redox potential variation was opposite to that when malate was applied. Cr(VI) was reduced by liquid culture metabolite (LCM, without cells) when glucose was added in liquid medium, but Cr(VI) was not reduced by LCM (without cells) when malate was used.

84894375292	Natural recovery and restoration in giant panda habitat after the Wenchuan earthquake	Natural disasters affect forest ecosystems in profound and complex ways. Artificial restoration projects have been conducted worldwide to repair disaster damage to forests, but the efficacy of such projects in light of naturally occurring recovery processes is rarely evaluated. To fill such an important knowledge gap, we investigated forest recovery and restoration in the world-renowned Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan, China after the catastrophic Wenchuan earthquake (magnitude 8.0) in 2008, which caused considerable damage to the forest and habitat of the endangered giant panda. This was the first multi-year field study to document natural recovery of forests in response to this disaster. Forest sampling conducted in panda habitat over a four-year period after the earthquake revealed that natural recovery was rapid, with vegetation covering roughly 70% of once denuded sites by the fourth sampling year. Vegetation recovery was further improved in sampled artificial restoration sites, which recovered from an average of 30% vegetation cover to 70% in only one year. Factors including soil cover and slope were correlated with successful vegetation recovery. New information learned from the multi-year field data provided a finer scale context for understanding the effects of disasters, a novel contribution considering that the majority of previous work has been conducted at the broader scale using remote sensing. Spatial analysis revealed that restoration sites were mainly distributed in areas of suitable slopes and elevations, but a measurable proportion (30-40%) were located too far from the existing panda distribution area and too close to human settlements. The restoration project has thus far had limited direct effect on giant panda conservation, but has indirect effects on improving forest cover in areas previously affected by human disturbances. This study provides a useful reference for understanding conditions affecting forest recovery, which can inform decision-making surrounding the implementation of forest restoration projects and conservation of endangered species, not only in China but also around the world. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84898804833	Impact of livestock on giant pandas and their habitat	Livestock production is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide. However, impacts of livestock on endangered species have been understudied, particularly across the livestock-wildlife interface in forested protected areas. We investigated the impact of an emerging livestock sector in China's renowned Wolong Nature Reserve for giant pandas. We integrated empirical data from field surveys, remotely sensed imagery, and GPS collar tracking to analyze (1) the spatial distribution of horses in giant panda habitat, (2) space use and habitat selection patterns of horses and pandas, and (3) the impact of horses on pandas and bamboo (panda's main food source). We discovered that the horse distribution overlapped with suitable giant panda habitat. Horses had smaller home ranges than pandas but both species showed similarities in habitat selection. Horses consumed considerable amounts of bamboo, and may have resulted in a decline in panda habitat use. Our study highlights the need to formulate policies to address this emerging threat to the endangered giant panda. It also has implications for understanding livestock impacts in other protected areas across the globe. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

The experiments in vivo included the observation of infiltration of inflammatory cell inside the tumor on nude mice and the coagulation embolism of the treated part of rat liver by Harris Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) Staining. The results showed that the apoptosis rate was relatively lower when tumor cells were treated with 6 and 12 pulses, compared with the significantly increased apoptosis rate and proliferation inhibition after 24 hours when increasing the pulse number to 18 and 30. In vivo, wide coagulation embolism was found in the treated rats' livers, and the tumor volume of the experimental group gradually was narrowed into scar shape along with diffused necrosis of tumor cells and the infiltration of inflammatory cells inside the tumor. It is concluded that three changes of tumor microenvironment mainly enhance the ablation of tumor mass in nsPEFs treatment: the early apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells, the secondary necrosis of tumor caused by vascular embolism, and the self-destruction are induced by the enriched inflammatory cells inside tumors.

84922575468	Research progress in function zoning of nature reserves in China	function zoning of nature reserves is a very important process in nature reserves construction and management. Currently function zones of nature reserves in China adopt in mode of “core zone-buffer zone -experimental zone” suggested by Man and Biosphere Reserve. In this paper, progress summarization about function zoning method, problems and difficulties in function zoning were analyzed. Currently five types of function zoning method, containing species distribution modeling (SDM), landscape suitability evaluation (LSE), cluster analysis, least-cost distance analysis and irreplaceability analysis, were introduced. Different methods had different application scopes. SDM an LSE emphasized on natural resources and biodiversity conservation, without consideration on human activity and resources utilization. The other three methods considered both biodiversity conservation and resources utilization. Some problems existed in current function zoning practices. One was lacking effective method of function zoning for different types of nature reserves in different area. Another one was inadequate background data and material for function zoning. The other was static function zoning patterns, and inharmony between nature reserves. Measures corresponding to these problems were also proposed. Analysis in this paper will provide scientific basis for improvement of function zoning in Chinas’ nature reserves.
