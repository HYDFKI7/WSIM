33646881501	Improved measurement of double helicity asymmetry in inclulsive midrapidity π0 production for polarized p+p collisions at s=200GeV	We present an improved measurement of the double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in polarized proton-proton scattering at s=200GeV employing the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The improvements to our previous measurement come from two main factors: Inclusion of a new data set from the 2004 RHIC run with higher beam polarizations than the earlier run and a recalibration of the beam polarization measurements for the earlier run, which resulted in reduced uncertainties and increased beam polarizations. The results are compared to a Next to Leading Order (NLO) perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculation with a range of polarized gluon distributions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33748295641	Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons at LEP	The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for the neutral Higgs bosons which are predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The data of the four collaborations are statistically combined and examined for their consistency with the background hypothesis and with a possible Higgs boson signal. The combined LEP data show no significant excess of events which would indicate the production of Higgs bosons. The search results are used to set upper bounds on the cross-sections of various Higgs-like event topologies. The results are interpreted within the MSSM in a number of "benchmark" models, including CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. These interpretations lead in all cases to large exclusions in the MSSM parameter space. Absolute limits are set on the parameter tan β and, in some scenarios, on the masses of neutral Higgs bosons.

Two independent methods have been used to determine the heavy-flavor yields, and the results are in good agreement with each other. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative QCD calculation agrees with the data within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties, with the data/theory ratio of 1.71±0.02stat±0.18sys for 0.3<pT<9GeV/c.

34247106189	Scaling properties of azimuthal anisotropy in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV	Differential measurements of elliptic flow (v2) for Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200GeV are used to test and validate predictions from perfect fluid hydrodynamics for scaling of v2 with eccentricity, system size, and transverse kinetic energy (KET). For KETmT-m up to ∼1GeV the scaling is compatible with hydrodynamic expansion of a thermalized fluid. For large values of KET mesons and baryons scale separately. Quark number scaling reveals a universal scaling of v2 for both mesons and baryons over the full KET range for Au+Au. For Au+Au and Cu+Cu the scaling is more pronounced in terms of KET, rather than transverse momentum. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34547326716	System size and energy dependence of jet-induced hadron pair correlation shapes in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 and 62.4 GeV	We present azimuthal angle correlations of intermediate transverse momentum (1-4GeV/c) hadrons from dijets in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV. The away-side dijet induced azimuthal correlation is broadened, non-Gaussian, and peaked away from Δ =π in central and semicentral collisions in all the systems. The broadening and peak location are found to depend upon the number of participants in the collision, but not on the collision energy or beam nuclei. These results are consistent with sound or shock wave models, but pose challenges to Cherenkov gluon radiation models. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34848889574	Inclusive cross section and double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in p+p collisions at s=200GeV: Implications for the polarized gluon distribution in the proton	The PHENIX experiment presents results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider 2005 run with polarized proton collisions at s=200GeV, for inclusive π0 production at midrapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are given for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 20GeV/c, extending the range of published data to both lower and higher pT. The cross section is described well for pT<1GeV/c by an exponential in pT, and, for pT>2GeV/c, by perturbative QCD. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented based on a factor of 5 improvement in uncertainties as compared to previously published results, due to both an improved beam polarization of 50%, and to higher integrated luminosity. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton. Using one representative model of gluon polarization it is demonstrated that the gluon spin contribution to the proton spin is significantly constrained. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

38049091925	Transverse momentum and centrality dependence of dihadron correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV: Jet quenching and the response of partonic matter	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for charged hadrons from dijets for 0.4<pT<10 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons to p+p data suggest that the away-side can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ∼π and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ∼π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the head region softens toward central collisions, consistent with the onset of jet quenching. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT, which offers constraints on energy transport mechanisms and suggests that it contains the medium response to energetic jets. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

34247400755	Energy loss and flow of heavy quarks in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	The PHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured electrons with 0.3<pT<9GeV/c at midrapidity (|y|<0.35) from heavy-flavor (charm and bottom) decays in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The nuclear modification factor RAA relative to p+p collisions shows a strong suppression in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced at RHIC energies. A large azimuthal anisotropy v2 with respect to the reaction plane is observed for 0.5<pT<5GeV/c indicating substantial heavy-flavor elliptic flow. Both RAA and v2 show a pT dependence different from those of neutral pions. A comparison to transport models which simultaneously describe RAA(pT) and v2(pT) suggests that the viscosity to entropy density ratio is close to the conjectured quantum lower bound, i.e., near a perfect fluid. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

41249103994	Cold nuclear matter effects on J/ψ production as constrained by deuteron-gold measurements at sNN=200 GeV	We present a new analysis of J/ψ production yields in deuteron-gold collisions at sNN=200 GeV using data taken from the PHENIX experiment in 2003 and previously published in S. S. Adler [Phys. Rev. Lett 96, 012304 (2006)]. The high statistics proton-proton J/ψ data taken in 2005 are used to improve the baseline measurement and thus construct updated cold nuclear matter modification factors (RdAu). A suppression of J/ψ in cold nuclear matter is observed as one goes forward in rapidity (in the deuteron-going direction), corresponding to a region more sensitive to initial-state low-x gluons in the gold nucleus. The measured nuclear modification factors are compared to theoretical calculations of nuclear shadowing to which a J/ψ (or precursor) breakup cross section is added. Breakup cross sections of σbreakup=2.8-1. 4+1.7 (2.2-1.5+1.6) mb are obtained by fitting these calculations to the data using two different models of nuclear shadowing. These breakup cross-section values are consistent within large uncertainties with the 4.2±0.5 mb determined at lower collision energies. Projecting this range of cold nuclear matter effects to copper-copper and gold-gold collisions reveals that the current constraints are not sufficient to firmly quantify the additional hot nuclear matter effect. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

This study focuses on the extraction of the double-helicity asymmetry in η production (p→+p→→η+X), the η cross section, and the η/π0 cross section ratio.

84908160199	System-size dependence of open-heavy-flavor production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at sNN =200 GeV	The PHENIX Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured open-heavy-flavor production in Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200 GeV through the measurement of electrons at midrapidity that originate from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons. In peripheral Cu+Cu collisions an enhanced production of electrons is observed relative to p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions. In the transverse momentum range from 1 to 5 GeV/c the nuclear modification factor is RAA∼1.4. As the system size increases to more central Cu+Cu collisions, the enhancement gradually disappears and turns into a suppression. For pT>3 GeV/c, the suppression reaches RAA∼0.8 in the most central collisions. The pT and centrality dependence of RAA in Cu+Cu collisions agree quantitatively with RAA in d+Au and Au+Au collisions, if compared at a similar number of participating nucleons.

84908179316	Centrality categorization for Rp(d)+A in high-energy collisions	High-energy proton- and deuteron-nucleus collisions provide an excellent tool for studying a wide array of physics effects, including modifications of parton distribution functions in nuclei, gluon saturation, and color neutralization and hadronization in a nuclear environment, among others. All of these effects are expected to have a significant dependence on the size of the nuclear target and the impact parameter of the collision, also known as the collision centrality. In this article, we detail a method for determining centrality classes in p(d)+A collisions via cuts on the multiplicity at backward rapidity (i.e., the nucleus-going direction) and for determining systematic uncertainties in this procedure. For d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV we find that the connection to geometry is confirmed by measuring the fraction of events in which a neutron from the deuteron does not interact with the nucleus. As an application, we consider the nuclear modification factors Rp(d)+A, for which there is a bias in the measured centrality-dependent yields owing to auto correlations between the process of interest and the backward-rapidity multiplicity. We determine the bias-correction factors within this framework. This method is further tested using the hijing Monte Carlo generator. We find that for d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV, these bias corrections are small and vary by less than 5% (10%) up to pT=10 (20) GeV/c. In contrast, for p+Pb collisions at sNN=5.02 TeV we find that these bias factors are an order of magnitude larger and strongly pT dependent, likely attributable to the larger effect of multiparton interactions.

84908239582	Cross section and transverse single-spin asymmetry of η mesons in p↑+p collisions at s =200GeV at forward rapidity	We present a measurement of the cross section and transverse single-spin asymmetry (AN) for η mesons at large pseudorapidity from s=200GeV p↑+p collisions. The measured cross section for 0.5<pT<5.0GeV/c and 3.0<|η|<3.8 is well described by a next-to-leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculation. The asymmetries AN have been measured as a function of Feynman-x (xF) from 0.2<|xF|<0.7, as well as transverse momentum (pT) from 1.0<pT<4.5GeV/c. The asymmetry averaged over positive xF is 〈AN〉=0.061±0.014. The results are consistent with prior transverse single-spin measurements of forward η and π0 mesons at various energies in overlapping xF ranges. Comparison of different particle species can help to determine the origin of the large observed asymmetries in p↑+p collisions.

46349083491	Quantitative constraints on the transport properties of hot partonic matter from semi-inclusive single high transverse momentum pion suppression in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The PHENIX experiment has measured the suppression of semi-inclusive single high-transverse-momentum π0's in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The present understanding of this suppression is in terms of energy loss of the parent (fragmenting) parton in a dense color-charge medium. We have performed a quantitative comparison between various parton energy-loss models and our experimental data. The statistical point-to-point uncorrelated as well as correlated systematic uncertainties are taken into account in the comparison. We detail this methodology and the resulting constraint on the model parameters, such as the initial color-charge density dNg/dy, the medium transport coefficient q, or the initial energy-loss parameter ε0. We find that high-transverse-momentum π0 suppression in Au+Au collisions has sufficient precision to constrain these model-dependent parameters at the ±20-25% (one standard deviation) level. These constraints include only the experimental uncertainties, and further studies are needed to compute the corresponding theoretical uncertainties. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

47149098083	Dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for a broad range of transverse momentum (0.4<pT<10 GeV/c) and centrality (0-92%) selections for charged hadrons from dijets in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side Δ distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons with p+p data suggest that the away-side distribution can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ~π, and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ~π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the associated hadrons in the head region softens toward central collisions. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT. The properties of the near-side distributions are also modified relative to those in p+p collisions, reflected by the broadening of the jet shape in Δ and Δη, and an enhancement of the per-trigger yield. However, these modifications seem to be limited to pT4 GeV/c, above which both the hadron pair shape and per-trigger yield become similar to p+p collisions. These observations suggest that both the away- and near-side distributions contain a jet fragmentation component which dominates for pT5 GeV/c and a medium-induced component which is important for pT4 GeV/c. We also quantify the role of jets at intermediate and low pT through the yield of jet-induced pairs in comparison with binary scaled p+p pair yield. The yield of jet-induced pairs is suppressed at high pair proxy energy (sum of the pT magnitudes of the two hadrons) and is enhanced at low pair proxy energy. The former is consistent with jet quenching; the latter is consistent with the enhancement of soft hadron pairs due to transport of lost energy to lower pT. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Relative to π0 yields in p+p collisions scaled by the number of inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions (Ncoll) the π0 yields for pT □2GeV/c in central Cu+Cu collisions are suppressed at 62.4 and 200 GeV whereas an enhancement is observed at 22.4 GeV. A comparison with a jet-quenching model suggests that final state parton energy loss dominates in central Cu+Cu collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV, while the enhancement at 22.4 GeV is consistent with nuclear modifications in the initial state alone. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

54049132456	Charged hadron multiplicity fluctuations in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions from sNN=22.5 to 200 GeV	A comprehensive survey of event-by-event fluctuations of charged hadron multiplicity in relativistic heavy ions is presented. The survey covers Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV, and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=22.5,62.4, and 200 GeV. Fluctuations are measured as a function of collision centrality, transverse momentum range, and charge sign. After correcting for nondynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations in the collision geometry within a centrality bin, the remaining dynamical fluctuations expressed as the variance normalized by the mean tend to decrease with increasing centrality. The dynamical fluctuations are consistent with or below the expectation from a superposition of participant nucleon-nucleon collisions based upon p+p data, indicating that this dataset does not exhibit evidence of critical behavior in terms of the compressibility of the system. A comparison of the data with a model where hadrons are independently emitted from a number of hadron clusters suggests that the mean number of hadrons per cluster is small in heavy ion collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

A fivefold suppression is found, which is essentially constant for 5<pT<20GeV/c. Experimental uncertainties are small enough to constrain any model-dependent parametrization for the transport coefficient of the medium, e.g., □□ in the parton quenching model.

Unpolarized cross section results are measured for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 7GeV/c. Next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations are compared with the data, and while the calculations are consistent with the measurements, next-to-leading logarithmic corrections improve the agreement.

Measured asymmetries are consistent with zero, and at a theory scale of μ2=4GeV2 a next to leading order QCD analysis gives ΔG[0.02,0.3]=0.2, with a constraint of -0.7<ΔG[0. 02,0.3]<0.5 at Δχ2=9 (∼3σ) for the sampled gluon momentum fraction (x) range, 0.02 to 0.3.

70349124227	Photon-hadron jet correlations in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We report the observation at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider of suppression of back-to-back correlations in the direct photon+jet channel in Au+Au relative to p+p collisions. Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons are obtained by statistical subtraction of the decay photon-hadron (γ-h) background. The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly constrained, because the parton-photon pair exactly balance in momentum at leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, making such correlations a powerful probe of the in-medium parton energy loss. The away-side nuclear suppression factor, IAA, in central Au+Au collisions, is 0.32±0.12stat±0.09syst for hadrons of 3<pTh<5 in coincidence with photons of 5<pTγ<15 GeV/c. The suppression is comparable to that observed for high-pT single hadrons and dihadrons. The direct photon associated yields in p+p collisions scale approximately with the momentum balance, zT pTh/pTγ, as expected for a measurement of the away-side parton fragmentation function. We compare to Au+Au collisions for which the momentum balance dependence of the nuclear modification should be sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

77649125267	Double-helicity dependence of jet properties from dihadrons in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	It has been postulated that partonic orbital angular momentum can lead to a significant double-helicity dependence in the net transverse momentum of Drell-Yan dileptons produced in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions. Analogous effects are also expected for dijet production. If confirmed by experiment, this hypothesis, which is based on semiclassical arguments, could lead to a new approach for studying the contributions of orbital angular momentum to the proton spin. We report the first measurement of the double-helicity dependence of the dijet transverse momentum in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV from data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2005 and 2006. The analysis deduces the transverse momentum of the dijet from the widths of the near- and far-side peaks in the azimuthal correlation of the dihadrons. When averaged over the transverse momentum of the triggered particle, the difference of the root mean square of the dijet transverse momentum between like- and unlike-helicity collisions is found to be -37±88stat±14systMeV/c. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The Au+Au distribution at low pTa, whose shape has been interpreted as a medium effect, is modified for pTt<7GeV/c. At higher pTt, the data are consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest measured pTa, which quantitatively challenges some medium response models. The associated yield of hadrons opposing the trigger particle in Au+Au relative to p+p (IAA) is suppressed at high pT (IAA ≈ 0.35-0.5), but less than for inclusive suppression (RAA ≈ 0.2). © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The J/ψ polarization is studied in the helicity, Gottfried-Jackson, and Collins-Soper frames for pT<5GeV/c and |y|<0.35. The polarization in the helicity and Gottfried-Jackson frames is consistent with zero for all transverse momenta, with a slight (1.8 sigma) trend towards longitudinal polarization for transverse momenta above 2GeV/c. No conclusion is allowed due to the limited acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame and the uncertainties of the current data.

They indicate nuclear modification factors (RAA) which are similar in both magnitude and trend to those found in earlier π0 measurements. Linear fits to RAA as a function of pT in 5-20 GeV/c show that the slope is consistent with zero within two standard deviations at all centralities, although a slow rise cannot be excluded. Having different statistical and systematic uncertainties, the π0 and η measurements are complementary at high pT; thus, along with the extended pT range of these data they can provide additional constraints for theoretical modeling and the extraction of transport properties. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77957597955	Azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV: Path-length dependence of jet quenching and the role of initial geometry	We have measured the azimuthal anisotropy of π0 production for 1<pT<18GeV/c for Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The observed anisotropy shows a gradual decrease for 3pT7-10GeV/c, but remains positive beyond 10GeV/c. The magnitude of this anisotropy is underpredicted, up to at least ∼10GeV/c, by current perturbative QCD (PQCD) energy-loss model calculations. An estimate of the increase in anisotropy expected from initial-geometry modification due to gluon saturation effects and fluctuations is insufficient to account for this discrepancy. Calculations that implement a path-length dependence steeper than what is implied by current PQCD energy-loss models show reasonable agreement with the data. ©2010 The American Physical Society.

The measurement was performed over the rapidity ranges 1.2<|y|<2.2 and |y|<0.35 for transverse momenta up to 6GeV/c. J/ψ production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is dominated by processes involving initial-state gluons, and transverse single-spin asymmetries of the J/ψ can provide access to gluon dynamics within the nucleon. Such asymmetries may also shed light on the long-standing question in QCD of the J/ψ production mechanism. Asymmetries were obtained as a function of J/ψ transverse momentum and Feynman-x, with a value of -0.086±0.026stat±0.003syst in the forward region. This result suggests possible nonzero trigluon correlation functions in transversely polarized protons and, if well defined in this reaction, a nonzero gluon Sivers distribution function. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

79960913696	Azimuthal correlations of electrons from heavy-flavor decay with hadrons in p+p and Au+Au collisions at √s	Measurements of electrons from the decay of open-heavy-flavor mesons have shown that the yields are suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to expectations from binary-scaled p+p collisions. These measurements indicate that charm and bottom quarks interact with the hot dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions much more than expected. Here we extend these studies to two-particle correlations where one particle is an electron from the decay of a heavy-flavor meson and the other is a charged hadron from either the decay of the heavy meson or from jet fragmentation. These measurements provide more detailed information about the interactions between heavy quarks and the matter, such as whether the modification of the away-side-jet shape seen in hadron-hadron correlations is present when the trigger particle is from heavy-meson decay and whether the overall level of away-side-jet suppression is consistent. We statistically subtract correlations of electrons arising from background sources from the inclusive electron-hadron correlations and obtain two-particle azimuthal correlations at √s

84866527479	Observation of direct-photon collective flow in Au+Au collisions at √S<inf>NN</inf> = 200 GeV	The second Fourier component v2 of the azimuthal anisotropy with respect to the reaction plane was measured for direct photons at midrapidity and transverse momentum (pT) of 1-13 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at √S<inf>NN</inf> = 200 GeV. Previous measurements of this quantity for hadrons with pT < 6 GeV/c indicate that the medium behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for pT > 6 GeV/c a reduced anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for pT > 4 GeV/c the anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the pT < 4 GeV/c region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon v<inf>2</inf> comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed v<inf>2</inf>.

84892921965	Fluctuations of charge separation perpendicular to the event plane and local parity violation in s NN = 200 GeV Au + Au collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider	Previous experimental results based on data (∼15×106 events) collected by the STAR detector at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider suggest event-by-event charge-separation fluctuations perpendicular to the event plane in noncentral heavy-ion collisions. Here we present the correlator previously used split into its two component parts to reveal correlations parallel and perpendicular to the event plane. The results are from a high-statistics 200-GeV Au + Au collisions data set (57×106 events) collected by the STAR experiment. We explicitly count units of charge separation from which we find clear evidence for more charge-separation fluctuations perpendicular than parallel to the event plane. We also employ a modified correlator to study the possible P-even background in same- and opposite-charge correlations, and find that the P-even background may largely be explained by momentum conservation and collective motion. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84892923426	Azimuthal anisotropy of π 0 and η mesons in Au + Au collisions at s NN = 200 GeV	The azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v2 and v4 of π0 and η mesons are measured in Au + Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV as a function of transverse momentum pT (1-14 GeV/c) and centrality. The extracted v2 coefficients are found to be consistent between the two meson species over the measured pT range. The ratio of v4/v22 for π0 mesons is found to be independent of pT for 1-9 GeV/c, implying a lack of sensitivity of the ratio to the change of underlying physics with pT. Furthermore, the ratio of v4/v22 is systematically larger in central collisions, which may reflect the combined effects of fluctuations in the initial collision geometry and finite viscosity in the evolving medium. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84894281416	Neutral pion cross section and spin asymmetries at intermediate pseudorapidity in polarized proton collisions at s = 200 GeV	The differential cross section and spin asymmetries for neutral pions produced within the intermediate pseudorapidity range 0.8<η<2.0 in polarized proton-proton collisions at s=200 GeV are presented. Neutral pions were detected using the end cap electromagnetic calorimeter in the STAR detector at RHIC. The cross section was measured over a transverse momentum range of 5<pT<16 GeV/c and is found to agree with a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry ALL is measured in the same pseudorapidity range and spans a range of Bjorken-x down to x≈0.01. The measured ALL is consistent with model predictions for varying degrees of gluon polarization. The parity-violating asymmetry AL is also measured and found to be consistent with zero. The transverse single-spin asymmetry AN is measured over a previously unexplored kinematic range in Feynman-x and pT. Such measurements may aid our understanding of the onset and kinematic dependence of the large asymmetries observed at more forward pseudorapidity (η≈3) and their underlying mechanisms. The AN results presented are consistent with a twist-3 model prediction of a small asymmetry over the present kinematic range. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84894469564	Energy dependence of moments of net-proton multiplicity distributions at RHIC	We report the beam energy (sNN=7.7-200 GeV) and collision centrality dependence of the mean (M), standard deviation (σ), skewness (S), and kurtosis (κ) of the net-proton multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions. The measurements are carried out by the STAR experiment at midrapidity (|y|<0.5) and within the transverse momentum range 0.4<pT<0.8 GeV/c in the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. These measurements are important for understanding the quantum chromodynamic phase diagram. The products of the moments, Sσ and κσ2, are sensitive to the correlation length of the hot and dense medium created in the collisions and are related to the ratios of baryon number susceptibilities of corresponding orders. The products of moments are found to have values significantly below the Skellam expectation and close to expectations based on independent proton and antiproton production. The measurements are compared to a transport model calculation to understand the effect of acceptance and baryon number conservation and also to a hadron resonance gas model. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84897379022	Jet-hadron correlations in sNN =200GeV p+p and central Au+Au collisions	Azimuthal angular correlations of charged hadrons with respect to the axis of a reconstructed (trigger) jet in Au+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV in STAR are presented. The trigger jet population in Au+Au collisions is biased toward jets that have not interacted with the medium, allowing easier matching of jet energies between Au+Au and p+p collisions while enhancing medium effects on the recoil jet. The associated hadron yield of the recoil jet is significantly suppressed at high transverse momentum (pTassoc) and enhanced at low pTassoc in 0%-20% central Au+Au collisions compared to p+p collisions, which is indicative of medium-induced parton energy loss in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84898810279	Heavy-flavor electron-muon correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	Background: Heavy-flavor modification in relativistic p(d)+A collisions are sensitive to different kinds of strong-interaction physics ranging from modifications of the nuclear wave function to initial- and final-state energy loss. Modifications to single heavy-flavor particles and their decay leptons at midrapidity and forward rapidity are well established at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Purpose: This paper presents measurements of azimuthal correlations of electron-muon pairs produced from heavy-flavor decays, primarily cc̄, in sNN=200 GeV p+p and d+Au collision using the PHENIX detector at RHIC. The electrons are measured at midrapidity while the muons in the pair are measured at forward rapidity, defined as the direction of the deuteron beam, in order to utilize the deuteron to probe low-x partons in the gold nucleus. Methods: This analysis uses the central spectrometer arms for electron identification and forward spectrometer arms for muon identification. Azimuthal correlations are built in all sign combinations for e-μ pairs. Subtracting the like-sign yield from the unlike-sign yield removes the correlations from light flavor decays and conversions. Results: Comparing the p+p results with several different Monte Carlo event generators, we find the results are consistent with a total charm cross section σcc̄=538±46 (stat) ± 197 (data syst) ± 174 (model syst) μb. These generators also indicate that the back-to-back peak at Δφ=π is dominantly from the leading-order contributions (gluon fusion), while higher-order processes (flavor excitation and gluon splitting) contribute to the yield at all Δφ. We observe a suppression in the pair yield per collision in d+Au. We find the pair yield suppression factor for 2.7<Δφ<3.2 rad is JdA=0.433±0.087 (stat) ± 0.135 (syst). Conclusions: The e-μ pairs result from partons at xAu∼10-2 at Q2=10 GeV/c2 at the edge of the shadowing region. The pair suppression indicates modification to cc̄ pairs for these kinematics in the cold nuclear medium at RHIC. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84899766375	Transverse-energy distributions at midrapidity in p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at s NN =62.4 -200 GeV and implications for particle-production models	Measurements of the midrapidity transverse-energy distribution, dET/dη, are presented for p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV and additionally for Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 130 GeV. The dET/dη distributions are first compared with the number of nucleon participants Npart, number of binary collisions Ncoll, and number of constituent-quark participants Nqp calculated from a Glauber model based on the nuclear geometry. For Au+Au, dET/d/Npart increases with Npart, while dET/d/Nqp is approximately constant for all three energies. This indicates that the two-component ansatz, dET/d (1-x)Npart/2+xNcoll, which was used to represent ET distributions, is simply a proxy for Nqp, and that the Ncoll term does not represent a hard-scattering component in ET distributions. The dET/dη distributions of Au+Au and d+Au are then calculated from the measured p+p ET distribution using two models that both reproduce the Au+Au data. However, while the number-of-constituent-quark- participant model agrees well with the d+Au data, the additive-quark model does not. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84899510179	Beam-energy dependence of the directed flow of protons, antiprotons, and pions in au+au collisions	Rapidity-odd directed flow (v1) measurements for charged pions, protons, and antiprotons near midrapidity (y=0) are reported in sNN=7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions as recorded by the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. At intermediate impact parameters, the proton and net-proton slope parameter dv1/dy|y=0 shows a minimum between 11.5 and 19.6 GeV. In addition, the net-proton dv1/dy|y=0 changes sign twice between 7.7 and 39 GeV. The proton and net-proton results qualitatively resemble predictions of a hydrodynamic model with a first-order phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined matter, and differ from hadronic transport calculations. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84903518309	Cold-nuclear-matter effects on heavy-quark production at forward and backward rapidity in d+Au collisions at sNN =200GeV	The PHENIX experiment has measured open heavy-flavor production via semileptonic decay over the transverse momentum range 1<pT<6GeV/c at forward and backward rapidity (1.4<|y|<2.0) in d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV. In central d+Au collisions, relative to the yield in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, a suppression is observed at forward rapidity (in the d-going direction) and an enhancement at backward rapidity (in the Au-going direction). Predictions using nuclear-modified-parton-distribution functions, even with additional nuclear-pT broadening, cannot simultaneously reproduce the data at both rapidity ranges, which implies that these models are incomplete and suggests the possible importance of final-state interactions in the asymmetric d+Au collision system. These results can be used to probe cold-nuclear-matter effects, which may significantly affect heavy-quark production, in addition to helping constrain the magnitude of charmonia-breakup effects in nuclear matter. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84904314168	Dielectron mass spectra from Au+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	We report the STAR measurements of dielectron (e+e-) production at midrapidity (|yee|<1) in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The measurements are evaluated in different invariant mass regions with a focus on 0.30-0.76 (ρ-like), 0.76-0.80 (ω-like), and 0.98-1.05 (φ-like) GeV/c2. The spectrum in the ω-like and φ-like regions can be well described by the hadronic cocktail simulation. In the ρ-like region, however, the vacuum ρ spectral function cannot describe the shape of the dielectron excess. In this range, an enhancement of 1.77±0.11(stat)±0.24(syst)±0. 33(cocktail) is determined with respect to the hadronic cocktail simulation that excludes the ρ meson. The excess yield in the ρ-like region increases with the number of collision participants faster than the ω and φ yields. Theoretical models with broadened ρ contributions through interactions with constituents in the hot QCD medium provide a consistent description of the dilepton mass spectra for the measurement presented here and the earlier data at the Super Proton Synchrotron energies. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84904962774	Inclusive double-helicity asymmetries in neutral-pion and eta-meson production in p → + p → collisions at s =200GeV	Results are presented from data recorded in 2009 by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider for the double-longitudinal spin asymmetry, ALL, for π0 and η production in s=200GeV polarized p+p collisions. Comparison of the π0 results with different theory expectations based on fits of other published data showed a preference for small positive values of gluon polarization, ΔG, in the proton in the probed Bjorken x range. The effect of adding the new 2009 π0 data to a recent global analysis of polarized scattering data is also shown, resulting in a best fit value ΔGDSSV[0.05,0.2]=0.06-0.15+0.11 in the range 0.05<x<0.2, with the uncertainty at Δχ2=9 when considering only statistical experimental uncertainties. Shifting the PHENIX data points by their systematic uncertainty leads to a variation of the best-fit value of ΔGDSSV[0.05,0.2] between 0.02 and 0.12, demonstrating the need for full treatment of the experimental systematic uncertainties in future global analyses. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84904965636	Measurement of transverse-single-spin asymmetries for midrapidity and forward-rapidity production of hadrons in polarized p+p collisions at s =200 and 62.4 GeV measurement of transverse-single-spin ... A. ADARE et al.	Measurements of transverse-single-spin asymmetries (AN) in p+p collisions at s=62.4 and 200 GeV with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider are presented. At midrapidity, AN is measured for neutral pion and eta mesons reconstructed from diphoton decay, and, at forward rapidities, neutral pions are measured using both diphotons and electromagnetic clusters. The neutral-pion measurement of AN at midrapidity is consistent with zero with uncertainties a factor of 20 smaller than previous publications, which will lead to improved constraints on the gluon Sivers function. At higher rapidities, where the valence quark distributions are probed, the data exhibit sizable asymmetries. In comparison with previous measurements in this kinematic region, the new data extend the kinematic coverage in s and pT, and it is found that the asymmetries depend only weakly on s. The origin of the forward AN is presently not understood quantitatively. The extended reach to higher pT probes the transition between transverse momentum dependent effects at low pT and multiparton dynamics at high pT. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84905575386	Beam-energy dependence of charge separation along the magnetic field in Au+Au collisions at RHIC	Local parity-odd domains are theorized to form inside a quark-gluon plasma which has been produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The local parity-odd domains manifest themselves as charge separation along the magnetic field axis via the chiral magnetic effect. The experimental observation of charge separation has previously been reported for heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. In this Letter, we present the results of the beam-energy dependence of the charge correlations in Au+Au collisions at midrapidity for center-of-mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV from the STAR experiment. After background subtraction, the signal gradually reduces with decreased beam energy and tends to vanish by 7.7 GeV. This implies the dominance of hadronic interactions over partonic ones at lower collision energies. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84907263146	Beam energy dependence of moments of the net-charge multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at RHIC	We report the first measurements of the moments - mean (M), variance (2), skewness (S), and kurtosis (κ) - of the net-charge multiplicity distributions at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at seven energies, ranging from sNN=7.7 to 200 GeV, as a part of the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC. The moments are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of net charge, and are sensitive to the location of the QCD critical point. We compare the products of the moments, 2/M, S, and κ2, with the expectations from Poisson and negative binomial distributions (NBDs). The S values deviate from the Poisson baseline and are close to the NBD baseline, while the κ2 values tend to lie between the two. Within the present uncertainties, our data do not show nonmonotonic behavior as a function of collision energy. These measurements provide a valuable tool to extract the freeze-out parameters in heavy-ion collisions by comparing with theoretical models. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The charm production cross section per nucleon-nucleon collision at midrapidity scales with the number of binary collisions, Nbin, from p+p to central Au+Au collisions. The D0 meson yields in central Au+Au collisions are strongly suppressed compared to those in p+p scaled by Nbin, for transverse momenta pT>3GeV/c, demonstrating significant energy loss of charm quarks in the hot and dense medium. An enhancement at intermediate pT is also observed. Model calculations including strong charm-medium interactions and coalescence hadronization describe our measurements.

A significant suppression of pT-integrated J/ψ production is observed in central Au+Au events. The Cu+Cu data are consistent with no suppression, although the precision is limited by the available statistics. RAA in Au+Au collisions exhibits a strong suppression at low transverse momentum and gradually increases with pT. The data are compared to high-pT STAR results and previously published BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider results. Comparing with model calculations, it is found that the invariant yields at low pT are significantly above hydrodynamic flow predictions but are consistent with models that include color screening and regeneration. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has performed a systematic study of KS0 and K∗0 meson production at midrapidity in p+p,d+Au, and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The KS0 and K∗0 mesons are reconstructed via their KS0→π0(→γγ)π0(→γγ) and K∗0→K±π decay modes, respectively. The measured transverse-momentum spectra are used to determine the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons in d+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at different centralities. In the d+Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons is almost constant as a function of transverse momentum and is consistent with unity, showing that cold-nuclear-matter effects do not play a significant role in the measured kinematic range. In Cu+Cu collisions, within the uncertainties no nuclear modification is registered in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, both mesons show suppression relative to the expectations from the p+p yield scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions in the Cu+Cu system. In the pT range 2-5 GeV/c, the strange mesons (KS0,K∗0) similarly to the φ meson with hidden strangeness, show an intermediate suppression between the more suppressed light quark mesons (π0) and the nonsuppressed baryons (p,p¯). At higher transverse momentum, pT>5 GeV/c, production of all particles is similarly suppressed by a factor of ≈2.

In the mass region Mee<1.1 GeV/c2 the dielectron v2 measurements are found to be consistent with expectations from π0,η,ω, and φ decay contributions.

The nuclear modification of J/ψ yields in Cu+Au collisions in the Au-going direction is found to be comparable to that in Au+Au collisions when plotted as a function of the number of participating nucleons. In the Cu-going direction, J/ψ production shows a stronger suppression. This difference is comparable in magnitude and has the same sign as the difference expected from shadowing effects due to stronger low-x gluon suppression in the larger Au nucleus.
