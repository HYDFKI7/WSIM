84940356602	Efficacy of dendritic cells/cytokine induced killer cells adoptive immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer	Objective:To evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety of dendritic cells-cytokine induced killer cells (DC-CIK) combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: 80 mCRC patients were selected from Dalian Centre Hospital during November 2010 to November 2011. 40 patients were treated by DC-CIK combined with chemotherapy (combined group), and another 40 patients were treated by chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group). The immune function, therapeutic effect, toxicity and quality of life (QOL) were compared between the two groups after the treatment. Results: 160 cycles of DC-CIK were successfully treated. There were no obvious changes of T cell subsets in the peripheral blood in the combined group (P > 0.05), while the ratios of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly decreased after the treatment in the chemotherapy group, and obviously lower than that in the combined group (P <0.05). After treatment for 3 cycles, the IFN-γ level of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the combined group was significantly increased (P < 0.05), while the levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α in the chemotherapy group were significantly decreased after the treatment and were obviously lower than that in the combined group (P <0.05). No significant differences were found in the overall response rate (RR) between the combined group and the chemotherapy group (37.5% vs 22.5%,P > 0.05). The disease control rate (DCR) of the combined group was significantly higher than that of the chemotherapy group (77.5% vs 50.0%, P < 0.05). Ill-IV grade leucopenia and tardily diarrhea in the combined group were obviously lower than those of the chemotherapy group (17.5% vs 42.5%, 5.0% vs 25.0%, P <0.05). Other side effects showed no significant differences between the two groups, which can be alleviated after symptomatic treatment (P >0.05). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of the combined group was longer than that of the chemotherapy group (6. 5 months vs 4. 5 months, P <0. 05), while the median overall survival (OS) of the two groups had no significant difference (P >0. 05). The physical and emotional functions of the combined group were better than those of the chemotherapy group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Treatment with DC-CIK adoptive immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy can effectively improve the immune function, improve the efficacy, reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, prolong the PFS, and improve QOL of mCRC patients.

84940328709	An epidemiological research and risk factor analysis of adult rumination syndrome in a Chinese naval force	Objective To investigate the epidemiological features and its potential related risk factors of adult rumination syndrome (ARS) in Chinese naval servicemen, and to provide clinical basis for diagnosis and treatment of ARS. Methods A randomized cluster sampling method was used. Investigation and diagnosis were made according to the Rome III Modular Questionnaire from November 2006 to April 2007, and 8600 cases were collected from naval forces. Results 7454 valid questionnaires were retrieved. The overall incidence of ARS was 2.32% (176/7574, male>female). The median age, age of conscription and length of military service were 23, 18 and 4 years respectively. The ARS was most common in unmarried people, who were 21-25 years old holding a high school diploma, with a 1-4 years military service. The incidence of ARS was different between groups with different gender, age, years of military service and marital status (P< 0.05). No significant difference in the incidence between those with different education levels or blood types. The differences between individuals in ARS group and healthy controls were related to habit of overeating (P=0.0000), picky eating (P=0.0001), addiction to spicy food (P=0.0000), eating hard dry food (P=0.0001), and eating fruits (P=0.0188). Conclusion The overall incidence of ARS in naval force is 2.32%, and it is prevalent in young man. The body weight is an independent risk factor for ARS.

14044279964	A new approach for simultaneous shape and topology optimization based on implicit topology description functions	In the present paper, a new approach for structural topology optimization based on implicit topology description function (TDF) is proposed. TDF is used to describe the shape/topology of a structure, which is approximated in terms of the nodal values. Then a relationship is established between the element stiffness and the values of the topology description function on its four nodes. In this way and with some non-local treatments of the design sensitivities, not only the shape derivative but also the topological derivative of the optimal design can be incorporated in the numerical algorithm in a unified way. Numerical experiments demonstrate that by employing this approach, the computational efforts associated with TDF (and level set) based algorithms can be saved. Clear optimal topologies and smooth structural boundaries free from any sign of numerical instability can be obtained simultaneously and efficiently.

20544454396	Higher order Cauchy-Born rule based constitutive model of SWNT	Based on the higher order Cauchy-Born rule, a constitutive model of SWNT is established. In the present model, by including the second order deformation gradient tensor in the kinematic description, the limitation of the standard Cauchy-Born rule for the modeling of nanoscale crystalline films can be alleviated with less computational efforts. Based on the established relationship between the atomic potential and the macroscopic continuum strain energy density, analytical expressions for the tangent modulus tensors are derived. With the use of this model and the Tersoff-Brenner atomic potential for carbon, the size dependent mechanical properties of carbon nanotube are predicted. The obtained results agree well with those obtained by other experimental, atomic modeling and continuum concept based studies.

20144364787	An improved mathematical programming method for wrinkling prediction of cloths	Purpose - An improved mathematical programming method for numerical simulation of cloth wrinkling is investigated. Design/methodology/approach - Cloth is modeled as the network of bars (called bar network) or membrane elements with a special nonlinear mechanical constitutive law in the finite element analysis. Findings - Compared with conventional numerical methods, the proposed method does not depend on stress iteration, but on the base exchanges in the solution of a standard quadratic programming problem. Thus, the new method presents very good convergence behavior and accurate predictions of wrinkling patterns and stress distributions of cloths. Numerical results demonstrate the validity and the efficiency of the proposed method. Originality/value - From the engineering point of view, accurate numerical methods are required in wrinkling analysis of cloth deformation.

The distinctive feature of this method is the solutions of a sequence of approximated problems are sought which are formulated by relaxing the constraints of the original problem to some extent. The approximated problem can be solved efficiently by employing the algorithms developed for sizing optimization problems because its solution is not singular. It can also be proved that when the relaxation parameter is tending to zero, the solution of the approximated problem will converge to the solution of the original problem uniformly. Results are compared with those obtained by traditional methods.

The distinctive feature of this new approach is that unlike the typical treatment of topology optimization problems based on the ground structure approach, we eliminate the singular optima from the problem formulation and thus unify the sizing and topology optimization within the same framework. As a result, numerical methods developed for sizing optimization problems can be applied directly to the solution of topology optimization problems without any further treatment. The application of the proposed approach and its effectiveness are illustrated with several numerical examples.

Furthermore, by including overlapping bars in the initial ground structure, the difficulty caused by hinge cancellation as pointed out by Rozvany (1996) can be overcome. Also, the importance of inclusion of compatibility conditions in the problem formulation is demonstrated.

Some basic definitions such as topology design variables and their critical values, topology-dependent behaviour constraints which are directly associated with topology design variables and the limiting values of the constraint functions are introduced. Using grillage topology optimization problems as illustrations, it is demonstrated that the discontinuity of the topology-dependent behaviour constraint function at its critical values is the essential cause of the existence of a jellyfish-like feasible domain and a singular optimum. Jellyfish-like feasible domains may exist even in simple topology optimization problems subjected only to displacement constraints. Finally, the general conditions for the existence of jellyfish-like feasible domains and the classification of various structural topology optimization problems, are discussed. © 1998 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V.

33748491517	The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project shows inter- and intraplatform reproducibility of gene expression measurements	Over the last decade, the introduction of microarray technology has had a profound impact on gene expression research. The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a resource that represents an important first step toward establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in clinical and regulatory settings.

The proposed constitutive model is developed based on the so-called higher-order Cauchy-Born rule, which is an extension of its classic counterpart for crystal membranes. It is found that the strain energy obtained under finite deformation agrees well with that of atomistic calculations. Furthermore, the influence of the radial and inner displacement relaxations on the strain energy and the tangential elastic moduli are also explored for axially stretched and otherwise unconstrained SWCNTs.

Through the use of these sensitivities, a singular optimum can be obtained by employing the extrapolation technique at a relatively large value of ε, thus great computation efforts associated with the continuation approach for the solution of singular optimum can be saved.

80052275757	Fail-safe optimal design of truss structures based on robust optimization	Traditional fail-safe optimal design was always performed based on a prior assumed failure mode. However, the assumed failure mode may not necessarily be the most dangerous one, and if this is the case, then the reliability of the obtained optimal solution cannot be guaranteed. To circumvent this difficulty, in the present paper, fail-safe optimal design is carried out in a robust optimization framewok. The problem is formulated in a Bi-level form. The upper level program aims at finding the optimal design variables while the lower level program is solved to find the worst case failure mode. In order to find the global optimal solution of the lower level program, a mixed 0-1 programming is proposed and solved with the branch-and-bound algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for fail-safe design and optimization are illustrated by some numerical examples.

Study the special ability has attracted a lot of research attention recently. It will inspire us to develop wall-climbing robots, adhesive materials and bandages with superior properties and so on. For the biomimetic applications the reversible adhesion mechanism is an important topic. In the present study, a JKR-model under combined tensile/torsion loading is used to mimic the detachment process. Our analysis indicates that torque has a significant effect on the strength of adhesion (e.g. pull-off force, critical contact radius and detachment work). The results obtained shed some new light on the reversible adhesion mechanism in biological systems and may be helpful for the designing of biomimetic adhesive materials in microelectronics and robotics applications.

57849109859	Extreme structural response analysis of truss structures under material uncertainty via linear mixed 0-1 programming	This paper concerns the extreme structural response analysis of truss structures taking the possible uncertainties of Young's moduli of the bars into consideration. The uncertainty of Young's modulus is described by a non-probability but bounded interval model. With the use of this uncertain model, it is shown that the structural responses such as nodal displacement and bar stress will attain their extreme values when Young's moduli of the bars take either their upper or lower bound value. Based on this conclusion and simultaneous analysis and design formulation, a linear mixed 0-1 programming problem can be constructed to find the extreme values of the structural response by the well-established branch-and-bound approach with global optimality. The proposed approach is applied to several test problems for the demonstration of its validity. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The present investigation shows that the symmetric torsional properties existed in armchair and zigzag SWCNTs which are symmetric in structure. However, it is not the case for chiral SWCNTs which are non-symmetric in structure. Also, the shear modulus is investigated for a serial of different chiral SWCNTs in detail.

69549126120	Confidence structural robust design and optimization under stiffness and load uncertainties	Most of the structural behavior constraints involved in structural robust design and optimization are non-convex in nature. Therefore if local optimality criteria based optimization algorithms are employed to find the worst case structural responses that are used for examining the feasibility of a given design, it is highly possible that the optimization process will get stuck in a local optimum. If this is the case, the reliability of a "robust" design cannot be guaranteed, at least theoretically. The aim of the present paper is to develop some new formulations and the corresponding numerical algorithms to find the confidence optimal design under non-probabilistic stiffness and load uncertainties. To this end, two Bi-level program formulations for confidence robust design are proposed. In order to ensure the strict feasibility of the optimal solution, in the lower-level of program, the constraints are imposed on the confidence upper bounds of the structural responses, which can be obtained efficiently by solving some convex linear semi-definite programs (LSDPs). Based on the sensitivity analysis of the lower-level LSDP problem, the upper level programs are then solved by employing the classical gradient-based nonlinear optimization algorithms. Furthermore, for the case of stiffness uncertainty, a single-level nonlinear semi-definite programming (NSDP) formulation is also proposed and its mathematical properties are analyzed. Numerical examples show that confidence robust optimal design can be obtained via the proposed approaches effectively without resorting to too many computational efforts. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of adhesion is described by using a generalized JKR-model which can account for the non-slip condition in the contact regions. Analytical function theory is employed to find the solution of the resulting singular integral equations.

The computational results indicate that the Young's moduli and shear moduli of chiral SWCNTs increase with increasing tube radius and converge to the corresponding limit values of graphite sheet. The chirality-dependence of Young's moduli and shear moduli is not significant. The size-dependent strain energy per atom relative to a graphite sheet is insensitive to tube chirality, which is consistent with the existing atomistic calculations. The radial strain induced torsion is limited to chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes and is maximum for nanotube with chiral angle of π/12. Chirality and size dependence of the radial strain induced torsion is also analyzed in detail, respectively. Copyright copy; 2009 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

77049109409	A study on the bending stiffness of single-walled carbon nanotubes and related issues	Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are usually modeled as elastic tubes and their bending stiffness D is often related to their axial stretching modulus E (Young's modulus) as in mechanics of materials (i.e. D=EI where I is the moment of inertia of the tube). However, recent studies show that large discrepancies may exist when this relationship is used to predict Young's modulus of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through bending dominated deformations. In the present paper, the bending stiffness of SWCNTs and some related issues are investigated by the combined use of the molecular-mechanics (M-M) model and the deformation mapping technique. Based on the analysis results, the contradictions mentioned above can be explained well. Furthermore, an analytical expression for the bending stiffness of SWCNTs is also presented. It shows that the bending stiffness of a SWCNT is approximately proportional to the cube of its radius which agrees well with the existing molecular dynamics simulation and continuum theory based results. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Emphasis is placed on the coupling effect between tangential and normal directions which was often neglected in previous works. Our analysis shows that the coupling effect tends to reduce the contact area in the compressive regime. The effect of bending moment on the adhesion behavior is also examined. Like a pull-off force, there also exists a critical bending moment at which the cylinder can be bended apart from the substrate. However, unlike pull-off force, the critical bending moment is insensitive to the gradient exponent of the graded material. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79951673011	Repulsive force vs. source number: Competing mechanisms in the yield of twinned gold nanowires of finite length	Nanoscale twin boundaries play a significant role in the yield behavior of nanowires. They serve as both a source of dislocation nucleation and a generator of the repulsive force which acts against the nucleation of dislocations. In the present paper molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the tensile deformation of twinned gold nanowires (NWs) of finite length. Emphasis is placed on competing mechanisms in the initial yield of nanowires: dislocation source number vs. repulsive force, both of which are controlled by the twin boundary spacing. The simulation results reveal that with decreasing twin boundary spacing there is a transition from softening to strengthening due to a change in the dominant mechanism of plastic deformation. An analytical model based on kinetic rate theory is also established to provide an insight into the competing mechanisms indicated by the simulation results. © 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

79951724876	Confidence structural robust optimization by non-linear semidefinite programming-based single-level formulation	Structural robust optimization problems are often solved via the so-called Bi-level approach. This solution procedure often involves large computational efforts and sometimes its convergence properties are not so good because of the non-smooth nature of the Bi-level formulation. Another problem associated with the traditional Bi-level approach is that the confidence of the robustness of the obtained solutions cannot be fully assured at least theoretically. In the present paper, confidence single-level non-linear semidefinite programming (NLSDP) formulations for structural robust optimization problems under stiffness uncertainties are proposed. This is achieved by using some tools such as S-procedure and quadratic embedding for convex analysis. The resulted NLSDP problems are solved using the modified augmented Lagrange multiplier method which has sound mathematical properties. Numerical examples show that confidence robust optimal solutions can be obtained with the proposed approach effectively. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

At first, a second order smooth-extended technique is used to make the disjoint feasible domains connect, then the so-called ε-relaxed method is applied to eliminate the singular optima from problem formulation. By means of this approach, the singular optimum of the original problem caused by stress and local buckling constraints can be searched approximately by employing the algorithms developed for sizing optimization problems with high accuracy. Therefore, the numerical problem resulting from stress and local buckling constraints can be solved in an elegant way. The applications of the proposed approach and its effectiveness are illustrated with several numerical examples.

79959743444	Mechanics of non-slipping adhesive contact on a power-law graded elastic half-space	In previous work about axisymmetric adhesive contact on power-law graded elastic materials, the contact interface was often assumed to be frictionless, which is, however, not always the case in practical applications. In order to elucidate the effect of friction and the coupling between normal and tangential deformations, in the present paper, the problem of a rigid punch with a parabolic shape in non-slipping adhesive contact with a power-law graded half-space is studied analytically via singular integral equation method. A series of closed-form analytical solutions, which include the frictionless and homogeneous solutions as special cases, are obtained. Our results show that, compared with the frictionless case, the interfacial friction tends to reduce the contact area and the indentation depth during adhesion. The magnitude of the coupling effect depends on both the Poisson ratio and the gradient exponent of the half-space. This effect vanishes for homogeneous incompressible as well as for linearly graded materials but becomes significant for auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio. Furthermore, influence of mode mixity on the adhesive behavior of power-law graded materials, which was seldom touched in literature, is discussed in details. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

80052755691	Stress-related topology optimization via level set approach	Considering stress-related objective or constraint functions in structural topology optimization problems is very important from both theoretical and application perspectives. It has been known, however, that stress-related topology optimization problem is challenging since several difficulties must be overcome in order to solve it effectively. Traditionally, SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) method was often employed to tackle it. Although some remarkable achievements have been made with this computational framework, there are still some issues requiring further explorations. In the present work, stress-related topology optimization problems are investigated via a level set-based approach, which is a different topology optimization framework from SIMP. Numerical examples show that under appropriate problem formulations, level set approach is a promising tool for stress-related topology optimization problems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84859490133	Sequential linear programming algorithm based on the sand formula for truss optimization	In this paper, a SLP (Sequential linear Programming) algorithm based on SAND (Simultaneous Analysis and Design) formula is proposed. It is different from the traditional practice of a linear expansion of implicit response functions (e.g. displacement, stress etc.) at the designed variable (e.g. cross sectional area of bar members). Taking a truss structure as an example, using SAND formula, with both bar cross sectional areas and node displacements as the design variables, a linear approximation to the compatibility conditions using explicit bilinear function is made and an LP sub-problem is constructed. By solving a series of LP sub-problems, a best approximat solution for this optimization problem can be obtained. Comparing to the SLP algorithm under traditional optimization formula, this method has 2 advantages: The choice of the move limit of the designed variable is easier; the error involved in the linear approximation can be accurately estimated. Worked examples demonstrate that this algorithm is able to obtain the approximate optimized solution to the optimization problem in a fast yet stable manner.

84860742585	Bio-inspired material design and optimization	Natural materials such as bone, tooth, and nacre are nano-composites of proteins and minerals with superior stiffness and toughness. At the most elementary structure level, bio-composites exhibit a generic microstructure consisting of staggered mineral bricks wrapped by soft protein in nanoscale. Why does nature design building blocks of biological materials in this form? Can we reproduce this kind of structure from the structural optimization point of view? We believe that biological materials are designed with simultaneous optimization of stiffness and toughness for maximum structural support and flaw tolerance. With this philosophy, an optimization problem is formulated under the assumption of appropriate material constitutive models and failure criteria. It is shown that, within this optimization framework, the staggered microstructure of biological materials can be successfully reproduced at the nanometer length scale. This study may have at least partially provided an answer to the question whether the nanostructure of biological materials is an optimized structure and what is being optimized. The results suggest that we can draw lessons from the nature in designing nanoscale and hierarchically structured materials. © 2006 Springer.

84862821506	Numerical simulation for finite deformation of single-walled carbon nanotubes at finite temperature using temperature-related higher order Cauchy-Born rule based quasi-continuum model	In the present study, a meshless computational framework for simulating the large deformation behaviors of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at finite non-zero temperatures is established based on the so-called temperature-related higher order Cauchy-Born rule (THCB rule) where the second-order deformation gradient is involved in the kinematic description of the deformation of SWCNTs. The Helmholtz free energy is used as the thermodynamic potential and the local harmonic approximation (LHA) is adopted to construct the nanoscale quasi-continuum constitutive model. The proposed numerical approach is then applied to four numerical examples under different loading conditions. It is found that the results obtained by the proposed numerical framework agree well with those from molecular dynamics simulations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84862179590	Mode-mixity-dependent adhesion of power-law graded elastic solids under normal load and substrate stretch-induced mismatch strain	The present paper analytically investigates the adhesive behavior of power-law graded elastic solids under a combined action of external normal loading and a substrate stretch-induced mismatch strain with the effect of mode-mixity taken into account. A plane strain non-slipping model, a plane strain non-coupling model and an axisymmetric non-coupling model have been analyzed, respectively. Our results show that under a finite normal force, the equilibrium of the adhesive system may lost its stability at a critical value of mismatch strain, which significantly depends on both the graded material constants and the degree of mode-mixity. This indicates that the strongest or weakest adhesion strength under substrate stretching can be achieved by designing the physical constants of the adhesive system appropriately. These results provide a theoretical foundation for novel applications of functional graded materials in adhesion systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0038334122	Simultaneous shape and topology optimization of truss under local and global stability constraints	A new approach for the solution of truss shape and topology optimization problems under local and global stability constraints is proposed. By employing the cross sectional areas of each bar and some shape parameters as topology design variables, the difficulty arising from the jumping of buckling length phenomenon can be easily overcome without the necessity of introducing the overlapping bars into the initial ground structure. Therefore computational efforts can be saved for the solution of this kind of problem. By modifying the elements of the stiffness matrix using Sigmoid function, the continuity of the objective and constraint functions with respect to shape design parameters can be restored to some extent. Some numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84868706544	Robust structural topology optimization considering boundary uncertainties	In classical deterministic topology optimization, the effect of the possible boundary variations on the performance of the structure is not taken into account, which may lead to designs that are very sensitive to manufacturing errors. As a consequence, the performance of the real structure may be far from optimal and even not meet the design requirements. In the present paper, structural topology optimization considering the uncertainty of boundary variations is considered via level set approach. In order to make the optimal designs less sensitive to the possible boundary variations, we choose the compliance and fundamental frequency of structure enduring the worst case perturbation as the objective function for ensuring the robustness of the optimal solution. With use of the Schwarz inequality, the original Bi-level optimization problem is transformed to a single-level optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84874188990	Optimal topology design of continuum structures with stress concentration alleviation via level set method	Although the phenomenon of stress concentration is of paramount importance to engineers when they are designing load-carrying structures, stiffness is often used as the solely concerned objective or constraint functional in the studies of optimal topology design of continuum structures. Sometimes this will lead to optimal designs with severe stress concentrations that may be highly responsible for the fracture, creep, and fatigue of structures. The aim of the present work is to develop some effective numerical techniques for designing stiff structures with less stress concentrations. This is achieved by introducing some specific stress measures, which are sensitive to the existence of high local stresses, in the problem formulation and resolving the corresponding optimization problem numerically in a level set framework. Our study indicates that with use of the proposed numerical schemes, some intrinsic difficulties in stress-related topology optimization of continuum structures can be overcome in a natural way. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The temperature-related hyperelastic constitutive model for SLGSs is constructed with use of Helmholtz free energy as the thermodynamic potential to capture their thermo-mechanical coupling effect at finite temperature.

The so-called temperature-related higher order Cauchy-Born rule (THCB rule), as the kinematic assumption for curved crystalline membranes with one-atom thickness, is employed to link the change of SWCNTs with that of their corresponding equating continuums. The Helmholtz free energy as well as the local harmonic approximations is utilized to construct the underlying constitutive framework. Subsequently, based on the proposed quasi-continuum contact model, a meshless computational scheme for SWCNTs is established and several numerical examples under different loading conditions are performed.

It was found that due to the existence of junction heptagonal defects, shear bands induced by the external load may expand outward in the form of spiral and promote the formation of Stone-Wales transformation, which therefore constitutes an effective way to dissipate the energy. We also study the temperature effect on the mechanical properties of Y-CNTs. Our simulation results provide useful insights to the design and fabrication of Y-CNTs based nanostructures and devices. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84880717405	Mechanics of axisymmetric adhesive contact of rough surfaces involving power-law graded materials	In the present paper, the mechanics of axisymmetric adhesive contact of rough surfaces involving power-law graded materials is investigated analytically. A series of general analytical solutions have been obtained with use of the cumulative superposition and equivalent energy release rate approaches. These solutions provide closed-form expressions of equilibrium relations among applied load, indentation depth and contact radius. Based on these solutions, an effective macroscopic description of the contact evolution is obtained for a general punch profile with surface roughness. Our analysis results reveal that the simultaneous presence of surface roughness and graded material properties can influence the pull-off force and energy dissipation due to adhesion hysteresis significantly. Moreover, it is found that both the adhesion strength and toughness can be optimized by adjusting the surface topography and material parameters of power-law graded solids appropriately. The analytical results obtained in this paper include the corresponding solutions for homogeneous isotropic materials as special cases and therefore can also serve as the benchmarks for checking the validity of numerical solution results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These solutions provide analytical expressions of the surface stress, deformation fields, and equilibrium relations among the applied load, indentation depth, and contact radius. Based on these results, we then examine the combined effects of material inhomogeneities and punch surface morphologies on the adhesion behaviors of the considered contact system. The analytical results obtained in this paper include the corresponding solutions for homogeneous isotropic materials and the Gibson soil as special cases and, therefore, can also serve as the benchmarks for checking the validity of the numerical solution methods.

With the use of this description, the non-overlap constraints for embedding structural components can be dealt with in a convenient way. Numerical examples demonstrated that the comparison with the existing methods in the literature, the simultaneous optimization of the structural topology and components layout can be achieved via the present approach with much less computational effort.

The so-called higher order Cauchy-Born rule (HCB rule) is utilized as the linkage between the deformation of the spectrin network/cytoskeleton and that of the corresponding equivalent continuum. By incorporating the second order deformation gradients into kinematic description, the resulting QC model can capture the curvature effect of nanoscale membranes accurately in a geometrically consistent way. Based on the proposed QC model, a variationally consistent meshless computational scheme is developed for simulating the finite deformation of human erythrocyte/RBCs.

84888639716	Adhesive contact on power-law graded elastic solids: The JKR-DMT transition using a double-Hertz model	A cohesive zone model of axisymmetric adhesive contact between a rigid sphere and a power-law graded elastic half-space is established by extending the double-Hertz model of Greenwood and Johnson (1998). Closed-form solutions are obtained analytically for the surface stress, deformation fields and equilibrium relations among applied load, indentation depth, inner and outer radii of the cohesive zone, which include the corresponding solutions for homogeneous isotropic materials and the Gibson solid as special cases. These solutions provide a continuous transition between JKR and DMT type contact models through a generalized Tabor parameter μ. Our analysis reveals that the magnitude of the pull-off force ranges from (3 + κ)πRΔγ/2 to 2πRΔγ, where κ, R and Δγ denote the gradient exponent of the elastic modulus for the half-space, the radius of the sphere and the work of adhesion, respectively. Interestingly, the pull-off force for the Gibson solid is found to be identically equal to 2πRΔγ, independent of the corresponding Tabor parameter. The obtained analytical solutions are validated with finite element simulations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84900482476	Adhesion between elastic cylinders based on the double-Hertz model	A cohesive zone model for two-dimensional adhesive contact between elastic cylinders is developed by extending the double-Hertz model of Greenwood and Johnson (1998). In this model, the adhesive force within the cohesive zone is described by the difference between two Hertzian pressure distributions of different contact widths. Closed-form analytical solutions are obtained for the interfacial traction, deformation field and the equilibrium relation among applied load, contact half-width and the size of cohesive zone. Based on these results, a complete transition between the JKR and the Hertz type contact models is captured by defining a dimensionless transition parameter μ, which governs the range of applicability of different models. The proposed model and the corresponding analytical results can serve as an alternative cohesive zone solution to the two-dimensional adhesive cylindrical contact. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84900502787	Adhesive contact on randomly rough surfaces based on the double-hertz model	A cohesive zone model for rough surface adhesion is established by combining the double-Hertz model (Greenwood, J. A., and Johnson, K. L., 1998, "An Alternative to the Maugis Model of Adhesion Between Elastic Spheres," J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., 31, pp. 3279-3290) and the multiple asperity contact model (Greenwood, J. A., and Williamson, J. B. P., 1966, "Contact of Nominally Flat Surfaces," Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 295, pp. 300-319). The rough surface is modeled as an ensemble of noninteracting asperities with identical radius of curvature and Gaussian distributed heights. By applying the double- Hertz theory to each individual asperity of the rough surface, the total normal forces for the rough surface are derived for loading and unloading stages, respectively, and a prominent adhesion hysteresis associated with dissipation energy is revealed. A dimensionless Tabor parameter is also introduced to account for general material properties. Our analysis results show that both the total pull-off force and the energy dissipation due to adhesive hysteresis are influenced by the surface roughness only through a single adhesion parameter, which measures statistically a competition between compressive and adhesive forces exerted by asperities with different heights. It is also found that smoother surfaces with a small adhesion parameter result in higher energy dissipation and pull-off force, while rougher surfaces with a large adhesion parameter lead to lower energy dissipation and pull-off force.

To this end, a new computational framework for structural topology optimization based on the concept of moving morphable components is proposed. Compared with the traditional pixel or node point-based solution framework, the proposed solution paradigm can incorporate more geometry and mechanical information into topology optimization directly and therefore render the solution process more flexibility. It also has the great potential to reduce the computational burden associated with topology optimization substantially.

84903274887	Integrated size and topology optimization of skeletal structures with exact frequency constraints	The present paper studies the integrated size and topology optimization of skeletal structures under natural frequency constraints. It is found that, unlike the conventional compliance-oriented topology optimization problems, the considered problem may be strongly singular in the sense that the corresponding feasible domain may be disconnected and the global optimal solutions are often located at the tips of some separated low dimensional sub-domains when the cross-sectional areas of the structural components are used as design variables. As in the case of stress-constrained topology optimization, this unpleasant behavior may prevent the gradient-based numerical optimization algorithms from finding the true optimal topologies. To overcome the difficulties posed by the strongly singular optima, some particular forms of area/moment of inertia-density interpolation schemes, which can restore the connectedness of the feasible domain, are proposed. Based on the proposed optimization model, the probability of finding the strongly singular optimum with gradient-based algorithms can be increased. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0742319027	Mathematical programming method for numerical analysis of flexible net-membrane structures	This paper gives a detailed introduction to the development of a new method for numerical simulation of the wrinkled behavior of space flexible structures. The flexible net-structure is modeled as a network of bars with a special nonlinear constitutive relationship. Based on the parametric variational principle, a mathematical programming method is developed for the nonlinear analysis of the network of bars. For the analysis of the membrane structure, a new method is developed to simulate directly the mechanic behaviors of the structure. The method is based on the finite element method with membrane elements and is constructed in terms of the corresponding constitutive relationship, from which the nonlinear behavior of the structure can be truly simulated. Compared with the conventional methods, the new method can provide a good convergence property and hence can obtain accurate predictions of wrinkled regions/patterns and stress distributions of the membrane structures. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the method proposed.

11144239745	Epsilon-continuation approach for truss topology optimization	A so-called epsilon-continuation approach is proposed for the solution of singular optimum in truss topology optimization problems. This approach is an improved version of the epsilon-relaxed approach. In the proposed approach, we start the optimization process from a relaxation parameter with a relatively large value and obtain a solution by applying the epsilon-relaxed approach. Then we decrease the value of the relaxation parameter by a small amount and choose the optimal solution from the previous optimization process as the initial design for the next optimization. This continuation process is continued until a small termination value of the relaxation parameter is reached. Convergence analysis of the proposed approach is also presented. Numerical examples show that this approach can alleviate the dependence of the final solution on the initial choice of the design variable and enhance the probability of finding the singular optimum from rather arbitrary initial designs.
