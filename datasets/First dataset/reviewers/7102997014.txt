84937484908	Fifth normal form made easy with novel web-based CAI HCI	As Internet computing becomes a norm in everyday life, web-based learning is acceptable to many people. However, it is a challenge to build a satisfactory Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) on Internet. Not only it is difficult to guide the users through the operations of a CAI, but also it is hard to measure the effectiveness of the CAI. This paper presents a methodology of using a set of Human Computer Interface (HCI) rules to develop a CAI for database normalization. It applies a constructivist theory for the users to automate his/her own database design on the CAI. The result is a user friendly CAI for the users to learn and apply database normalization skill effectively. A case study of normalizing an data entry form up to fifth normal form is used for illustration.

8644229383	Concurrent data materialization for object-relational database with semantic metadata	For a company with many databases in different data models, it is necessary to consolidate them into one data model interchangeable and present data in one data model concurrently to users. The benefit is to let user stick to his/her own data model to access database in another data model. This paper presents a semantic metadata to preserve database constraints for data materialization to support user's view of database on an ad hoc base. The semantic metadata can store the captured semantics of a relational or an object-oriented database into classes and stored procedures triggered by events. The stored constraints and data can be materialized into a target database upon user request. The user is allowed to perform the data materialization many times alternatively. The process can provide a relational as well as an object oriented view to the users simultaneously. This concurrent data materialization function can be applied to data warehouse to consolidate heterogeneous database into a fact table in a data model of user's choice. Furthermore, a user can obtain either a relational view or an object-oriented view of the same dataset of an object-relational database interchangeably.

8644266776	Translating OODB method to RDB routine	A methodology is introduced for translating from methods in an object-oriented database to routines in a relational database. The approach consists of three steps. The first step is to translate method signature to Persistent Stored Modules signature. The second step is to translate method source language to (function/procedure) routine. The process includes Host Language, OSQL's Qualification, Query Translation, Update Transaction Translation, and Objects inside Object. The third step is to translate method invocation to routine invocation. According to this approach, object-oriented database methods can be translated to relational database routines that can be executed in the relational database environment assisted by a frame model and case statements listing all possible cases of binding conditions and actions. The significance of the finding is adding an open object-oriented interface on top of relational database system for database interoperability and in the development of an object-relational database management system.

16344368499	Translating relational schema into XML schema definition with data semantic preservation and XSD graph	Many legacy systems have been created by using relational database operating not for the Internet expression. Since the relational database is not an efficient way for data explosion, electronic transfer of data, and electronic business on the Web, we introduce a methodology in which a relational schema will be translated to an Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema definition for creating an XML database that is a simple and efficient format on the Web. We apply the Indirect Schema Translation Method that is a semantic-based methodology in this project. The mechanism is that the Relational Schema will be translated into the conceptual model, an Extended Entity Relationship (EER) Model using Reverse Engineering. Afterward, the EER model will be mapped to an XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) Graph as an XML conceptual schema using Semantic Transformation. Finally, the XSD Graph will be mapped into the XSD as an XML logical schema in the process of Forward Engineering, and the data semantics of participation, cardinality, generalization, aggregation, categorization, N-ary and U-ary relationship are preserved in the translated XML schema definition. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

22644449089	Architecture of a universal database: A frame model approach	RDB has been dominant in the industry for the last decade. OODB is recognized as a post-relational technology that can improve productivity. Hierarchical Database and Network Database were popular in the 1970s, and have been developed into legacy database systems. The DBMS of various data models have proliferated into many companies, and become their important assets. There is a need to integrate these database system into a data warehouse in the company. We investigate a solution to the problem by offering an architecture of a universal database for the connectivity of various DBMSs using different data models. A frame model is chosen to represent the conceptual and logical schema of the universal database, which structures an application domain into classes organized via generalization, aggregation and user-defined relationships, and its data in relational tables. The schemas of the existing database systems are translated into frame model conceptual schemas which are integrated into a global frame model in a knowledge representation that includes classes for object structure descriptions and constraints for supporting user-defined relationships. The universal database is implemented by a relational DBMS as a kernel. In addition to relational tables, the universal database consists of program area to emulate database navigation in nonrelational DBMS, method classes to implement program calls to emulate methods of OODBMS, and constraint classes to preserve semantic and resolve naming conflicts in schema translation and integration. To ensure each database program access the universal database, a database gateway for each source DBMS is developed to translate their DML into SQL, which is chosen to be its kernel database language, for its user-friendliness, standardization and popularity in the industry. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

0031375561	Data dictionary system approach for database schema translation	Database system reengineering technique has been used to resolve the problem of converting from existing out-of-data database systems to new technique database systems in order to reduce the new system implementation cost. The technique consists of three parts: schema translation, data conversion, and program translation. The schema translation requires the transferring of existing database schema into the new database schema with better semantics. Recapturing the semantics is a complicated and difficult work. During the database design phase, the semantics has been lost from the conceptual data model to the logical data model. It is difficult to recapture it. After recapturing the semantics from the original conceptual database schema, we need also to have a sophisticated knowledge base to store the knowledge. This paper describes a new schema translation system, which can recapture the missing/hidden semantics of a database. The kernel of the system is an Extended Entity Relationship (EER) Data Dictionary System (DDS), which can store all the semantics of the new database schema.

0032638454	Transforming RDB schema into well-structured OODB schema	When transforming relational database (RDB) schema into object-oriented database (OODB) schema, much effort was put on examining key and inclusion dependency (ID) constraints to identify class and establish inheritance and association between classes. However, in order to further remove the original data redundancy and update anomaly, multi-valued dependency (MVD) should also be examined. In this paper, we discuss class structures and define well-structured classes. Based on MVDs, a theorem is given transforming a relation schema into a well-structured class. To transform RDB schema into OODB schema, a composition process simplifying the input RDB schema and an algorithm transforming the simplified RDB schema into well-structured OODB classes are developed.

25444436671	An e-customer behavior model with online analytical mining for internet marketing planning	In the digital market, attracting sufficient online traffic in a business to customer Web site is vital to an online business's success. The changing patterns of Internet surfer access to e-commerce sites pose challenges for the Internet marketing teams of online companies. For e-business to grow, a system must be devised to provide customers' preferred traversal patterns from product awareness and exploration to purchase commitment. Such knowledge can be discovered by synthesizing a large volume of Web access data through information compression to produce a view of the frequent access patterns of e-customers. This paper develops constructs for measuring the online movement of e-customers, and uses a mental cognitive model to identify the four important dimensions of e-customer behavior, abstract their behavioral changes by developing a three-phase e-customer behavioral graph, and tests the instrument via a prototype that uses an online analytical mining (OLAM) methodology. The knowledge discovered is expected to foster the development of a marketing plan for B2C Web sites. A prototype with an empirical Web server log file is used to verify the feasibility of the methodology. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

2642561108	XTOPO: An XML-based topology for information highway on the internet	The need for interoperation and data exchange through the Internet makes XML a dominant standard language. Much work has been done on translating relational data into XML documents and vice versa. However, there is not an integrated method to combine them together as one technology for mass information transmission on the Internet. Furthermore, most XML-enabled database management systems can only translate a few relations into an XML document without data semantics constraints consideration, which is not sufficient for information highway on the Web. This paper presents a methodology, XTOPO, to transmit a relational database on the Internet using XML document as medium. XTOPO facilitates the translation from relational database to XML document and vice versa. XTOPO divides an XML document hierarchical structure into four different topologies - single sub-element (element, sub-element), multiple sub-elements (element, multiple sub-elements), group (element, group of sub-elements), and referral element (element, element - and captures their semantics into classification tables as a knowledge-based repository. The view of a sender company's information in a relational database is mapped into four topological XML documents according to their data semantics constraints. The intermediate XML documents are integrated into an XML document using DOM (Document Object Model). The XML document instances are loaded into a relational database with generated Object Identity as key. The receiver company translates the XML document back to relational database for processing. The result is a mechanism of mass information transmission on the Internet for an information highway.

26444585994	Student centered knowledge level analysis for eLearning for SQL	There are many different designs for eLearning on the Internet. The static webpage design can only provide fixed learning materials. The dynamic webpage design can change the page data depending on the students' input. The intelligent webpage design records students 'learning results for their knowledge level analysis and provides sequence and format to test the students for practicing and training accordingly. A student centered model enables the system to provide customized course contents and study guidance to individual student. The web-based application helps students of all levels with different educational background to achieve their learning goals effectively. This paper provides an eLearning system with intelligent dynamic web pages customized to each student's effective learning style in SQL (Structural Query Language) as a practical relational database language in the syllabus of an undergraduate Database Systems course. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

3042601568	Replicate relational and XML databases for internet computing	Most XML-Enabled database management systems can only translate a few relations into an XML document. Moreover, the translation is without data semantics constraints consideration, which may not be sufficient for information highway on the web. The demand on database is increased in e-commerce. Not only relational database (RDB) is needed for traditional data processing, but also its equivalent XML documents (database) are needed for B2B applications. Therefore, performance for online conversion from relational data to XML document is an issue. This paper aims to create a replicate XML database for a company's RDB to improve database performance, and to automate XML database recovery in case of system failures. For any successful update to the RDB, corresponding update will be applied to its replicate XML database. The result is an incrementally maintained XML database for efficient and effective computing for e-commerce. In summary, Internet computing performance can be improved because a replicate XML database and its counterpart RDB can be parallel processing for both internal data and external data transmission on the Internet. Furthermore, an XML database can be recovered by its counterpart RDB once it is down.

33646410410	Translating relational schema with constraints into XML schema	With XML adopted as the technology trend on the Internet, and with investment in the current relational database systems, companies must convert their relational data into XML documents for data transmission on the Internet. In the process, to preserve the users' relational data requirements of data constraints into the converted XML documents, we must define a meaningful root element for each XML document. The construction of an XML document is based on the root element and its relevant elements. The root element can be selected from a relational entity table in the existing relational database, which depends on the requirements to present the business behind. The relevant elements are mapped from the related entities, based on the navigability of the chosen entity. The derived root and relevant elements can form a Data Type Definition Graph (DTD-graph) of an XML conceptual schema diagram which can be mapped into a Data Type Definition (DTD) of an XML schema. The result is a translated XML schema with semantic constraints transferred from a relational conceptual schema of an Extended Entity Relationship (EER) model. The data conversion from relational data to the XML documents can be done after the schema, translation. The relational data, are loaded into XML documents according to the translated DTD. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

33744506306	Reverse engineering XML documents into DTD Graph with SAX	We propose a systematic approach to reverse engineer arbitrary XML documents to their conceptual schema, DTD Graphs. The necessity for doing so is due to the fact that XML documents are frequently used for storing structured data and their schemas, such as in Document Type Definition (DTD) format, are missing, especially for those existing historical XML documents. As such, it is difficult for software developers or end users to make use of them. Even the schemas exist, they are difficult to read and undetermined of the underlying relationships among the elements in the documents. In view of this, it is necessary to determine the data semantics from the XML documents. If the DTDs of the XML documents exist with the identifications of the ID/IDREF(S) type attributes, then more data semantics can be derived. Another application of the determined data semantics is to verify the linkages implemented by ID/IDREF(S). If the element is referring to an incorrect XML element type, an extra data semantic will be determined as a result, and such findings can be used for verification purposes. Furthermore, the approaches proposed in this paper use Simple API for XML (SAX) so that the algorithms are applicable to small to huge sized XML documents.

33745657868	Positioning-based query translation between SQL and XQL with location counter	The need for interoperation and data exchange through the Internet has made Extensible Markup Language (XML) a dominant standard language. Much work has already been done on translating relational data into XML documents and vice versa. However, there is not an integrated method to combine them together as a unifying technology for database interoperability on the Internet. Users may not be familiar with various query language syntax. We propose database gateways built on the top of a Relational Database (RDB) and an XML Database (XMLDB). Users can access both databases at the same time through the query language SQL or XQL (an XML query language) to access data stored in either RDB or XMLDB. The translation process adopts query graph translation between a RDB and an XMLDB. Thus, a stepwise procedure of query translation is devised and amenable to implementation. The procedure also provides an XML interface to a RDB as well as a relational interface to XMLDB. A location counter sequence number is used to position tuples in a RDB for subsequent transforming the tuples into the corresponding positioning element instances in the XML documents. As a result, both XMLDB and RDB can co-exist, and be accessible by the users. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

33845549524	Effective e-learning by use of HCI and web-based workflow approach	A web-based workflow system is proposed to help users study by e-learning anywhere and anytime. Basically, the Workflow based e-Learning System is a learning environment supported by workflow technology which provides a flexible learning solution. With the rapid development of Internet, distance-learning applications over Internet become more and more popular. The user interface of a system is often the yardstick by which the system is judged. An interface which is difficult to use will, at best, provide result with a high level of user errors. At worst, it will cause the software system to discard, irrespective of its functionality. If the information is presented in a confusing or misleading way, the user may misunderstand the meaning of an item of information. They may initiate a sequence of unexpected actions which even cause the system failure. In this respect, this paper focuses on the design principles and implementation of the Human-Computer Interface(HCI). We lay down the guideline for HCI design concept and principles, and evaluate the HCI design of a Workflow-based e-Learning application. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

35048854135	An Application-Oriented e-Learning System with Self-monitoring and Adaptive Exercises	eLearning has deficiencies. It is difficult to monitor students' learning progress and verify students' understanding of a topic. Self Monitoring System(SMS) and Adaptive Exercise System(AES) is a solution to the problem. With SMS, students can actively monitor their learning progress for better efficiency. With AES, professors can determine which levels of exercises the student should take for progressive learning. This paper presents a methodology of using sequencing instructions of fixed format case study and free format empirical study for self learning process. The fixed format provides a predefined input and fixed model answer output for students to obtain general concept of the topic. The free format provides a chance for the students to apply their learned knowledge a real life situation. We focus on teaching students how to apply their learnt knowledge in a real life application such as data modeling techniques by eLearning. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

35248852025	eSignature verification on web using statistical mining approach	This research is related to the field of biometrics. The biometrics research consists of fingerprint scans, retina scans, voiceprint analyses, and so on [1]. Although an electronic signature (eSignature) does not actually come from human, it comes from an indirect tissue (i.e. handwriting) of a human. For instance, a handwritten signature will be collected from a cardholder when filling out the application form of credit card and formularized from a normal signature to an electronic signature. This eSignature will then be transmitted and stored into XML document in a data center. We will extract the eSignature that is a group of numbers from the database. This group of numbers is a factor in preceding the Online Analytical Mining (OLAM) [2]. We use the Internet as a network channel. We will also use the XML-RPC [6] to implement the active rules and apply OLAM to verify incoming eSignatures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

0033164748	Schema Integration Methodology and its verification by use of Information Capacity	In the past decade a considerable amount of research has been done on schema integration and translation. Until recently, most of the work has largely neglected the proof of correctness in transforming schemas. Invalid transformations can produce incomplete or inconsistent pictures that may cause damage to organizations. In this paper, we present a Schema Integration Methodology, with proof of correctness, based on the use of Information Capacity. We present our methodology as a set of steps for schema translation tasks, verify their correctness according to operational goals and derive the information capacity of the original schema in its pre-transformed and post-transformed conditions. If the information capacity of the original schema is equivalent to or dominated by the transformed schema, then information is preserved after integration. Our correctness criterion is based on the assumption that these goal(s) could be practically pursued in an operational sense and are not solely mathematical proofs.

0033906370	Translating update operations from relational to object-oriented databases	In migrating a legacy relational database system to the object-oriented (OO) platform, when database migration completes, application modules are to be migrated, where embedded relational database operations are mapped into their OO correspondents. In this paper we study mapping relational update operations to their OO equivalents, which include UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE operations. Relational update operation translation from relational to OO faces the touchy problem of transformation from a value-based relationship model to a reference-based model and maintaining the relational integrity constraints. Moreover, with a relational database where inheritance is expressed as attribute value subset relationship, changing of some attribute values may lead to the change of the position of an object in the class inheritance hierarchy, which we call object migration. Considering all these aspects, algorithms are given mapping relational UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE operations to their OO correspondents. Our work emphasize in examining the differences in the representation of the source schema's semantics resulting from the translation process, as well as differences in the inherent semantics of the two models.

38649098806	The XML Tree Model - toward an XML conceptual schema reversed from XML Schema Definition	XML Schema Definition (XSD) is the logical schemas of an XML model, but there is no standard format for the conceptual schema of an XML model. Therefore, we propose an XML Tree Model (XTM) as an XML conceptual schema for representing data semantics in a diagram, and also as an XML data model validator for confirming the data semantics required by users. An XTM consists of hierarchical nodes representing all the elements, and the data relationships among elements within the XSD. A rule-based algorithm and an information capacity with pre- and post-conditions are developed as the methodology for reverse engineering. The proposed algorithm consists of two rules: General Information Transformation and Data Semantic Recovering to construct an XTM. Users can draw an XTM with data relationships among elements as a result of the reverse engineering. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

41549130755	Web-based logging of classroom teaching activities for blended learning	Nowadays, eLearning has been adapted in all educational institutes, starting from kindergartens, primary schools, high schools, to the universities. Teachers are encouraged to use computer and Internet as a teaching medium in addition to the classroom teaching. The result is a blended learning which combines eLearning as a supplementary learning means to classroom learning. The issue becomes what is the best approach for blended learning for the effective and productive teaching methods. This paper suggests to record (log) all teaching activities into a web site for students to self study after classroom learning. The objective is to provide students more flexibility in learning with more facilities of eLearning, classroom learning and/or blended learning.

58049096654	Facilitating education in prisons	Education can effectively reduce prisoners in reoffending, equip them the necessary skills and knowledge to earn their livings. As educational backgrounds of the prisoners vary a lot even they are roughly of the same ages, traditional classroom teaching is not appropriate. On the other hand, distance learning provides students higher flexibility and more choices in organizing the learning paths. Students taking courses in distance learning approach need to read study units and reference materials, such as textbooks and reference books and papers. For usual students, the resources can either accessed via the Internet or at the library in person. However, for prisoners, due to highly restrictive measures in material exchange into and out of the prisons, they are not allowed to access the Internet directly and all materials dispatched must be verified. This paper discusses requirements of prison educations and a framework for facilitating prisoners in taking distance learning. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

4644271906	A frame model approach for expert and database system integration	Expert systems (ES) and database systems (DBS) are major components of information systems and important assets to companies. The development of these systems represent users' knowledge in the application systems. As computer technologies evolve, and as users requirements change, there is a need to upgrade these system to meet the new application requirements. To preserve the knowledge of the existing information systems, a methodology for integrating ES and DBS into an expert database system (EDS) is proposed. The integrated EDS is a knowledge based system (KBS) which derives and stores knowledge in a frame model consisting of a class header, attributes, methods and constraints. It extracts the ES rules and DBS data for an application into coupling classes at run time only. The attributes of the coupling classes are matched with synonyms in a synonym table which resolves their naming and semantic conflicts with user assistance in knowledge acquisition. The resultant EDS is a KBS ready for application development.

This article proposes a systematic approach to reverse engineer arbitrary XML documents to their conceptual schema, extended DTD graphs, which are DTD graphs with data semantics. The proposed approach not only determines the structure of the XML document, but also derives candidate data semantics from the XML element instances by treating each XML element instance as a record in a table of a relational database. One application of the determined data semantics is to verify the linkages among elements. Implicit and explicit referential linkages are among XML elements modeled by the parent-children structure and ID/IDREF(S), respectively. As a result, an arbitrary XML document can be reverse engineered into its conceptual schema in an extended DTD graph format. Copyright © 2008, IGI Global.

52749093996	A relational-XML data warehouse for data aggregation with SQL and XQuery	Integrating information from multiple data sources is becoming increasingly important for enterprises that partner with other companies for e-commerce. However, companies have their internal business applications deployed on diverse platforms and no standard solution for integrating information from these sources exists. To support business intelligence query activities, it is useful to build a data warehouse on top of middleware that aggregates the data obtained from various heterogeneous database systems. Online analytical processing (OLAP) can then be used to provide fast access to materialized views from the data warehouse. Since extensible markup language (XML) documents are a common data representation standard on the Internet and relational tables are commonly used for production data, OLAP must handle both relational and XML data. SQL and XQuery can be used to process the materialized relational and XML data cubes created from the aggregated data. This paper shows how to handle the two kinds of data cubes from a relational-XML data warehouse using extract, transformation and loading. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

67650442725	Visualization of XML conceptual schema recovered from XML schema definition	XML Schema Definition (XSD) is in the logical level of XML model and is used in most web applications. At present, there is no standard format for the conceptual level of XML model. Therefore, we introduce an XML Tree Model as an XML conceptual schema for representing and confirming the data semantics according to the user requirements in a diagram. The XML Tree Model consists of nodes representing all elements within the XSD. We apply reverse engineering from an XSD to an XML Tree Model to assist end users in applying an XML database for information highway on the Internet. The data semantics recovered for visualization include root element, weak elements, participation, cardinality, aggregation, generalization, categorization, and n-ary association, and which can be derived by analyzing the structural constraints of XSD based on its key features such as key, keyref, minOccurs, maxOccurs, Choice, Sequence and extension.

67650503218	Methodology for data conversion from xml documents to relations using extensible stylesheet language transformation	Extensible Markup Language (XML) has been used for data-transport and data-transformation while the business sector continues to store critical business data in relational databases. Extracting relational data and formatting it into XML documents, and then converting XML documents back to relational structures, becomes a major daily activity. It is important to have an efficient methodology to handle this conversion between XML documents and relational data. This paper aims to perform data conversion from XML documents into relational databases. It proposes a prototype and algorithms for this conversion process. The pre-process is schema translation using an XML schema definition. The proposed approach is based on the needs of an Order Information System to suggest a methodology to gain the benefits provided by XML technology and relational database management systems. The methodology is a stepwise procedure using XML schema definition and Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) to ensure that the data constraints are not scarified after data conversion. The implementation of the data conversion is performed by decomposing the XML document of a hierarchical tree model into normalized relations interrelated with their artifact primary keys and foreign keys. The transformation process is performed by XSLT. This paper will also demonstrate the entire conversion process through a detailed case study. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.

77952078484	Long distance learning for under-developing countries using replicated XML database system	Education can improve the quality and production of the people in a country in a long run, which is especially important in under developed countries. Besides, there illiteracy rates in remote districts in People Republic of China are still high. Deficient transportation and communication are common in these areas, and it is therefore necessary to resolve these two critical issues. As education involves exchanging large amount of teaching materials, such as course materials, assignments, questions and answers, between educators and learners, XML is a preferable document format for these materials and XML database is therefore a preferable storage and retrieval facility. For remote districts, it is preferable to have regional offices that handle the teaching materials, and each regional office should be equipped with an XML database and the entire education framework is supported by XML databases installed in the university, the regional offices and student machines, and the document exchanges are to be implemented by replication. This paper addresses the issues related to supporting long distance learning by resolving the communication and transportation problem with a loosely connected XML database system with replication. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77952087312	A peer-to-peer eLearning supporting system for computer programming debugging system	While students are studying computer programming, they have to handle programming style questions or assignments frequently. They are mostly facing similar programming difficulties. Some of them can resolve the problems but some cannot. As such, it can be treated as a peer-to-peer learning opportunity for all students to share their experiences and knowledge. As sharing and teaching is a good process in the entire learning life-cycle, that is, learn to teach and teach to learn, such sharing and assistance should be encouraged with credits based on the recommendations of the students who are assisted. An open forum can facilitate knowledge sharing, but there are no features for maintaining the trace of peer-to-peer assistance. Therefore, this project aims to facilitate the peer-to-peer activities with an award system. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77955304165	Extracting a largest redundancy-free XML storage structure from an acyclic hypergraph in polynomial time	Given a hypergraph and a set of embedded functional dependencies, we investigate the problem of determining the conditions under which we can efficiently generate redundancy-free XML storage structures with as few scheme trees as possible. Redundancy-free XML structures guarantee both economy in storage space and the absence of update anomalies, and having the least number of scheme trees requires the fewest number of joins to navigate among the data elements. We know that the general problem is intractable. The problem may still be intractable even when the hypergraph is acyclic and each hyperedge is in BoyceCodd normal form (BCNF). As we show here, however, given an acyclic hypergraph with each hyperedge in BCNF, a polynomial-time algorithm exists that generates a largest possible redundancy-free XML storage structure. Successively generating largest possible scheme trees from among hyperedges not already included in generated scheme trees constitutes a reasonable heuristic for finding the fewest possible scheme trees. For many practical cases, this heuristic finds the set of redundancy-free XML storage structures with the fewest number of scheme trees. In addition to a correctness proof and a complexity analysis showing that the algorithm is polynomial, we also give experimental results over randomly generated but appropriately constrained hypergraphs showing empirically that the algorithm is indeed polynomial. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77958463652	Concurrent data materialization for XML-enabled database with semantic metadata	For a company with many databases in different data models, it is necessary to consolidate them into one interchangeable data model and present data in more than one data model concurrently to different users or individual users who need to access the data in more than one data model. The benefit is to let the user stick to his/her own data model to access database in another data model. This paper presents a semantic metadata to preserve database constraints for data materialization to support the user's view of database on an ad hoc basis. The semantic metadata can store the captured semantics of a relational or an XML-enabled database into classes. The stored constraints and data can be materialized into a target database upon user request. The user is allowed to perform data materialization many times alternatively. The process can provide a relational as well as an XML view to the users simultaneously. This concurrent data materialization function can be applied into data warehouse to consolidate heterogeneous database into a fact table in a data model of user's choice. Furthermore, a user can obtain either a relational view or an XML view of the same dataset of an XML-enabled database interchangeably. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

80051566972	YouLearn portal: Hybrid learning with archived lectures and tutorials	YouTube portal is a popular video-sharing tool for entertainment. On similar ideas, we propose a YouLearn portal to support university students' learning. Very often, owing to heavy study load and tight study schedule, it is difficult for many students to 'digest' the lecture materials. Borrowing the ideas of YouTube portal, these lectures and tutorials can be recorded, archived and posted onto the Internet so that students can watch back the video archive of lectures and tutorials. This paper shows a solution called YouLearn portal by synchronizing video, audio and image, three-in-one files, used in the lectures and tutorials, and deploying them through web podcasting. The portal also facilitates hybrid learning by encouraging the students to learn from each other through open forum chat room activities. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80051575729	Data modeling technique made easy with hybrid learning computer aided instruction	Although hybrid learning has been adopted in higher education for a decade, it is still a challenge to build a satisfactory Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) on Internet. Not only it is difficult to guide users through the operations of CAI, but also it is hard to measure the learning effectiveness. This paper presents an effective method of using a set of CAI steps to demonstrate hybrid learning on data modeling technique. A constructivist theory is applied for users to go through the CAI steps. The result is a CAI for teaching and learning data modeling techniques. A case study of designing a hospital patient system is used for illustration. Its merit is the effective application of interactivity in teaching and learning data modeling techniques in designing an extended entity relationship model. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

82755171870	Facebook - Education with social networking websites for teaching and learning	This paper is a study of using social networking websites, in particularly Facebook, for conducting courses as a replacement of expensive traditional electronic learning platforms. At the early stage of the Internet community, Internet users used electronic mail as the main communication mean. Although email is still the core way of communication in a convenient but offline mode, other facilities were introduced, such as many Instant Messaging (IM) software applications like I-Seek-You (ICQ) and MSN, which enable people to communicate in a real-time mode. However, the communication between people was further enhanced to the next stage, when Facebook came to existence as a social networking website that supports many features. People do not only communicate with others, but also organize all kinds of interactions among them. Facebook provides rich features for organizing relationships. The framework of Facebook actually provides free of charge software that were provided by traditional electronic learning. This paper studies how people use Facebook for teaching and learning, together with recommendations provided. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

84857614219	An interpreter approach for exporting relational data into XML documents with structured export markup language	Almost all enterprises use relational databases to handle real time business operations and most need to generate various XML documents for data exchanges internally among various departments and externally with business partners. Exporting data in a relational database to an XML document can be considered a data conversion process. Based on the four approaches for data conversion: Customized program, Interpretive transformer, Translator generator, and Logical level translation, this paper proposes a new interpretive approach using Structured Export Markup Language (SEML) interpreter for converting relational data into XML documents. The frameworks and languages proposed by other researchers are neither generic nor able to generate arbitrary XML documents. Therefore, SEML interpreter is a simple, user friendly, and complete solution with a new mark-up language ̄ SEML ̄ for data conversion. The solution can be used as a generic tool for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) purposes. In other words, the SEML interpreter is a solution for relational databases similar to what X-Query is for XML databases. © 2012, IGI Global.

84864554115	Evaluating e-learning by using Kirkpatrick's Four Levels Model	This study examines the effectiveness of e-learning in Hong Kong. Kirkpatrick's Four Levels Model is the most widely used model for measurement of effectiveness for training program. Initial methodology has been proposed to measure the effectiveness of e-learning program. We implemented Kirkpatrick's model to measure the effectiveness of e-learning. Experimental results have shown that students are satisfied with e-learning programs. The e-learning programs are more effective in courses at the fundamental level. Students' academic results are significantly improved in these courses. However, the current e-learning programs fail to achieve some overall objectives of the schools. This study provides baseline data for schools in Hong Kong to set their strategic direction of e-learning.

84865030851	PTA system: Mobile computing student assessment by parent and teacher association	Smart phone has become more and more common in our life. This paper aims at bringing parents and teachers friendly, instantly and directly to communicate with each other anywhere, anytime. It studies how smart phone application can support real-time communication between parents and teachers. We propose that parents can obtain updated and reliable information such as circular and homework. It helps them to support their children at home easily. Moreover, the PTA (Parent and Teacher Association) system helps school administrator to manage circular. It can publish circular directly and summarize parents' reply easily. Very often, parents are not aware of the performance of their sons and daughters at school until it is too late, and they complain about the teachers' teaching method. The PTA system shows that parents and teachers can work together to monitor students' progresses in school work based on their assessment results. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

0037081090	Translating object-oriented database transactions into relational transactions	In this paper, we present methods of translating transactions from object-oriented database (OODB) to relational database (RDB). The process involves schema mapping in data definition language and transaction translation in data manipulation language. They include scheme definition, data query and transaction operation of insert, update, and deletion. We also discuss the object-oriented features in OODB operations that are not supported by RDB, such as class hierarchy, class composition hierarchy, and set attribute, and provide a general solution to realize those mechanisms by traditional relation operations. The result of the transaction translation can be applied into adding object-oriented interface into relational database management system and to the interoperability between OODB and RDB. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037338989	Continuous and incremental data mining association rules using frame metadata model	Most organizations have large databases that contain a wealth of potentially accessible information. The unlimited growth of data will inevitably lead to a situation in which it is increasingly difficult to access the desired information. There is a need to extract knowledge from data by knowledge discovery in database (KDD). Data mining is the discovery stage of KDD whereas association rule is a possible product. It states a statistical correlation between the occurrence of certain attributes in a database table. Such correlation is continuously changing subject to the new updates in the source database. Data mining association rules are often done by computing the association rules for the whole source database. In this paper, we introduce a frame metadata model to facilitate the continuous association rules generation in data mining. A new set of association rules can be derived with the update of the source databases by the data operation function in the frame metadata model. The frame metadata model consists of two types of classes: static classes and active classes. The active classes are event driven, obtaining data from the database when invoked by a certain event. The static classes describe data of the association rule table. Whenever an update occurs in the existing base relations, a corresponding update will be invoked by an event attribute in the method class which will compute the association rules continuously. The result is an active data mining capable of deriving association rules of a source database continuously or incrementally using frame metadata model. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037446820	Converting relational database into XML documents with DOM	The revolution of XML is recognized as the trend of technology on the Internet to researchers as well as practitioners. Companies need to adopt XML technology. With investment in the current relational database systems, they want to develop new XML documents while running existing relational databases on production. They need to reengineer the relational databases into XML documents with constraints preservation. In the process, schema translation must be done before data conversion. Since the existing relational databases are usually normalized, they have to be reconstructed into XML document tree structures. This can be accomplished through denormalization by joining the normalized relations into tables according to their data dependencies constraints. The joined tables are mapped into DOMs, which are then integrated into XML document trees. The user specifies an XML document root with its relevant nodes to form a partitioned XML document tree to meet their requirements. The selected XML document tree is mapped into an XML schema in the form of DTD. We then load joined tables into DOMs, integrate them into a DOM, and transform it into an XML document. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

0041817755	Universal data warehousing based on a meta-data modeling approach	Data warehouse contains vast amount of data to support complex queries of various Decision Support Systems (DSSs). It needs to store materialized views of data, which must be available consistently and instantaneously. Using a frame metadata model, this paper presents an architecture of a universal data warehousing with different data models. The frame metadata model represents the metadata of a data warehouse, which structures an application domain into classes, and integrates schemas of heterogeneous databases by capturing their semantics. A star schema is derived from user requirements based on the integrated schema, catalogued in the metadata, which stores the schema of relational database (RDB) and object-oriented database (OODB). Data materialization between RDB and OODB is achieved by unloading source database into sequential file and reloading into target database, through which an object relational view can be defined so as to allow the users to obtain the same warehouse view in different data models simultaneously. We describe our procedures of building the relational view of star schema by multidimensional SQL query, and the object oriented view of the data warehouse by Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) through method call, derived from the integrated schema. To validate our work, an application prototype system has been developed in a product sales data warehousing domain based on this approach.

84898500941	A hybrid learning model using an XML-based multimedia podcasting system	Due to heavy workload and tight working schedule, it is difficult for part-time students at City University of Hong Kong to 'digest' course materials and to understand the content of the course. Therefore, it will be convenient if a lecture presentation with course materials is recorded and posted into the Internet. Then, students can easily attend the lecture on-line in anywhere or watch back the video archive of the presentation through the Web. This chapter aims to provide a solution to achieve a hybrid learning model (HLM) including e-learning and traditional teaching platform by synchronizing video, audio and image files which are used in a presentation. In addition, this is targeted to record and to retrieve by using an on-line podcasting system and an XML SMIL technology respectively. © 2010, IGI Global.

84905836703	An editable multi-media authoring eBook system for mobile learning	Traditional eBook is to put the content of a book from hardcopy paper format into electronic mobile device format. Nevertheless, with evolution of mobile computing, information can be spread in seconds by mobile phones in multi-media format. Therefore, a student may need to put his/her learning material in an eBook which can be accessed by mobile device so that the student can study at any time and at anywhere using the mobile device. An authoring eBook allows students selects his/her own lecture slides from teacher's power point files, relevant discussion from open forum, cognitive map from course concept map, and video recording from lectures etc. This paper presents a methodology that can let students tailor make his/her own learning material from different multi-media source, and which can be edited as students' learning level improves. The stepwise development procedure includes preprocess of converting discussion panel and mind maps into images, uploading document, video, audio and images into PDF files, concatenate PDF files into an eBook PDF file, and modify the eBook PDF files if needed. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.
