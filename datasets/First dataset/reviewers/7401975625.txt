14744280820	Expression of genes of the somatotropic axis in the chicken: Developmental changes and impact of nutrition	Growth is determined by genotype as well as by environmental factors including nutrition. The neuroendocrine system involved in the regulation of growth acts as an interface to integrate both internal and external inputs. Among all neuroendocrine factors involved the hypothalamo-pituitary somatotropic axis has been received greatest attention. In order to better understand the role of growth hormone (GH) on poultry (and avian) growth and development, we studied broiler-type and laying-type chickens and compared expression levels of various genes during embryonic and post-hatch development. We found significant differences in the level of gene transcription between layer and broiler chickens. In the fast-growing broiler chickens there were higher levels of hepatic GH receptor (GHR) mRNA but there was a lower steady-state GH mRNA level in the pituitary. The observed differences are contributed by both genetic and nutritional factors, since the birds were raised under their own standard diets with different nutritional levels. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of nutrition on the patterns of gene expression of GH and GHR in broiler and layer chickens.

16544379707	Developmental patterns of serum leptin levels, leptin gene expression in adipose tissue and Ob-Rb gene expression in hypothalamus of Erhualian and Large White pigs	The present study was aimed to investigate the developmental patterns of leptin mRNA expression in dorsal subcutaneous adipose tissue and Ob-Rb mRNA expression in hypothalamus in pigs of different breeds and sexes. Erhualian gilts and boars and Large White boars were sampled at birth, 3, 20, 30, 45, 90, 120 and 180 days of age, respectively. Serum concentration of leptin was measured with RIA and single tube semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to determine the relative abundances of mRNA expression using 18S rRNA as an internal standard. The results showed that leptin mRNA expression in adipose tissue increased with age and displayed both sex and breed differences. In Erhualian pigs, females expressed higher leptin mRNA compared with males, and Erhualian boars showed higher abundance of leptin mRNA than Large White boars (P < 0.01). Serum leptin levels were in good agreement with adipose leptin mRNA, displaying similar sex and line differences. In contrast, expression of Ob-Rb mRNA in hypothalamus exhibited a distinctive pattern, decreased gradually after birth, and then increased till weaning. After weaning, Ob-Rb gene expression decreased gradually with age but rose gradually again from 120 to 180 days of age in Erhualian pigs. The expression of Ob-Rb mRNA was higher in Large White pigs than that in Erhualian pigs (P < 0.01). The results suggest that the serum leptin level and leptin gene expression in adipose tissue highly correlate with adiposity. Copyright by Science in China Press 2004.

18044378230	Analysis of gene expression information in the fat and muscle tissues of pig	An in silico study was developed to detect the gene expression profile of pig fat and muscle tissues by using the porcine EST resources and human gene sequences, and thus provided candidate information for basic genetic analysis in meat quality improvement of pig. In this study, a BLAST search was performed to identify homologies between the cDNA sequences of human genes and the ESTs sequences of pig, and the high homologous records were screened out. Four Java programs were developed to retrieve and collect sequences, and analyze the BLAST alignment results. By statistical analysis, it was found that there were at least 2 002 genes expressed in the fat and muscle tissues of pig, and 1 087 in the fat tissue, 1 205 in the muscle respectively (290 genes co-expressed in the two tissues). The top-ranking records were screened out, and meantime, 114 basic active genes (BAGs) were found to express in the two tissues, 80 in the fat tissue and 34 in the muscle tissue respectively. The top 10 records were described in the paper. This study was summarized in relation to current meat quality improvement of pig at molecular level.

18844392563	Effects of microsatellite DNA markers on meat quality traits in pig chromosome 13	In this reseanch, 7 microsatellite DNA loci linked with PPAR gene were selected from the published genetic map of chromosome 13 in pig, and polymorphisms of these microsatellites in 100 samples from Sutai pigs (Duroc × Erhualian) populations were detected. Results revealed that the number of alleles were 6 - 9, heterozygosity 0.59 - 0.81, polymorphism information content 0.51 - 0.76. Effects of S0021, SW937, SW482, S0222, S0293, S0281 and SWR2054 on meat quality traits were analyzed with PROC GLM of SAS. Results showed that the effects of 30021 on pH value and SW937 on water-holding capacity reached a significant level at P < 0.01 respectively. The effect of S0293 on tenderness and SW482 on BFT were also significant (P < 0.05). S0222, S0281 and SWR2054 had no significant effect on the 7 selected meat qualitytraits (P > 0.05).

2442607816	The developmental changes of GHR and IGF-1R gene expressions in porcine hypothalamus and pituitary	GH and IGF-1 may serve as negative feedback factors to regulate GH secretion from pituitary by binding to their respective receptors in hypothalamus and/or pituitary. In order to evaluate the line-specific developmental patterns of negative feedback regulation of GH secretion, Erhualian (EHL) and Large White (LW) pigs with significant difference in growth rate were employed in present study to investigate the developmental changes of GH receptor (GHR) mRNA and type-1 IGF receptor (IGF-1R) mRNA in hypothalamus and pituitary from birth till 180 days of age by relative quantitative RT-PCR. Pigs were sampled at birth, 3,20,30,90,120 and 180 days of age respectively. Hypothalamic GHR mRNA was expressed according to an age-dependent manner, being low at birth, then increased steadily till day 120, followed by a decrease (P < 0.05) at the age of 180 days, suggesting that the sensitivity of hypothalamus to the GH negative feedback influence increase steadily during fast-growing period. LW boars expressed higher level of GHR mRNA than EHL boars (P < 0.05) in hypothalamus. In pituitary, however, the GHR mRNA level was not significantly correlated with the breeds and age. The results suggested that GH might act mainly at the level of hypothalamus to regulate GH secretion. In contrast, the expression of IGF-1R mRNA exhibited line-specific developmental patterns in pituitary but not in hypothalamus. Hypothalamic expression of IGF-1R mRNA was abundant but did not show significant differences between ages, groups or lines. In pituitary, however, the IGF-1R mRNA expression was found to be high at birth both in EHL and LW pigs, subsequently declined till day 20, then followed by a slow rise reaching the second peak at the age of 90 days. At the age of 180 days, the pituitary IGF-1R mRNA level was higher in EHL pigs than that in LW pigs (P < 0.05), but the opposite was true at the age of 30 and 90 days. These results suggest that the site for receiving the feedback signal of IGF-1 is more likely in pituitary rather than in hypothalamus in the pig.

33750373750	Effects of methionine and betaine supplementation on growth performance, carcase composition and metabolism of lipids in male broilers	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of methionine and betaine supplementation on growth performance, carcase composition and lipid metabolism in growing broilers. A total of 450 commercial broilers, 22 d of age, were randomly allocated to three groups, each of which included three replicates (50 birds per replicate). The groups received the same methionine-deficient diet supplemented with 0 or 1 g/kg methionine, or 0.5 g/kg betaine, respectively. Methionine and betaine supplementation significantly improved weight gain and feed conversion. Supplemental methionine and betaine also significantly increased breast muscle yield and decreased abdominal fat content. Meanwhile, addition of methionine and betaine significantly increased the contents of creatine and free carnitine in liver, the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase in abdominal fat and the concentration of free fatty acid in serum, whereas uric acid concentration in serum was significantly decreased. The results of this study suggest that betaine can spare methionine in its function as an essential amino acid and is as effective as methionine in improving performance and carcase quality of growing broilers if the diet is moderately deficient in methionine. The decrease in abdominal fat may be due to the increased carnitine synthesis in liver and hormone-sensitive lipase activity in abdominal fat. © 2006 British Poultry Science Ltd.

33751240833	Effects of different selenium source on selenium distribution, loin quality and antioxidant status in finishing pigs	The experiment was conducted to study the effects of different selenium source on selenium distribution, loin quality and antioxidant status in finishing pigs. A total of 108 castrates (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire) at average body weight (BW) of 60 kg were allotted to three treatments, each of which was replicated three times with 12 pigs per replicate (four per pen). The control groups received the basal diet containing 0.045 mg Se/kg. A 0.3 mg Se/kg in forms of sodium selenite or selenomethionine was added to the basal diet for the experimental groups. The total test period was 40 d. Results showed that selenomethionine-treatment increased the Hunter a (redness) value of meat color during 45 min, 8 and 16 h measurement period (P<0.05) and decreased the drip loss of loin muscle during 8 and 16 h measurement period (P<0.05), while sodium selenite-treatment only elevated the Hunter a value of meat color during 0.75 h measurement period (P<0.05) and had no significant effects on drip loss of loin muscle tissues. Both selenomethionine and sodium selenite-treatment increased the Se content in serum, muscle, liver, pancreas and kidney tissue (P<0.05), the level was substantially higher in muscle, liver and pancreas (P<0.05) in the selenomethionine treated group. In addition, both selenomethionine and sodium selenite-treatment increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity (P<0.05) and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the liver and muscle (P<0.05) when compared with control group, but the level of magnitude was higher when selenomethionine was fed. The present study suggests that compared with sodium selenite, selenomethionine is more effective in depositing Se in tissues, enhances the antioxidant status, thus decreasing the volume of drip loss and stabilizing the meat color. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33846549963	Hepatic lipogenesis in broiler chickens with different fat deposition during embryonic development	In order to identify the genes involved in the fatness variability, we studied the expression of several genes implicated in the hepatic lipid metabolism of broiler chickens with different fat deposition patterns during embryonic development. The mRNA expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), malic enzyme (ME) and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) genes were determined using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples of livers were collected from Arbor Acres (AA) and Sanhuang (SH) chickens on day 9, 14 and 19 of embryonic development as well as at hatching. This study showed that hepatic triglyceride (TG) level was found to increase suddenly during day 14 of embryonic development, to gradually increase thereafter, and to remain relatively constant at hatching. FAS gene expression in AA and SH broilers occurred prior to hatching and at hatching. The gene was expressed more in the former breed. ACC gene expression was observed beginning at the earlier development stage of days 9. No breed difference was observed in ME and apoB gene expression. This study indicated that the expression of lipogenic enzyme genes of the liver in broiler chickens exhibited scheduling during embryogenesis. The ACC gene started to express earlier than the FAS gene during embryonic development. This suggested that embryonic liver synthesized fatty acid, and breed difference was noticed prior to hatching. © 2007 The Authors.

33847132226	Effect of chicken egg yolk antibody against adipose tissue plasma membranes on carcass composition and lipogenic hormones and enzymes in pigs	Chicken egg yolk antibody against pig adipose tissue plasma membranes (AIgY) was raised and used in the present experiment to evaluate the effect of dietary AIgY supplementation on pig growth and carcass composition. 160 crossbred (Duroc-Jersey × Landrace·Meishan) pigs, with initial live body weight of 27.5 ± 2.4 kg, were treated with AIgY or non-immunized control egg yolk powder (NIgY) at the inclusion level of 75 mg/kg diet. Following a 104-day trial, the pigs were slaughtered for analyzing the carcass and meat quality traits. The perirenal, mesenteric and subcutaneous fat depots were weighed and the diameter of adipocytes from different fat depots was measured with histological methods. Serum concentrations of insulin and leptin as well as the activities of malic enzyme (ME) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in adipose tissue were measured. Dietary supplementation of AIgY enhanced average daily gain and feed efficiency by 13.03% (P < 0.01) and 7.49%, respectively, with no influence on feed consumption. AIgY increased the lean mass by 10.3% (P < 0.01) without affecting the dressing percentage. Backfat thickness at 6th-7th rib and the weights of perirenal, mesenteric and subcutaneous fat depots were reduced by 24.14% (P < 0.01), 27.27% (P < 0.05), 20.42% (P < 0.01) and 29.21% (P < 0.01), respectively. Dietary supplementation of AIgY reduced the size of adipocytes in all the three fat pads (P < 0.05). The meat color was improved whereas the marbling score, the intramuscular fat content, and pH

33947149532	Hepatic and muscle expression of thyroid hormone receptors in association with body and muscle growth in large yellow croaker, Pseudosciaena crocea (Richardson)	The role of thyroid hormone (TH) and its receptors (TRs) in the regulation of body growth and muscle accretion is well established in mammals and birds, whereas the involvement of THs and TRs in fish growth, especially during the muscle accretion period of juvenile-adult transition, is unknown. This study describes the cloning of the partial cDNA sequences of TRα and TRβ in large yellow croaker, Pseudosciaena crocea (Richardson) and the patterns of TRα and TRβ mRNA expression in liver and muscle of 1- and 2-year-old large yellow croaker, associated with changes in body mass and muscle characteristics. Two TRα isoforms (TRα1, TRα2) and TRβ were identified in large yellow croaker. The deduced amino acid sequences showed high homology to the TRs of human and other teleosts. Hepatic TRβ mRNA expression was markedly lower in 2-year-old large yellow croaker compared with the 1-year-old, while no significant age difference was observed for hepatic TRα mRNA expression. Muscle expression of TRα mRNA was significantly higher in 2-year-old large yellow croaker, whereas TRβ exhibited no significant age difference. Meanwhile, serum concentration of T

34447634700	Effect of early feed restriction on myofibre types and expression of growth-related genes in the gastrocnemius muscle of crossbred broiler chickens	The purpose of this study was to investigate the immediate and long-term effects of early feed restriction (ER) on morphology and gene expression of lateral gastrocnemius muscle. Newly hatched crossbred broiler chickens were allocated into control and ER groups, the latter being free-fed on alternate days from hatch to 14 days of age (14d), followed by ad libitum feeding as the control group until 63d. The lateral gastrocnemius muscle was taken at 14 and 63d, respectively for myofibre typing by both myosin ATPase staining and relative quantification of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) mRNA for slow-twitch (SM), red fast-twitch (FRM) and white fast-twitch (FWM) myofibres. The body weight and lateral gastrocnemius weight were significantly lower in the ER group, accompanied by significantly reduced serum triiodothyronine. The ER group exhibited significantly higher SM and FRM MyHC expression at 14d, but lower SM expression at 63d. Myosin ATPase staining revealed a similar pattern. The percentage of SM was higher at 14d while lower at 63d in the ER group. These morphological changes were accompanied by changes of mRNA expression for growth-related genes. The ER group expressed lower insulin-like growth factoar I (IGF-I) and higher IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) at 14d, yet significantly increased growth hormone receptor and IGF-IR mRNA at 63d. These results indicate that ER may delay the slow to fast myofibre conversion as an immediate effect, but would result in a lower percentage of slow fibres owing to compensatory growth in the long term, which involves changes of mRNA expression for the growth-related genes in the muscle. © The Authors 2007.

34547739555	Muscle type-specific responses of myoD and calpain 3 expression to recombinant porcine growth hormone in the pig	Sixteen castrated male Large White × Landrace pigs were employed to investigate the muscle type-specific changes of gene expression in response to recombinant porcine growth hormone (rpGH) administration. Pigs were injected intramuscularly with rpGH (4 mg/day, n = 8) or saline (n = 8) for 28 days. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the mRNA abundance of genes related to muscle growth in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles. Myofibre-type composition was characterised by the ratio of the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) 1, 2a or 2b relative to 2x. The results showed that the relative myofibre-type composition of neither LD nor ST was affected by rpGH administration. rpGH administration did not induce significant changes in the abundances of myostatin and myogenin mRNA in both types of muscle. MyoD and calpain 3 mRNA were significantly increased after rpGH treatment in ST muscle, whereas the difference was not significant in LD muscle. A tendency of down-regulation was observed for PGC-1α mRNA expression in ST muscle of rpGH-treated group (P = 0.16). These results suggest that myoD, calpain 3 and probably PGC-1α may be involved in the mechanism of exogenous GH action on skeletal muscle growth; rpGH up-regulates mRNA expression of myoD and calpain 3 in a muscle type-specific manner, being more remarkable in ST than in LD, whereas no influences of rpGH on the mRNA expression of myostatin and myogenin were detected. © 2007 The Animal Consortium.

34548305116	Effect of dietary daidzein on egg production, shell quality, and gene expression of ER-α, GH-R, and IGF-IR in shell glands of laying hens	Our previous studies demonstrated that dietary daidzein improves egg production in ducks during the late period of the laying cycle. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of daidzein in laying hens, with more focus on eggshell quality. The expression of ER-α, GH-R, and IGF-IR mRNA in shell glands was determined to identify the target genes of daidzein action and to reveal the relationship between shell quality and profiles of gene expression in shell glands of laying hens. 1000 ISA hens, at 445 days of age, were allotted at random to two groups and given the basal diet with or without 10 mg of daidzein per kg diet for 9 weeks. Daidzein supplement significantly increased the egg laying rate and the feed conversion ratio.

34548550356	Effect of early feed restriction on metabolic programming and compensatory growth in broiler chickens	The effect of early feed restriction on metabolic programming and compensatory growth was studied in broiler chickens. A total of 480 female 1-d-old broiler birds (Aconred) were randomly allocated to ad libitum and feed-restricted groups, each of which was replicated 6 times with 40 birds per replicate. Broilers were provided commercial diets. Feed-restricted broilers were deprived of feed for 4 h per day from 1 to 21 d of age. Effects of treatments were determined at 21 and 63 d of age. In feed-restricted birds at 21 d of age, BW, average daily gain and average daily feed intake, breast muscle (P < 0.01), carcass yield (P < 0.05), and abdominal fat (P < 0.05) were decreased. Ether extract content in breast muscle was increased (P < 0.01), whereas CP content was slightly decreased. Triiodothyronine (P < 0.01) and thyroxine (P < 0.05) were decreased in serum. Free fatty acid and very low density lipoprotein were slightly increased in serum, whereas triglyceride and glucose were decreased (P < 0.01). Activities of NADPH-generating enzymes in liver including malic dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged in ad libitum birds, whereas hormone-sensitive lipase activity was increased (P < 0.01). In feed-restricted birds at 63 d of age, BW, average daily gain, average daily feed intake, carcass yield, breast muscle yield, and serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine remained as ad libitum birds, whereas abdominal fat yield was increased (P < 0.05). Ether extract content in breast muscle was decreased (P < 0.01), whereas CP content was increased (P < 0.05). Activities of NADPH-generating enzymes were significantly increased, except abdominal malic dehydrogenase and hormone-sensitive lipase activity was decreased (P < 0.01) in liver and abdominal fat. Lipoprotein lipase activity was increased (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat. In summary, feed restriction severely affected growth performance and lipid metabolism in broilers in the early period. Because there was no statistical difference among the final BW, near full compensatory growth was achieved. In addition, early feed restriction might have induced prolonged metabolic programming in chicks and led to adult obesity. ©2007 Poultry Science Association Inc.

34948846005	Tissue-specific effect of dietary cysteamine on expression of adiponectin receptors in rats	Adiponectin is synthesized by adipocytes and affects glucose and lipid metabolism by binging to its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. Cysteamine, a naturally existing intermediate metabolite of sulfur amino acid, has been reported to modulate metabolism and growth in various species of animals; however, whether the action of cysteamine involves adiponectin and its receptors is unknown. The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the effect of dietary cysteamine on the expression of AdipoR1/R2 in different tissues, in association with the alterations in endocrine and metabolic status. Rats were fed either of the diets supplemented with 0 or 700 mg/kg cysteamine feed additive (containing 30% of cysteamine hydrochloride) for 4 weeks, and the expression of adiponectin and its receptors in adipose tissue, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in liver, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscle was determined, in association with the growth performance and serum concentrations of hormones and metabolites. A temporal trend of increase in growth rate and the ratio of feed consumption relative to body weight gain was observed in the second week of cysteamine supplementation. Serum concentrations of insulin and TNF-α increased, while serum levels of triglycerides, FFA, and total cholesterol decreased significantly 4 weeks after cysteamine treatment. Leptin and GH remained unaffected. Cysteamine supplementation increased mRNA expression of AdipoR1 in adipose tissue, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscle as well as that of AdipoR2 in soleus muscle and adipose tissue. Nevertheless, hepatic expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 was not influenced. Despite a numeric increase, no significant alteration in adiponectin mRNA expression in adipose tissue was observed. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of cysteamine modulates the endocrine and metabolic status of rats, which may involve the tissue-specific responses of adiponectin receptors at the level of mRNA transcription. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

36448993706	Effect of transportation stress on heat shock protein 70 concentration and mRNA expression in heart and kidney tissues and serum enzyme activities and hormone concentrations of pigs	Objective - To determine the enzymatic and hormonal responses, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) production, and Hsp70 mRNA expression in heart and kidney tissues of transport-stressed pigs. Animals - 24 pigs (mean weight, 20 ± 1 kg). Procedures - Pigs were randomly placed into groups of 12 each. One group was transported for 2 hours The other group was kept under normal conditions and used as control pigs. Sera were used to detect triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and cortisol concentrations and alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase activities. The heart and kidneys of anesthetized pigs were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen for quantification of Hsp70 and Hsp70 mRNA. Results - No significant differences were detected in serum alanine aminotransferase activity and triiodothyronine and cortisol concentrations between groups; however, the serum creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase activities and thyroxine concentrations were higher in transported pigs. Densitometric readings of western blots revealed that the amount of Hsp70 in heart and kidney tissues was significantly higher in transported pigs, compared with control pigs. Results of fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that the Hsp70 mRNA transcription in heart tissue, but not kidney tissue, was significantly higher in transported pigs, compared with control pigs. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Transportation imposed a severe stress on pigs that was manifested as increased serum activities of aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase and increased amounts of Hsp70 and Hsp70 mRNA expression in heart and kidney tissues. Changes in serum enzyme activities were related to the tissue damage of transport-stressed pigs.

36049014023	Long-term effect of early feed restriction on lipid peroxidation and enzymatic antioxidant activity in broiler chicken	Aim: To investigate the long-term effect of early post-hatch feed restriction (EFR, food provided every other day during first 2 weeks after hatching) on the lipid peroxidation and enzymatic antioxidant activity in broiler chicken, compare with the effect of late feed restriction (LFR, performed 2 weeks before slaughtering), and observe the changes of the concentrations of malonilaldehyde (MDA), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in plasma, liver, pectoral and gastrocnernius muscle, Methods: The experiment was conducted at Key Laboratory of Animal Physiology and Biochemistry, State Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University from April to December in 2005. Experimental grouping: Totally 100 healthy chicken of one-day old were selected and randomly assigned into two groups: control group (n = 60) and EFR group (n = 40). Controlled chicken were fed to 50-day old, and 20 of them were selected as LFR group. Experimental management: 1 EFR group: Feed restriction was performed every other day during first 2 weeks, followed by free feeding. 2 LFR group: Free feeding at days 1-49 and feed restriction at days 50-63 were combined. 3 Control group: Free feeding was managed only. Experimental evaluation: Body weight was recorded every week. At days 14 and 63, the concentrations of MDA, activities of SOD and GPX in plasma, liver and muscle were measured. Results: All 100 animals were involved in the result analysis. 1 No significant changes were found for all the indices at 14 days of age between EFR group and control group. 2 At 63 days of age, EFR chicken exhibited significantly higher serum MDA concentration and GPX activity compared with the control counterparts (P < 0.05), significantly lower liver SOD activity (P < 0.05). LFR chicken also showed significantly higher serum MDA concentration as well as SOD and GPX activities at 63 days of age, but significantly lower liver MDA concentration and pectoral muscle SOD activity compared with the control counterparts (P < 0.05). No change was observed in gastrocnemius muscle (P < 0.05). Compared with EFR group, serum GPX and SOD activities were increased, but liver MDA concentration was decreased in LFR group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Both EFR and LFR can increase lipid peroxidation and enzymatic antioxidant activity systematically in broiler chicken of 63 days old'. EFR exerts long-term effect on lipid peroxidation and enzymatic antioxidant activity.

Sixty-four German Holstein and German Simmental bulls were randomly assigned to two dietary treatments, based on concentrate or pasture. The concentration of cis-9,trans-11 CLA and VA in rumen, duodenal digesta and different tissues was determined by gas chromatography. The results showed that pasture relative to concentrate feeding significantly increased the concentration of VA in duodenal digesta, plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids. Pasture-based feeding resulted in a significant enrichment of cis-9,trans-11 CLA in plasma lipids and erythrocyte phospholipids, but not in rumen and duodenal digesta, compared to concentrate-fed diet. Diet did not affect the cis-9,trans-11 CLA concentrations (mg/100 g fresh tissue) in semitendinosus muscle and subcutaneous fat. There was a breed effect on the deposition of cis-9,trans-11 CLA in longissimus muscle with lower concentration in pasture-fed German Simmental bulls compared to concentrate-fed bulls. However, pasture feeding significantly increased both, the VA and cis-9,trans-11 CLA concentrations in liver and heart tissues. Both diet and breed effects on Δ

37549034275	Erhualian and Pietrain pigs exhibit distinct behavioral, endocrine and biochemical responses during transport	This study describes the breed-specific coping characteristics of pigs in response to transport stress. The dynamic changes of behavior, the activities of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as the plasma concentrations of stress and metabolic hormones in Erhualian (EHL) and Pietrain (PIE) pigs during 2 h transport were investigated. The majority of the behavior of EHL pigs consisted of oral/nasal/facial (ONF) and fit behaviors during the initial observations (first 15 min after start), and these behaviors were replaced by increased time sitting and lying in later observations (middle and last 15 min of transport). In contrast, PIE pigs showed high levels of ONF behaviors in initial observation, followed by high frequency and duration of standing during the middle and the last observation period. PIE pigs demonstrated significantly higher plasma CK (P < 0.01) and LDH activities (P < 0.05). There were significant effects of time and time × breed interaction (P < 0.05) on CK activities (P < 0.01) in both breeds. Plasma ACTH levels did not differ between breeds, yet a significant effect of time (P < 0.05) was shown during transport. EHL pigs exhibited consistently higher basal and stimulated plasma cortisol levels (P < 0.05). There were significant time effects on metabolic hormones (insulin, T3 and T4) (P < 0.01), whereas no significant breed effect for these hormones were found. These results indicate that different coping strategies apply in EHL pigs, as reflected by different behavioral, endocrine and biochemical responses during transport as compared with PIE pigs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

38149140340	Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 expression and genetic polymorphism significantly affect intramuscular fat deposition in the longissimus muscle of Erhualian and Sutai pigs	Two experiments were performed to elucidate the role of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) in i.m. fat (IMF) deposition in pigs. In Exp. 1, LM samples were removed from 4 male and 4 female Erhualian piglets at 3, 20, and 45 d of age, and SREBF1 mRNA expression level and IMF content were measured. Intramuscular fat content and expression of SREBF1 mRNA was greater (P < 0.05) in females than males at all 3 stages of age, providing initial evidence that the level of SREBF1 mRNA expression is related to IMF deposition in muscle of suckling pigs. Additionally, in Exp. 2 there was a positive correlation between the SREBF1 mRNA level and IMF content (r = 0.67, P < 0.01) in 100 Sutai finishing pigs, a synthetic line produced by crossing Erhualian and Duroc pigs. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the reverse transcription PCR products of the SREBF1 gene revealed 3 genotypes in Sutai pigs with frequencies of 50% for AA, 36% for AB, and 14% for BB, respectively. Both SREBF1 mRNA level and IMF content in muscle were greater (P < 0.05) in AB and BB animals than in AA animals, whereas no difference in backfat thickness was observed among the 3 genotypes. Sequencing analysis identified 2 SNP at T1006C and C1033T within the open reading frame of the SREBF1 gene (NM_214157). Although both are silent mutations, they affected the secondary structure of SREBF1 mRNA. These results suggest that SREBF1 might play an important role in regulation of muscle fat deposition during postnatal growth of pigs. The SNP identified in the SREBF1 gene suggest that it could be used as a genetic marker to improve IMF content in pigs. © 2008 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

38449113151	Exposure of preimplantation embryos to insulin alters expression of imprinted genes	Insulin promotes early embryonic development, but whether this action affects postimplantation fetal development and alters the expression of imprinted genes remain to be determined. This study analyzed the expression and methylation levels of the growth-related imprinted genes H19 and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) in fetuses exposed to insulin before implantation. We cultured 2-cell embryos in either 0 or 0.25 μg/ml insulin until the blastocyst stage and then transferred them into pseudopregnant recipient mice. The number of embryos developing to blastocysts after insulin exposure was 16.4% higher than that of the control, and the birth body weight of the insulin-exposed group was 17.8% higher than that of the control group. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that exposure of preimplantation embryos to insulin increased the mRNA expression of both Igf2 and H19 in embryonic day (E) 14 fetuses. Bisulfite genomic sequencing demonstrated that the methylation level of the H19-Igf2 imprint control region was 19.3% lower in insulin-exposed E14 fetuses than in controls. The present study indicates that insulin exposure during the preimplantation stage alters the expression of imprinted genes and affects fetal development.

34249034627	Developmental changes of FSH-R, LH-R, ER-β and GnRH-I expression in the ovary of prepubertal ducks (Anas platyrhynchos)	Normal ovarian development is dependent on stimulation of the gonadotropic hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), as well as some regulatory factors locally produced in ovary, e.g. 17beta-estradiol (E2) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), mediated by their respective receptors. In order to elucidate the potential roles of LH, FSH, E2 and GnRH-I during early follicular development in prepubertal ducks, mRNA expression of LH-R, FSH-R, ER-β and GnRH-I in ovaries of 1-day-old (D1), 30-day-old (D30), 60-day-old (D60) and 90-day-old (D90) ducks was measured with semi-quantitative RT-PCR using β-actin as an internal standard. The ovary index (the ratio of ovary weight/body mass) did not change from D30 to D90, while the ovary weight and serum E2 levels rose progressively, indicating the prepubertal development of the ovary. Ovarian expression of FSH-R, LH-R, ER-β and GnRH-I mRNA changed greatly during this period. Abundance of FSH-R and ER-β mRNA went up gradually from D1 to D60, followed by a decline on D90. LH-R and GnRH-I mRNA expression increased from D1 to D90, reaching a peak at D90. These results indicate that the developing ovary is highly responsive to the regulation of FSH during the early stage, while close to the onset of sexual maturation, the ovary is likely more responsive to LH. In addition, the expression of GnRH-I and ER-β mRNA in the ovary suggest that GnRH-I and E2 are involved in the regulation of prepubertal follicular development in the ovary of ducks. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

79951949776	Effect of maternal protein restriction on lipid metabolism in Meishan piglets at weaning	The present study aimed to determine the effects of maternal protein restriction on lipid metabolism of piglets at weaning and the associated underlying mechanism employing Meishan pigs as model. Sixteen Meishan sows were assigned to the control group and the maternal protein restriction group (MPR). The treated group was fed a low-protein diet containing 6% protein during pregnancy followed by 7% protein during lactation, whereas the control group received 12% and 14% protein during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. Blood and subcutaneous fat of piglets were sampled at weaning. The results showed that in MPR piglets' body weight and backfat thickness were significantly decreased compared to control piglets (P< 0.05). Leptin mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated and the leptin content showed a decreased tendency (P= 0.10) in subcutaneous fat of MPR group though the serum leptin concentration was unchanged. The lipolytic lipase activity (including Hormone sensitive lipase, HSL and adipose tissue triglyceride lipase, ATGL) in subcutaneous fat was significantly increased in MPR group (P< 0.05). The fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA expression decreased significantly (P< 0.05) although CCTTA enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP-β) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor Γ (PPAR-Γ) mRNA expression showed no obviously changes in MPR group compared with the control. Furthermore, though no alteration was detected for total perilipin protein level, the mRNA expression of perilipin was significantly decreased and the phosphorylation level of perilipin protein demonstrated an increased tendency (P= 0.09) in the MPR group. The present study indicates that the lower lipid deposition in piglets of maternal protein restriction group at weaning may be mediated by the increased lipolysis in the subcutaneous fat demonstrated by increased lipolytic lipase activity and higher perilipin phosphorylation level. These alterations may influence the lipid metabolism of later life. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

84876685693	Glucocorticoid receptor is involved in the breed-dependent transcriptional regulation of mtDNA- and nuclear-encoded mitochondria genes in the liver of newborn piglets	Background: Mitochondria, which are essential for the functionality of eukaryotic cells, are particularly important in metabolically active tissues such as liver. Different breeds of pigs demonstrate distinct metabolic profiles in the liver, yet little is known whether the expression and transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial genes differ between breeds.Results: Here we used male newborn Large White (LW) and Erhualian (EHL) piglets to delineate the difference in hepatic mitochondrial gene regulation between breeds. The hepatic content of ATP was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in EHL piglets, which was associated with lower mtDNA copy number (p < 0.05). Most of the mtDNA-encoded genes (10 of 13), however, were more abundantly expressed in EHL compared to LW piglets. We also detected 3 differentially expressed nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, among which isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and ATP synthase, H

84877765895	Maternal Low-Protein Diet Affects Epigenetic Regulation of Hepatic Mitochondrial DNA Transcription in a Sex-Specific Manner in Newborn Piglets Associated with GR Binding to Its Promoter	Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) plays an important role in energy homeostasis by controlling electron transfer and ATP generation. Maternal malnutrition during pregnancy affects mitochondrial (mt) DNA-encoded OXPHOS activity in offspring, yet it is unknown whether epigenetic mechanism is involved in the transcriptional regulation of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS genes. In this study, 14 primiparous purebred Meishan sows were fed either standard- (SP, 12% crude protein) or low-protein (LP; 6% crude protein) diets throughout gestation, and the hepatic expression and transcriptional regulation of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS genes were analyzed in newborn piglets. Maternal low protein diet decreased hepatic mtDNA copy number in males, but not in females. LP male piglets had significantly higher hepatic AMP concentration and low energy charge, which was accompanied by enhanced mRNA expression of NADH dehydrogenase subunits 6, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, 2, 3 and cytochrome b, as well as increased cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity. In contrast, LP female piglets showed significantly lower hepatic AMP concentrations and higher energy charge with no alterations in OXPHOS gene expression. Moreover, LP males demonstrated higher glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding to the mtDNA promoter compared with SP males, which was accompanied by lower cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation on mtDNA promoter. Interestingly, opposite changes were seen in females, which showed diminished GR binding and enriched cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation on mtDNA promoter. These results suggest that maternal low protein diet during pregnancy causes sex-dependent epigenetic alterations in mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS gene expression, possibly GR is involved in mtDNA transcription regulation. © 2013 Jia et al.

84888043998	Vaccination inhibits TLR2 transcription via suppression of GR nuclear translocation and binding to TLR2 promoter in porcine lung infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) act respectively as effectors of innate immune and stress responses. The crosstalk between them is critical for the maintenance of homeostasis during the immune response. Vaccination is known to boost adaptive immunity, yet it remains elusive whether vaccination may affect GR/TLR interactions following infection. Duroc. ×. Meishan crossbred piglets were allocated to three groups. The control group (CC) received neither vaccination nor infection; the non-vaccinated infection group (NI) was artificially infected intratracheally with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae ( M. hyopneumoniae); while the vaccinated, infected group (VI) was vaccinated intramuscularly with inactivated M. hyopneumoniae one month before infection. The clinical signs and macroscopic lung lesions were significantly reduced by vaccination. However, vaccination did not affect the concentration of M. hyopneumoniae DNA in the lung. Serum cortisol was significantly decreased in both NI and VI pigs ( P<. 0.01), but only VI pigs demonstrated significantly diminished nuclear GR content. TLRs 1-10 were all expressed in lung, among which TLR2 was the most abundant and was significantly up-regulated ( P<. 0.05) in NI pigs, but not in VI pigs. Accordingly, GR binding to the GR response element on TLR2 promoter was significantly increased ( P<. 0.05) in NI pigs, but not in VI pigs. These results suggest that the inhibition of GR nuclear translocation and binding to the TLR2 promoter, which results in diminished TLR2 expression, is associated with the protective effect of vaccination on M. hyopneumoniae-induced lung lesions in the pig. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84897626764	Differential expression of hypothalamic fear- and stress-related genes inbroiler chickens showing short or long tonic immobility	The serotonin system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis play important roles in modulating fear and stress-coping characteristics. Tonic immobility (TI) is a fear-related phenotype, and previously we have shown that broiler chickens showing short TI (STI) duration experience better growth performance and higher adaptability to stress. Here, we sought to further elucidate the central mechanisms underlying the phenotypic differences between chickens showing STI and long TI duration, by comparing the hypothalamic expression of genes in the serotonergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis under basal and corticosterone-exposed situations. The STI broilers had significantly lower (P < 0.01) hypothalamic expression of serotonin reuptake transporter and serotonin receptor 1A. Moreover, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 was expressed significantly lower in STI chickens at the level of both mRNA (P < 0.01) and protein (P < 0.05). Hypothalamic expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA tended to be higher (P < 0.059) in long TI chickens, but the protein content was approximately 2 times higher (P < 0.01) in STI chickens. The uncoupled expression of GR mRNA and protein was associated with significantly lower (P < 0.05) expression of gga-miR-181a, gga-miR-211, and gga-miR-22, which are predicted to target GR, in STI chickens. Corticosterone administration reduced the mRNA expression of postsynaptic serotonin receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (P = 0.059) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (P < 0.05), yet significantly increased the protein content of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (P < 0.05). These results suggest that broilers of different TI phenotypes have a distinct pattern of hypothalamic expression of fear- and stress-related genes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84908100309	A high-concentrate diet induced colonic epithelial barrier disruption is associated with the activating of cell apoptosis in lactating goats	Background: In ruminants, lower ruminal pH causes massive disruption of ruminal epithelial structure during periods of feeding high-concentrate diets. However, the influence of excessive organic fatty acids in the lumen of hindgut on the epithelial structure is unclear. In this study, twelve mid-lactating goats were randomly assigned to either a HC diet group (65% concentrate of dry matter; n = 6) or a LC diet group (35% concentrate of dry matter; n = 6) for 10 weeks. The colonic epithelial structure was detected by HE staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the apoptotic status of epithelial cells was estimated by TUNEL method and caspase activities.Results: HC goats showed higher level of free lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rumen fluid (p < 0.01) but not in colonic digesta (p > 0.05), and higher total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) and in colonic digesta (p < 0.01), and higher content of starch in colonic digesta (p < 0.05) compared to LC goats. HC goats demonstrated profound alterations in the colonic epithelial structure and tight junctions (TJ), apparently due to damage of the epithelium with widened TJs space and nuclear breakdown and mitochondrial swelling. HC goats showed higher level of apoptosis in the colonic epithelium with higher proportion of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells and increases of caspase-3 and -3/7 activities, as well as the lower ratio of bcl-2/bax mRNA expression in the colonic mucosa (p < 0.05). However, β-defense mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the colonic mucosa of HC goats compared to LC (p < 0.05). HC goats showed higher level of TJ proteins including claudin-1 and claudin-4 in the colonic mucosa than LC (p < 0.05). Neither free LPS content in the colonic digesta nor NF-κ B protein expression in tissues showed significant difference between HC and LC goats (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Our results reveal that long-term feeding HC diet to lactating goats causes severe damages to the colonic mucosa barrier associated with activating cells apoptosis.

84908474485	Maternal dietary betaine supplementation modifies hepatic expression of cholesterol metabolic genes via epigenetic mechanisms in newborn piglets	To elucidate the effects of maternal dietary betaine supplementation on hepatic expression of cholesterol metabolic genes in newborn piglets and the involved epigenetic mechanisms, we fed gestational sows with control or betaine-supplemented diets (3 g/kg) throughout pregnancy. Neonatal piglets born to betaine-supplemented sows had higher serum methionine concentration and hepatic content of betaine, which was associated with significantly up-regulated hepatic expression of glycine N-methyltransferase. Prenatal betaine exposure increased hepatic cholesterol content and modified the hepatic expression of cholesterol metabolic genes in neonatal piglets. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 was down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels, while 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) was down-regulated at the mRNA level, but up-regulated at the protein level, in betaine-exposed piglets. The transcriptional repression of HMGCR was associated with CpG island hypermethylation and higher repressive histone mark H3K27me3 (histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation) on the promoter, whereas increased HMGCR protein content was associated with significantly decreased expression of miR-497. Furthermore, LDL receptor was significantly down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in the liver of betaine-exposed piglets, which was associated with promoter CpG hypermethylation. In addition, the expression of cholesterol-27α-hydroxylase (CYP27α1) was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels, while the expression of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7α1) was increased at the mRNA level, but unchanged at the protein level associated with increased expression of miR-181. These results indicate that maternal betaine supplementation increases hepatic cholesterol content in neonatal piglets through epigenetic regulations of cholesterol metabolic genes, which involve alterations in DNA and histone methylation and in the expression of microRNA targeting these genes.

84908480357	Maternal low-protein diet alters ovarian expression of folliculogenic and steroidogenic genes and their regulatory microRNAs in neonatal piglets	Maternal malnutrition during pregnancy may give rise to female offspring with disrupted ovary functions in adult age. Neonatal ovary development predisposes adult ovary function, yet the effect of maternal nutrition on the neonatal ovary has not been described. Therefore, here we show the impact of maternal protein restriction on the expression of folliculogenic and steroidogenic genes, their regulatory microRNAs and promoter DNA methylation in the ovary of neonatal piglets. Sows were fed either standard-protein (SP, 15% crude protein) or low-protein (LP, 7.5% crude protein) diets throughout gestation. Female piglets born to LP sows showed significantly decreased ovary weight relative to body weight (p<0.05) at birth, which was accompanied with an increased serum estradiol level (p<0.05). The LP piglets demonstrated higher ratio of bcl-2 associated X protein/B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 mRNA (p<0.01), which was associated with up-regulated mRNA expression of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) (p<0.05) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (p<0.05). The steroidogenic gene, cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19A1) was significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) in LP piglets. The alterations in ovarian gene expression were associated with a significant down-regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor mRNA expression (p<0.05) in LP piglets. Moreover, three microRNAs, including miR-423-5p targeting both CYP19A1 and PCNA, miR-378 targeting CYP19A1 and miR-210 targeting BMP4, were significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) in the ovary of LP piglets. These results suggest that microRNAs are involved in mediating the effect of maternal protein restriction on ovarian function through regulating the expression of folliculogenic and steroidogenic genes in newborn piglets.

84925315046	Betaine supplementation in maternal diet modulates the epigenetic regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes in neonatal piglets	In this study, gestational sows were fed control or betaine-supplemented diets (3 g/kg) throughout the pregnancy, and the newborn piglets were used to elucidate whether maternal dietary betaine affected offspring hepatic gluconeogenic genes through epigenetic mechanisms. Neonatal piglets born to betaine-supplemented sows had significantly higher serum and hepatic betaine contents, together with significantly greater expression of methionine metabolic enzymes in the liver. Interestingly, significantly higher serum concentrations of lactic acid and glucogenic amino acids, including serine, glutamate, methionine and histidine, were detected in the piglets born to betaine-supplemented sows, which were coincident with higher hepatic glycogen content and PEPCK1 enzyme activity, as well as greater protein expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK1), mitochondrional phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK2) and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBP1). Moreover, maternal betaine significantly changed the methylation status of both CpGs and histones on the promoter of gluconeogenic genes. The lower PEPCK1 mRNA was associated with DNA hypermethylation and more enriched repression histone mark H3K27me3, while the up-regulated PEPCK2 and FBP1 mRNA was associated with DNA hypomethylation and more enriched activation histone mark H3K4me3. Furthermore, the expression of two miRNAs predicted to target PC and 6 miRNAs predicted to target PEPCK1 was dramatically suppressed in the liver of piglets born to betaine-supplemented sows. Our results provide the first evidence that maternal betaine supplementation affects hepatic gluconeogenic genes expression in newborn piglets through enhanced hepatic methionine metabolism and epigenetic regulations, which involve DNA and histone methylations, and possibly miRNAs-mediated post-transcriptional mechanism. © 2014 Cai et al.

44449092560	Growth- and breed-related changes of fetal development in cattle	Breed differences in adult animals are determined during fetal development. If interventions are to be developed that influence growth of muscle and fat, it is important to know at which time during gestation breed differences appear and are fixed. The objective of this study was to characterize fetal development in cattle of different breeds. Pregnant cows of 4 cattle breeds with different growth impetus and muscularity were slaughtered under normal processing conditions and the fetuses were removed. German Angus, a typical beef cattle; Galloway, a smaller, environmentally resistant beef type; Holstein Friesian, a dairy type; and Belgian Blue, an extreme type for muscle growth were used. Fetuses of each breed were investigated at 3, 6, and 9 mo of gestation. Fetuses were weighed and dissected into carcass, organs, and muscles. Body fat weight was obtained using the Soxhlet extraction method. Fetal weight increased most rapidly in the third trimester of gestation mainly due to the accelerated muscle and fat deposition. The organ weight to body weight (BW) ratios decreased and the muscle and fat weight to BW ratios increased. At 3 mo of gestation, Galloway fetuses had the significantly smallest BW, half-carcass weight, leg weight, organ weight, muscle weight and shortest leg length. In contrast, Holstein fetuses had the significantly greatest BW, liver, kidney, and lung weights and significantly longest leg length among the 4 breeds, but no differences between Holstein Friesian and Belgian Blue were detected in half-carcass and leg weight. Indeed, Belgian Blue fetuses had the significantly greatest half-carcass weight, leg weight, and muscle weight at 9 mo of gestation, and Galloway had a significantly greater body fat to BW ratio than Holstein Friesian and Belgian Blue. These differences were not evident at 3 and 6 mo of gestation. These data show that the profound increase of tissue and organ weights occurred in later gestation in cattle fetuses even though breed differences were evident as early as 3 mo of gestation. Depending on the tissue of interest, impacting fetal growth likely needs to occur early in gestation before the appearance of breed-specific differences.

44249084156	Characterization of adrenal ACTH signaling pathway and steroidogenic enzymes in Erhualian and Pietrain pigs with different plasma cortisol levels	Our previous study demonstrated significant difference in the basal plasma cortisol levels between Erhualian (EHL) and Pietrain (PIE) pigs, implicating fundamental breed difference in adrenocortical function. The objectives of the present study were therefore to characterize the expression pattern of proteins involved in adrenal ACTH signaling and, including melanocortin type 2 receptor (MC2R), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), as well as that of the key enzymes involved in steroidogenesis in EHL and PIE pigs, in association with the plasma corticotrophin (ACTH) and cortisol levels. The plasma concentrations of the substrates for adrenal steroidogenesis, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, did not differ between breeds. Plasma concentration of ACTH and the adrenal contents of MC2R mRNA and protein were similar in two breeds of pigs, whereas the basal plasma concentrations of cortisol in EHL pigs were 1.5 folds higher than that in PIE pigs. The higher basal plasma cortisol levels in EHL pigs were found to be accompanied with the higher expression of ACTH post-receptor signaling components, cAMP, pCREB and StAR, as well as the higher expression of cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc), 17α-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (P450

However, little is known concerning its effects on egg production of hens and the growth rate of their offspring. In the present study, 67-wk-old broiler breeders were allotted at random to control and cysteamine-supplemented (400 mg/kg) groups for 8 wk. The hatchlings were fed under the same condition until 6 wk of age. Cysteamine significantly increased the average laying rate by 2.24% (P < 0.01), decreased dramatically the percentage of the broken eggs by 40.55% (P < 0.01), and increased that of the abnormal eggs by 20.15% (P < 0.05). Cysteamine did not alter the egg weight, egg quality, fertility, or hatchability but significantly increased eggshell weight (P < 0.05) and decreased albumin weight (P < 0.05).

Diabetes was induced in female mice by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. DNA and total RNA were extracted from fetuses obtained from diabetic and control dams on embryonic day (E) 14. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA expression of Igf2 in fetuses from diabetic mice was 0.65-fold of the control counterparts. Bisulfite genomic sequencing demonstrated that the methylation level of the H19-Igf2 imprint control region was 19.1% higher in diabetic fetuses than in those of control dams. In addition, the body weight of pups born to diabetic dams was 26.5% lower than that of the control group. The results indicate that maternal diabetes can affect fetal development by means of altered expression of imprinted genes. The modified genomic DNA methylation status of imprinting genes may account for the change in gene expression. Copyright 2008 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

53349165616	Meat quality is associated with muscle metabolic status but not contractile myofiber type composition in premature pigs	Longissimus muscles were sampled from Erhualian (EHL) and Pietrain (PIE) pigs at 20 kg of body weight. No breed differences were detected in either the proportions or the mRNA/protein expression of respective MyHC isoforms, or the mRNA expression of PGC-1α (all P > 0.10). However, meat quality traits were already divergent between breeds, and were associated with distinct energy metabolic status, as reflected by dramatically lower AMPK activity yet higher CK and LDH activities (all P < 0.01) in longissimus muscle of EHL pigs. Moreover, mRNA expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was found to be higher (P < 0.05) in longissimus muscle of EHL pigs. These results indicate that the differences in meat quality traits occur early in premature pigs, and these are attributed to skeletal muscle energy metabolism and not contractile myofiber type composition. Breed-specific GR expression in muscle may be related to the pattern of energy metabolism and meat quality, yet the mechanism awaits further investigation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

56549083516	Analysis of cis-9, trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid in milk fat by capillary gas chromatography	Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a term representing a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of octadecadienoic acid with a conjugated double bond system. Conjugated linoleic acid has attracted a great deal of interest among nutritionists because it is a natural fat component that appears to have a number of health improvement properties. The cis-9, trans-11-CLA is the major CLA isomer found in dairy products accounting for 75% to 90% of the total CLA in milk fat. A capillary gas chromatographic method equipped with a flame ionization detector for the analysis of the cis-9, trans-11-CLA in milk fat was developed. The cis-9, trans-11-CLA was extracted with hexane-isopropanol, methylated with methanol-sodium methylate and cis-9) trans-11-CLA was separated and quantified using gas chromatography. Retention time of the peaks was used for qualitative analysis, while external standard method was used for quantitative analysis. The recovery of the cis-9, trans-11-CLA was 100. 26%. The relative standard deviation was 1.9% (n=6). This method presented is advantageous for high precision, high sensitivity analysis with smaller sample size and simpler pretreatment. It would be of significance for analyzing the contents of other fatty acids in the milk and milk products.

60149094527	Differential display of expressed genes reveals a novel function of SFRS18 in regulation of intramuscular fat deposition	Intramuscular fat (IMF) content plays a key role in establishing pork quality. In the present study, differential-display reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR) was used to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes between longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles with extremely different IMF content. A major DE gene associated with IMF content was identified as splicing factor serine-arginine rich protein (SFRS18) gene, also known as SRrp130. The gene exhibited relatively higher expression levels in LD muscles with higher IMF content. A full-length cDNA sequence of pig SFRS18 gene was obtained by in silico comparative cloning coupled with PCR target sequencing, while the current EST (expressed sequence tag) database supported two transcript variants of the pig gene. Differential expression of the SFRS18 gene was further confirmed using quantitative PCR. The mRNA levels of SFRS18 gene showed significant and positive correlation with IMF content in LD muscle (r = 0.54, P < 0.01). Collectively, these results suggest that the SFRS18 gene is involved in the regulation of IMF deposition in pig and that it may be a useful tool in selecting animals for desired amounts of fatness for high quality pork. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

67649214780	Methionine and selenium yeast supplementation of the maternal diets affects color, water-holding capacity, and oxidative stability of their male offspring meat at the early stage	Four hundred fifty 52-wk-old Lang-shan breeding hens (dual-purpose type, an indigenous poultry breed of China) were randomly divided into 9 treatments with 5 replicates each treatment. They were fed corn-soybean diets with 0, 0.30, and 0.60 mg of Se/ kg from Se yeast and 3.2, 4.0, and 5.4 g of dl-Met/ kg, respectively. After incubation, 250 chickens each treatment were randomly divided into 5 replicates and fed the same diet. At 21 d old, 10 male chicks in each treatment were slaughtered. There results were as fol-lows. (1) The Se content significantly increased with the increase of Se yeast supplementation (P < 0.01). (2) The carbonyl content of the myofibrillar protein significantly decreased with the increase of Met supplementation (P < 0.01) and the carbonyl content of the 0 mg of Se/kg treatment was higher than the 0.3 mg of Se/kg treatment (P < 0.01). (3) Selenium supplementation at 0.30 and 0.60 mg/kg significantly decreased malondialdehyde content compared with that of 0 mg of Se/kg (P < 0.01) and 4.0 and 5.4 g of Met/kg supplementation significantly decreased malondial-dehyde content compared with that of 3.2 g of Met/ kg (P < 0.01). (4) Supplementation of Met at 5.4 g/ kg significantly increased International Commission on Illumination a* value compared with 3.2 and 4.0 g of Met/kg (P < 0.01). Supplementation of Se at 0.6 mg/ kg significantly increased a* value compared 0 and 0.3 mg of Se/kg (P < 0.01) and 0 mg of Se/kg significantly increased b* value compared with 0.30 and 0.60 mg of Se/kg (P < 0.01). (5) Selenium supplemented at 0.30 and 0.60 mg/kg decreased drip loss compared with 0 mg of Se/kg and 4.0 and 5.4 g of Met/kg decreased drip loss compared with 3.2 g of Met/kg, respectively. The conclusion was drawn that Met and Se yeast supplementation of the maternal diets could improve color, water-holding capacity, and oxidative stability of male offspring meat to an extent. © 2009 Poultry Science Association Inc.

67649232980	Expression of heat shock protein 60 in the tissues of transported piglets	In this study, we sought to determine the distribution and expression of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) in the tissues of transported piglets. A total of 24 Chinese Erhualian piglets with an average body weight of 20±1 kg were assessed under both 2-h transported and normal housing conditions. Results of enzymatic analysis showed that the serum creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations were significantly increased in the 2-h transported piglets. Acute cellular lesions characterized by granular and vacuolar degeneration of the parenchyma cells in the tested heart, liver, and kidney were also confirmed by histopathological test after 2 h transportation. These results indicate that transport stress induces tissue damage to heart, liver, and kidney. Hsp60-positive immunostaining was consistently detected in the cytoplasm of myocardial cells, hepatocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells, and epithelial cells of fundic gland. However, results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that Hsp60 expression was only significantly elevated in the stomach, with lower expression in the heart and a non-significant trend of increased liver and kidney expression of Hsp60. These results indicate that different tissues had different sensitivities to transport stress, possibly resulting in varying levels of cytoprotection by Hsp60 in the different tissues. The expression of Hsp60 following 2 h transportation coincided with deterioration of cardiac cytoprotection in the heart and protection in the stomach. However, the direct role of Hsp60 in cytoprotection of heart and stomach tissues needs further investigation. © Cell Stress Society International 2008.

67349159377	Perilipin, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ mRNA abundance in longissimus muscle and different adipose tissues of Holstein and Charolais cattle	Possible regulators of intramuscular fat deposition were investigated in longissimus muscle (LM) and adipose tissues of 18 months old Holstein and Charolais bulls. The mRNA abundance of perilipin and transcription factors C/EBPα and C/EBPβ was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Carcass traits and marbling traits were recorded and relationships among adipogenic genes and tissue traits were determined. Charolais cattle were heavier (P < 0.001) and had less body fat (P < 0.001). Holstein bulls accumulated more fat in the LM (P = 0.02), but the number and size of marbling flecks did not differ (P > 0.7) between breeds. Perilipin, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ mRNA abundance was influenced by tissue but not by breed. Relationships between mRNA abundance and marbling traits could not be confirmed, however relationships among adipogenic genes. The transcriptional activity of adipogenic genes in LM suggests that intramuscular adipose tissue is still developing and differentiation still occurs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

67349186641	Layer and broiler chicks exhibit similar hypothalamic expression of orexigenic neuropeptides but distinct expression of genes related to energy homeostasis and obesity	Layer and broiler chickens demonstrate striking differences in body weight and body composition. However, the mechanism underlying such difference is elusive. Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulates energy homeostasis and body size in mammals, but information in birds is scarce. Here we test the hypothesis that such breed difference is more associated with hypothalamic expression of genes related to HPA axis, rather than orexigenic neuropeptides. Broiler chicks exhibit significantly higher body weight and food intake at day (D) 7 posthatching, but the food intake relative to body weight gain was actually lower. No breed differences were observed for hypothalamic expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AGRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), orexin (ORX), leptin receptor (LEPR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) or fatty acid synthase (FAS). However, broiler chicks expressed significantly higher glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA (P < 0.05) and protein (P < 0.01) in hypothalamus compared to layer chicks, which is associated with lower corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA (P < 0.05) yet higher accumulation of CRH peptide in hypothalamus, suggesting an augmented GR-mediated negative feedback regulation of CRH transcription and release in broiler chicks. Furthermore, fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene was also more highly expressed in hypothalamus of broiler chicks (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the genes related to energy homeostasis and obesity, such as GR, CRH and FTO, rather than orexigenic neuropeptides, are impacted by the genetic selection practices and play a role in breed-specific body weight setpoint regulation in the chicken. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

69749110788	Effects of selenium and methionine supplementation of breeder hen diets on selenium concentration and oxidative stability of lipids in the thigh muscles of progeny	The effects of dietary supplementation to female chickens with selenium (Se) and methionine (Met) on the next generation were studied. Lang-shan breeding hens (450) were obtained at 52 wk of age and randomly allotted to 9 treatments; 5 replicates of each treatment were carried out. The breeders were fed a basal corn-soybean meal diet (0.13 mg Se/kg) supplemented with 0, 0.30, or 0.60 mg/kg Se from Sel-Plex and 0.32%, 0.40%, or 0.54% Met for the 30-d adapting period and 70-d experiment period. Se and glutathione (GSH) concentrations, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, and the oxidative stability of muscular lipids of 90-d progeny were determined by testing the TBARS values. When breeders received the highest levels of Met or Se, GSH-Px activity was decreased, the Se concentration and the oxidative stability of muscular lipids were increased with the supplementation of Se or Met. When breeder hens were given a Met-deficient diet, supplementing with Se decreased the Se deposition in progeny thigh. With regard to lipid oxidation, 0.3 mg/kg maternal dietary Se supplementation decreased the oxidative stability of muscle lipid and 0.6 mg/kg Se supplementation showed no difference from the control. When breeders were fed a Se-deficient diet, the GSH-Px activity was increased significantly and the oxidative stability of progeny muscles was decreased with the supplementation of Met. It was concluded that supplementation of the maternal diet with higher Se and Met can increase Se deposition in progeny muscle and lead to more effective protection against lipid oxidation in progeny thighs. © 2009 Institute of Food Technologists®.

7044264869	Isolation and expression of novel expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from ovarian follicles of Shaoxing ducks	Three expressed sequence tags (ESTs), SXDF0201 (271 bp), SXDF0202 (200 bp) and SXDF0203 (173 bp), were isolated from ovarian follicles of Shaoxing ducks by using silver staining mRNA differential display. GenBank/BLAST analysis revealed that SXDF0201 was not homologous to any of the published sequences from all species, indicating that it was a novel EST and was then registered in GenBank (GenBank Accession No.: CB072629), while SXDF0202 and SXDF0203 were found to be highly homologous to seven known chicken ESTs and chicken mRNA for gizzard smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. 5′-RACE was employed to extend the SXDF0201 to 544 bp which was confirmed as novel in BLAST search. The temporal and spatial expression of SXDF0201 and SXDF0202 were also investigated with semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The result showed that: both SXDF0201 and SXDF0202 were found to be expressed in hypothalamus, pituitary, muscle, liver, and fat tissues of Shaoxing ducks; SXDF0201 was expressed significantly higher in ovaries of 30-day-old Shaoxing ducks compared with that of 60-day-old (P<0.05) and 90-day-old (P = 0.015), but the expression of SXDF0202 showed no difference throughout the ovarian development; granulose layers expressed higher SXDF0201 than theca layers in almost all hierarchical follicles, the expression of SXDF0202 in granulose layers increased along with follicular maturation (P<0.01) from F

One hundred and twenty Chinese inbred Langshan breeder hens were allocated randomly into two groups fed diets containing low (10%, LP) or normal (15%) crude protein levels. Low dietary protein did not affect the body weight of hens, but significantly decreased the laying rate and egg weight.

7644229255	Expression of GHR and PGC-1α in association with changes of MyHC isoform types in longissimus muscle of Erhualian and Large White pigs (Sus scrofa) during postnatal growth	Myofibre composition in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of Erhualian (EHL) and Large White (LW) pigs was investigated by determining the ratios of mRNA abundances of four myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms (MyHC I, MyHC 2a, MyHC 2x and MyHC 2b) using multiplex RT-PCR. The relationship between expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) mRNAs and changes of myofibre type composition during postnatal growth from 3 to 180 days of age were analysed. At 3 days of age, proportions of MyHC I, 2a and 2x fibres were high while only a few MyHC 2b fibres were differentiated. Dramatic changes were observed from day 3 to day 20 with significantly decreased MyHC I, 2a and 2x fibres but abrupt increases in MyHC 2b fibres in both breeds of pigs. Breed difference was exhibited only from day 90, with higher MyHC 2b but less MyHC I and 2a expression in LW pigs. Developmental pattern of GHR mRNA expression in LD muscle coincided with that of MyHC 2b, with LW pigs expressing higher abundance of GHR mRNA. PGC-1α mRNA expression followed distinct patterns in the two breeds of pigs, a higher level of PGC-1α mRNA being expressed in LD muscle of EHL pigs, the breed that possessed more oxidative fibres (MyHC I and MyHC 2a).

77949860250	Single molecule epigenetic analysis in a nanofluidic channel	Epigenetic states are governed by DNA methylation and a host of modifications to histones bound with DNA. These states are essential for proper developmentally regulated gene expression and are perturbed in many diseases. There is great interest in identifying epigenetic mark placement genome wide and understanding how these marks vary among cell types, with changes in environment or according to health and disease status. Current epigenomic analyses employ bisulfite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation, but query only one type of epigenetic mark at a time, DNA methylation, or histone modifications and often require substantial input material. To overcome these limitations, we established a method using nanofluidics and multicolor fluorescence microscopy to detect DNA and histones in individual chromatin fragments at about 10 Mbp/min. We demonstrated its utility for epigenetic analysis by identifying DNA methylation on individual molecules. This technique will provide the unprecedented opportunity for genome wide, simultaneous analysis of multiple epigenetic states on single molecules. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77951713634	Neonatal intramuscular injection of plasmid encoding glucagon-like peptide-1 affects anxiety behaviour and expression of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor in adolescent rats	Early-life endocrine intervention may programme hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and cause psychiatric disorders in later life. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been implicated in the regulation of neuroendocrine and behavioural responses, but it is yet to be determined whether and how neonatal GLP-1 overexpression may modify hippocampal GR expression and thus programme adolescent behaviour in rats. Two-dayold pups were injected intramuscularly with vacant plasmid (VP) or plasmid DNA encoding secretory GLP-1 (GP). Anxiety-related behaviour was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test at 8 weeks of age. Plasma corticosterone levels were measured with enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Protein and mRNA levels were determined by western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. The DNA methylation status of the GR exon 1

77953118184	Methionine and selenium yeast supplementation of the maternal diets affects antioxidant activity of breeding eggs	Four hundred fifty 52-wk-old Langshan layer hens (dual-purpose type, an indigenous poultry breed of China) were randomly divided into 9 treatments with 5 replicates in each treatment. Birds were fed corn-soybean diets (0.13 mg of Se/kg) supplemented with 0, 0.30, and 0.60 mg/kg of Se from Se yeast and 3.2, 4.0, and 5.4 g of dl-Met/kg, respectively. Increasing Se yeast supplementation significantly increased Se concentration in the egg yolk (P < 0.01) and the Se concentration of the 3.2 g of Met/kg treatment was higher than those of the 4.0 and 5.4 g of Met/kg treatments. Adding 0.3 mg of Se/kg to the diet significantly increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in the egg yolk compared with 0 and 0.6 mg of Se/kg (P < 0.01) and increasing Se yeast supplementation significantly increased the GSH-Px activity in the egg albumen (P < 0.01). Increasing Met supplementation significantly decreased the GSH-Px activity in both the yolk and the albumen of the eggs (P < 0.01). Methionine supplemented at 3.2 and 4.0 g/kg significantly increased glutathione concentration in the egg yolk compared with 5.4 g of Met/kg (P < 0.01) and increasing Met supplementation increased the glutathione concentration in the egg albumen. Increasing Met supplementation significantly decreased malondialdehyde concentration in the egg yolk (P < 0.01) and Se supplemented at 0 and 0.6 mg/kg increased the malondialdehyde concentrations in the egg yolk compared with 0.3 mg of Se/kg (P < 0.01). Methionine supplemented at 4.0 and 5.4 g/kg significantly decreased carbonyl concentration compared with 3.2 g of Met/kg. The conclusion was drawn that Se yeast and Met supplementation of the maternal diets could enhance antioxidant activity of breeding eggs. © 2010 Poultry Science Association Inc.

77957323536	Breed-specific expression of hippocampal 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and glucocorticoid receptors in Erhualian and Pietrain pigs exhibiting distinct stress coping characteristics	The hippocampusmay stimulate or inhibit the activity ofHPA axis tomaintain homeostasis during stress response, and its function is largely determined by the cytosol concentration of cortisol which is influenced by the balance between 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (11β-HSD1 and 2), as well as the number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor, GR and MR. However, it is unknown whether pigs exhibiting different stress coping characteristics display distinct patterns for hippocampal GR/MR and 11β-HSD1/2 expressions under both basal and stressed conditions. Therefore, 12 Erhualian (EHL) and 12 Pietrain (PIE) pigs were respectively allocated to control and 2 h transport groups and sacrificed to detect hippocampal expression of GR,MR, 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2mRNAs. Under basal conditions, EHL pigs exhibited higher GR, MR, and 11β-HSD1 but lower 11β-HSD2 in hippocampus compared with PIE pigs (P<0.05),which resulted in a significantly higher ratio of 11β-HSD1/11β-HSD2 (P<0.05). A significantly lower GR (P<0.05) and a tendency of lower MR (P=0.1) mRNA expression was detected in the transport group of EHL pigs compared with their control counterparts, resulting in an unalteredGR/MR ratio. In contrast, the transport group of PIE pigs exhibited a significantly higher GR/MR ratio (P<0.05). These results indicate a significant breed-specific hippocampal sensitivity or responsitivity to glucocorticoids, which may account, to some extent, for the different basal cortisol levels and stress coping characteristics of these two breeds of pigs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77958133842	Neonatal intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA encoding GLP-1 reduces serum insulin level and modifies skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain composition in adult rats	To test the hypothesis that neonatal GLP-1 exposure may program myosin heavy chain (MyHC) composition in adult skeletal muscle, two-day-old rats were transfected intramuscularly with vacant vector plasmid (VP), or recombinant plasmid expressing secretory GLP-1 at the doses of 60 μg (LG) and 120 μg (HG), respectively. Expression of GLP-1 mRNA was detected in muscles of both LG and HG rats 7 days after transfection, with more abundant GLP-1 transcript seen in LG rats. In accordance with the GLP-1 expression, LG rats demonstrated more significant responses to neonatal GLP-1 exposure. Small yet significant growth retardation was observed in LG rats, which is accompanied with significantly reduced serum insulin concentration at 8 weeks of age compared to VP rats. The responses of skeletal muscle were dependent on muscle type. Significant increase of PGC-1α and GLUT4 mRNA expression was detected in soleus of LG rats, whereas a MyHC type switch from II B to I was seen in gastrocnemius. These results indicate that neonatal exposure of healthy pups to ectopic GLP-1 causes growth retardation with decreased serum insulin as well as muscle type-dependent modifications in MyHC type composition and metabolic gene expression in adult rats. © 2010 Institute of Physiology v.v.i., Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.

77957297191	Curcumin attenuates the effects of transport stress on serum cortisol concentration, hippocampal NO production, and BDNF expression in the pig	Curcumin, the active component of curcuma longa, has been reported to be effective in alleviating chronic stress-induced disorders in rodents by modulating neuroprotection and neuroendocrine functions of the central nervous system, especially hippocampus. However, it is unclear whether curcumin can attenuate the subacute stress response induced by 2 h of road transport in the pig. Therefore, the present study was designed to identify the changes of serum cortisol concentration, hippocampal nitric oxide (NO) production, and related gene expression in response to 2 h of transport and to explore whether curcumin treatment (8 mg/kg, p.o.) for 21 d before transport may alleviate the stress-induced responses in the hippocampus of pigs. We found that 2 h of transport elevated serum cortisol concentration (P < 0.01), increased hippocampal NO content, and reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in pigs not treated with curcumin, whereas these stress responses were all reversed or attenuated in curcumin-treated pigs. In addition, the stress-induced increase in the expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) and enzyme activities of total NOS, cNOS, and inducible NOS (iNOS) was also reversed or attenuated in curcumin-treated pigs. However, neither transport nor curcumin caused significant alterations in hippocampal expression of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and type 2 (11β-HSD1 and 2), glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (GR and MR), or pro-/anti-apoptotic molecules (Bax-α and Bcl-xL). These results suggest that curcumin can alleviate subacute stress response in pigs through its neuroprotective effects on modulating hippocampal NO production and BDNF expression. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78049319784	Effect of early feed restriction on hepatic lipid metabolism and expression of lipogenic genes in broiler chickens	The study was conducted to investigate the effect of early feed restriction (ER) on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function in the liver of broiler chickens. Newly hatched broiler chickens were randomly allocated into control and ER group which was subjected to feed restriction with feed provided on alternate days from hatch to 14 days of age (14 d), followed by ad libitum feeding until the end of the experiment on 63 d. ER group exhibited significantly lower body weight throughout the experiment. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) were significantly higher in ER group at 14 d (P< 0.05), and the higher serum TC level in ER group was also observed at 63 d. In contrast, the contents of triglyceride (TG), TC and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in liver were significantly lower in ER group at 14 d (P< 0.05). At 14 d no significant difference was detected for the mRNA expression of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACC-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α (PPAR-α) between control and ER group. At 63 d ACC-α mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated accompanied with a significantly up-regulated CPT-ImRNA and a decreased tendency of SREBP-1c mRNA expression in ER group (P= 0.09). Swollen mitochondria with fragmented and reduced cristae were observed in liver of ER group at 14 d. Meanwhile the inner mitochondria membrane viscidity increased and hepatic mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased at 14 d. The results suggest that feed restriction at early postnatal stage may produce long-term effect on lipid metabolism of broiler chicken, probably through, at least in part, alterations in mitochondria morphology and function. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Four hundred and fifty hens were randomly divided into nine treatments with five replicates each treatment and fed 1 of 9 corn soybean diets with 0, 0.30 and 0.60mg Se/kg from Se-yeast and 3.2, 4.0 and 5.4g Met/kg from DL-methionine, respectively. After incubation, 250 chickens each treatment were randomly divided into five replicates and fed the same diet. At 21 days old, two male chicks each replicate were slaughtered. The Met and Se supplementations of the hen diets increased the muscle tissue Se content and decreased disulfide bond and protein carbonyl contents in the muscle. The higher levels of Met and Se (5.4g/kg Met and 0.60mg/kg Se) significantly increased reactive sulfhydryl content in the muscle. The intermediate levels of Met and Se (4.0g/kg Met and 0.30mg/kg Se) significantly increased gel hardness and water-holding capacity of the gel and the higher levels of Met and Se (5.4g/kg Met and 0.60mg/kg Se) decreased gel hardness and water-holding capacity of the gel to an extent. The conclusion was drawn that 0.30mg/kg Se and 4.0mg/kg Met supplementations of the hen diets could improve the protein gel and antioxidant properties in the chick to an extent. © 2010, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Pigs were assessed after 1, 2 and 4. h of transportation (n= 5 per group), with normal housing conditions as a control (n= 4). Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 were highest at 1. h, whereas concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly decreased at 4. h. Expression of these three cytokines and their receptors was also significantly altered in the thymus during transportation stress. Serum IL-10 concentrations and thymus IL-10 mRNA expression were significantly correlated.

After hatch, chickens were fed under the same conditions and slaughtered at 49 days of age for sample collection and analysis. The results showed that body weight and composition were marginally affected by Eq administration (P > 0.05). Compared with their male counterparts, the meat quality of female broilers was affected greatly after Eq administration. The redness (a*) of meat color in the L and H groups of female broilers was significantly decreased by 24.10% and 21.50% (P < 0.01), respectively; cooking loss decreased by 12.11% and 16.82%, respectively, in the L and H groups (P < 0.01); 24 h and 48 h drip loss was significantly decreased by 60.27% and 45.72% (P < 0.05), respectively, in the H group. However, for male broilers, only cooking loss was significantly decreased by high dosage of Eq treatment (P < 0.05). The antioxidative status was analyzed for discovering further the mechanism behind the improvement of the water-holding capacity caused by Eq in female broilers. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) in plasma was greatly increased by 15.94% in the L group (P < 0.01), whereas the total superoxide dismutase activity (T-SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde in plasma were not changed (P > 0.05). The T-SOD activity in the breast muscle of the L and H groups were significantly improved by 23.14% and 18.82% (P < 0.05), respectively. GSHPx in the breast muscle of the H group showed a tendency to increase (P = 0.06 < 0.1). These results indicate that Eq injection in ovo does not affect the growth of broilers, but significantly improves the water-holding capacity of the muscle, especially in female broilers, which is related to the improvement of antioxidative status. © The Animal Consortium 2010.

0036084229	The developmental patterns of GHr gene expression in gastric tissue of Erhualian and Large White pigs	Pituitary growth hormone (GH) is essential for postnatal growth in animal, it regulates numerous cellular functions by direct effect on it's receptor (GHr) in many different tissues. And it is believed that the abundance of GHr in different tissue determines the tissue sensitivity to GH. However, the regulation of GH on porcine stomach development is still unknown. So, in present experiment single tube semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to investigate the developmental patterns of gastric GHr mRNA expression in Large White and Erhualian Boars, and the Classic 18S internal standards (Ambion Inc. USA) was used. Pigs were sampled at birth, and 3, 20, 30, 45, 90, 120, 180 days of age respectively, meanwhile the bodyweight and gastric weight were recorded. The results indicated that the expression of gastric GHr mRNA was high at birth, followed by a significantly decrease (P < 0.05) at 3 days of age (D3) in both breeds. In Erhualian boars, GHr mRNA expression reached a peak at D45, then remarkablely declined till D90 (P < 0.05), and kept constant thereafter. In Large White boars, however, the expression of GHr mRNA reached a peak at D90 and remained pleateau afterwards. From birth to D30, the GHr mRNA expression was higher in Erhualian than that in Large White, the significant strain difference were founded at D20 (P < 0.05). But from D30 to D180, the higher expression was found in Large white, the significant strain difference was especially at D90 (P < 0.05). Significant positive correlation was found between the expression of GHr mRNA and the ratio of gastric weight to bodyweight from birth to D180 (r = 0.54, P < 0.05). The results suggest that, (1) GHr mRNA in porcine stomach is expressed according a strain specific development pattern; (2) GH directly acts at the gastric tissue and regulates it's growth. The relationship between GH and the development of gastric function is to be elucidated.

GLP-1 is an intestinal peptide that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle; however, the effects of its two analogs (Ex-4 and Ex-9) on myofiber properties are still unclear. Here, we report the effects of Ex-4 and Ex-9 alone or in combination on the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) type composition and the glucose uptake capacity in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. Neither Ex-4 nor Ex-9 altered basal glucose uptake, whereas Ex-9 significantly increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, suggesting enhanced insulin sensitivity. The mRNA expression of MyHC I and 2A as well as the percentage of MyHC I protein was remarkably increased in Ex-9-treated myotubes. In contrast, Ex-4, alone or in combination with Ex-9, caused a significant reduction in MyHC 2A mRNA expression and the percentage of MyHC I protein. Consistent with the MyHC type switching peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α expression in myotubes was remarkably increased by Ex-9 yet was significantly inhibited by Ex-4. In addition, intracellular concentrations of free Ca

79960145205	Maternal dietary protein affects transcriptional regulation of myostatin gene distinctively at weaning and finishing stages in skeletal muscle of Meishan pigs	Myostatin (MSTN) is suggested to mediate the effect of maternal nutrition on offspring phenotype, yet the mechanisms underlying such adaptive gene regulation is elusive. In this study, we determined the effects of maternal dietary protein on transcriptional regulation of MSTN in skeletal muscle of pig offspring. Fourteen Meishan sows were fed either lowprotein (LP) or standard-protein (SP) diets throughout gestation and lactation. MSTN expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle was determined both at weaning and finishing stages. Myostatin mRNA abundance was downregulated at weaning, but upregulated at finishing in LP pigs, indicating stage-specific transcriptional regulation. At weaning, CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein b (C/EBPβ) in muscle nuclear lysate was decreased in LP piglets, associated with diminished binding of C/EBPβ to all the three putative binding sites in MSTN promoter. None of the four histone modification marks investigated showed differences between SP and LP piglets. Among 12 microRNAs predicted to target MSTN, none was expressed differently. At finishing stage, C/EBPβ content remained unchanged, but the binding of C/EBPβ to two of the three putative binding sites increased in LP pigs. Histone H3 acetylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation on MSTN promoter were increased, while histone H3 lysine 9 monomethylation was decreased in LP pigs. Moreover, expression of ssc-miR-136 and ssc-miR-500 was significantly reduced. These results indicate that maternal dietary protein affects MSTN expression through distinct regulatory mechanisms at different stages. The immediate effect at weaning is mediated by C/EBPβ binding without epigenetic modifications, whereas the long-term effect at finishing stage involves both C/EBPβ binding and epigenetic regulations, including histone modification and microRNA expression. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

79960698974	Leptin stimulates hepatic activation of thyroid hormones and promotes early posthatch growth in the chicken	Hepatic iodothyronine deiodinases (Ds) are involved in the conversion of thyroid hormones (THs) which interacts with growth hormone (GH) to regulate posthatch growth in the chicken. Previous studies suggest that leptin-like immunoreactive substance deposited in the egg may serve as a maternal signal to program posthatch growth. To test the hypothesis that maternal leptin may affect early posthatch growth through modifying hepatic activation of THs, we injected 5.0 μg of recombinant murine leptin into the albumen of breeder eggs before incubation. Furthermore, chicken embryo hepatocytes (CEHs) were treated with leptin in vitro to reveal the direct effect of leptin on expression and activity of Ds. In ovo leptin administration markedly accelerated early posthatch growth, elevated serum levels of total and free triiodothyronine (tT3 and fT3), while that of total thyroxin (tT4) remained unchanged. Hepatic mRNA expression and activity of D1 which converts T4 to T3 or rT3 to T2, were significantly increased in leptin-treated chickens, while those of D3 which converts T3 to T2 or T4 to rT3, were significantly decreased. Moreover, hepatic expression of GHR and IGF-I mRNA was all up-regulated in leptin-treated chickens. Males demonstrated more pronounced responses. A direct effect of leptin on Ds was shown in CEHs cultured in vitro. Expression and activity of D1 were increased, whereas those of D3 were decreased, in leptin-treated cells. These data suggest that in ovo leptin administration improves early posthatch growth, in a gender-specific fashion, probably through improving hepatic activation of THs and up-regulating hepatic expression of GHR and IGF-I. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79961208077	Trans-18:1 and CLA isomers in rumen and duodenal digesta of bulls fed n-3 and n-6 PUFA-based diets	The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of n-6 PUFA (maize silage/grass silage, soybean meal and soybean oil, control) and n-3 PUFA (grass silage, rapeseed cake and rapeseed oil, experiment) based diets on the occurrence of rumen- and duodenal digesta trans-C18:1 and CLA isomers of German Simmental bulls. The results based on rumen and duodenal digesta samples immediately taken from the bulls just after slaughter. The diet affected the occurrence of individual trans-C18:1 and CLA isomers in the rumen and duodenal digesta in different ways. The isomer trans-11,cis-13 CLA was detected as the most abundant isomer in the rumen of n-3 PUFA based diet fed bulls compared to n-6 PUFA based diet fed bulls. The trans-7,cis-9 CLA isomer was not detected in the rumen samples of bulls fed both diets, however abundant trans-7,cis-9 CLA was identified and quantified in the duodenum digesta. Both the concentration of the sum of trans-18:1 fatty acids and individual isomers in the rumen were not affected by the diet, except trans-16-18:1. The concentration of trans-16-18:1 was significantly decreased in the rumen of n-3 PUFA supplemented-fed bulls compared to n-6 PUFA supplemented-fed bulls. © 2011 AOCS.

80051783336	Effect of glucocorticoids pretreatment on steroidogenic capacity of adrenocortical cells isolated from Meishan piglets	The present in vitro experiment was designed to test whether 48 h of pretreatment with glucocorticoids, cortisol, or dexamethasone (DEX), would affect basal and corticotrophin (ACTH) stimulated (24 h) cortisol secretion from primary cultures of pig adrenocortical cells. Cells were divided into six groups: control pretreatment with or without ACTH challenge, cortisol pretreatment with or without ACTH challenge, and DEX pretreatment with or without ACTH. The culture medium and cells were collected at the end of treatment. Cortisol concentration in medium was measured by radioimmunoassay, and protein content of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and key regulatory factors for steroidogenesis, including melanocortin type 2 receptor (MC2R), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc), were detected by Western blot analysis. The results showed that glucocorticoid pretreatment did not affect cortisol secretion under basal condition without ACTH challenge, but significantly enhanced ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion. Furthermore, the protein content of GR, MC2R, StAR, and P450scc was all increased in groups pretreated with glucocorticoids. These results indicate that adrenocortical cells pretreated with glucocorticoids display higher steroidogenic capacity under ACTH challenge, through the upregulation of GR and other steroidogenic regulatory factors. © 2011 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

80053093437	Changes of hypothalamic GnRH-I, POMC and NPY mRNA expression and serum IGF-I and leptin concentrations during maturation of shaoxing ducks (Anas platyrhynchos)	Sexual maturity in poultry is controlled by a complex neural circuit located in the basal forebrain, which integrates the central and peripheral signals to activate hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. This study demonstrated the changes of GnRH-I, POMC and NPY mRNA transcription in hypothalamus and IGF-I and leptin levels in serum of Shaoxing ducks during puberty. Body weight increased progressively from d30 to d120 and at d120 the flock reached 5% of laying rate. A significant upregulation of hypothalamic GnRH-I mRNA expression was observed from d60, reaching the peak at d120. POMC and NPY mRNA expression in hypothalamus showed a similar pattern, which increased from d30 to d60, followed by a significant decrease towards sexual maturity. Serum IGF-I levels exhibited two peaks at d30 and d120, respectively. Serum leptin displayed a single peak at d90. The results indicate that the down-regulation of POMC and NPY genes in hypothalamus coincides with the up-regulation of GnRH-I gene to initiate sexual maturation in ducks. In addition, peripheral IGF-I and leptin may relay the peripheral metabolic status to the central system and contribute to the initiation of the reproductive function in ducks.

84859916524	Breed-specific patterns of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucocorticoid action in pigs	In the present study, Erhualian and Pietrain pigs were employed to investigate the breedspecific patterns of hepatic gluconeogenesis by detecting the related enzyme mRNA expression, and to analyse the relationship with the hepatic glucocorticoid receptors and 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) expression. Furthermore, hepatic DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression was determined to detect DNA methyltransferase state difference between the two breeds. The results demonstrated that the Erhualian pigs exhibited significantly lower plasma lactate acid concentration, but higher liver lactate acid content than the Pietrain pigs. A significantly higher expression of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBP) and the mitochondria phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2) mRNA were observed in Erhualian pigs. The Erhualian pigs demonstrated a significantly higher expression of glucocorticoid receptor and 11β-HSD1 mRNA than the Pietrain pigs, though there was no difference in the hepatic cortisol content between the two breeds. The hepatic DNMT1 mRNA expression in the Erhualian pigs was significantly lower, and the DNMT1 protein content in Erhualian pigs tended to be decreased compared with Pietrain pigs (P=0.066). The results suggest that the Erhualian pigs demonstrated higher hepatic gluconeogenesis capacity in comparison to the Pietrain pigs. The up-regulation of hepatic glucocorticoid receptor and 11β-HSD1 expression may be involved in the enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis in Erhualian pigs. Moreover, the down-regulation of DNMT1 in Erhualian pigs implies possible involvement of DNA methylation in a breed-specific pattern of hepatic gluconeogenesis. © Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology, Dummerstorf, Germany.

84860826824	A semi-quantitative assay of overall DNA methylation status using Methyl-CpG binding protein (MBD1)	Background: In mammals, DNA methylation at the 5-position of cytosine is the most essential epigenetic modification. Changes in the level of genome-wide DNA methylation (also known as overall DNA methylation) are associated with alterations in gene expression, thereby contributing to the phenotypic and physiological diversity. Current technologies for detecting overall DNA methylation either suffer from low sensitivity or require sophisticated equipment. Studies on domestic animals are hampered by the lack of complete and annotated genomic information. Results: Here we report a rapid slot blot method using methyl-CpG binding protein (MBD1) to exam the level of overall DNA methylation in pigs and chickens. Using this rapid approach, we determined the methylation status in various DNA samples of a Chinese indigenous (Erhualian) and a Western (Large White) breed of pigs. We also chose day 18 embryos (E18) and newly hatched chicks (D1) of a Chinese indigenous chicken breed (Wens yellow-feathered broiler chicken) for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. The results revealed tissue- and breed-specific differences, as well as age-dependent variations, in the level of overall DNA methylation. Conclusion: The results showed that the slot blot assay is a sensitive, highly specific and convenient method for semi-quantitative estimation of overall DNA methylation with no species specificity. This method does not require sophisticated equipment, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or expensive technologies like sequencing, thus providing a useful tool for overall DNA methylation studies on domestic animals. © 2012 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862796409	Cysteamine improves growth performance and gastric ghrelin expression in preweaning piglets	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of cysteamine on growth performance of preweaning piglets and gastric expression of ghrelin mRNA in vivo and in vitro. Twelve litters of newborn piglets were allocated randomly to control and treatment groups. From 15 d of age, piglets in the control group were fed basal creep diet, whereas the treatment group received basal diet supplemented with 120 mg cysteamine per kg of diet until weaning on 35 d of age. Body weight gain, creep feed consumption, and diarrhea rates were recorded, and gastric mucosal tissues were collected for quantifying mRNA expression. To evaluate the direct effect of cysteamine on gastric ghrelin expression, primary cultures of gastric mucosal cells isolated from 35-d-old piglets were exposed to cysteamine for 20 h at 0, 1, 10, and 100 μg/mL, respectively. Dietary cysteamine increased (P < 0.05) average daily creep feed consumption and BW gain in preweaning pigs, which was accompanied by reduction in diarrhea rates. At 35 d of age, piglets treated with cysteamine showed increased (P < 0.05) ghrelin and gastrin and decreased (P < 0.05) somatostatin mRNA expression in gastric mucosa. Moreover, dietary cysteamine treatment increased serum concentration of gastrin (P < 0.05). In vitro, cysteamine significantly increased ghrelin mRNA expression in gastric mucosal cells at the concentration of 10 μg/mL. In conclusion, dietary cysteamine is effective in improving the growth performance and health condition of preweaning piglets, which is associated with its stimulatory effects on gastric ghrelin mRNA expression both in vivo and in vitro. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862173714	Coordinated miRNA/mRNA expression profiles for understanding breed-specific metabolic characters of liver between Erhualian and large white pigs	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of various metabolic processes in the liver, yet little is known on the breed-specific expression profiles of miRNAs in coordination with those of mRNAs. Here we used two breeds of male newborn piglets with distinct metabolic characteristics, Large White (LW) and Erhualian (EHL), to delineate the hepatic expression profiles of mRNA with microarray and miRNAs with both deep sequencing and microarray, and to analyze the functional relevance of integrated miRNA and mRNA expression in relation to the physiological and biochemical parameters. EHL had significantly lower body weight and liver weight at birth, but showed elevated serum levels of total cholesterol (TCH), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), as well as higher liver content of cholesterol. Higher serum cortisol and lower serum insulin and leptin were also observed in EHL piglets. Compared to LW, 30 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated miRNAs were identified in the liver of EHL, together with 298 up-regulated and 510 down-regulated mRNAs (FDR<10%). RT-PCR validation of some differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) further confirmed the high-throughput data analysis. Using a target prediction algorithm, we found significant correlation between the up-regulated miRNAs and down-regulated mRNAs. Moreover, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which are involved in proteolysis, were predicted to be mediated by DEMs. These findings provide new information on the miRNA and mRNA profiles in porcine liver, which would shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the breed-specific traits in the pig, and may serve as a basis for further investigation into the biological functions of miRNAs in porcine liver. © 2012 Li et al.

84862230155	Gene expression of calpain 3 and PGC-1α is correlated with meat tenderness in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Sutai pigs	To investigate the effects of skeletal muscle characteristics on meat tenderness, meat quality of a total of 100 Sutai pigs was evaluated in the present study. Myofibre composition in longissimus dorsi (LD) was investigated by determining the ratios of mRNA abundance of four myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms (MyHC I, IIa, IIx and IIb) to detect the influence of myofibre type on meat tenderness. The expression of candidate genes was analysed to elucidate their possible relationship with meat tenderness. The results showed that under the same tenderization condition in the same breed of pigs, meat tenderness demonstrated the largest amount of variation compared with other meat traits. The proportion of MyHC I fibres was significantly higher in the lowest shear force group, whereas the proportions of MyHC IIa, IIb, IIx fibres did not differ significantly between the two extreme meat tenderness groups. The mRNA expression of myostatin, myogenin, myoD and growth hormone receptor (GHR) genes also did not significantly differ between the two tenderness groups. However, the mRNA expression of calpain 3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) changed with the shear force, showing a negative correlation with the shear force (r=-0.38 and -0.65, respectively, P<0.05). Our results showed that the increased percentage of myofibre type I and high expression of calpain 3 and PGC-1α are positively related to meat tenderness. The results provide useful data for meat tenderness selection in pig breeding. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

84862767314	Low amino acids affect expression of 11b-HSD2 in BeWo cells through leptin-activated JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways	Maternal protein restriction diminishes placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β- HSD2) activity and causes fetal growth restriction in mammals. However, it is unknown whether such effect was caused directly by nutrient deficiency, or indirectly through the mediation of maternal hormones. In the present study, a human placental cell line (BeWo) was cultured in F12K as control and F12 as low amino acids (LAA) media for 48 h to investigate the effects of amino acids deficiency on 11β- HSD2 expression and activity. Despite a significant upregulation of 11β-HSD2 mRNA expression in LAA cells, 11β-HSD2 activity and protein content were decreased by 38 and 54%, respectively (P<0.05), indicating a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation. Among 5 miRNAs targeting 11β-HSD2, miR-498 was expressed significantly higher in LAA cells. Leptin concentration was significantly lower (P<0.01) in LAA medium. The mRNA expression of both isoforms of leptin receptor was significantly higher in LAA cells, although no difference was detected at protein level. To further clarify whether leptin is involved in mediating the effect of LAA on 11β-HSD2 activity, leptin was supplemented to LAA medium, whereas three specific inhibitors of leptin signaling pathways, WP1066 for JAKSTAT, PD98059 for MAPK and LY294002 for PI3K, respectively were added to control medium. Leptin restored the diminished 11β-HSD2 activity in LAA cells, whereas WP1066 (5 nM) and PD98059 (50 nM) significantly decreased 11β-HSD2 activity in control cells. In conclusion, the present results indicate that LAA diminishes 11β-HSD2 expression and activity in BeWo cells through leptin-activated JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84862784298	In ovo leptin administration inhibits chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis in female chicken embryos through the STAT3-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway	Previous studies indicate that leptin regulates placental angiogenesis and fetal growth in mammals and that in ovo leptin administration affects embryonic development and hatch weight in the chicken. To test the hypothesis that leptin affects embryonic growth through modifying chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis, we injected 0.5 μg of recombinant murine leptin into the albumen of fertilized eggs before incubation. On embryonic day 12 (E12), the number and the total area of blood vessels on CAM were measured, and expression of genes involved in angiogenesis was quantitated to show the possible mechanisms. Leptin in ovo administration decreased (P < 0.05) both the total area of blood vessels and the number of small-sized capillaries on CAM of E12 female chicken embryos, which coincided with significantly decreased (P < 0.05) embryo weight on E12 and BW at hatching. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthases (iNOS and eNOS) were all downregulated (P<0.05) inCAMboth at themRNAand protein/activity levels with reduced (P < 0.05) nitric oxide (NO) concentration in chorioallantoic fluid of female embryos. Furthermore, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) was found to be diminished (P<0.05) both at themRNAand protein levels and associated with decreased (P<0.05) binding of STAT3 to VEGF promotor in the CAM of leptin-treated E12 female embryos. These data suggest that in ovo leptin administration affects CAM angiogenesis and embryo growth in female chicken embryos, probably through STAT3-mediated VEGF/NO pathways. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84863609998	Breed-dependent transcriptional regulation of 5′-untranslated GR (NR3C1) exon 1 mRNA variants in the liver of newborn piglets	Glucocorticoids are vital for life and regulate an array of physiological functions by binding to the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR, also known as NR3C1). Previous studies demonstrate striking breed differences in plasma cortisol levels in pigs. However, investigation into the breed-dependent GR transcriptional regulation is hampered by lacking porcine GR promoter information. In this study, we sequenced 5.3 kb upstream of the translation start codon of the porcine GR gene, and identified seven alternative 5′-untranslated exons 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9,10 and 1-11. Among all these mRNA variants, exons 1-4 and 1-5, as well as the total GR were expressed significantly (P<0.05) higher in the liver of newborn piglets of Large White (LW) compared with Erhualian, a Chinese indigenous breed. Overall level of CpG methylation in the region flanking exons 1-4 and 1-5 did not show breed difference. However, nuclear content of Sp1, p-CREB and GR in the liver was significantly (P<0.05) higher in LW piglets, associated with enhanced binding of p-CREB, and higher level of histone H3 acetylation in 1-4 and 1-5 promoters. In contrast, GR binding to promoters of exons 1-4 and 1-5 was significantly diminished in LW piglets, implicating the presence of negative GREs. These results indicate that the difference in the hepatic expression of GR transcript variants between two breeds of pigs is determined, at least partly, by the disparity in the binding of transcription factors and the enrichment of histone H3 acetylation to the promoters. © 2012 Zou et al.

84864335081	The effect of equol injection in ovo on lipid metabolism and hepatic lipogenic gene expression in broilers	This study investigated the effects of in ovo administration of equol (Eq) on post-hatch growth and hepatic lipid metabolism in broiler chickens. Fertilized eggs (146 eggs/group) were injected with 0 μg (control, Con), 20 μg (low dose, L) and 100 μg (high dose, H) Eq in the albumen on the 7th day of incubation. Except a trend increase in the weight of total fat (P = 0.09), Eq had no effect on growth or liver weight in broilers at 49 days of age. Males presented higher liver and BWs and lower total fat and relative liver weights than females (P < 0.01). However, there were no significant effects of Eq or Eq-gender interactions on growth performance or tissues weight (P > 0.05). With respect to lipid parameters in the serum, the results showed that female broilers presented higher triacyglycerol (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations than males, whereas there was no gender difference in serum total cholesterol (TC) or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) concentration (P > 0.05). Eq administration significantly decreased serum TG and TC but increased HDLC concentrations in serum of broilers at 49 days of age (P < 0.05), whereas there were no interactions between gender and Eq (P > 0.05). To elucidate the mechanism behind the significant changes of serum TG and TC levels, the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver was investigated in female chickens using reverse transcription-PCR. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPTI) messenger RNA (mRNA) was significantly upregulated by 20 and 100 μg Eq (P < 0.05). High-dose Eq significantly decreased fatty acid synthase (FAS) and enhanced cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA levels in the liver (P < 0.05). Eq had no significant effects on acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, malic enzyme, low-density lipoprotein receptor or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase mRNA in the liver (P > 0.05). These results in female broilers suggest that Eq decreased blood TG by upregulating CPTI and downregulating FAS mRNA expression in the liver, and that high serum cholesterol levels stimulated CYP7A1 gene transcription in the liver. © The Animal Consortium 2011.

84865986400	Effect of dietary daidzein supplementation on egg laying rate was associated with the change of hepatic VTG-II mRNA expression and higher antioxidant activities during the post-peak egg laying period of broiler breeders	Daidzein, a soy phytoestrogen, is a powerful antioxidant and has multiple biological activities. In this study, the improvement of egg laying rate by feeding daidzein was confirmed again in broiler breeder hens during post-peak egg laying stages, and the mechanism underlying this process was elucidated by the changes of relevant genes expression and the antioxidant status in liver. Three hundred 460-day-old broiler breeders were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups (100 birds/10 replicates/group) and were fed a basal diet (control, Con) or the basal diet supplemented with either 5 (low dosage, L) or 10. mg (high dosage, H) of daidzein per kg of diet. After one week adaptation to dietary daidzein, the experiment lasted for 15 days. Both low and high dosage of daidzein supplementation significantly increased the egg-laying rate (P<0.05), but did not change (P>0.05) body weight, oviduct weight, small follicles weight or the number of preovulatory follicles. Serum estrogen showed dose-dependent decrease by daidzein treatment and reached the statistical significance in H group (P<0.05). Serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations were not altered by daidzein (P>0.05). Daidzein reduced serum malondialdehyde content (P<0.05). In liver, total antioxidant capacity was greatly increased by daidzein (P<0.05), and the activity of glutathione-peroxidase was increased by high level of daidzein treatment (P<0.05), while the activity of superoxide dismutase and the content of malondialdehyde in liver were not changed by daidzein (P>0.05). Real-time PCR analysis showed that, in parallel with the increase of egg laying rate, down-regulation of vitellogenin-II and up-regulation of estrogen receptor β mRNA expression in liver were observed in daidzein treated hens (P<0.05), while estrogen receptor α gene transcription was not affected (P>0.05). The results indicate that dietary daidzein supplementation improves egg-laying rate by increasing the antioxidant capacity and changing the relevant genes transcription in liver of broilers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84866288630	Maternal low-protein diet induces gender-dependent changes in epigenetic regulation of the glucose-6-phosphatase gene in newborn piglet liver	Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) plays an important role in glucose homeostasis because it catalyzes the final steps of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Maternal malnutrition during pregnancy affects G6PC activity, yet it is unknown whether epigenetic regulations of the G6PC gene are also affected. In this study, we fed primiparous, purebred Meishan sows either standard-protein (SP; 12% crude protein) or low-protein (LP; 6% crude protein) diets throughout gestation and analyzed hepatic G6PC expression in both male and female newborn piglets. The epigenetic regulation of G6PC, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and micro RNA (miRNA), was determined to reveal potential mechanisms. Male, but not female, LP piglets had a significantly lower serum glucose concentration and greater hepatic G6PC mRNA expression and enzyme activity. Also, in LP males, glucocorticoid receptor binding to the G6PC promoter was lower compared with SP males, which was accompanied by hypomethylation of the G6PC promoter. Modifications in histones also were gender dependent; LP males had less histone H3 and histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation and more histone H3 acetylation and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation on the G6PC promoter compared with the SP males, whereas LP females had more H3 and greater H3 methylation compared with their SP counterparts. Moreover, two miRNA, ssc-miR-339-5p and ssc-miR-532-3p, targeting the G6PC 3' untranslated region were significantly upregulated by the LP diet only in females. These results suggest that a maternal LP diet during pregnancy causes hepatic activation of G6PC gene expression in male piglets, which possibly contributes to adult-onset hyperglycemia. © 2012 American Society for Nutrition.

0037700436	The developmental patterns of GH-R, IGF-1 and IGF-IR gene expression in adipose tissue of Erhualian and large white pigs	Growth hormone (GH) is essential for postnatal growth in animal, it regulates numerous cellular functions by direct effect on its receptor (GH-R) in many different tissues. In present experiment single tube semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to investigate the developmental patterns of GH-R, IGF-1 and IGF- I R mRNA expression in dorsal subcutaneous adipose tissue of Erhualian and Large White pigs, and 18S internal standards were used as control. Eight Erhualian pigs were sampled at birth, 3, 20, 30, 45, 90, 120, 180 days of age respectively, four Large White boars were sampled at 20, 30, 90, 120, 180 days of age respectively. The results showed that GH-R mRNA levels in adipose tissue were changed with age (P < 0.05). The expression of GH-R mRNA in Erhualian gilts was low at birth but reached a peak at 45 days of age, and kept constant thereafter. The expression of GH-R mRNA in Erhualian boars was high at birth and reached a peak at 45 day, then decreased remarkably. It had no differences between sexes in general. The expression of GH-R mRNA in Large White boars was lower than that in Erhualian boars (P < 0.01). The IGF-1 mRNA expression in adipose tissue was changed with age. The IGF-1 mRNA expression in Erhualian gilts was lower than that in Erhualian boars (P < 0.05), and the IGF-1 mRNA expression in Large White boars was lower than that in Erhualian boars (P < 0.01). The IGF- I R mRNA expression in adipose tissue was changed with aging, but it had no differences between sexes and breeds in general. The results suggest that the GH-R, IGF-1 and IGF- I R mRNA expression in adipose tissue follow specificdevelopmental pattern, and the different patterns of IGF-1 gene expression may contribute to different sediment of adipose tissue between two breeds.

The single tube semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied in this experiment to investigate the developmental patterns of gastric GHr and SS mRNA expression, the correlations between the patterns of mRNA expression and the relative gastric weight (ratio of gastric weight to bodyweight) and the pepsin contents in gastric mucous membrane were analyzed. In order to further elucidate the effect of GH on gastric function, the primary cultures of gastric fundic mucosal cells were treated with 2 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml of rpGH for 18 hrs respectively, and the pepsin contents in culture medium were measured. Results: The expression of GHr mRNA was high at birth, followed by a significant decrease at 3 days of age (D3) in both breeds. In Large White boars, the expression of GHr mRNA reached a peak at D90 and remained a plateau afterward. In Erhualian pigs, however, a slight yet significant increase occurred at D30 reaching a level that was kept constant thereafter. From birth to D30, the expression of GHr mRNA in gastric tissue was higher in Erhualian boars than that in Large White boars, but from D90 to D180, the higher expression of GHr mRNA was found in Large White boars. The gastric GHr mRNA expression was significantly correlated with the relative gastric weight (r=0.541, P<0.05) and pepsin content in gastric mucosa (r=0.625, P<0.05) respectively. The gastric SS mRNA expression was high at birth (Erhualian 1.59, Large White 0.80), but dropped significantly at D3 (Erhualian 0.95, Large White 0.19, P<0.05), a stepwise increase was followed thereafter until a peak at D30 (Erhualian 1.71, Large White 0.95) In general, Erhualian pigs expressed higher levels of SS mRNA in gastric tissue as compared with Large White pigs at the same age (P<0.05). No significant correlations between SS mRNA and relative gastric weight or pepsin content were found. In vitro, 2 ng/ml of rpGH elicited significant increase in pepsin secretion from primary cultures of gastric mucosal cells (P<0.05), and no responses were observed at 20 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml. Conclusion: The results suggested that: 1, GHr and SS mRNA in porcine stomach are expressed according to strain specific developmental patterns; 2, GH acts directly at the gastric tissue and regulates the structural and functional growth of stomach.

84866406290	Chicken FTO gene: Tissue-specific expression, brain distribution, breed difference and effect of fasting	Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is widely expressed in central and peripheral tissues of mammals, and exhibits a range of functions, especially in energy balance. However, basic knowledge of FTO in the chicken is lacking. Therefore, we studied the tissue distribution, age and breed dependent changes, brain localization, as well as the impact of fasting on FTO mRNA expression in the chicken. FTO mRNA was expressed in all the tissues studied, and generally, with high expression in hypothalamus, liver, visceral fat and cerebellum. However it exhibited breed-specific patterns: in broilers, the highest expression was seen in the liver, while in layers, hypothalamus and cerebellum showed relatively higher FTO mRNA expression. One-week-old broilers expressed markedly higher FTO mRNA in liver compared with the layers of the same age (P<0.01), while the breed difference was reversed in visceral fat and cerebellum (P<0.05). Compared with newly hatched chicks (one week of age), adult layers expressed higher FTO mRNA in liver and visceral fat, while adult broilers showed higher expression in hypothalamus and cerebellum. In situ hybridization demonstrated distribution of FTO mRNA in paraventricularis magnocellularis (PVN), nucleus ventromedialis hypothalami (VMN), nucleus lateralis hypothalami (LHy), nucleus dorsomedialis hypothalami (DMN) of the hypothalamus and nucleus habenularis medialis (HM) and stratum cellulare externum (SCE) of the thalamus. Breed-specific expression of FTO mRNA was shown in PVN, but not in VMN, with higher abundance in broilers compared to layers. The decrease in FTO mRNA levels after 24. h of fasting was seen only in VMN of layer chickens. These results may provide some intriguing hints for further investigation of FTO function in the chicken. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84869084013	Maternal low-protein diet causes epigenetic deregulation of HMGCR and CYP7α1 in the liver of weaning piglets	To investigate the effect of maternal dietary protein on hepatic cholesterol metabolism in offspring pigs and to detect underlying epigenetic mechanisms, 14 primiparous purebred Meishan sows were fed standard-protein (SP, n=7) or low-protein (LP, 50% of SP, n=7) diets during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. LP piglets showed significantly lower body weight and liver weight at weaning, associated with decreased liver and serum cholesterol content. Hepatic SREBP2, HMGCR and CYP7α. 1 mRNA expressions were all up-regulated in LP piglets, as well as SREBP2 protein content and HMGCR enzyme activity, compared to SP piglets, while the mRNA expression of LDLR, FXR, LXR and CYP27α. 1 was not altered. Hepatic activation of HMGCR gene transcription in LP piglets was associated with promoter hypomethylation, together with decreased histone H3, H3 lysine 9 monomethylation (H3K9me1) and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and increased H3 acetylation. No CpG islands were predicted in the CYP7α. 1 promoter, and the augmented CYP7α. 1 transcription in LP piglets was associated with decreased H3, H3K9me1 and H3K27me3. No alterations were detected for hepatic expression of microRNAs predicted to target 3'-UTR of HMGCR or CYP7α. 1 gene. These results indicate that maternal low-protein diet during gestation and lactation affects hepatic cholesterol metabolism in weaning piglets by modifying the epigenetic regulation of HMGCR and CYP7α. 1 genes, which implicates possible long-term consequences in cholesterol homeostasis later in adult life. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84870238843	Differences in egg deposition of corticosterone and embryonic expression of corticosterone metabolic enzymes between slow and fast growing broiler chickens	Glucocorticoids (GCs) are vital for embryonic development and their bioactivity is regulated by the intracellular metabolism involving 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs) and 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20-HSD). Here we sought to reveal the differences in egg deposition of corticosterone and embryonic expression of corticosterone metabolic enzymes between slow and fast growing broiler chickens (Gallus gallus). Eggs of fast-growing breed contained significantly higher (P<. 0.05) corticosterone in the yolk and albumen, compared with that of a slow-growing breed. 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 were expressed in relatively higher abundance in the liver, kidney and intestine, following similar tissue-specific ontogenic patterns. In the liver, expression of both 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 was upregulated (P<. 0.05) towards hatching, yet 20-HSD displayed distinct pattern showing a significant decrease (P<. 0.05) on posthatch day 1 (D1). Hepatic mRNA expression of 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 was significantly higher in fast-growing chicken embryos at all the embryonic stages investigated and so was the hepatic protein content on embryonic day of 14 (E14) for 11β-HSD1 and on E14 and D1 for 11β-HSD2. 20-HSD mRNA was higher in fast-growing chicken embryos only on E14. Our data provide the first evidence that egg deposition of corticosterone, as well as the hepatic expression of glucocorticoid metabolic enzymes, differs between fast-growing and slow-growing chickens, which may account, to some extent, for the breed disparities in embryonic development. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84873807737	Effect of corticosterone on growth and welfare of broiler chickens showing long or short tonic immobility	Tonic immobility (TI) test is commonly used to assess fear. Animals showing different TI durations demonstrate distinct behavior and biochemical responses to stress. However, less is known about how TI phenotype affects growth and welfare of domestic fowl. In this study, broiler chickens (Gallus gallus) were classified into short and long TI duration (STI and LTI) phenotypes and treated chronically with vehicle (CON) or corticosterone (CORT). STI broilers demonstrated significantly higher growth rate with higher breast muscle yield (P<0.05) and liver weight relative to BW tended to be lower (P=0.053), which was accompanied by higher serum concentration of CORT (P<0.05) and uric acid (P<0.01), but lower serum level of T4 (P=0.01). CORT severely reduced body weight, as well as the relative weight of muscle, bursa of Fabricius and spleen (P<0.001), but relative liver weight was increased (P<0.001). CORT-treated chickens had reduced serum CORT, elevated heterophile/lymphocyte ratio, and increased serum levels of total and free T3. STI broilers displayed more preening behavior (P<0.05), yet CORT elicited more walking behavior (P<0.05). No difference was observed in the welfare assessment scores between STI and LTI phenotypes under basal situation, while LTI chickens showed significantly increased incidence of pad dermatitis compared to STI under CORT exposure. The results suggest that STI broilers demonstrate better growth performance and higher adaptability to stress compared to LTI chickens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84878018555	MicroRNA-130b and microRNA-374b mediate the effect of maternal dietary protein on offspring lipid metabolism in Meishan pigs	To investigate whether the effect of maternal dietary protein on offspring lipid metabolism is mediated by microRNA (miRNA), fourteen Meishan sows were fed either low-protein (LP, half of standard protein (SP) level, n 7) or SP (n 7) diets throughout gestation and lactation periods. PPAR-γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) protein expression was evaluated. The expression of miRNA predicted to directly target PPAR-γ and C/EBP-β in the subcutaneous fat of offspring at weaning age was determined, and the functions of these potential miRNA were verified. The results showed that piglet body weight and back fat thickness were significantly decreased in the LP group compared with the SP group (P< 0.05). The protein level of PPAR-γ was significantly decreased and C/EBP-β protein expression was also decreased, though not significantly (P= 0.056), in the subcutaneous fat of the LP group. Furthermore, miRNA expression analysis showed that miR-130b, targeting the PPAR-γ 3′-untranslated region (UTR), and miR-374b, targeting the C/EBP-β 3′-UTR, were significantly increased in the LP group compared with the SP group; other candidate regulatory miRNA were expressed similarly in both groups. Dual luciferase activity assay results indicated that miR-130b directly recognised and bound to the 3′-UTR of PPAR-γ and thereby suppressed PPAR-γ gene expression. Similar results were found for miR-374b and the 3′-UTR of C/EBP-β. The present study showed that miR-130b and miR-374b are involved in the effect of maternal dietary protein on offspring lipid metabolism in pigs. These results shed new light on our understanding of the maternal effect on offspring lipid deposition. © 2012 The Authors.

84879339151	Ontogeny of mRNA expression of somatostatin and its receptors in chicken embryos in association with methylation status of their promoters	The present study was designed to investigate the ontogeny and tissue distribution of somatostatin and its five receptor subtypes (SSTR1-5) mRNA expression in embryonic chicken (Gallus gallus). Brain, gonads (male), intestine, kidney, liver, muscle, stomach and yolk sac membrane (YSM) of chicken embryos on the embryonic (E) ages of 10, 16 and 21. days (right before hatch) were investigated. Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was performed to determine the methylation status of the promoter region of all the six genes in the liver. Somatostatin (SST) was predominately expressed in intestine, brain and gonads (male) with different ontogenic patterns. The highest expression in intestine was detected at E10. There was ontogenic shift from intestine to brain as development progressed. Expression pattern of SSTRs in brain, intestine and kidney was similar to human embryonic expression. In liver, the ontogenic expression pattern of SST and its receptors was associated to methylation status of the respective promoters. Methylation of site Sp1 determines expression level of SST, SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR3 while site a is important in governing the expression of SSTR4 and SSTR5. The results show that ontogenic expression profile of chicken SST and SSTRs is time and tissue specific. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84881173568	Kisspeptin-10 enhanced egg production in quails associated with the increase of triglyceride synthesis in liver	Our previous results showed that kisspeptin-10 (Kp-10) injections via intraperitoneal (i.p.) once daily for three weeks notably promoted the egg laying rate in quails. In order to investigate the mechanism behind the effects of Kp-10 on enhancing the egg laying rate in birds, this study focused on the alternations of lipids synthesis in liver after Kp-10 injections. 75 female quails (22 d of age) were allocated to three groups randomly, and subjected to 0 (control, Con), 10 nmol (low dosage, L) and 100 nmol (high dosage, H) Kp-10 injections via i.p. once daily for three weeks, respectively. At d 52, quails were sacrificed and sampled for further analyses. Serum E2 concentration was increased by Kp-10 injections, and reached statistical significance in H group. Serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations were increased by 46.7% in L group and 36.8% in H group, respectively, but did not reach statistical significance, and TG contents in liver were significantly elevated by Kp-10 injections in a dose-dependent manner. Serum total cholesterol (Tch) concentrations significantly decreased in H group, while in H group the hepatic Tch content was markedly increased. The level of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), apolipoprotein A1 and B (apoA1 and apoB) were not altered by Kp-10 injections. The genes expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), apolipoprotein VLDL-II (apoVLDL-II), cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and vitellogenin II (VTG-II) were significantly up-regulated by high but not low dosage of Kp-10 injection compared to the control group. However, the expression of SREBP-2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCα), malic enzyme (ME), stearoyl-CoA (D9) desaturase 1 (SCD1), apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2), 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductases (HMGCR), estrogen receptor α, β (ERα and β) mRNA were not affected by Kp-10 treatment. In line with hepatic mRNA abundance, hepatic SREBP1 protein content was significantly higher in H group. Although the mRNA expression was not altered, the content of ERα protein in liver was also significantly increased in H group. However, SREBP-2 protein content in liver was not changed by Kp-10 treatment. In conclusion, exogenous Kp-10 consecutive injections during juvenile stage significantly advanced the tempo of egg laying in quails, which was associated with the significant elevation in hepatic lipids synthesis and transport. © 2013 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.

84881354568	p53 Cooperates with Sp1 to Regulate Breed-Dependent Expression of Glucocorticoid Receptor in the Liver of Preweaning Piglets	Previous studies indicate that Chinese indigenous pig breeds demonstrate distinct pattern of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, which is associated with their unique growth and metabolic phenotypes. Here we sought to unravel the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the breed-specific hepatic GR expression in preweaning Chinese Erhualian (EHL) and Western Large White (LW) piglets. Total GR mRNA and the predominant GR mRNA variant 1-9/10 were expressed significantly higher in EHL compared with LW piglets (P<0.01), which was associated with more enriched histone H3 acetylation on 1-9/10 promoter (P<0.05). Nuclear content of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) was significantly lower in EHL piglets, yet its binding to GR 1-9/10 promoter was significantly higher in EHL piglets, as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Although p53 binding to GR promoter 1-9/10 did not differ between breeds, expression of p53 mRNA and protein, as well as its binding to Sp1, were significantly higher in EHL piglets. Moreover, p53 activator doxorubicin significantly enhanced GR 1-9/10 promoter activity in HepG2 cells at 100 nM, which was associated with significantly higher protein content of p53 and GR. Sp1 inhibitor, mithramycin A, significantly inhibited (P<0.05) the basal activity of GR promoter 1-9/10 and completely blocked doxorubicin -induced activation of GR promoter 1-9/10. These data indicate that higher hepatic GR expression in EHL piglets attributes mainly to the enhanced transcription of GR promoter 1-9/10, which is achieved from breed-specific interaction of p53 and Sp1 on porcine GR 1-9/10 promoter. © 2013 Zou et al.

84884720253	In ovo leptin administration accelerates post-hatch muscle growth and changes myofibre characteristics, gene expression and enzymes activity in broiler chickens	To evaluate the effect of maternal leptin on muscle growth, we injected 0μg (control, CON), 0.5μg (low leptin dose, LL) or 5.0μg (high leptin dose, HL) of recombinant murine leptin dissolved in 100μl of PBS into the albumen of broiler eggs prior to incubation. The newly hatched chicks were all raised under the same conditions until 21days of age (D21), when body weight was measured and samples of gastrocnemius muscle were collected and weighed. Myosin ATPase staining was applied to identify myofibre types and measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of myofibres. Real-time PCR was performed to quantify leptin receptor (LEPR), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), growth hormone receptor (GHR) and myostatin (MSTN) mRNA expression in the gastrocnemius muscle. The activity of calpains (CAPNs) in the gastrocnemius muscle was measured using a quantitative fluorescence detection kit. Male chickens treated with both high and low doses of leptin had significantly higher (p<0.05) body weight on D21. The high leptin significantly increased the CSA (p<0.05) of gastrocnemius muscle in male chickens, which coincided with a 93% increase (p<0.05) in IGF-1 mRNA expression. Likewise, the LL dose increased the weight of gastrocnemius muscle in male chickens (p<0.05), which was accompanied by a 41% down-regulation (p<0.05) of MSTN mRNA expression and a decreased activity of CAPNs. However, all these changes were not observed in female chickens. The proportion of myofibre types did not altered. No significant change was detected for LEPR and GHR mRNA expression. These results indicate that in ovo leptin treatment affects skeletal muscle growth in chickens in a dose-dependent and sex-specific manner. The altered expression of IGF-1, MSTN mRNA and activity of CAPNs in skeletal muscle may be responsible for such effects. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

84884754389	Effects of tail docking and teeth clipping on the physiological responses, wounds, behavior, growth, and backfat depth of pigs	The objective of this experiment was to compare the effects of tail docking and teeth clipping on the growth and behavior of pigs. Pigs (n = 126) from 21 litters (6 pigs/litter) were blocked by birth weight, and assigned at 3 d of age within blocks to either teeth clipping and tail docking (processed) or control (sham-processed). Vocalizations of pigs were recorded during the procedures, and behavior was observed during the lactation, nursery, and growing periods. Blood samples were collected on d 21 to measure serum IgG concentrations. Wounds on the body and tail were assessed by inspecting both sides of the body and tail at 70, 110, and 160 d of age, whereas BW were recorded at 10, 21, 70, and 160 d of age. Fat and LM depths were measured ultrasonically on growing pigs at 160 d of age. Clipped and docked pigs vocalized more (1.06 vs. 0.62 s; P < 0.01) during processing, and processed pigs were observed lying alone more often (P = 0.03) during the 3 d after processing and the entire suckling period; however, teeth clipping and docking did not (P ≥ 0.14) alter the frequency that pigs spent suckling, standing, huddling, playing/fighting, or sitting during the first 3 d or between 5 and 15 d after processing. Social behavior during the nursery (P ≥ 0.23) and grower phases (P ≥ 0.18) was unaffected by clipping and docking, but processed pigs rested more (P = 0.03) during the nursery period and were less (P ≤ 0.01) interested in exploratory behaviors during both phases, especially during pen (P ≤ 0.04) and enrichment investigations (P ≤ 0.02). Teeth clipping and tail docking reduced ADG between 10 and 21 d (P = 0.01) and 21 to 70 d of age (P = 0.04), resulting in lighter BW at 21 (P = 0.01) and 70 d of age (P = 0.08) compared with sham-processed pigs. However, 160-d BW (P = 0.62), d 70 to 160 ADG (P = 0.23), and G:F (P ≥ 0.15) were not affected by teeth clipping and tail docking. Additionally, there was no difference between sham and processed pigs for fat depth (P ≥ 0.05), LM depth (P = 0.93), or estimated percent muscle (P = 0.27). Even though tail docking and teeth clipping appear to produce short-term pain and distress, results of this experiment indicate that leaving the teeth and tails intact have no detrimental effects on mortality, morbidity, live performance, or carcass merit of growing-finishing pigs. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science.

84884307878	Breed-dependent transcriptional regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, cystolic form, expression in the liver of broiler chickens	Hepatic gluconeogenesis is the main source of glucose during chicken embryonic development, and it plays a major role in glucose homeostasis for developing embryos. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis, yet how hepatic PEPCK expression is differentially regulated between chicken breeds remains elusive. In this study, fertile eggs from a slow-growing Chinese Yellow Feathered Chicken and a fast-growing White Recessive Rock Chicken were incubated under the same standard conditions, and serum and liver samples were collected on embryonic d 18 (18E). The fast-growing breed had a significantly higher fetal weight (P < 0.01) and serum glucose concentration (P < 0.05) compared with the slow-growing breed. The fast-growing breed also had significantly higher hepatic mRNA expression levels of the cystolic form of PEPCK (PEPCK-c; P < 0.05) and significantly higher hepatic mRNA and protein expression levels of cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB-1; P < 0.05). Moreover, the binding of phosphorylated CREB-1 to the PEPCK-c promoter tended to be higher in the fast-growing breed (P = 0.08). Breed-specific epigenetic modifications of the PEPCK-c promoter were also observed; the fastgrowing breed demonstrated lower CpG methylation (P < 0.05) and histone H3 (P < 0.05) levels but more histone H3 acetylation (H3ac) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3; P < 0.05) compared with the slow-growing breed. Our results suggest that hepatic PEPCK-c expression is transcriptionally regulated in a breed-specific manner and that fast- and slow-growing broiler chicken fetuses exhibit different epigenetic modifications on their PEPCK-c promoter regions. © 2013 Poultry Science Association Inc.

84890288578	Maternal dietary fat affects the LT muscle fatty acid composition of progeny at weaning and finishing stages in pigs	The present study was conducted to investigate whether maternal dietary fat affects the fatty acid composition of the longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle in offspring pigs at weaning and finishing stages. Fourteen sows were randomly assigned to a control or a high fat (HF) group. The HF sows received a diet containing 8% corn oil starting seven days before farrowing until weaning. The results showed that a high-fat diet significantly increased the contents of serum-lipid-related indexes in the sows. Although the triglyceride content did not change, the C18:2n. 6 content was higher in the colostrum and in the LT muscle of offspring pigs at both investigated stages. The total n. 6 content and the n. 6/n. 3 ratio generally increased. This study demonstrated that maternal dietary fat during lactation affects the fatty acid composition of the LT muscle of progeny at weaning, and can have persistent effects in later life. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84890307284	LPS-induced inflammation in the chicken is associated with CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta-mediated fat mass and obesity associated gene down-regulation in the liver but not hypothalamus	Background: The fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) is widely investigated in humans regarding its important roles in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Studies in mammals demonstrate that FTO is also associated with inflammation markers. However, the association of FTO with inflammation in chickens remains unclear. In this study, male chickens on day 28 posthatching were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline to investigate whether the FTO gene is involved in LPS-induced inflammation.Results: We detected significant down-regulation of FTO mRNA in the liver (P < 0.01), but not in the hypothalamus, 2 and 24 h after LPS challenge. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 (P < 0.01) and TLR4 (P < 0.01) followed the same pattern as FTO, being suppressed significantly in liver but not in hypothalamus. IL-1β was dramatically up-regulated (P < 0.01) in both liver and hypothalamus 2 h after LPS challenge, while activation of IL-6 was observed in the liver (P < 0.01), but not in hypothalamus. The 5'-flanking sequence of the chicken FTO gene contains nine predicted binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP beta) and one for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Significant elevation of C/EBP beta was detected in the liver (P < 0.01), but not in the hypothalamus, 2 h after LPS challenge. Lipopolysaccharide challenge increased the C/EBP beta binding to FTO promoter in the liver (P < 0.01 for fragment 1, P < 0.05 for fragment 2), although the protein content of C/EBP beta was not altered. Moreover, injection of LPS resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of liver STAT3, a downstream transcription factor in IL-6 signaling. Although phosphorylated STAT3 was not detected to directly bind to FTO promoter, it was found to interact with C/EBP beta.Conclusion: Our results reveal that FTO expression in liver, but not in hypothalamus, is affected by the i.p. injection of LPS, which may be mediated through tissue-specific FTO transcriptional regulation by C/EBP beta and STAT3 interaction. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84891895408	Embryonic exposure to corticosterone modifies aggressive behavior through alterations of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and the serotonergic system in the chicken	Exposure to excess glucocorticoids (GCs) during embryonic development influences offspring phenotypes and behaviors and induces epigenetic modifications of the genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and in the serotonergic system in mammals. Whether prenatal corticosterone (CORT) exposure causes similar effects in avian species is less clear. In this study, we injected low (0.2. μg) and high (1. μg) doses of CORT into developing embryos on day 11 of incubation (E11) and tested the changes in aggressive behavior and hypothalamic gene expression on posthatch chickens of different ages. In ovo administration of high dose CORT significantly suppressed the growth rate from 3. weeks of age and increased the frequency of aggressive behaviors, and the dosage was associated with elevated plasma CORT concentrations and significantly downregulated hypothalamic expression of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The hypothalamic content of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein was significantly decreased in the high dose group (p. <. 0.05), whereas no changes were observed for GR mRNA. High dose CORT exposure significantly increased platelet serotonin (5-HT) uptake, decreased whole blood 5-HT concentration (p. <. 0.05), downregulated hypothalamic tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) mRNA and upregulated 5-HT receptor 1A (5-HTR1A) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) mRNA, but not monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). High dose CORT also significantly increased DNA methylation of the hypothalamic GR and CRH gene promoters (p. <. 0.05). Our findings suggest that embryonic exposure to CORT programs aggressive behavior in the chicken through alterations of the HPA axis and the serotonergic system, which may involve modifications in DNA methylation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84892643763	Effects of tonic immobility (TI) and corticosterone (CORT) on energy status and protein metabolism in pectoralis major muscle of broiler chickens	Tonic immobility (TI), which can be divided into short (STI) or long (LTI) duration, is a character related to fear. Our previous study has demonstrated LTI phenotype and chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration retarded growth of breast muscle in broiler chickens. In order to investigate the mechanism behind the negative effects of LTI and CORT on growth, the level of mRNA transcription of several key genes linked to energy and protein metabolism was measured in muscle. LTI broilers showed lower levels of ATP, energy charge (EC) ( p<. 0.01), and lower muscle glycogen content (p< 0.05) but higher level of ADP (p=. 0.08) than STI birds. CORT treatment elevated EC level (p< 0.05) and reduced liver glycogen content (p< 0.05). Real-time PCR results showed that STI chickens had higher mRNA expression of PPAR α (p= 0.06) and AMPK α (p=0.09) than LTI. CORT significantly down-regulated α-enolase mRNA expression in breast muscle compared to control (p< 0.05). Neither TI nor CORT altered gene expression in Akt/mTOR/p70s6k cascade pathway in muscle (p > 0.05). However, western blot results showed that LTI chickens exhibited higher protein content of total Akt (p=0.05) and phosphorylated Akt (p=0.06) than STI. CORT treatment decreased the total protein content of Akt (p=0.09) and p70s6k (p=0.08). These results suggest that the retardation of muscle growth by LTI and chronic CORT administration parallels a strong alternation in energy status but slight changes of Akt/mTOR/p70s6k cascade, indicating that a decrease in muscle growth induced by LTI and CORT might not be mediated through mTOR-dependent signaling pathways. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84892647657	Microvesicle-shuttled miR-130b reduces fat deposition in recipient primary cultured porcine adipocytes by inhibiting PPAR-γ expression	Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Consequently, the development of safe and effective anti-obesity drugs is an area of ongoing clinical interest. MicroRNAs play a vital role in anti-obesity by inhibiting the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis and lipogenesis. However, the clinical application of miRNAs has been limited by a lack of appropriate delivery systems. The discovery of microvesicles (MVs) has shed new light on the search for more efficient drug transport tools. In a previous study, we demonstrated that miRNA-130b suppressed fat deposition by inhibiting PPAR-γ expression. In order to demonstrate whether miRNA-130b can be packaged into MVs and function as an endogenous form of miRNA-130b in recipient cells, we transfected HeLa-229 cells with plasmid to overexpress miRNA-130b. This enabled HeLa-229 cells to selectively package miRNA-130b into MVs and actively secrete the miRNA-130b enriched MVs into the culture media. We further verified that MVs enriched with miRNA-130b contain elevated concentrations of Argonaute 2 and heat shock protein 90α which are known to protect the circulating miRNAs from degradation. Exposure of primary cultured porcine adipocytes to purified, miRNA-130b-enriched MVs resulted in a significant down-regulation of PPAR-γ expression which was associated with reduced adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that MVs may provide an effective transport systems for the deliver of miRNAs for therapeutic use. We also showed that MV-shuttled miRNA-130b inhibited adipogenesis and lipogenesis, and reduced fat deposition in recipient adipocytes by targeting PPAR-γ. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84892673604	Early-age feed restriction affects viability and gene expression of satellite cells isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle of broiler chicks	Background: Muscle growth depends on the fusion of proliferate satellite cells to existing myofibers. We reported previously that 0-14 day intermittent feeding led to persistent retardation in myofiber hypertrophy. However, how satellite cells respond to such nutritional insult has not been adequately elucidated.Results: One-day-old broiler chicks were allocated to control (Con, ad libitum feeding), intermittent feeding (IF, feed provided on alternate days) and re-feeding (RF, 2 days ad libitum feeding after 12 days of intermittent feeding) groups. Chickens were killed on Day 15 and satellite cells were isolated. When cultured, satellite cells from the IF group demonstrated significant retardation in proliferation and differentiation potential, while RF partly restored the proliferation rate and differentiation potential of the satellite cells. Significant up-regulation of insulin like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) (P<0.05) and thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) (P<0.05), and down-regulation of growth hormone receptor (GHR) (P<0.01) and IGF-I (P<0.01) mRNA expression was observed in freshly isolated IF satellite cells when compared with Con cells. In RF cells, the mRNA expression of IGF-I was higher (P<0.05) and of TRα was lower (P<0.01) than in IF cells, suggesting that RF restored the mRNA expression of TRα and IGF-I, but not of GHR and IGF-IR. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio tended to increase in the IF group, which was reversed in the RF group (P<0.05), indicating that RF reduced the pro-apoptotic influence of IF. Moreover, no significant effect of T

84893501206	Long-term effects of Subacute Ruminal Acidosis (SARA) on milk quality and hepatic gene expression in lactating goats fed a high-concentrate diet	Purpose: The mechanism underlying the decline in milk quality during periods of feeding high-concentrate diets to dairy ruminants is not well documented. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic changes in the liver that contribute to the input of substrate precursors to the mammary gland after feeding a high-concentrate diet to lactating goats for a long period. Experimental Design: Eight mid-lactating goats with rumen cannulas were randomly assigned to two groups. For 9 weeks, the treatment group was fed a high-concentrate diet (60% concentrate of dry matter, HC) and the control group was fed a low-concentrate diet (40% concentrate of dry matter, LC). Ruminal fluid, plasma, and liver tissues were sampled, microarray techniques and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to evaluate metabolic parameters and gene expression in liver. Results: Feeding a 60%-concentrate diet for 9 weeks resulted in a significant decrease in rumen pH. Changes in fat and protein content also occurred, which negatively affected milk quality. Plasma levels of leptin (p = 0.058), non-esterified fatty acid (p = 0.071), and glucose (p = 0.014) increased markedly in HC group. Plasma cortisol concentration was significantly elevated in the treatment group (p<0.05). Expression of the glucocorticoid receptor protein gene was significantly down-regulated (p<0.05) in the liver. The expression of genes for interleukin 1b, serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, and haptoglobin mRNA was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the HC group. GeneRelNet analysis showed that gene expression involved in inflammatory responses and the metabolism of lipids, protein, and carbohydrate were significantly altered by feeding a high-concentrate diet for 9 weeks. Conclusions: Activation of the acute phase response and the inflammatory response may contribute to nutrient partitioning and re-distribution of energy in the liver, and ultimately lead to a decline in milk quality. © 2013 Dong et al.

84894480610	In ovo leptin administration affects hepatic lipid metabolism and microRNA expression in newly hatched broiler chickens	Background: A leptin-like immunoreactive substance has been found in chicken eggs and has been implicated in serving as a maternal signal to program offspring growth and metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the effects of in ovo leptin administration on hatch weight, serum and hepatic concentrations of metabolites and hormones, as well as on the expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and the predicted microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the affected genes. To this end we injected fertile eggs with either 0.5 μg of recombinant murine leptin or vehicle (PBS) before incubation.Results: Prenatally leptin-exposed chicks showed lower hatch weight, but higher liver weight relative to the body weight, compared to the control group. In ovo leptin treatment increased the hepatic content and serum concentration of leptin in newly hatched chickens. The hepatic contents of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (Tch) were decreased, whereas the serum levels of TG, Tch and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were increased. The hepatic mRNA expression of sterol regulator element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), SREBP-2, hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1) was significantly up-regulated, as was the protein content of both SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 in hepatic nuclear extracts of leptin-treated chickens. Moreover, out of 12 miRNAs targeting SREBP-1c and/or HMGCR, five were significantly up-regulated in liver of leptin-treated chicks, including gga-miR-200b and gga-miR-429, which target both SREBP-1c and HMGCR.Conclusions: These results suggest that leptin in ovo decreases hatch weight, and modifies hepatic leptin secretion and lipid metabolism in newly hatched broiler chickens, possibly via microRNA-mediated gene regulation. © 2012 Hu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84894549921	Sexual maturation in hens is not associated with increases in serum leptin and the expression of leptin receptor mRNA in hypothalamus	Background: In mammals, leptin is an attractive candidate for mediating the metabolic signal and the reproductive function via the specific receptor in hypothalamus. However, till now, the role of leptin on reproduction in birds is less well established. This experiment was conducted to elucidate the role of leptin on the onset of reproduction in bird, as a first step, to detect the changes of peripheral leptin and leptin receptor mRNA expression in hypothalamus between mature and immature hens at the same age. 120 ISA brown pullets at D60 were allocated randomly into two groups, long light (LL) group being raised under artificial light regimes with incrementally increased light phase (from 8 L:16D to 14 L:12D) and short light (SL) group raised on consistent light (8 L:16D) for 12 wk.Results: The results showed that pullets in LL group reached sexual maturation 15 d earlier than those in SL group.

84894288599	Porcine glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) gene: Tissue-specificity of transcriptional strength and glucocorticoid responsiveness of alternative promoters	Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is transcribed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner with multiple exon 1 mRNA variants driven by selective promoters. We recently cloned and characterized the 5.3 kb proximal promoter sequence of porcine GR gene containing 7 untranslated alternative first exons each processed by a distinct promoter. In this study, we showed tissue-specific expression of total GR and its exon 1 mRNA variants in hippocampus, muscle and liver of pigs. Total GR mRNA was most abundant in liver, followed by muscle and hippocampus in descending order. Among all the GR exon 1 mRNA variants detected, GR exon 1-9/10 and 1-4 were the most predominant variants in all the three tissues. The abundance of GR exon 1-4 mRNA was similar to that of 1-10 in muscle, but was significantly lower than 1-10 in liver and hippocampus. The activities of truncated short (S) and long (L) promoters of respective GR exon 1 mRNA variants were analyzed by luciferase reporter assay in 3 representative cell lines, SY5Y, C2C12 and HepG2. S1-10 and S1-4 demonstrated significantly higher activities than other short promoters in all the cell lines examined. Nevertheless, the strongest activity and cell specificity were detected for L1-10 promoter, which was consistent with the predominant exon 1-9/10 expression in porcine tissues. Moreover, with 3 potential nGRE binding sites, L1-10 promoter was more sensitive to dexamethasone (DEX) in HepG2. Our data provide basic knowledge of the transcriptional mechanism underlying the tissue- and cell-specific expression of porcine GR under basal or ligand-stimulated conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84895108829	Effects of chromium propionate on egg production, egg quality, plasma biochemical parameters, and egg chromium deposition in late-phase laying hens	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of chromium propionate on egg production, egg quality, plasma biochemical parameters and egg chromium deposition in late-phase laying hens. Four hundred thirty-two 60-weeks old laying hens were divided into four groups of 108 birds per group according to egg production. The dietary treatments consisted of the basal diet adding with 0, 200, 400, and 600 μg/kg chromium as chromium propionate. All laying hens were given feed and water ad libitum for 8 weeks. The addition of 400 μg/kg Cr as chromium propionate increased egg production (P < 0.01) during the later 4 weeks, but decreased albumen height, yolk color score, and Haugh unit of eggs. Six hundred micrograms per kilogram Cr as chromium propionate supplementation improved shell thickness (P < 0.05). 200 μg/kg Cr as chromium propionate supplementation decreased the uric acid concentration by 31 % (P < 0.05). However, supplemental Cr did not affect the egg chromium deposition of hens (P > 0.05). These data indicated that feeding of late-phase laying hens with chromium propionate could improve egg production, increase eggshell thickness, but do not result in abnormal levels of chromium deposition in eggs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84898048283	Comparative proteomic analysis of the breast muscle response to chronic corticosterone administration in broiler chickens showing long or short tonic immobility	Broilers of the same genetic origin were classified as short or long tonic immobility duration (STI and LTI, respectively) phenotypes and treated chronically with vehicle (control) or corticosterone (CORT) dissolved in drinking water between 27 and 42 d of age. Differential expression of proteins and mRNA was examined using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR to elucidate the mechanism behind the severe retardation of broiler breast muscle growth caused by LTI and CORT. The majority of the 13 proteins found to be differentially expressed in breast muscle of STI and LTI broilers are involved in either glycolysis (5 proteins) or myofilament formation (5 proteins). Of the 16 proteins differentially expressed in breast muscle following CORT treatment, 6 are structural proteins, 5 are categorized as cellular defense and stress proteins, and 3 (pyruvate kinase, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase) are involved in responses to stress and muscle damage. Real-time PCR results indicated that expression of these proteins is transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally regulated. Protein synthesis capacity, estimated by the RNA-to-protein ratio, was significantly lower in the breast muscle of CORT-treated broilers than in untreated control broilers. The level of Leu, Gly, and Ser in serum was significantly higher in CORT-treated broilers than in the control birds. Therefore, we conclude that CORT treatment retards the growth of skeletal muscle by suppressing protein synthesis and augmenting protein catabolism, paralleling the response to severe stress and muscle damage, and the negative effect of LTI on muscle growth is likely mediated through glucose metabolism. No interaction was observed between CORT and tonic immobility affecting growth performance or any parameter examined in the current study. © 2014 Poultry Science Association Inc.

84899488820	Corticosterone in ovo modifies aggressive behaviors and reproductive performances through alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in the chicken	Exposure to excess glucocorticoids during embryonic development affects offspring reproduction and suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in mammals. However, whether corticosterone (CORT) causes similar effects in the chicken remains unclear. In the present study, we injected low (0.2. μg) and high (1. μg) doses of CORT in ovo before incubation and detected changes in aggressive behavior, tonic immobility (TI), reproductive performances, and HPG axis gene expression in posthatch chickens of different ages. High dose of CORT suppressed growth rate from 3 weeks of age, increased the frequency of aggressive behaviors, which was associated with elevated plasma CORT concentration. High-dose CORT significantly (P< 0.05) down-regulated arginine vasotocin (AVT), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1), while significantly (P< 0.05) up-regulated gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) and 11β-HSD1 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20-HSD) mRNA levels were not affected by CORT treatment. High-dose CORT significantly (P< 0.05) reduced egg production and egg quality, which was associated with decreased ovary and oviduct weight. Moreover, CORT exposure significantly decreased (P< 0.05) luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor mRNA abundance in theca cells of ovarian follicles 1 (F1), F2 and F3. In addition, yolk CORT concentration was significantly higher in eggs laid by hens prenatally exposed to high-dose CORT. Our findings suggest that in ovo administration of CORT programs the aggressive behaviors and reproductive functions in the chicken through alterations of HPG axis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84901261768	Maternal protein restriction during gestation and lactation programs offspring ovarian steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis in the prepubertal gilts	Maternal malnutrition may disrupt ovarian functions in adult offspring. Steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis in the offspring ovary appear to be the major targets of nutritional programming. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which maternal low-protein diet affects the offspring steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis, and the possible pathway linking these two processes remain unclear. In this study, Landrace × Yorkshire crossbred sows were fed either standard (SP) or low-protein (LP, 50% of the SP) diets throughout gestation and lactation. Female offspring were fed the same diet after weaning until 6 months of age. LP offspring had higher serum 17β-estradiol level (P < 0.01), which was accompanied by lower mRNA (P < 0.05) but higher protein (P < 0.05) expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19A1) in the ovary. CYP19A1 protein up-regulation was associated with lower ovarian expression of drosha (P < 0.05) and miRNAs targeting CYP19A1 (P < 0.05). LP offspring had less graafian follicles with more apoptotic granulosa cells (P < 0.05), as well as higher caspase 3 activity (P < 0.05) and FasL expression (P < 0.05) in the ovary.

84904902370	Cholesterol deregulation induced by chronic corticosterone (CORT) stress in pectoralis major of broiler chickens	Chronic endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) excess in mammals is associated with metabolic dysfunction and dyslipidemia that are characterized by increased plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol (Tch) levels. However, the effects of chronic GC administration on cholesterol metabolism, particularly in muscle tissues of broiler chickens, are unknown. In this study, broiler chickens were treated chronically with vehicle (CON) or corticosterone (CORT) for 2. weeks. Chronic CORT treatment significantly increased Tch levels in pectoralis major muscle (PMC) (p. <. 0.001) as well as in leg muscle (p. <. 0.01), and CORT enhanced triglyceride levels in the PMC (p. <. 0.001). Real-time PCR results showed that HMGCR (p. <. 0.05) mRNA expression was up-regulated by CORT in PMC, and 11β-HSD1 gene transcription (p. = 0.08) was not significantly downregulated, whereas glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression, 11β-HSD2, CYP7A1, CYP27A1, ApoB and LDLR were unchanged by CORT (p. >. 0.05). Western blot results showed that the levels of total GR (p. = 0.08) tended to be increased and nuclear GR protein (p. <. 0.05) was increased in PMC by CORT administration. Parallel to an increase in gene expression, HMGCR protein expression in PMC was significantly increased (p. <. 0.05) by CORT. Moreover, LDLR (p. <. 0.05), ApoA1 (p. = 0.06) and 11β-HSD2 (p. = 0.07) protein expression in PMC tended to be increased by CORT compared to control. These results indicate that chronic CORT administration causes cholesterol accumulation in PMC tissues of broiler chickens by increasing cholesterol synthesis and uptake. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84906794670	Response to lipopolysaccharide in salivary components and the submandibular gland of pigs	The diagnostic use of saliva for disease detection and health monitoring is increasing in recent years. To investigate whether the components of saliva change with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and clarify whether these changes directly relate to the submandibular gland (SMG), 12 pigs were employed in the present study. At 6. h after LPS intramuscular injection, samples including saliva, plasma and SMG were taken. The amylase, cortisol, Immunoglobulin A (IgA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) contents were analyzed by colorimetry, radioimmunoassay or ELISA, respectively. Chromogranin A (CgA) and lactoferrin protein concentrations were detected by western blot. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the related gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in SMG. The results showed that LPS treatment increased amylase activity and cortisol concentrations, whereas IL-1β, CgA and lactoferrin concentrations showed a decrease in saliva. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression in SMG increased. Decreased ATP concentration in SMG may be the reason for the opposite changes of IL-1β, lactoferrin and CgA content in the saliva and the SMG. The present study for the first time comprehensively demonstrates that the altered parameters in saliva can indicate the body inflammation in pigs, and they may become useful, noninvasive biomarkers for the evaluation of body state. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84908032409	A survey of Chinese citizens' perceptions on farm animal welfare	Farm animal welfare has been gradually recognized as an important issue in most parts of the world. In China, domestic animals were traditionally raised in backyard and treated as an important component of family wealth. Industrialization of animal production brings forth the farm animal welfare concerns recently in China, yet the modern concept of animal welfare has not been publicized and a comprehensive recognition on how consumers and farmers perceive animal welfare is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a survey on public opinions toward farm animal welfare in China, based on pigs (including sows, piglets, and fattening pigs), domestic fowls (including layers and broilers) and their products. From 6,006 effective questionnaires approximately two thirds of the respondents had never heard of 'animal welfare'; 72.9% of the respondents claimed that, for the sake of animal derived food safety, human beings should improve the rearing conditions for pigs and domestic fowls; 65.8% of the respondents totally or partly agreed on establishing laws to improve animal welfare; more than half of the respondents were willing, or to some extent willing, to pay more for high-welfare animal products, whereas 45.5% of the respondents were not willing or reluctant to pay more. In summary, farm animal welfare is still in its early stage of development and more efforts are needed to improve the public conception to animal welfare in the process of establishing farm animal welfare standards and legislations in China.

84911457383	Breed-specific expression of DROSHA, DICER and AGO2 is regulated by glucocorticoid-mediated miRNAs in the liver of newborn piglets	MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is determined mainly by Drosha, Dicer and Argonaute2 (Ago2). Different breeds of pigs with vast differences in serum cortisol level demonstrate distinct profiles of hepatic miRNA expression. As yet, little is known about whether glucocorticoid contributes to the breed differences in miRNA biogenesis. Here, we used newborn Large White (LW) and Erhualian (EHL) piglets to investigate the role of glucocorticoid in breed-specific hepatic miRNA biogenesis. Erhualian piglets showing significantly higher serum cortisol level, as compared to LW, demonstrated higher hepatic expression of Drosha, Dicer and Ago2 at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level. At the post-transcriptional level, miRNAs that are predicted to target these proteins may be involved in the regulation. Hepatic expression of miR-15b and miR-222 was significantly lower in EHL piglets and was associated with higher glucocorticoid receptor binding to the respective promoter regions of miR-15b and miR-222 genes. The inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid on miR-15b and miR-222 expression was further verified in HepG2 cells, in which dexamethasone significantly downregulated the expression of primary transcripts of miR-15b and miR-222 genes. In conclusion, the higher protein content of Drosha, Dicer and Ago2 in the liver of EHL piglets is post-transcriptionally regulated, at least in part, by glucocorticoid-mediated repression of miR-15b and miR-222.

84914150654	Breed-specific expression of GR exon 1 mRNA variants and profile of GR promoter CpG methylation in the hippocampus of newborn piglets	Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription is driven by alternative promoters to produce different exon 1 mRNA variants. CpG methylation on GR promoters profoundly affects GR transcription. GR in hippocampus is critical for energy homeostasis and stress responses, yet it remains unclear whether hippocampal expression of GR exon 1 mRNA variants and the methylation status of GR promoters differ between Large White (LW) and Erhualian (EHL) pigs showing distinct metabolic and stress-coping characteristics. EHL pigs had higher hippocampus weight relative to BW (P < 0.01), which was associated with higher serum cortisol level compared with LW pigs. Hippocampal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (P < 0.05) was significantly higher, while Bax, a pro-apoptotic gene, was significantly lower in EHL pigs (P < 0.05). Hippocampal expression of total GR did not differ between breeds, yet GR exon 1 to 11 mRNA was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in EHL pigs, which was associated with a trend of increase (P = 0.057) in GR protein content. No significant breed difference was detected for the methylation status across the whole region of the proximal GR promoter, while CpG334 and CpG266.267 were differentially methylated, in a reversed manner, between breeds. The methylation status of CpGs 248, 259, 260, 268 and 271 was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with GR exon 1 to 11 mRNA abundance. Our results provide fundamental information on the breed-specific characteristics of GR and its mRNA variants expression and the status of DNA methylation on the proximal GR promoter in the pig hippocampus.

1042287105	Effect of genotype-nutrition interaction on growth and somatotropic gene expression in the chicken	The neuroendocrine system integrates genotype with external factors such as nutrition to regulate animal growth. To investigate the role of somatotropic axis in the interaction of genotype and nutrition, two series of experiments were conducted using broiler and layer chickens as a model. In the first experiment, both strains of chickens were raised on their respective standard diets and the mRNA expressions of somatotropic genes were investigated on day 5 (D5), D21, and D42 after hatching as composites of genotype and nutrition. The hypothalamic somatostatin (SS) and pituitary growth hormone (GH) mRNA expression as well as the plasma GH levels were higher in layer chickens while the opposite was true for hepatic GH receptor (GHR) mRNA. Regulation of GHR mRNA expression was found to be tissue-specific. Hepatic GHR mRNA content increased with age whereas in the muscle, the peak levels of expression were observed at D5 with significantly higher abundance ratio in the layer. To evaluate genotype-diet interaction on growth and the patterns of gene expression of both layer and broiler chickens, layers were fed broiler diet and vice versa from D1 to 42 in the second experiment. The D42 body weight of layer chickens increased by 35% when fed with broiler diet, whereas that of broiler chickens decreased by 51% when fed with layer food. The diet exchange completely reversed the patterns of hypothalamic SS and pituitary GH mRNA expression and the strain differences vanished when the comparison was made on the same diet basis. The hepatic GHR mRNA decreased by 46.1% in broilers fed with layer food, but increased by 45.6% in the layer fed with broiler diet. The strain differences were diminished but did not completely disappear on the same diet basis for hepatic GH receptor mRNA. In contrast, however, the muscle GHR mRNA expression was not affected by diet exchange and thus, was more genotype-specific. The results suggest that genes of the somatotropic axis respond to nutrition differently at the level of transcription. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
