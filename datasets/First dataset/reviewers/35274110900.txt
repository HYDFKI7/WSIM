18844427080	Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in young children from China with community-acquired pneumonia	Eighty-five cases community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children 5 years or younger, confirmed by chest X-ray, and 185 age-matched control patients with diarrhea or dermatitis from the Outpatient Department at Beijing Children's Hospital were enrolled into this study. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all subjects. Real-time PCR-based fluorescence assays were performed for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A nested PCR was also run for C. pneumoniae for comparison of assays. C. pneumoniae was found in 3 (3.5%) of CAP cases and in 4 (2.1%) of controls (P = 0.51). M. pneumoniae was found in 6 (7.1%) of CAP cases and in none of the controls (P = 0.001). The agreement rate of the 2 applied PCR methods used for C. pneumoniae detection was 98.5%. Our study demonstrates that M. pneumoniae may play a significant role in CAP affecting children up to 5 years in China, whereas C. pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal specimens was not associated with CAP in this age group.

23044511417	Carrier rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae and susceptibility thereof to antimicrobial drugs among children in China: A surveillance study in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou 2000-2002	Objective: To investigate the carrier rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to 10 different antimicrobial drugs among children in China. Methods: Nasopharageal swab specimens were collected from randomly selected 3578 out-patients with upper respiratory infection aged i month to 5 years in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou 2000-2002 so as to isolate S. pneumoniae. The susceptibility of these starins to erythromycin and β-lactam antibiotics (penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone) was determinated by E-test MIC method, and the susceptibility to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin was determinated by disk diffusion method. Results: A total of 892 strains of S. pneumoniae were isolate from the 3578 children with a carrier rate of 24.9% (9.0% ∼36.0%). 634 isolates of S. pneumoniae were tested to examine their susceptibility to chloramphenicol, 199 to ciprofloxacin, and 887 to the other 8 antimicrobial drugs. The insusceptibility rate of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was 39.9%, and the resistance rate was 6.4%. The resistance rate to cefaclor was 20.4%. The insusceptibility rate to cefuroxime was 19.0%. The susceptibility rate to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was 98.5% and that to ceftriaxone was 97.2%. More than 80% of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Chloramphenicol resistance was less common (32.3%) than the resistance to other non-β-lactam antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin to which the resistance rate was 2.0%. The national insusceptibility rates for β-lactam antibiotics did not vary significantly during the three years with the widest varying range of 5.1% for penicillin (38.1% ∼43.2%). Each of the three cities had their different varying patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility, especially for β-lactam antibiotics. Multi-drug resistance was common (88.7%). Strains of S. pneumoniae insusceptible to penicillin were significantly more common than those susceptible to penicillin (99.1 % vs. 78.8%, X

0031682970	Study on Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases in China: The past, present and future	Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a common and serious disease for which there now are WHO-certified vaccines that are recommended for universal infant immunization in North America and European countries. If these vaccines are to be recommended in Asia, it is necessary to know the incidence, age distribution and clinical outcome of Hib meningitis and other systemic infections in this region. Data on Hib disease in China are scanty. Hib meningitis was common during the 1950s in China, accounting for up to 16% of all of pyogenic meningitis (up to 38% of cases were caused by unknown pathogens), despite severe epidemics of meningococcal meningitis during that period. Since 1989 we have conducted hospital- and community-based etiologic and epidemiologic studies of bacterial meningitis. Hib accounts for 30 to 50% of bacterial meningitis in China. The incidence of Hib meningitis in Hefei City was 10.4 per 100 000 children <5 years, a result relatively lower than in the West but higher than the rate of 2.7 found in a retrospective study in Hong Kong. Pneumonia is the primary cause of death for Chinese children. From 1991 to 1993 the average mortality of children<5 years because of pneumonia was 1563.2 per 100 000. To achieve the goal of reducing the death rate of children by one-third by the year 2000, greater efforts should be made to reduce the mortality of children with pneumonia. Our preliminary study showed that about one-fourth to one-third of cases of pneumonia in Chinese children might be caused by Hib. Therefore Hib vaccination for infants and children in China might be an effective and valuable procedure to achieve the goal.

24944479073	The application of infrequent-restriction-site PCR as a typing method of Staphylococcus aureus	Objective: To explore the value of infrequent-restriction-site PCR (IRS-PCR) as a typing method of Staphylococcus aureus (Sa). Methods: Typing all strains by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and IRS-PCR. Discriminatory index (ID) was measured according to the typing situation of 49 community acquired (CA) strains. Repeating the typing process of 30 strains to examine reproducibility. Typing ability, discriminatory ability , reproducibility , accordance ratio and performance of two genotyping methods were compared. Results: IRS-PCR as a genotyping method for Sa was established. 70 strains were all typed by two methods, and typing ability of two methods were both 100%. By IRS-PCR, 70 strains were sorted in to 38 types. 21 hospital acquired (HA) strains were sorted in to 6 types, 49 CA strains were sorted in to 32 types and ID was 0.981. By PFGE, 70 strains were sorted in to 40 types. 21 HA strains were sorted in to 6 types, 49 CA strains were sorted in to 34 types and ID was 0.983. The reproducibility of two typing methods was 100%. For HA strains, the accordance ratio of two typing methods was 100%. For CA strains, the accordance ratio of type was 92% (45/49). Comparing to PFGE, IRS-PCR was simpler, less time- consuming, easy to perform, and does not special need expensive equipments. Conclusion: IRS-PCR is an easy, fast and reliable typing method for Sa and suitable for clinical laboratory to type clinical samples quickly and effectively.

28344440449	Distribution of resistance genes ermB, mefA, tetM and the integrase gene intTn of Tn1545 in Streptococcus pneumoniae	Objective: To investigate the distribution of resistance genes ermB, mefA, tetM and the integrase gene intTn of Tn1545 in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methods: The antimicrobial sensitivity to 15 antibiotics of 185 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was tested. PCR was used to detect the macrolide resistance genes ermB and mefA, tetracycline resistance genes tetM, and the integrase gene intTn of Tn1545. Results: Of the 185 pneumococcal isolates, the resistance rates to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim were 78.9%, 76.2%, 86.0% and 78.7% respectively. For amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, ceftriaxone and cefuroxime, the resistance rates were 2.2%, 15.5%, 2.8% and 14.1% respectively. All erythromycin-resistant isolates had ermB and/or mefA gene of these strains, 79.5% had ermB, 17.8% had both ermB and mefA, and 2.7% had mefA of the 185 isolates, 87% was positive for the tetracycline resistance gene tetM. The presence of tetM gene in tetracycline-resistant strains was higher(96.9%) than those in tetracycline-susceptible strains(26.9%). So did the erythromycin resistance rates in tetracycline-resistant strains (90.0%) than those in tetracycline-sensitive strains(11 .5%). The intTn gene was detected in 87.6% of the 185 test strains. The most prevalent patterns associated with the four test genes of the strains, were those had intTn, tetM and ermB (58.4%). Conclusion: Resistance to macrolide in Streptococcus pneumoniae collected from nasopharyngeal sites in children with respiratory tract infection in Beijing Children's Hospital was generally mediated by methylation of 23S rRNA via ermB methylase. Pneumococcal resistance to tetracycline was predominantly due to ribosomal protection encoded by tetM. There was a significant association of the ermB and tetM genes with Tn1545-related elements.

33744457312	Expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase and survivin proteins in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and its significance	Objective: To study the expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and survival proteins in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and there clinical significance. Methods: The morphologic characteristics were studied by routine light microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining for ALK and survivin proteins was performed using LSAB method. Results: ALK protein was positive in 51 cases (63%) and negative in 30 cases (37%) of the 81 cases of ALCL studied. The prognosis of patients with ALK protein expression was better than those without ALK expression (P < 0.05). As for survivin protein, there were various degrees of expression in all the 77 ALCL cases studied. High level of survivin protein expression was observed in 33 cases (42.9%), while low level of expression was seen in 44 cases (57.1%). The expression of survivin protein did not correlate with that of ALK protein (P > 0.05). The survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high survivin protein expression (P < 0.05). In cases with ALK protein expression, the prognosis was less favorable if there was also high co-expression of survivin protein (P < 0.05). In ALK protein negative cases, prognosis did not significantly correlate with the expression of survivin protein (P > 0.05). In addition, multivariate analysis confirmed the prognosis value of ALK protein expression, survivin protein expression and constitutional symptoms. Conclusion: Survivin protein expression can serve as an independent prognostic predictor of unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with ALCL, especially when ALK protein is positive.

33748347737	Adjacent location of the bac gene and two-component regulatory system genes within the putative Streptococcus agalactiae pathogenicity island	A chromosomal DNA fragment of 8992 bp in size that has not been previously identified in Streptococcus agalactiae, was cloned and sequenced from strain 98-D60C. In particular, this 8992-bp fragment contained genes homologous to the sensor histidine kinase gene and the DNA-binding response-regulator gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae bac gene. Structural and genetic features of the 8992-bp fragment were highly similar to those specific for bacterial pathogenicity islands. Analysis of epidemiologically unrelated S. agalactiae strains revealed that this fragment was present only in bac gene-positive strains. The possible origin of the 8992-bp fragment in S. agalactiae and its significance for molecular mechanisms of "bacteria- host" interactions are discussed.

33750354467	Analysis on the antibiotic resistance of 746 Enterococcus isolates from children patients	Objective: To study the antimicrobial resistance pattern of the enterococcal isolates collected in a pediatric hospital from 2001 to 2005. Methods: The routine method and Micro-scan,Phoenix 100 automatic microbial analysis system were used to identify the organisms. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used to analyze drug resistance. Nitrocefin was used for the detection of β-lactamase. Data were analyzed by WHONET 5.3 software. Results: Of the 746 isolates, E. faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans accounted for 47.8%, 47.2% and 2.1% respectively. About 54.2%, 31.6% and 7.9% of the isolates were isolated from urine, blood and secretion. No isolate was found resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. The resistance rates to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, high level gentamicin and high level streptomycin were significantly higher in nosocomial E. faecalis isolates than the isolates from outpatients (P<0.01). The resistance rate of E. faecium to ampicillin was significantly higher in nosocomial isolates than the isolates from outpatients (P<0.05). Besides vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin and high level streptomycin, the resistant rates of E. faecium to other antimicrobial agents were significantly higher than those of E. faecalis (P<0.01). Conclusions: Enterococcal infections in pediatric patients are mainly caused by nosocomial isolates. The clinical isolates of Enterococcus are highly resistant to ampicillin, high level gentamicin and erythromycin. No Enterococcus isolate is found resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin in this study.

34249656815	Antimicrobial resistance and serotypes of nasopharyngeal strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Chinese children with acute respiratory infections	This prospective, multicentre, nasal carriage study in Chinese children with upper respiratory infection was carried out over the period from 2000 to 2002. Overall, the prevalence of pneumococcal carriage was 24.9%. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed for 887 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae of which 33.5% were intermediately susceptible to penicillin and 6.4% were resistant. Multidrug resistance was very common. Pneumococcal strains (n = 625) were serotyped, showing 72.2% were covered by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and 57.6% by the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Sero-groups 19 and 23 were significantly associated with penicillin resistance, which is increasing in China. Erythromycin, tetracycline and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim cannot be recommended as first-line treatments for respiratory tract infection as in some other developing countries. These features of serotype distribution are of importance for surveillance in the era of the new conjugate vaccine. In particular, these features will allow for documentation of serotype replacement after the introduction of widespread vaccination. Copyright © 2007 Cambridge Medical Publications.

34447569431	Prediction, recombination and expression of streptococcal C5a peptidase epitope and its immunogenicity	Objective: To predict epitopes of streptococcal C5a peptidase by bioinformatics, and to recombinant, express and analyze recombinant epitope and its immunogenicity. Methods: The prediction programs are ProPred and ANTIGENIC. Recombinant epitope gene was constructed by PCR. The PCR product was then cloned into a constructed recombinant vector. The gene was induced to express fusion protein in E. coli host strain BL21 (DE3) and the fusion protein was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis and Western blot. Anti serum of C57/BL mice immunized with purified fusion protein was tested by double immunodiffusion to evaluate the fusion protein's immunogenicity. Results: The peptide functioning both as MHC binding peptides and B cell epitopes was predicted from SCPB. The probability based mouse score of C5a peptidase was 79. The recombinant protein could specially react with antibody against SCPB. The fusion protein was obtained with the purity over 90%. Results of double immunodiffusion showed that the antiserum of fusion protein could specially react with surface proteins isolated from GBS strain. Conclusion: The results confirm that the recombinant epitope has certain immunogenicity, and its potential for the study on recombining epitopes and subunit vaccine in related protein.

3442899366	Clinical diagnosis of group B streptococci by scpB gene based PCR	Background & objectives: The goal of the present study was to improve and simplify the diagnosis of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus, GBS) infection for routine clinical practice. Methods: A total of 71 clinical samples were tested by microbiologic culture, counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and PCR described in the literature. Southern hybridization was accomplished with the Enzo™ "DNA Labeling and Detection Kit", Roche (Germany). The computer techniques were used for selection of the specific primers and for analysis of the sizes of PCR products. Results: The primers for the regions around the 51 bp deletion in C5a peptidase gene (scpB) of GBS were selected. PCR analysis revealed the 255 bp amplification fragment in GBS, 306 bp fragment in groups A and G streptococci (GAS, GGS) and did not reveal any fragments in other bacterial species. Among 71 urine and serum clinical samples tested, none were found to be GBS positive by microbiologic culture, 16 samples by CIE, 36 by PCR. The specificity of amplification was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Interpretation & conclusion: The 51 bp deletion in scpB gene in comparison with scpA and scpG genes can be used as a diagnostic tool for identification of GBS. The 51 bp deletion based PCR proved to be faster and more reliable test than microbiologic culture or CIE.

The average incidence of β-lactamase production was 12.0%. Overall, 88.0% of isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, 100.0% were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and azithromycin, and 99.0% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from Beijing and Shanghai had a lower susceptibility to tetracycline (57.0% and 61.0%, respectively) compared with those from Guangzhou (81.0%), while trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole susceptibilities in Shanghai (47.0%) and Guangzhou (54.0%) were significantly higher than in Beijing (35.0%). A total of 34.5% of all the isolates were susceptible to all eight of these antimicrobial agents and 12.8% were multi-drug resistant. Ampicillin resistance increased over the duration of the study. These findings show that β-lactamase production and ampicillin resistance among isolates from Chinese children with upper respiratory tract infection are increasing, and highlight the strong correlation between ampicillin resistance and resistance to cefaclor, chloramphenicol and tetracycline in H. influenzae isolates.

Methods: The 625 strains were isolated from out-patients with upper respiratory infection in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, 2000-2002. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by E-test for erythromycin and penicillin and by disk diffusion method for tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. Results: A total of 625 pneumococal strains were typed. The common types were serotypes 19, 23, 6 and 14. The nonsusceptible rates to erythromycin, tetracycline or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in common-type group were significantly higher than in the other types and nontypable group. Nonsusceptible rates of penicillin nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSP) to erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were significantly higher than those of penicillin susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). In the nontypable group, nonsusceptible rates of PNSP to erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were also significantly higher than those of PSSP. Meanwhile, nonsusceptible rates of PNSP to erythromycin and tetracycline were significantly higher than those of PSSP in serotype 19; while the resistant rate to chloramphenicol was significantly lower. No similar association was found in serotype 23, 6 or 14. Conclusions: The resistance rates to erythromycin, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim are very high for serotypes 19, 23, 6 and 14 pneumococcal strains. The difference of nonsusceptibility rates to some non β-lactam antibiotics between PNSP and PSSP may be influenced by serotype distribution.

Pneumonia patients were more likely to be colonized with Hib and S. pneumoniae than control patients, even after the data were adjusted for possible confounding factors such as day- care attendance, the presence of other children in the household, and recent antibiotic use. In China, where blood cultures from pneumonia patients are rarely positive, the results of these nasopharyngeal cultures provide supporting evidence for the role of Hib and S. pneumoniae as causes of childhood pneumonia.

Methods: A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed, to identify 12 respiratory bacterial pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Bordetella pertussis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and single (uniplex) PCRs were used for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae only. In a preliminary evaluation, we compared the results of mPCR/RLB with those of single (uniplex) PCRs and culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 100 children under 5 years, admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital between October 2004 and May 2005, with pneumonia. Results: Reference strains and clinical isolates of all 12 target species were correctly identified by mPCR/RLB. Potential pathogens were isolated from one blood culture and 26% of respiratory cultures. One or more pathogens were identified in 70% of respiratory specimens - by mPCR/RLB in 63%, uPCR only in another 3%, culture only in 2%, and culture plus uPCR in 2%. The species most commonly identified were S. pneumoniae (54%) and H. influenzae (38%, including type b, 4%). Cultures were not performed for B. pertussis, M. tuberculosis C. pneumoniae or M pneumoniae but each was identified by mPCR/RLB in between one and four specimens. Two or more potential pathogens were identified in 35% of specimens. Ten of 14 S. pneumoniae isolates belonged to serotypes represented in the 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Conclusions: The mPCR/RLB assay is a sensitive tool for identification of respiratory pathogens, including mixed infections and bacteria requiring special culture methods. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

38349079968	Antimicrobial usage in paediatric intensive care units in China	Aim: The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial usage in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in China. Methods: Data were equally collected from 540 charts of PICUs in the three Chinese tertiary teaching children hospitals in 2006. The data included demographic, clinical data and those on antimicrobial usage and results of microbiological examinations. Results: Of the 540 cases, 524 (94.7%) patients received at least one antimicrobial agent. The main treatment started empirically in 387 (71.6%). The third-generation cephalosporins were the major antimicrobials used in all participating hospitals, accounting for 227 (31%). Bacteria were isolated from 48%, 68% and 59% of the three PICUs. Six common pathogens accounted for more than 75% of the isolated bacteria. The rates of Escherichia coli isolates resistant to cefotaxime were 73.8%, 58.3% and 49.2%, respectively, with the rate being higher in H1 than in H2 and H3 (both p < 0.01). Conclusions: Irrational use of antimicrobials exists in clinical practice of PICUs in China. It is recommended that antimicrobial usage should be guided by bacterial isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility tests in order to select correct antimicrobials and to prevent emergency of drug-resistant strains in PICUs. © 2007 The Author(s).

38949168857	Membranous glomerulonephropathy associated with hepatitis B virus infection	The association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the development of nephropathy remains controversial. The chronic carrier state of Hepatitis B Virus leads to the development of glomerulonephropathy, the commonest histological type being membranous nephropathy (MN), particularly in children. Other types of glomerulonephritis associated with HBV infection are less common. Spontaneous clearance of HBV antigens, particularly the HBeAg, leads to resolution of proteinuria. The isolation of immune complexes in the kidney suggests that the pathogenesis of the disease may have an immune-complex basis. Genetic studies suggest a possible genetic predisposition to the development of HBV-MN. Cellular immune mechanism studies suggest HBV-MN children seem to have an inadequate cellular immune response to HBcAg. Membranous nephropathy in patients with chronic HBV carriage is the result of an interaction of virus and host factors. Although the natural history of the disease suggests a tendency to remission with supportive therapy, there is considerable morbidity. Anti-viral therapy (interferon or lamivudine) accelerates clearance of the virus and proteinuria. Immunisation with HBV vaccination is the most effective tool to reduce the incidence of HBV-MN.

Susceptibility to ampicillin was determined by E test. Nested PCR with primers specific to bexA gene and capsular type-specific genes was established. Hib strains among resistant isolates were identified by nested-PCR based capsular typing and slide agglutination serotyping (SATS) at the same time. Results: Of the 74 H. influenzae strains resistant to ampicillin, 2 were positive by nested-PCR, and characterized as genotype b. The prevalence of Hib in ampicillin-resistant Hi isolates was about 2.7%. Conclusions: Nested-PCR based capsular typing as a supplement to slide agglutination serotyping, is useful for identifying Hib. The prevalence of type b strain among ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolated from nasopharyngeal specimens of children with respiratory tract infection in a defined geographic area during the past four years is at relatively lower level.

40949103118	Antibiotic use in five children's hospitals during 2002-2006: The impact of antibiotic guidelines issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health	Purpose: To investigate the pattern of antibiotic use in five Chinese children's hospitals from 2002 to 2006. To see if the Guidelines to encourage rational use of antibiotics issued by the Ministry of Health in October 2004 have any impact on the use. Methods: The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification/Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD) methodology was used. Aggregate data on antibiotic use (ATC code-J01) were expressed in numbers of DDD/100 bed-days for inpatients. Results: Total 56 different substances of systemic antibiotics were used. The overall consumption of antibiotic drugs was 68.2, 58.4, 65.8, 65.6 and 49.9 DDD/100 bed-days for the years 2002-2006, respectively. The top antibiotics used were third-generation cephalosporins. There was considerable variation in both type and amount of antibiotics used in the five hospitals. In 2002, some hospitals had twice the antibiotic use compared to others. While the overall antibiotic use in 2005 was largely unchanged compared with previous years, by 2006 antibiotic use had decreased by 22.6% and the variation in use between hospitals was also reduced. Conclusions: The ATC/DDD methodology proved useful for studying overall antibiotic usage in children's hospitals. The decline in antibiotic usage found in 2006 (and the reduced variation between hospitals) may be attributed to the impact of the Ministry of Health guidelines which took some time to be promulgated to individual staff members. Further research will focus on compliance of antibiotic use in these five hospitals with particular guideline recommendations for specific clinical problems such as bacterial resistance and surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.

40549103822	Profile of antimicrobial resistance in the Enterococcus isolates from children	Objective: To study the antimicrobial resistance pattern of 158 enterococcal isolates in a Children's Hospital for rational use of antibiotics. Methods: Agar dilution was used to determine MIC of 11 antibiotics against the enterococcal isolates. Nitrocefin was used to test the production of β-lactamase. The data were analyzed with WHONET 5.3 software. Results: A total of 158 enterococcal isolates were collected from children. E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans, E. avium and E. hirae accounted for 56.3%, 39.9%, 1.3%, 1.3%, and 1.3%, respectively. The proportion of E. faecium resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin was 96.8%, 95.2% and 84.1%, respectively, while only 23.6%, 18% and 49.4% of E. faecalis isolates were resistant to these 3 antibiotics. The resistance rate of E. faecium was significantly higher than that of E. faecalis. The MIC of vancomycin was 8 mg/L for the 2 E. faecalis isolates. E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were all susceptible to teicoplanin. Multiple-drug resistance was found in 88.6% of enterococcal isolates. Conclusions: The situation of antimicrobial resistance is serious in Enterococcus isolates from children. In particular, E. faecium isolates are highly resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

0034934503	Physician control of pediatric antimicrobial use in Beijing, China, and its rural environs	Background. Antibiotic resistance is recognized as an increasing problem in China. It is widely believed that because antibiotics are available without a prescription, changing physician prescribing behaviors will not decrease inappropriate usage. This study identified the sources of antibiotics and the important influence that physicians have on antibiotic use by children in one region of China. Methods. Trained medical professionals surveyed parents of children attending several kindergartens in urban Beijing and rural Gu'An, Hebei County. Parents completed a questionnaire concerning the children's recent illnesses, care-seeking patterns and antibiotic use. The team also observed hospital- and non-hospital-based pharmacy purchases of antibiotics for children, assessed the proportion accompanied by a prescription and then interviewed parents about factors influencing those purchases. Results. Of 241 urban and 143 rural kindergarten parents, 76 to 82% usually obtained children's antibiotics from a hospital pharmacy (with a prescription). For 84% the first source of care was usually a physician (primarily western medicine, sometimes traditional Chinese medicine). Only 5% of antibiotics were obtained from independent vendors without prior physician consultation. Among 229 observed antibiotic purchases 72% occurred at hospital-based facilities, even after longer observation times at nonhospital pharmacies. Prescriptions accompanied all hospital-based antibiotic purchases, contrasting with 18% of nonhospital transactions (P < 0.001). Together 86% of parents self-reported that the observed purchase stemmed from a doctor's recommendation. Conclusions. Doctors directly and indirectly controlled the majority of antibiotic usage for childhood illnesses in Beijing and Gu'An (Hebei County). Physician education and implementation of treatment guidelines might substantially reduce inappropriate antimicrobial usage and help prevent antimicrobial resistance in this region.

0034703834	Preparation and preclinical evaluation of experimental group B streptococcus type III polysaccharide-cholera toxin B subunit conjugate vaccine for intranasal immunization	Streptococcus group B (GBS) is usually carried asymptomatically in the vaginal tract of women and can be transferred to the newborn during parturition. Serum antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) can prevent invasive diseases, whereas immunity acting at the mucosal surface may be more important to inhibit the mucosal colonization of GBS and thus the risk of infection for the newborn. We prepared different GBS type III CPS-protein conjugate vaccines and evaluated their systemic and mucosal immunogenicity in mice. GBS type III CPS was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) or recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB) either directly or to rCTB indirectly via TT. The conjugation was performed by different methods: (1) CPS was coupled to TT with 1-ethyl-3 (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDAC), using adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) as a spacer; (2) CPS was conjugated with rCTB using reductive amination; or, (3) N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) was used to bind rCTB to the TT of the CPS-TT conjugate. Mice were immunized with these conjugates or purified CPS by subcutaneous (s.c.) and intranasal (i.n.) routes. Antibodies to GBS III in serum, lungs and vagina were measured with ELISA. All of the CPS-protein conjugates were superior to unconjugated CPS in eliciting CPS-specific immune responses in serum and mucosal tissue extracts. The conjugates, when administrated s.c., induced only IgG responses in serum, lung and vagina, while i.n. vaccination also elicited IgA responses in the lungs and vagina. The CPS-TT conjugate administrated i.n. induced a strong serum IgG, but only a weak mucosal IgA response, while the CPS-rCTB conjugate elicited high IgG as well as IgA antibodies in the lungs after i.n. immunization. GBS III CPS-TT conjugated with rCTB produced a strong systemic and local anti-CPSIII response after i.n. administration. Co-administration of CT as adjuvant enhanced the anti-CPS systemic and mucosal immune responses further after i.n. administration with the CPS conjugates. These findings indicate that: (i) i.n. immunization with GBS CPS-protein conjugates was more effective than s.c immunization for stimulating serum as well as mucosal immune responses; (ii) rCTB as a carrier protein for GBS III CPS could markedly improve the mucosal immune response; and (iii) the experimental GBS type III CPS conjugates containing rCTB should be investigated as mucosal vaccine to prevent GBS infection in humans.

77954732508	Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes from Chinese pediatric patients in association with Tn916 transposons family over a 16-year period	To investigate changes in the antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates over a 16-year period, 456 group A streptococci isolates were collected from Chinese pediatric patients among 1993 to 1994 and 2005 to 2008. Susceptibilities to antibiotics were performed using agar dilution methods. The macrolide resistance genes ermB, ermTR, mefA, and tetracycline-resistant gene tetM and the int and xis genes of Tn. 916 family were detected by polymerase chain reaction. All 456 strains were analyzed by emm typing. Selected strains representing each emm type were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The resistance rates of erythromycin and clindamycin both significantly increased during the 2 sample periods (79.7% versus 94% for erythromycin and 75.4% versus 96.9% for clindamycin). Telithromycin resistance rate increased from 20.37% to 87.93%. Among the macrolide resistance strains, the rate of strains with the genes int, xis, tetM, and ermB increased with time (16.05% versus 86.91%, P < 0.05). The emm1 and emm12 isolates had high rates of ermB gene, which increased after 16 years (65.2% versus 86.23% for emm1 and 7.7% versus 91.8% for emm12). This study demonstrates the increase in macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes in Chinese children over a 16-year period. The phenomenon may be related not only with the shift in the emm types but also with the change of macrolide-resistant mechanisms. The change of Tn. 916 family among the isolates may be related with the increased resistance. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77954825957	Analysis of resistant genes of beta-lactam antibiotics from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pediatric patients	Objective: To analyze the antibiotic resistance of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) isolated from pediatric patients and the resistant genes of beta-lactam antibiotics thereof. Methods: 146 PA strains were isolated from pediatric patients. Agar dilution method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute was used to examine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 12 antimicrobial agents, including the penicillins, third and fourth genet ration cephalosporins, carbapenemases, Aztreonam, β-lactamase inhibitors, quinolones, and aminoglycosides. PCR was used to detect the expression of the genes TEM, SHV, OXA, PER, GES, CTX-M,IMP, VIM, DHA, MIR, FOX, and oprD2. Results: The multi-drug resistance rates against different antibiotic were high among the 146 PA strains. The rates of imipenem and meropenem resistance were 41.1% and 35.6% respectively. Among the 146 PA strains, 46 (31.5%) were positive for the MBL genotype; 38 (82.6%) carried the blaIMP gene, 8 (17.4%) carried the blaVIM gene, and 114 (78.1%) were oprD2 negative. The genes TEM, SHV, OXA, CTX-M, PER, VEB, GES, FOX, MIR, and DHA were not found in all strains. Conclusion: Many PA isolated from pediatric patients carry the genes IMP or VIM and losses oprD2 gene related to the expression of the outer membrane porin OprD2. The loss of the gene oprD2 is essential mechanism of beta-lactam antibiotics resistance in PA.

84867132470	Molecular characteristics of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae from pediatric patients younger than five years in Beijing, 2010	Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main pathogen that causes respiratory infections in children younger than five years. The increasing incidence of macrolide- and tetracycline-resistant pneumococci among children has been a serious problem in China for many years. The molecular characteristics of erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates that were collected from pediatric patients younger than five years in Beijing in 2010 were analyzed in this study. Results: A total of 140 pneumococcal isolates were collected. The resistance rates of all isolates to erythromycin and tetracycline were 96.4% and 79.3%, respectively. Of the 135 erythromycin-resistant pneumococci, 91.1% were non-susceptible to tetracycline. In addition, 30.4% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates expressed both the ermB and mef genes, whereas 69.6% expressed the ermB gene but not the mef gene. Up to 98.5% of the resistant isolates exhibited the cMLS

43249110665	Antimicrobial susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae strains and antibiotics usage patterns in pediatric outpatients: Results from a Children's Hospital in China (2000-2004)	Objective: To investigate the nasopharyngeal carriage and antimicrobial susceptibility of H. influenzae among children younger than 5 years old and to assess antibiotics usage patterns in the outpatient department of Beijing Children's Hospital from 2000 to 2004. Materials and Methods: From 2000 to 2004, At least 100 strains of H. influenzae were isolated from the pediatric patients who were younger than 5 years and who presented with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections during February to May in each of the study years. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined; and antibiotics usage was expressed as defined daily dose (DDD)/100 patient days. Results: The overall nasopharyngeal carriage rate of H. influenzae is 26.3% (562/2,137) in children younger than 5 years old with acute upper respiratory tract infection. The percentage of ampicillin-resistant isolates ranges from 4.0% (4/100) to 14.3% (17/119) from 2000 to 2004. All the ampicillin-resistant isolates are β-lactamase producers. More than 80% of the isolates are susceptible to amoxicillin, cefaclor, and chloramphenicol; whereas, almost all (99-100%) of the isolates are sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime. For antibiotics utilization, macrolides are the predominantly used antibiotics, followed by cephalosporins and penicillins among pediatric patients in the outpatient department during the study period. Conclusion: All amoxicillin-resistant isolates of H. influenzae are producing β-Lactamase; and the rates of amoxicillin-resistant isolates are increasing over time. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cephalosporins are highly sensitive to H. influenzae isolated from Chinese pediatric patients. Macrolides are the most used antibiotics in the outpatient department during the study period. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

42649142589	Occurrence of qnr-positive clinical isolates in Klebsiella pneumoniae producing ESBL or AmpC-type β-lactamase from five pediatric hospitals in China	The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnr genes in clinical isolates in adults have been described in different countries; however, the frequency of their occurrence has not been detected in pediatric patients. A total of 410 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, identified as producers of an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), or AmpC β-lactamase, were collected from five children's hospitals in China during 2005-2006. The isolates were screened for the presence of the qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS genes, and then the harboring qnr gene isolates were detected for a bla gene coding for the TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and plasmid-mediated ampC gene by a PCR experiment. Ninety-two isolates (22.7%) were positive for the qnr gene, including 10 of qnrA (2.4%), 25 of qnrB (6.1%), and 62 of qnrS (15.1%). Eighty-one of the 92 (88.0%) qnr-positive isolates carried at least one bla gene for TEM, SHV, CTX-M, or DHA-1. The ciprofloxacin resistance increased 16-256-fold and oflaxacin resistance increased 2-32-fold in transconjugants, respectively. These results indicated that the plasmid-mediated qnr quinolone resistance gene was qnrS, followed by qnrB and qnrA. Most of the isolates also carried a bla gene coding ESBL or ampC gene coding DHA-1 among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from Chinese pediatric patients. © 2008 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

4444273044	Structure of scpB-lmb intergenic region as criterion for additional classification of human and bovine group B streptococci	The relative location of scpB and lmb genes in group B streptococcal (GBS) strains was studied. These genes were found in all the strains isolated from human and only in 9% of strains isolated from dairy cows. The scpB gene was located upstream of the lmb gene, however, three different structures of scpB-lmb intergenic region were identified. These genes could be separated by the 164 bp spacer region (type 1), by this spacer region with insertion sequence IS1548 (type 2) or by this spacer region with intron GBSi1 (type 3). The presence of different insertion sequences (IS861, IS1548, ISSa4 and IS1381) was compared with serological types of GBS strains and the types of scpB-lmb intergenic region structure. As a result, 10 different genetic variants were identified in GBS. The genetic variants No. 1 - No. 9 were found in human strains while the variant No. 10 was found only in bovine strains. The mutually exclusive presence of insertion sequences IS1548, ISSa4 and the type 3 structure of scpB-lmb intergenic region was demonstrated. The structure of scpB-lmb intergenic region was found to be useful criterion for additional classification of GBS strains.

44949230200	Presence of qnr gene in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ciprofloxacin isolated from pediatric patients in China	Background: Quinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae results mainly from mutations in type II DNA topoisomerase genes and/or changes in the expression of outer membrane and efflux pumps. Several recent studies have indicated that plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms also play a significant role in fluoroquinolone resistance, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. In China, the presence of the qnr gene in the clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae has been reported, but this transmissible quinolone resistance gene has not been detected in strains isolated singly from pediatric patients. Because quinolones associated with a variety of adverse side effects on children, they are not authorized for pediatric use. This study therefore aimed to investigate the presence of the qnr gene in clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae from pediatric patients in China. Methods: A total 213 of non-repetitive clinical isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin from E. coli and K. pneumoniae were collected from hospitalized patients at five children's hospital in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The isolates were screened for the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes of qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS by PCR. Transferability was examined by conjugation with the sodium azide-resistant E. coli J53. All qnr-positive were analyzed for clonality by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR. Results: The study found that 19 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were positive for the qnr gene, and most of the qnr positive strains were ESBL producers. Conjugation experiments showed that quinolone resitance could be transferred to recipients. Apart from this, different DNA banding patterns were obtained by ERIC-PCR from positive strains, which means that most of them were not clonally related. Conclusion: This report on transferable fluoroquinolone resistance due to the qnr gene among E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains indicated that plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance has emerged in pediatric patients in China. © 2008 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

45149090748	Expression and functional study of fragment peptides of group B streptococcal LrrG protein	Objective: To construct fragment peptides of group B streptococcal LrrG protein and study their immunogenicity and protective function. Methods: Three fragments (Gn, Gr, Gc) of LrrG protein were constructed according to the prediction result of LrrG protein's antigenic sites and the characteristics of its primary structure. The recombinant fragments were expressed and purified. CD1 mice were immunized with Gn, Gr, Gc separately to test their immunogenicity. Perfusion-extraction method was used to obtain lung, rectal and vagina specimens for antibody detection. The IgG and IgA levels in mice serum and issues were tested by ELISA. Opsonophagocytosis test in vitro was used to test the protective function of anti-Gn, Gr, Gc serum. Results: Gn, Gr, Gc were successfully expressed and purified with affinity chromatography. ELISA data showed that Gn, Gr and Gc could elicit significantly higher level of IgG in serum of immunized mice than that of control group (P < 0.001). 30 μg dose of Gr and Gc can elicit higher level of specific IgG than that of 10 μg and 50 μg doses. Except that Gr elicited higher IgA level in lung and rectum, Gn and Gc have little influence on IgA level of serum and tissues. Opsonophagocytosis tests showed that anti-serum of Gn, Gr and Gc had opsonophagocytic activity than control serum and negative control, and their infection index of phagocytes were 617.76, 907.83, 906.30, 225.08, 247.04 respectively after incubating with phagocytes and GBS for 30 min, which were also confirmed by counting the number of GBS on blood agar after lysis of phagocytes. After 3 h incubation the infection index decreased, which showed the killing function of phagocytes. Gr and Gc have better opsonophagocytic activity than Gn, though Gn has higher IgG level, but the result is accorded with the prediction. Conclusion: Gn, Gr and Gc are immunogenic. The specific IgG level is dependent on the dose of immunized protein to some extent, and beyond the extent it may inhibit immune response. Immunization from subcutaneous route seems to have little influence on mucosal immunity, which can provide experimental data for further mucosal immunity. The opsonophagocytic activity may be the protective mechanism of LrrG protein. Antiserum to Gn, Gr and Gc have potential protective function, which supports them to be components of GBS vaccine.

45849135597	Outpatient antibiotic use and assessment of antibiotic guidelines in Chinese children's hospitals	Purpose: Our aim was to investigate outpatient antibiotic use and assess the impacts of intervention in five Chinese children's hospitals from 2002 to 2006. Methods: The Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical Classification/Defined Daily Doses and Drug Utilization 90% methodologies were used. We also analyzed the relationship between antibiotic consumption and resistant rate in one of the hospitals. Results: The overall antibiotic consumption decreased during the intervention period in some hospitals, and the variation in use between hospitals was also reduced. A decrease in penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins, and an increase in third-generation cephalosporins as well as in the combinations of penicillins and β-lactamase inhibitors were observed. In addition, an increasing resistance to antibiotics was a concern due to antibiotic overconsumption. Conclusions: The intervention had effects on the overall antibiotic use in outpatients. However, over the span of 5 years, there was a decrease in the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics and an increase in broad-spectrum antibiotics. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

45349083951	A survey of Esp gene in enterococcal isolates from children	Objective: To study the relationship between Esp gene and the pathogenesis of enterococcal isolates. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction was used to test the Esp gene. Results: Of the 152 enterococcal strains isolated from children, 98 were positive for Esp gene. Esp gene was not identified in the 30 strains isolated from stool (P<0.001). The prevalence of Esp gene in E. faecalis and E. faecium was 90.9% and 28.1% respectively. The prevalence in E. faecalis was significantly higher than in E. faecium (P<0.001). The prevalence Esp gene in urine, umbilical swab, genital swab, blood and sputum was 83.7%, 55.6%, 50.0%, 43.0% and 33.0%, respectively. The prevalence of Esp gene was 75.0% in inpatients and 37.5% in outpatients (P<0.001). Conclusions: Esp gene in Enterococcus plays an important role in adherence and colonization, as well as escaping immune elimination.

45349103729	Antibiotic resistance profile of common gram-negative bacterial pathogens isolated from children	Objective: To investigate the prevalence and pattern of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from Chinese children and provide guidance for rational antimicrobial therapy. Methods: Clinical isolates were collected from five Chinese pediatric hospitals during 2000 to 2006. Kirby-Bauer agar diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) according to NCCLS criteria. Results: The prevalence of ESBLs in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was relatively higher. Resistance rate of E. coli to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime showed increasing trend and was positively correlated to the prevalence of ESBLs. Imipenem was the most active antimicrobial agent against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Drug resistance of P. aeruginosa was not high. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance slightly fluctuated over time. Significant regional difference could be found for the three bacterial species in terms of resistance rate. The resistance was higher in Beijing and Chongqing hospitals, but relatively lower in shanghai hospitals. Conclusions: It is necessary to understand the prevalence and pattern of antibiotic resistance in each hospital in order to effectively control infection. Antimicrobial therapy should be based on the results of ongoing resistance surveillance.

4844219894	Cytokine-induced killer cells showing multidrug resistance and remaining cytotoxic activity to tumor cell after transfected with mdr1 cDNA	Background. Routine treatment of cancer such as surgery, radiation or chemotherapy is sometimes unable to erdiacate metastatic malignant cells. So we tried a new method and increased the adoptive immunotherapy of Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in tumor patients and the multidrug resistance (mdr1) cDNA was transfected into CIK cells. Methods. CIK cells were obtained from peripheral blood and induced by IFN-γ, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, IL-2 and IL-1. CIK cells were transfected with plasmid PHaMDR containing human mdr1 cDNA by electroporation. RT-PCR was used to detect mdr1 mRNA in transfected CIK cells. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressed on surface of CIK cells was assayed by FITC-conjugated anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry. Multidrug resistance to doxorubicin and colchicine and cytotoxic activity to human breast cancer cell line MCF7 were performed using MTT method. Results. mdr1 mRNA was detected in transfected CIK cells. P-gp was expressed on the surface of the transfected CIK cells, and the P-gp positive cells reached 21% -37% of the total CIK cells after transfection. The IC50 to doxorubicin increased to 22.3-45.8 times, and that to colchicines to 6.7 - 11.35 times, as compared to those of untransfected CIK cells. However, the cytotoxic activity to MCF7 cell line remained unaltered. Conclusions. CIK cells were successfully transfected with mdr1 cDNA by using electroporation. The transfected CIK cells had the characteristics of multidrug resistance without change in their cytotoxic activity to tumor cells.

48449090026	Streptococcus pneumoniae diseases in Chinese children: Past, present and future	This review describes major contributions to our understanding of pneumococcal diseases among children in hinterland of China. The data demonstrated that Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is an important pathogen of pyogenic meningitis, pneumonia, and other infectious diseases in children. The distribution of serotypes of S. pneumoniae showed great diversity in several studies in various cities during different years. The penicillin nonsusceptibility rates, although variable, demonstrated an increase over time in China. The prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline was reported to be over 80% and exceeded those reported from other developed countries. A national survey on serotype prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and molecular epidemiology of S. pneumoniae, especially in invasive pneumococcal diseases, and studies to determine pneumococcal disease burden should be undertaken in the future to provide evidence and guidance to the use of vaccine and antibiotics in S. pmeumoniae infections.

48449093482	Serogroup distribution and antimicrobial resistance of nasopharyngeal isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae among Beijing children with upper respiratory infections (2000-2005)	The aims of this study were to estimate pneumococcal carriage rate, antimicrobial resistance and serogroup distribution of nasopharyngeal isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae among children with acute upper respiratory infections (AURIs) aged 1 month to 5 years attending outpatient department of the Beijing Children's Hospital between 2000 and 2005. Susceptibilities to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefaclor, erythromycin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and chloramphenicol were assessed using the E-test and disc diffusion. We also analyzed the correlation between antibiotic consumption and rates of resistance. The prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci increased from 26% during 2000-2001 and 21% during 2002-2003 to 31.5% in 2004-2005. The percentage of S. pneumoniae resistant to cefaclor and cefuroxime increased from about 6% during 2000-2001 to about 23% during 2004-2005 (P<0.01). The frequency of resistance to erythromycin ranged from 87% to 94%. Tetracycline and co-trimoxazole resistance rates were greater than 80%. We conclude that resistance rates for most antibiotics are increasing, possibly due to misues of antibiotics in the hospital setting. However, chloramphenicol resistance was found to decrease, which correlated with the cessation of chloramphenicol administration in 1999. Pneumococcal strains (n=519) were analyzed by serogroup, and only 296 were found to be seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-related serotype isolates. This serotype distribution is important for surveillance of the new conjugate vaccine. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

48549103404	Five-year surveillance of antimicrobial use in Chinese Pediatric Intensive Care Units	In order to demonstrate antibiotic usage in Chinese Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs), and provide some data to further study on relation of antimicrobial use and resistance. We reviewed the use of antibiotics in Chinese PICUs from 2002 to 2006. All data, including general data and antibiotic use data, were obtained from five PICUs of pediatric teaching hospitals in China. The results of antibiotic use were expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 patient-days by WHO in this study. All 12 743 patients were included from the five PICUs in this study. Length of stay in PICUs was essentially unchanged, but the percentage of antimicrobial costs vs. drug costs dramatically decreased in this study period (p < 0.01). The percentage of empiric treatment decreased by year (from 82.2% to 70.2%). while the percentage of therapeutic treatment increased by year (from 11.2% to 24.2%) from 2002 to 2006. Total antibiotic usage decreased from 72.1 DDDs per 100 patient-days to 35.5 DDDs per 100 patient-days from 2002 to 2006 (p < 0.05). The significant increase was found in the DDDs per 100 patient-days of second generation cephalosporins in this study (p < 0.05). While usages of the some antibiotics decreased, for example penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, and macrolides in this study period. The data of antimicrobial use were obtained from five PICUs of biggest pediatric teaching hospital in this 5-year period, which could serve as a basis of antibiotic treatment and a benchmark in future study of antibiotic use. © The Author [2008].

49149087146	Antimicrobial resistance of Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from pediatric patients with respiratory infection in Chongqing from 2004 to 2006	Objective: To investigate the change of antimicrobial resistance of Moraxella catarrhalis in pediatric patients with respiratory infection in Chongqing from 2004 to 2006. Methods: Sputum or throat swab cultures were collected from 16,737 inpatient pediatric patients with respiratory infection. KB disk method and nitrocefin disk method were used to detect the drug resistance and beta-lactamase of Moraxella catarrhalis. Results: The resistance rates of Moraxella catarrhalis against ampicillin and compound sulfamethoxazole were 51% and 49.5% respectively, and there was an increase tendency over the 3-year study period. But the drug resistance rate did not reach 5.0% to the cephalosporins and/or plus enzyme inhibitor. While, ampicillin-resistance Moraxella catarrhalis was multidrug resistance and its resistance rate was 22.8%. The incidence of β lactamase-producing Moraxella catarrhalis was averagely 71.2% and lower than other area, it was obviously growing higher in 2006. Conclusions: The resistance rate of Moraxella catarrhalis against ampicillin was very high, resistance to cephalosporins and/or plus enzyme inhibitor was relatively low. Therefore, the latter two drugs were considered for clinical practice.

49749140081	Drug utilisation 90% (DU90%) profiles of antibiotics in five Chinese children's hospitals (2002-2006)	This study surveyed the pattern of inpatient antibiotic use in five Chinese children's hospitals between 2002 and 2006, focusing on the antibiotics accounting for 90% of the volume utilised as well as the level of adherence to guidelines. The Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical Classification/Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD) and the drug utilisation 90% (DU90%) methodologies were used. In October 2004, national antibiotic guidelines were issued that divided antibiotics into non-restricted, restricted and special use grades. In five children's hospitals, a total of 56 different systemic antibiotics were used during the study period. Antibiotics that could be injected accounted for 59.0-99.8%. β-Lactam antibacterials (ATC codes J01C and J01D) were the most used subgroups. The numbers of antimicrobial agents and non-restricted antibiotics within the DU90% segment were 11-20 and 5-9, respectively. The proportion of non-restricted antibiotic consumption was ca. 40% in 2006 in four hospitals, which varied among hospitals during the period 2002-2005. There was considerable variation both in the pattern and amount of antibiotics used in the five hospitals, with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime and cefazolin being the most commonly used substances. We also observed a decrease in the ranks of some restricted and special use antibiotics after the guidelines were issued in one hospital. The DU90% profiles were proven to be useful in studying the pattern of antibiotic use in hospitals. Finally, the study observed the effectiveness of guidelines for antibiotic use in some hospitals, although injectable antibiotics were widely used in children's hospitals in China. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

49749149163	Surveillance of antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from hospitalized patients with pneumonia in four children's hospitals in China	Objective: To investigate the antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) isolated from Chinese children with pneumonia. Methods: Hypopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected from hospitalized children with pneumonia who were admitted to the children's hospital located in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou or Shanghai from Feburary 16, 2006 to Feburary 16, 2007. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of S. pneumoniae isolates against penicillin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime (sodium), ceftriaxone, erythromycin, vancomycin, ofloxacin and imipenem was determined by E-test method. Results: A total of 279 S. pneumoniae isolates were obtained. Eighty-six percent of the isolates were not susceptive to penicillin, and 23.3% was resistant to penicillin. The rate of susceptibility of the isolates to amoxicillin was 92.1%, and to cefuroxime and ceftriaxone was 19.0% and 75.3%, respectively. The isolates also showed a high susceptibility to vancomycin (99.6%) and ofloxacin (97.8%). Seventeen point six percent of the isolates were not susceptive to imipenem, and most of those were intermediate. Almost of all isolates were resistant to erythromycin. There were some distinct regional differences in the susceptibility to antimicrobials tested except for erythromycin, vancomycin and ofloxacin. Conclusions: The S. pneumoniae isolates from Chinese children with pneumonia were susceptive to amoxicillin, vancomycin and ofloxacin, but were not susceptive or resistant to penicillin, cefuroxime and erythromycin. The isolates kept susceptibility to ceftriaxone and imipenem to a certain extent.

50149093919	Macrolide-resistance mechanisms in Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from Chinese children in association with genes of tetM and integrase of conjugative transposons 1545	This study investigated macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae carried by Beijing children presenting with respiratory tract infections. Nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae strains were tested for sensitivity with 15 antibiotics and further analyzed for phenotypes of macrolide-resistant strains and by PCR for the macrolide-resistant genes ermB, mefA, tetM, and integrase of conjugative transposon (Tn1545) intTn. We found 185 strains of S. pneumoniae relatively highly resistant to erythromycin (78.9%), clindamycin (76.2%), tetracycline (86%), and SMZ-TMP (78.7%) but with relatively low resistance to amoxicillin (2.2%), cefaclor (15.5%), ceftriaxone (2.8%), and cefuroxime (14.1%). The 146 strains of erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae showed extensive cross-resistance to other macrolides like azithromycin (100%), clarithromycin (100%), acetylspiramycin (95.2%), and clindamycin (95.9%). Genes ermB and mefA were detected in all erythromycin-resistant strains, with ermB(+) 79.5%, ermB + mefA(+) 17.8%, and mefA(+) 2.7%. About 96.9% of tetracycline-resistant isolates were positive for tetM, compared to 26.9% of sensitive strains. Ninety percent of tetracycline-resistant strains were also erythromycin-resistant versus 11.5% of tetracycline-sensitive strains. The intTn gene was present in 87.6% of S. pneumoniae strains and correlated with erythromycin and tetracycline resistance. The close relationship between the conjugative transposon Tn1545 and the genes ermB and tetM is probably one of the important mechanisms explaining the multiple drug resistance of S. pneumoniae. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

53349100445	Analysis of the mechanism and antibiotic resistance of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Objective: To investigate the loss of OprD2 porin and metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) produced by carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and analyze antibiotic resistance of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in pediatric patients. Methods: Seventy-five strains of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from January 2004 to December 2006 in our hospital were analyzed. Genes encoding outer membrane proteins oprD2 porin and MBLs were amplified by PCR. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents against these strains were determined. Results were analyzed according to the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). WHONET 5.3 and SPSS13.0 software were used to analyze the data. Results: Loss of OprD2 porin was identified in 50 (66.7%) of the 75 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains and MBLs were identified in 46 (61.3%) of the 75 strains. Among the MBL-positive isolates, 38 (82.6%) carried blaIMP gene, 8 (17.4%) with bla VIM gene. Loss of OprD2 porin was found in 34 (45.3%) MBL-positive isolates. These 34 strains were more resistant to β-lactam antibiotics than other isolates. Conclusions: Loss of OprD2 porin and MBLs-production is prevalent in the carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from pediatric patients. The isolate producing MBLs but missing OprD2 porin is highly resistant. Two genotypes, IMP and VIM, are identified in MBL-producing strains.

53549115042	The prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from five children's hospitals in China	The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from five children's hospitals in China. A total of 494 E. coli and 637 K. pneumoniae isolates were collected from five children's hospitals in China from 2005 to 2006. The isolates with decreased susceptibility to cefoxitin were subjected to confirmation test with 3-aminophenyl boronic acid. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the blaAmpC, blaTEM, blaCTXM, and blaSHV genes and their gene sequencing were performed. Transconjugants were achieved by conjugation experiments. Plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases were found in 10.1% of K. pneumoniae (64/637) and in 2.0% of E. coli (10/494) strains. The proportion of plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing strains significantly increased from 2005 (2.6%) to 2006 (9.3%) (p<0.001). The DHA-1-producing isolates were the most prevalent type (93.2%, 69/74). The sequences of blaDHA-1 genes were all identical to those from the GenBank. Strains of blaCMY-2 were isolated from five isolates (6.8%), which were all from E. coli. One sequence of blaCMY-2 differs from blaCMY-2 in the GenBank. Eighteen of the 74 (24.3%) AmpC-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates coproduced an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL). Cefoxitin resistance was transferred to 15 of the 74 positive strains (20.3%). Our study has demonstrated the occurrence of plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases in E. coli and K. pneumoniae in Chinese pediatric patients and DHA-1 type AmpC enzymes had the highest prevalent rate. The CMY-2 AmpC β-lactamases from the children's hospitals in China in this study are the first reported. Hence, continuous surveillance of the prevalence and evolution of AmpC β-lactamase is important. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

53849149350	Detection of Haemophilus influenzae type B DNA in a murine pneumonia model by in situ PCR	This study estimated the value of in situ PCR (ISPCR) in the detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) DNA in paraffin-embedded lung tissues of a murine pneumonia model. ICR mice were infected with Hib solution intranasally. In study group A (n=20), physiological changes and the number of deaths were recorded for 7 consecutive days after infection. In study group B (n=10), blood samples and lung tissues were obtained from the infected mice on the brink of death. In both groups, portions of the lung tissue were cultured for Hib, while other portions were submitted for histopathological studies. Conventional PCR, PCR followed by Southern blotting and ISPCR were performed to detect Hib in paraffin-embedded lung tissues. In control group A, six mice were inoculated intranasally with the same concentration of heat-inactivated Hib solution. In control group B, six healthy mice served as a blank control. Both control groups were managed using the same methods as those used in the study groups. The white blood cell count of the mice in the study group increased (F=3.295, P<0.01), with a high neutrophil count (F=0.127, P<0.05). In the histopathological study, various stages of pneumonia were found in the lung tissues of the infected mice examined by microscope; 80% of the mice had moderate or severe pneumonia. Cultures of lung tissues in the study groups were all positive for Hib, while no bacteria were found in the control groups. Hib was detected in only 4 of 30 samples (13.3%) of the study groups using conventional PCR, but in all 30 samples (100%) using both Southern blotting and ISPCR. All three methods did not detect Hib in the control groups. Because of its sensitivity and specificity and its ability to locate the micro-organism, ISPCR can be considered suitable for the detection of Hib in paraffin-embedded lung tissues. © 2008 SGM.

55649102777	Characteristics of Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from Chinese children with scarlet fever	Aim: To analyse the characteristics of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from Chinese children with scarlet fever. Methods: Minimal inhibitory concentration with nine antibiotics was performed on 145 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates acquired from Beijing and Shanghai in 2007. Their macrolide-resistant genes (mefA, ermB and ermA - a subclass of ermTR), superantigens (speA and speC), and en-coding mature M protein gene (emm gene) were amplified by PCR. Results: A total of 97.9% of the isolates exhibited resistance to the macrolides, while 96.6% manifested resistance to tetracycline. All isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, penicillin, cefradine, and ofloxacin. Moreover, 94.5% exhibited a cMLSB phenotype, while 90.3% had the ermB gene. Five emm types (emm1.0, emm4.0, emm12.0, emm22.0 and st5240) were discovered, of which 9.7% carried the superantigen speA, 35.9% carried the speC, 42.8% carried both speA and speC and 11.7% carried neither speA nor speC. Finally, 85.5% of emm1.0 and 15.5% of emm12.0 isolates carried speA, while 79.0% of emm1.0 and 75.9% of emm12.0 isolates carried speC. Conclusion: The Streptococcus pyogenes isolates had high resistance rates against macrolides and tetracycline. They mainly expressed the ermB gene type and cMLSB phenotype. Their common emm types are emm1.0 and emm12.0, which have different frequencies of speA and speC. ©2008 The Author(s).

56549122388	Influencing the use of antibiotics in a Chinese pediatric intensive care unit	Objectives: To demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention in antibiotics prescribing, and evaluate the use of antibiotics in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at the Beijing Children's Hospital. Methods: Our interventions included (1) educating the pediatricians on antibiotics prescribing, (2) applying an antimicrobial spectrum chart, and (3) controlling the prescription of specific antibiotics with the use of a guideline. Nine hundred clinical records, including clinical information and antibiotic usage data, were selected retrospectatively from the PICU admissions during the pre- and post-intervention periods. Results: In this 5-year survey, the mean rate of antibiotic prescribing was greater than 95% in the PICU. More than 76% of the prescriptions were started empirically. The most frequently used antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins. After the intervention, we found a reduction in the rate of antibiotic cost/patient/day (P < 0.05); a decrease in the prescription rate of third-generation cephalosporins and macrolides (P < 0.01); an increase in the prescription rate of β-lactam/β- lactamase inhibitors and second-generation cephalosporins (P < 0.01); a reduction in the empiric treatment (P < 0.01); and a significant reduction in the incidence rates of bacterial resistance for imipenem-, cefepime-, and ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05), and cefepime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Our interventions led to a significant reduction of broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing associated with the significant reduction in bacterial resistance in the PICU. The implementation of the antibiotics guideline appeared to be effective. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

58149289704	Antibiotic use in pulmonology wards of Chinese children's hospitals: 2002-2006	Purpose: To investigate the pattern of antibiotic use in the pulmonology wards of four children's hospitals in China from 2002 to 2006. Methods: The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification/Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD) methodology was used. Aggregate data on antibiotic use (ATC code-J01) were expressed in numbers of DDD/100 bed-days for inpatients. Results: The overall consumption of antibiotic drugs in the pulmonology wards of the four children's hospitals were 83.7, 49.9, 53.6 and 79.3 DDD/100 bed-days, respectively. Injectables were among the most widely used antibiotics. In addition, there was a considerable variation in both the amount and the pattern of antibiotics used in the respective hospitals' pulmonology wards. Conclusions: Wide variations were found between the four hospitals studied in the amount and type of antibiotics prescribed although the diseases treated appeared the same. This variation may have been due to differences in disease severity, regional diversity in bacterial resistance or variations in empiric treatment regimens. Despite the introduction of Chinese Ministry of Health Antibiotic Guidelines in 2004, the pattern of antibiotic use in individual hospitals remained unchanged from 2002 to 2006. Antibiotic utilization studies need be taken to the next level; comparing drugs used to treat specific diseases with guideline recommendations. In addition, educational and other interventions to ensure better compliance with guidelines are urgently required. © 2008 The Authors.

62749108499	Genetic analysis of group A streptococcus isolates recovered during acute glomerulonephritis outbreaks in Guizhou Province of China	In this study, 68 group A streptococcus (GAS) isolates associated with two outbreaks of acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) in China were analyzed by emm typing. A total of 11 different emm types were identified. Analysis of emm type distribution suggested that AGN outbreaks in two counties were caused by emm60.1- and emm63.0-type GAS. These two types were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, sof sequence typing, and PCR-based identification of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, B, and C (speA, speB, and speC) genes. In antimicrobial susceptibility tests, all outbreak strains were resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline, and the rates of resistance of nonoutbreak strains to the two antibiotics were 63.6% and 90.9%. This study is also the first to report a nephritogenic M63 GAS strain. Copyright © 2009, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

66249149006	Nosocomial infections among pediatric hematology patients: Results of a retrospective incidence study at a pediatric hospital in China	The occurrence of nosocomial infections (NIs) differs in different patient populations and different hospitals, and information on NI in Chinese children patients is scarce. This study fills these research gaps by evaluating the frequency of NIs, main infection sites, and common microorganisms found in pediatric hematology patients in a general children's hospital. A retrospective study was performed by analyzing the medical records of patients with NIs. The rates of NIs were calculated on the basis of cases identified during surveillance and the number of discharges annually. One thousand six hundred and four NIs were detected in 21,456 subjects (overall rate: 7.0 episodes/100 discharges). The most commonly observed infections were respiratory tract infections (1079 cases, 67.3%), followed by gastrointestinal infections (198 cases, 12.3%), skin and soft tissue infections (161 cases, 10.0%), bloodstream infections (97 cases, 6%), and urinary tract infections (16 cases, 1%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens, followed by Gram-positive bacteria, virus, and fungal organisms. Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections were the common NIs in pediatric hematology/oncology patients. Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for most pathogens of NIs. In future studies, the prospective use of incidence density rates and postdischarge surveillance in children patient populations would be an interesting research direction. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

67349236645	Molecular epidemiological analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from Chinese pediatric patients	To investigate the molecular epidemiological analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from five pediatric hospitals in China. Seventy-three MRSA isolates were analyzed by a combination of different genotyping methods, including multilocus sequence typing (MLST), SCCmec and spa typing. Panton-Valentine Leukocin (PVL) gene was also detected. The prevalent strains were ST239-MRSA-III and ST1-MRSA clones in the northern region; ST239-MRSA-III, ST910-MRSA-IV and ST88-MRSA in the eastern region; and ST59-MRSA in the southern region. Only the ST910-MRSA-IV clone has been found in China until now, and it is closely related to ST30-MRSA-IV. All MRSA isolates were found to be resistant to penicillin and azithromycin, and multidrug resistance was observed. The cases of necrotic pneumonia, severe skin and subcutaneous tissue infection and lymphadenitis resulted from PVL gene-positive MRSA. There were several novel genetic types of MRSA. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed high resistance of many antimicrobials and multiple drugs. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

66749111259	High macrolide resistance in streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from children with pharyngitis in China	Objectives: To assess the macrolide resistance, phenotype, and genotypic characterization of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from Chinese children with pharyngitis. Methods: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) with nine antibiotics was determined on 188 isolates of S. pyogenes collected from outpatients with pharyngitis in four children's hospitals in different regions of China in 2007. MICs of penicillin, chloramphenicol, cefradine, levofloxacin, macrolide (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin,), clindamycin, and tetracycline were determined by the microdilution method. The macrolide resistant phenotypes of isolates were determined through a double-disk. The macrolide-resistant genes (mefA, ermB, and ermA) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Over 95% were resistant to macrolides, while 92.0% were resistant to tetracycline. We also found that all isolates were sensitive to penicillin, chloramphenicol, cefradine, and levofloxacin. Among the 173 erythromycin resistant strains, 171 (98.8%) were assigned to the cMLS phenotype, while the remaining 2 (1.2%) were assigned to the iMLS phenotype. Among the 171 cMLS isolates, 168 isolates (98.2%) had the ermB gene accounting for 98.2%. Meanwhile, 2 iMLS isolates had the ermA gene. Macrolides were highly resistant to ermB positive strains (MIC90 > 256 ug/ml). Neither the M-phenotype nor the mefA gene was detected. Meanwhile, our studies of multiple centers showed that consumption of macrolides from 2000 to 2006 was very high. Conclusion: The main phenotype is cMLS, and the ermB gene code is the main resistance mechanism against macrolides in S. pyogenes. The high rate of macrolide resistance to S. pyogenes was observed, which may be correlated with the overuse of these antibiotics in China. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

67649553912	Small cell variant of peripheral T-cell lympboma, not otherwise specified: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic analysis	Objective To study the clinicopathologic features and differential diagnosis of small cell variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified ( PTCL, NOS). Methods The clinicopathologic features of 5 cases of small cell variant of PTCL, NOS were retrospectively reviewed, with immunohistochemical study, T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement analysis and evaluation for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status. Results All the 5 patients were males. The mean age was 52.6 years. The median duration before diagnosis was 1 month. Clinically, 3 patients presented in stage IV and 2 in stage 1H. Four of them had generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Hepatomegaly and massive effusion were found in 1 and 2 cases, respectively. Marrow involvement was detected in 3 of the 4 patients with bone marrow biopsy performed and one of them also accompanied by lymphocytosis. Histologically, the involved lymph nodes showed partial or complete effacement of nodal architecture and replacement by a monomorphous population of small lymphoid cells. Scanty large lymphoid cells were also identified in 4 cases. Increase in number of blood vessels was noticed in two of them as well. Immunohistochemically, the lymphoma cells in all cases expressed two or more of the T-cell markers and CD43. The staining for CD20, TdT, CD56 and granzyme B was negative. CD99 expression was noted in 3 of the 4 cases. The Ki-67 index ranged from 5% to 15%. Clonal TCR-y gene rearrangement was detected in the 4 cases studied and one of them also showed TCRp gene rearrangement. In-situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA was negative in the 4 cases studied. Follow up information was available in 3 of the 5 cases. All of the 3 patients died of the disease, with an average survival of 21. 7 months. Conclusion Small cell variant of PTCL, NOS represents a rare disease entity which often presents in advanced tumor stage and carries a poor prognosis.

69749117081	Correlation between usage of macrolide antibiotic and resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae clinic isolates from Chongqing Children's Hospital	To investigate the reasons of growing resistance problem of Streptococcus pneumoniae against macrolide in Chongqing, a retrospective method was employed to measure the minimal inhibition concentrations (MIC) of macrolide antibiotic against 1,210 S. pneumoniae clinic isolates. The defined daily doses (DDDs) of macrolide antibiotic were calculated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the presence of the erythromycin-resistant genes in 100 macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates. A decrease in macrolide consumption, from 371,100 DDDs in 2002 to 182,500 DDDs in 2005 (51% reduction); however, the rate of erythromycin resistance in S. pneumoniae showed continued increase from 88.0% in 2002 to 96.0% in 2005. No linear correlation was observed between the decline in macrolide consumption and continued increase in resistant rate in S. pneumoniae. In 100 macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates, 68 had both erm(B) and mef(A) genotypes, 10 only had the erm(B), 20 only had the mef(A). Co-existences of ribosomal modification coded by erm(B) gene and efflux effects coded by mef(A) gene were the main resistance mechanism against macrolides and might be attributed to the high drug resistance of S. pneumoniae in Chongqing. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

70349245188	Characterization of emm types and superantigens of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from children during two sampling periods	The characteristics of 359 group A streptococcal (GAS) isolates collected from Chinese paediatric patients in two periods (1993-1994, 2005-2006) were studied. Isolates were assigned to emm types and assayed for eight superantigen (SAg) genes (speA, speC, speH, speI, speG, speJ, ssa, SMEZ). Types emm1 and emm12 were consistently the most prevalent during the two periods, while others varied in frequency. GAS isolates carrying six or more SAg genes increased from 46.53% (1993-1994) to 78.39% (2005-2006); ssa, speH and speJ genes (P<005) increased but speA declined (P<005). SAg gene profiles were closely associated with the emm type, but strains of the same emm type sometimes carried different SAg genes in the two periods. No significant difference in emm-type distribution and SAg gene profile was noted between isolates from different diseases.

0035157211	Seroetiology of acute lower respiratory infections among hospitalized children in Beijing	Background. Little is known of the etiology of childhood acute lower respiratory infections in China, where the use of antimicrobials is indiscriminate. Trials to change such a policy require etiologic data, especially on the bacteria most relevant to these common diseases. Methods. One hundred consecutive infants and children from 3 months to 14 years of age with symptoms and signs compatible with acute lower respiratory infections were studied prospectively in the largest pediatric hospital in Beijing from February to May, 1997. Blood culture, thorax radiography and paired sera for 20 microbiologic assays were taken, and the course of illness was monitored uniformly. Disease severity was graded. Results. In 24 cases there was evidence only of bacterial etiology, and in 5 solely viral agents were found; 3 children probably had a mixed bacterial-viral infection. Surprisingly no pneumococcal infection was detected, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n= 21), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 8) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 7) being the dominant bacteria. All children recovered. Conclusions. Routine use of antimicrobials for these patients seems unjustified. Serologic evidence for the H. influenzae type b etiology is encouraging in terms of vaccination, but confirmatory studies are needed.

0035184018	Nasal carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae among children in Beijing	Objective. To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae carried in the nose among children in Beijing and the distribution of serotypes, and to analyze the risk factors for nasal carriage of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae. Methods. A disk diffusion test was applied to detect the antimicrobial susceptibilities of S. pneumoniae to erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. The E test was applied to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, augmentin and imipenem. S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped by the Quellung reaction. Results. S. pneumoniae that was resistant to penicillin or cefuroxime was not found, but S. pneumoniae intermediate resistant to penicillin and cefuroxime accounted for 8.2% and 2.1%, respectively. All of the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime, augmentin and imipenem. S. pneumonia that was resistant to erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline were extremely numerous, accounting for 72%, 70% and 79%, respectively. Five serotypes (19, 6, 14, 23, 17) accounted for 54.7%, and nontypables accounted for 20.6% of all the S. pneumoniae. Previous history of otitis media was a risk factor we found for nasal carriage of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae. Conclusions. Continued surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of S. pneumoniae is necessary. A larger scale investigation is needed to identify if the 7 or 9-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine is appropriate for Chinese children.

72449149668	The prevalence of qnr-positive clinical isolates in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae producing ESBLs or AmpC-type β-lactamase from five pediatric hospitals in China	Objective: To investigate the prevalence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae producing ESBLs or AmpC β-lactamase. Methods: A total of 702 non-duplicate clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae phenotypic positive for ESBLs or AmpC β-lactamases were collected from five children's hospitals in China. Isolates were screened for qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS genes by PCR. Transferability was examined by conjugation with the sodium azide-resistant E. coli J53. All qnr-positive isolates were analyzed by ERIC-PCR for DNA-relatedness. Results: Totally 99 isolates (14.1%) were positive for qnr gene, including 8 (1.1%) of qnrA, 28 (4.0%) of qnrB, and 67 (9.5%) of qnrS. Eighty- eight (88.9%) of the 99 qnr-positive isolates carried at least one bla gene. The ciprofloxacin resistance increased 2- to 125-fold. Different DNA band patterns were obtained from those isolates by ERIC-PCR, indicating that most of them were not clonally related. Conclusions: These results indicate that the most popular plasmid-mediated qnr quinolone resistance gene is qnrS, followed by qnrB and qn-rA. Most of the isolates also carried a bla gene encoding ESBLs or ampC gene encoding DHA-1 among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from Chinese pediatric patients.

72649095573	Antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from children with impetigo in China from 2003 to 2007 shows community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to be uncommon and heterogeneous	Background The number of patients with impetigo caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has been increasing. Objectives To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus causing impetigo in children in China from 2003 to 2007 and further characterize isolates of CA-MRSA. Materials and methods We examined 984 S. aureus isolates for antimicrobial susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials using the agar dilution method. CA-MRSA isolates were analysed for Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) genes, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing was performed. Results The largest proportion (94·5%) of strains were resistant to penicillin, followed by erythromycin (86·2%) and clindamycin (69·6%). In total 772 of 984 (78·5%) S. aureus strains were multiresistant. The incidence of CA-MRSA was 1·1%, with a high rate of resistance to clindamycin (90·9%) and tetracycline (72·7%), but all were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The susceptibility profiles of MRSA to other antimicrobial agents were similar to those of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). None of the S. aureus strains were resistant to vancomycin and fusidic acid; moreover, only one strain was resistant to mupirocin. Typing of the SCCmec showed that 54·5% were type IV, 18·2% were type V and 9·1% were type VI. All the PVL-positive CA-MRSA carried SCCmec type IV. Conclusions CA-MRSA is still relatively uncommon and heterogeneous in children in China. Penicillin and erythromycin are no longer appropriate agents. Effective antibiotic agents for patients with impetigo are mupirocin and fusidic acid. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.

7344231047	Experimental study on distribution of serotypes and antimicrobial patterns of Group B streptococcus strains	Objective: To obtain information on the distribution of serotypes and antimicrobial agent susceptibilities to group B streptococcus (GBS) strains isolated in Beijing area from 1991 to 1996. Methods: Bacterial isolates of GBS were obtained from vaginal and cervical tract of pregnant and nonpregnant women in Beijing Tian Tan Hospital by culture. A total of 76 BGS strains were identified finally by coagglutination. Serotyping was determined by Standard Lancefield method. Susceptibility to test agents was assessed by determining the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) with agar dilution method was established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Results: Seven serotypes were identified among 76 GBS strains isolates. Types II (33%), III (23%) and I a (16%) were the predominant serotypes in pregnant and nonpregnant women. MICs of penicillin G and ampicillin were ≤0.06 μg/ml. MICs of cephazolin, cefuroxime and cefoperozone were 0.003 μg/ml - 0.06 μg/ml. MICs of erythromycin were 0.003 μg/ml - 0.03 μg/ml. MICs of gentamycin were 1 μg/ml - 32 μg/ml. MICs of amikacin were 4 μg/ml - ≤64 μg/ml, nearly 12.8% and 40.4% of the strains were resistant to gentamycin and amikacin, respectively. Conclusions: Our study provides useful epidemiologic data for preparation of GBS type-specific vaccines which can prevent GBS infections and antimicrobial agents susceptibility patterns in China. Routine reports on GBS susceptibilities by clinical laboratories and continuous surveillance for changes in the susceptibility are of considerable clinical importance.

75749132762	Antibiotic resistance and molecular analysis of streptococcus pyogenes isolated from healthy school children in China	Streptococcus pyogenes are highly prevalent bacterial pathogens, especially in school-aged children. However, the characteristics of asymptomatic carriers vary geographically in different countries. We aimed to investigate S. pyogenes isolated from healthy schoolchildren in China. From 2007 to 2008, a total of 94 S. pyogenes isolates were obtained from healthy schoolchildren in Beijing and Chongqing, China. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, determination of macrolide resistance genes (ermB, ermA and mefA), emm genotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. The resistance rate to macrolides was 96.8% and to tetracycline was 92.6%. All macrolide-resistant isolates exhibited constitutive resistance; 77 isolates (84.6%) had the ermB gene, while 14 isolates (15.4%) had the ermA gene. Among the macrolide-resistant isolates, the most frequent emm type was emm12 (51.6%), followed by emm22 (14.3%) and ST1815 (8.8%). PFGE analysis revealed 12 different patterns, with a given pattern having the same sequence type (ST) by MLST and the same emm type. In conclusion, the rate of macrolide resistance to S. pyogenes is currently very high in China. This is due primarily to the dissemination of a limited number of clones. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

77649208136	Skin and soft tissue infections caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus among children in China	Aim: To investigate the characteristic of community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) among children in China. Methods: Forty-seven children with CA-MRSA SSTIs were enrolled in this study. Clinical information was collected and analysed. The strains from the children were analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcus cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and spa typing. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene was also detected. Results: The majority of the 47 cases were impetigo (20; 42.6%) and abscesses (14; 29.8%). The rest was cellulites, infected wounds, omphalitis, paronychia and conjunctivitis combined folliculitis. Thirty-two of the isolates (68.1%) were PVL-positive, and the abscesses infected with PVL-positive strains usually required incision and drainage (87.5% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.026). Most of the isolates belonged to ST type 59, which accounted for 46.8%, followed by ST1 (7/47, 14.9%) and ST910 (5/47, 10.6%). The clone of ST59-MRSA-IV with t437 was the most prevalent one. The multiresistant rate of these strains was 93.6%. Conclusion: The most common disease of CA-MRSA SSTIs was impetigo, and PVL-positive abscess was associated with incision and drainage. ST59-MRSA-IV with t437 was the most prevalent clone, and the multiresistant rate was high in Chinese children. © 2009 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

76149144361	Prevalence of fibronectin-binding protein in Streptococcus pyogenes and its relationship with macrolide resistance	Objective: To study the prevalence of the fibronectin-binding protein encoding genes in Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from Chinese children and examine the relationship between such genes and macrolide resistance. Methods: A total of 239 strains of S. pyogenes were collected from 3 children's hospitals in China, including 191 from patients with invasive or noninvasive infections, and 48 from asymptomatic carriers. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 macrolide antibiotics against these isolates were determined by microdilution technique, emm was typed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. The fibronectin-binding protein encoding genes prtF1 and prtF2 and macrolide-resistant genes ermB, ermTR and mefA were amplified by PCR to evaluate their association. Results: ermB gene was identified in 186 strains of the S. pyogenes. ermTR was positive in 11 S. pyogenes isolates. The prevalence of prtF1, prtF2 and prtF1 + prtF2 was 67.36%, 66.11% and 59.0% respectively. The prevalence of prtF1 gene did not show significant difference between the pathogens and the carrier strains. However, the prevalence of prtF2 gene was higher in the strains from asymptomatic carriers than the strains isolated from pharyngitis and scarlet fever. The prevalence of prtF1 + prtF2 genes was higher in the strains of emm12 or emm22 type, but rarely found in the strains of emm1 or emm4 type. It was more frequently to find both prtF1 and prtF2 genes co-existing in the ermB-positive macrolide-resistant Streptococcus isolates. Conclusions: The emm12-type S. pyogenes carrying both prtF1 and prtF2 genes is the most frequently isolated strains in Chinese children. These strains are mostly carried by healthy children. This may be one of the causes contributing to the high level macrolide resistance in the group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus isolates in China.

77649293602	The prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants among clinical isolates of ESBL or AmpC-producing Escherichia coli from Chinese pediatric patients	Three kinds of PMQR determinants (qnr genes, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA) have been discovered and shown to be widely distributed among clinical isolates. To characterize the prevalence of PMQR determinants in ESBL or AmpC-producing E. coli clinical isolates in Chinese children, a total of 292 ESBL or AmpC-producing E. coli clinical isolates collected from five children's hospitals in China from 2005 to 2006 were screened for PMQR determinants by PCR. Twenty (6.8%) of the 292 isolates were positive for PMQR determinants. A total of 12 (4.1%) isolates were positive for qnr genes, comprising three positive for qnrA (1.0%), three for qnrB (1.0%), and six for qnrS (2.1%). Twenty-four (8.2%) isolates were positive for aac(6')-Ib, of which 10 (3.4% of 292) had the -cr variant. There was no qepA gene detected in the isolates. Conjugation revealed that qnr, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and ESBL-encoding genes were transferred together. © 2010 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

77949372594	Molecular characteristics of community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from Chinese children	The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular characteristics of community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) isolates from Chinese children. Ninety-nine isolates were collected from eight hospitals, and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing, staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) type, and spa typing. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene was also detected. Overall, 14 sequence types (STs) were obtained, and ST59 (58.6%) was found to be the most prevalent, followed by ST1 (8%) and ST338 (8%). We also first registered the new ST1409. SCCmec type IV was the most predominant type at 67.7%, followed by SCCmec type V at 32.3%. SCCmec subtypes IVa, IVc, and IVg were found among the SCCmec type IV strains. Twenty-one spa types were also identified. Four new spa types were found by synchronization with the Ridom SpaServer and referring to the website (). ST59-MRSA-IVa with t437 accounted for 40.4% of occurrences, making it the most prevalent clone. The prevalence of PVL genes was 58.6%, and multidrug resistance was observed in 95% of all isolates. This result indicates that CA-MRSA isolates in Chinese children are largely associated with the ST59-MRSA-IV clone, and that the predominant clones of CA-MRSA are spread all over the country. © 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

77951499334	Epidemiology and molecular characteristics of community-associated methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus from skin/soft tissue infections in a children's hospital in Beijing, China	To evaluate the epidemiology and molecular features of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) from children with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in Beijing, China, prospective community-acquired S. aureus SSTIs surveillance was conducted at the Beijing Children's Hospital, Beijing, China, for a 12-month period from August 1, 2008, to July 30, 2009. Susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials was determined by the agar dilution method. Genotypic characteristics of CA-MRSA isolates were tested by SCCmec typing, spa typing, and multilocus sequence typing. Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene was detected. Of 1104 cases, 31.8% (351) were community-acquired S. aureus. CA-MRSA accounted for 4% (14) of S. aureus. Among 14 CA-MRSA and 120 MSSA isolates tested, 100% and 91.7% were multidrug resistant, respectively. ST59-MRSA-IVa-t437 (42.9%) was the most common form of CA-MRSA. Spa typing analysis of 120 MSSA isolates was performed, followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing of a selected number of isolates. The most common spa types among MSSA were t084 (8.3%), t091 (5.8%), t034 (5%), t127 (4.2%), t002 (4.2%), and t796 (4.2%). No predominant spa type was seen. Of the MSSA isolates that could be classified into spa-CCs, 15.0% had a genetic background observed in CA-MRSA clones (spa-CC437, spa-CC342, and spa-CC377). Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)-positive community-acquired S. aureus strains were more commonly associated with skin abscesses than other SSTIs (29.4% versus 5.9%, P < 0.01).In conclusion, CA-MRSA infections are not common among Chinese children with SSTIs. Our findings show that MSSA strains in China have diverse genetic backgrounds. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77950584669	Community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from children with community-onset pneumonia in China	Community-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has been associated with morbidity and mortality in various countries. In this study, we characterized the molecular and clinical features of pediatricCA-MRSApneumonia in China. Between June 2006 and February 2008, 55 previously healthy children confined in eight hospitals countrywide were found to be afflicted with CA-MRSA pneumonia. A total of 55 strains collected from these children were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Staphylococcus cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, and spa typing. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene was also detected. Overall, nine STswere obtained, with ST59 (40.4%) established to be the most prevalent type. We first registered the new ST1409 from a child with necrotizing pneumonia. SCCmecIVa was the most predominant type, followed by SCCmec type V. Twelve spa types were identified, of which one new spa type, t5348,was first detected and registered. One typical livestock-associated spa type, t034, was found in a 4-month-old girl living in the countryside.We also found that 40% of those isolates were PVL-positive. In addition, the median age of the children in this study was 10 months. A total of 69% (38/55) of the children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) had preceding influenza or influenza-like illness, and three ST910-MRSA-IV strains (PVL gene-positive) were associated with severe necrosis. The results indicated that the recent CA-MRSA found in Chinese children with CAP was largely associated with the spread of the ST59-MRSA-IV clone, and most of the PVL-positive strains in this study did not cause necrotic cases. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods: The serogroup 6 and type 6A and 6B of the S. pneumoniae isolates were determined by the quellung reaction using antiserum. Serotype 6C was determined by the multi-bead assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by E-test method for penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, erythromycin, imipenem, vancomycin and levofloxacin. Results: A total of 893 S. pneumoniae strains were isolated from 1997 to 2007, and 119 (13.3%) strains were identified as serogroup 6. The number (proportion) of type 6A, 6B and 6C were 71 (59.7%), 39 (32.7%) and 9 (7.6%), respectively. The non-susceptibility rate to penicillin, cefuroxime and erythromycin increased from 3.4%, 1.7% and 86.2% during 1997-2000 to 29.4%, 23.5% and 100% during 2005-2007, respectively. The values of MIC

77953467777	Mucosal immune effect of group B streptococcal surface immunogenic protein	Objective: To investigate the mucosal immune effect of group B streptococcal surface immunogenic protein (Sip). Methods: Gp-Sip and pET-Sip were expressed and purified respectively, then analyzed by mass spectrometry. BALB/c mice were immunized with Gp-Sip, and the specific antibody levels in sera and vaginal mucosa extract were determined with pET-Sip. The opsonophagocytic activity of Sip antisera was determined by opsonophagocytosis test. Results: Mass spectrometry proved that the probability-based mowse scores for Gp-Sip and pET-Sip as group B Sip were 177 and 92 respectively. ELISA showed that both immunization with Sip by intranasal and rectal routes induced high IgG titer in sera and high IgA titer in vaginal mucosa. However, the antibody levels induced by intranasal immunization were significantly higher than those by rectal immunization. No significant differences were observed in IgG and IgA levels induced by Sip + CT at various dosages. Both CT and CpG-ODN1826 as adjuvant enhanced the mucosal immune effect of Sip by intranasal route, which showed no significant difference. Sip antisera increased the phagocytic activity of phagocytes to GBS. Conclusion: Sip showed good mucosal immunogenicity, and the immune effect by intranasal route was superior to that by rectal route. Both CT and CpG-ODN1826 as adjuvant enhanced the immunogenicity of Sip effectively.

Staphylococcus aureus infection according to underlying conditions and type of infection. Methods: An observational cohort study including 4949 patients with . S. aureus infection was conducted. We compared data from patients with MRSA infection with those with MSSA infection. Results: The 30-day mortality rate of MRSA group was significantly higher than that of MSSA group (15.6% vs. 6.2%, . P < 0.001). However, MRSA infection was not found to be independent risk factor for mortality after adjusting for other variables (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.80-1.32). When we analyzed patients with . S. aureus bacteremia (n = 709), MRSA infection was found to be significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis (Adjusted OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.15-2.49). When the 30-day mortality rates were compared according to underlying diseases, the 30-day mortality rate of MRSA group was significantly higher than that of MSSA group in patients with malignancy or renal diseases. MRSA infection was also found to be one of the independent risk factors for mortality in patients with malignancy (adjusted OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.06-2.70) and in those with renal disease (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.0-2.89), after adjustment for host variables. Conclusions: Methicillin resistance adversely affected the outcome of patients with . S. aureus infection, in patients with cancer or renal disease and in those with . S. aureus bacteremia, although MRSA infection was not found to be significantly associated with higher mortality in overall patient population. © 2010 The British Infection Society.

78651424447	Molecular analysis of Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from Chinese children with pharyngitis	Streptococcus pyogenes is an important gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes various human diseases, of which streptococcal pharyngitis is the most common. In this work, a total of 185 S. pyogenes isolated from Chinese children with pharyngitis was analyzed by superantigen (SAg) genes, emm genotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Fifty-eight (31.4%) isolates were also typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The results indicate that most of the emm1 isolates possessed speA (88.5%) and speJ (83.6%), and few isolates possessed speI gene (13.1%). In contrast, none of the emm12-type isolates possessed speJ; few isolates possessed speA (5.2%); and most of the isolates possessed speI (91.7%). PFGE analysis revealed 25 different clusters, and MLST was performed for 2 predominant emm-type isolates; emm12 isolates belonged to ST36 while emm1 isolates belonged to ST28. As far as this collection is concerned, emm1 and emm12 are the prevalent genotypes among S. pyogenes strains associated with children's pharyngitis in China. Most of the pharyngitis strains can be covered by a 26-valent vaccine. A strong correspondence is found only in the direction of emm type for both SAg profiles and PFGE types but not in the reverse direction. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

78650829696	Superantigen gene profiles and presence of exfoliative toxin genes in community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from Chinese children	This study aimed to evaluate the distribution of superantigen gene profiles and the presence of exfoliative toxin genes in community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) isolated from Chinese children, and simultaneously to assess virulence gene profiles and genetic background. Of the CA-MRSA isolates, 88.9% (88/99) harboured toxin genes, with sek as the most frequent toxin gene (62.6 %), followed by seq (61.6 %), seb (60.6 %) and sea (35.4 %). The eta gene was detected only in one ST398-IVa-spa t034 strain. The sed and etd genes were not found in any of the isolates tested. A total of 38 virulence genotypes were observed, of which the genotype seb-sek-seq (27.3 %, 24/88) comprised the majority, followed by sea-seb-sek-seq (18.2 %, 16/88). The enterotoxin gene cluster including seg-sei-sem-sen-seo-seu predominated at a rate of 15.1 %. The relationship among toxin genotypes, toxin genes encoding profiles of mobile genetic elements and genetic background was analysed. Among 66 clonal complex (CC) 59 isolates, 87.9% (58/66) were positive for toxin genes, and 75.8% (50/66) harboured the toxin gene combination seb-sek-seq. Among seb-sek-seq-positive CC59 strains, 42.0% (21/50) also carried the sea gene. CC59 corresponded exclusively to accessory gene regulator 1 (agr-1). The data presented here enhance our current knowledge on the virulence determinants of CA-MRSA. © 2011 SGM.

79951810623	Pneumococcal serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Chinese children hospitalized for pneumonia	A prospective study was performed to determine serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) from Chinese children <5 years old meeting pneumonia criteria. A total of 3865 children were enrolled and 338 S. pneumoniae isolates were obtained. The most frequent serotypes were 19F (55.6%), 19A (13.9%), 23F (10.1%), 6B (4.7%), and 14 (3.6%). The 7-, 10- and 13-valent conjugate vaccines, respectively, covered 76.3%, 76.9%, and 92.3% of isolates. Out of the isolates, six (1.8%) were penicillin resistant. All except 1 of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Serotype 19A showed the highest drug resistance. The use of PCV7 has the potential to prevent a substantial number of pneumococcal infections. However, PCV13 is likely to prevent more episodes of pneumococcal disease in China because of the high rates of 19A. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79954590115	Spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus between the community and the hospitals in Asian countries: An ANSORP study	Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is highly prevalent in hospitals in many Asian countries. Recent emergence of community-associated (CA) MRSA worldwide has added another serious concern to the epidemiology of S. aureus infections. To understand the changing epidemiology of S. aureus infections in Asian countries, we performed a prospective, multinational surveillance study with molecular typing analysis. Methods: We evaluated the prevalence of methicillin resistance in S. aureus isolates in CA and healthcareassociated (HA) infections, and performed molecular characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility tests of MRSA isolates. Results: MRSA accounted for 25.5% of CA S. aureus infections and 67.4% of HA infections. Predominant clones of CA-MRSA isolates were ST59-MRSA-SCCmec type IV-spa type t437, ST30-MRSA-SCCmec type IV-spa type t019 and ST72-MRSA-SCCmec type IV-spa type t324. Previously established nosocomial MRSA strains including sequence type (ST) 239 and ST5 clones were found among CA-MRSA isolates from patients without any risk factors for HA-MRSA infection. CA-MRSA clones such as ST59, ST30 and ST72 were also isolated from patients with HA infections. Conclusions: Our findings confirmed that MRSA infections in the community have been increasing in Asian countries. Data also suggest that various MRSA clones have spread between the community and hospitals as well as between countries. © The Author 2011.

0035858099	Effect of pre-existing immunity for systemic and mucosal immune responses to intranasal immunization with group B Streptococcus type III capsular polysaccharide-cholera toxin B subunit conjugate	The effects of priming with a group B Streptococcus type III capsular polysaccharide (GBS CPS III)-recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB) conjugate, purified GBS CPS III or rCTB alone on the systemic and mucosal immune responses to CPS III after intranasal (i.n.) immunization were investigated in mice. Priming with purified GBS CPS III followed by boosting with GBS CPS III-rCTB conjugate or priming with the conjugate followed by boosting with free CPS induced comparable levels of specific IgG and IgA in both serum and in lungs and vagina. However, i.n. immunization comprising both priming and boosting with conjugate was superior to priming with CPS and boosting with conjugate or the reverse, especially with regard to inducing mucosal IgA anti-CPS responses. All the immunization schemes, except priming and boosting with free CPS, induced high and similar levels of IgG1 in serum. In contrast, mice primed with free CPS III and then boosted with CPS III-rCTB conjugate by the i.n. route failed to produce significant levels of IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 in serum, at difference from mice primed with the conjugate and boosted with either conjugate or free CPS. Pre-immunization with rCTB either i.n. or i.p. did not suppress specific serum IgG responses induced by GBS CPS III-rCTB conjugate intranasally, but did inhibit serum and especially mucosal IgA responses. Our findings suggest that priming with CPS affects the distribution of IgG subclasses to GBS CPS and that pre-existing anti-carrier rCTB immunity can have an inhibitory effect on mucosal immune responses elicited by the conjugate vaccine given by the i.n. route. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0036196103	Antimicrobial susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae among children in Beijing, China, 1999-2000	A study on the nasopharyngeal carriage and antimicrobial susceptibility of Haemophilus influenza among children was conducted in Beijing Children's Hospital from April to May 2000. The study included 292 children between 1 and 60 mo of age with acute upper respiratory tract infection. Nasopharyngeal swabs from these patients were cultured, and 105 Haemophilus influenzae strains were isolated, 3 of which were type b. Antibiotic susceptibility of the strains was determined using disk diffusion and E-tests and the results compared with those of isolates from children with pneumonia in 1999. The carriage rate of Haemophilus influenzae was 36.0% (105/292). It was found that 4.8% and 1.0% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin and cefaclor, respectively, and 5.7%, 16.2% and 77.1% were resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and clarithromycin were uniformly active to all strains. Compared with the data from 1999, there was a significant increase in resistance to tetracycline (from 12.7% in 1999 to 16.2%) and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (from 40.5% in 1999 to 77.1%). Conclusion: H. influenzae isolates from outpatients in Beijing Children's Hospital had low ampicillin resistance and were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistance rates increased rapidly compared with those in the 1999 data. Further surveillance investigations are important for the choice of empiric therapy of acute respiratory tract infection.

79959194735	Type distribution of serogroup 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae and molecular epidemiology of newly identified serotypes 6C and 6D in China	The recently determined serotypes 6C and 6D Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as subtypes 6B-I and 6B-II, were not reported in China. Among the 171 invasive isolates, 19 were identified as serogroup 6. There were equal distribution (42.1%) of 6B-I and 6B-II, 15.8% of 6A and lack of 6C and 6D. Among 1662 noninvasive isolates, 210 were identified as serogroup 6. The rates of types 6A, 6B-I, 6B-II, 6C, and 6D were 42.4%, 21.0%, 29.1%, 4.8%, and 2.9%, respectively. Subtype 6B-II was more resistant to antibiotics than others. The main sequence types (STs) of serotype 6C and 6D isolates were ST2912 and ST982, respectively. These results suggested that all recognized types of serogroup 6 can be found in China and that subtype 6B-II was more drug resistant. The epidemic STs of serotype 6C and 6D did not show genetic association with the STs spreading in other countries. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79959516682	Molecular epidemiology of serotype 19A Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from children in Beijing, 1997-2006	Background Despite the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A, the molecular characteristics of this serotype are yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the homology of the serotype 19A in China. Methods Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing were done to these forty-nine serotype 19A isolates to investigate the relationship between the strains prevalent in Beijing and other regions. Results From 1997 to 2006, the percentage of serotype 19A isolates increased. The susceptibility rate to penicillin and amoxicillin decreased and the resistance rate to cefuroxime increased. ST320 was the most prevalent ST, followed by ST3546. There were six new STs identified in our study. The serotype 19A strains were classified into six different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. ST320, which was associated with two different PFGE patterns (A and D), accounted for 32 isolates, and ST3546, which was associated with two PFGE patterns (B and E), accounted for eight isolates. Conclusions From 2003 onwards, ST320 was the most common ST and the rate of resistance to cefuroxime increased significantly. Further long-term surveys of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 19A are required to monitor ST prevalence and antimicrobial resistance in this important human pathogen.

80053615108	Serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance of 140 pneumococcal isolates from pediatric patients with upper respiratory infections in Beijing, 2010	In the present study, the serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance of S. pneumoniae from pediatric patients with upper respiratory infections in Beijing, 2010 were described. 140 pneumococcal isolates were obtained, and the prevailing five serotypes were 19F (18.6%), 23F (9.3%), 14 (9.3%), 15 (9.3%), and 6A (7.1%). The vaccine coverage of PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 were 43.6%, 43.6%, and 60.0%, respectively. According to the CLSI 2010 criteria, 99.3% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates to erythromycin and azithromycin were 96.4% and 97.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, 64.3% (90/140) of all pneumococcal isolates were multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (MDRSP). PCV13 covered 68.9% (62/90) of MDRSP strains, whereas it was 47.8% (43/90) for PCV7. ErmB was the dominant macrolide-resistance gene, whereas 30.4% pneumococcal isolates expressed both ermB and mefA. No isolate expressed ermTR. The potential coverage of PCV13 is higher than PCV7 and PCV10 because high rates of serotypes 6A and 19A, and the conjugate vaccines could prevent the spread of MDRSP. S. pneumoniae is still sensitive to penicillin. The resistance rate of S. pneumoniae to macrolides is high and ermB is the dominant macrolide-resistance gene in China, so continued surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. pneumoniae may be necessary. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

83055186479	Molecular characterization of group G Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis recovered from patients and healthy people in China	Beta-Hemolytic group G streptococci cause a considerable invasive disease burden and sometimes disease outbreaks. Little is known about the critical epidemiologic parameter of genetic relatedness between isolates. We determined the emm types of 65 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates. We formulated multilocus sequence typing (MLST) primers with 6 of the 7 loci corresponding to the Streptococcus pyogenes MLST scheme. We performed MLST with 69 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates to represent each emm type identified. These strains were further analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Sixteen emm types were observed. Eighteen unique combinations of allelic profiles (sequence types [STs]) were obtained with 12 profiles each accounting for multiple isolates. Forty-one MLST STs were observed. Analysis of the PFGE patterns generated revealed 10 clones. Over 80% of the isolates were distributed in 3 large clones. Isolates within 16 redundantly represented S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis emm types shared identical or nearly identical STs and subtypes of PFGE, demonstrating concordance between the emm type and genetic relatedness. It is conceivable that some particular characteristics in the genomes of these strains are responsible for their predominance in different regions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84856960701	Susceptibility to and resistance determinants of fusidic acid in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from Chinese children with skin and soft tissue infections	This study aims to determine the resistance rates and determinants of fusidic acid among Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from Chinese pediatric patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Between 2008 and 2009, a total of 186 clinical S. aureus isolates were collected from the pediatric patients with SSTIs, abscess (44.6%) was the most common SSTI in children 0-16 years old. Four clinical isolates (4/186, 2.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid. Two of these isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) that carry the fusC gene. The other two isolates were methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) that carry the fusB gene. In the two fusB-positive clinical isolates, the fusB gene was located in a transposon-like element that has 99% identity with a pUB101 fragment from S. aureus. The four fusidic acid-resistant clinical isolates were ST1-MRSA-SCCmecV-t127, ST93-MRSA-SCCmecIII-t202, ST680-MSSA-t5415, and ST680-MSSA-t377. The fusidic acid resistance rate of S. aureus isolated from Chinese pediatric patients with SSTIs was low, and the genes fusB and fusC were the main resistance determinants. The transposon-like element that contains the fusB gene might participate in the transmission of fusidic acid resistance genes. This is the first report regarding the emergence of fusidic acid-resistant clinical S. aureus isolates in mainland China. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

84859300086	Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene sequence variation and phage in methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus from children in mainland China	To determine the variation in the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene sequences and different PVL-encoding phages of Staphylococcus aureus strains collected from children in mainland China, fifty-eight strains with PVL collected from 2007 to 2009 were used. Their molecular characteristics were examined. Primers were designed to sequence the PVL genes. Six PVL-encoding phages (φ{symbol}PVL, φ{symbol}108PVL, φ{symbol}SLT, φ{symbol}Sa2MW, φ{symbol}Sa2958, and φ{symbol}Sa2USA) were identified by PCR. Eleven sequence types (ST) were detected with ST59 (39.7%, 23/58) the most frequent ST, followed by 910 (22.4%, 13/58), and 338 (12.1%, 7/58). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified at 11 locations in the PVL genes. SNP (nucleotide 1396, A→G) and SNP (nucleotide 1546, A→G) were observed in >10 sequences. Four additional SNP were non-synonymous. Both SNP (nucleotide 16, C→A) and SNP (nucleotide 62, C→T) were present in the same ST59 strain. SNP (nucleotide 527, A→G) was present in five strains belonging to ST30, 121, 1, and 93. SNP (nucleotide 1436, A→C) was present in one ST30 strain. Fifteen strains belonging to ST910, ST217, and ST30 carried a PVL phage that had an icosahedral head morphology. Nine ST59 strains carried φ{symbol}108PVL. Three ST88 strains carried a PVL phage that had an elongated head morphology. Twenty-seven strains, including 60.9% (14/23) of ST59 and all ST338 strains, had no detectable phage. In conclusion, sequence variation in PVL genes and PVL-encoding phages was generally related to the lineage. ST59 strains may indeed carry novel PVL phages. © 2012 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84862705052	Epidemiological and molecular characteristics of clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes collected between 2005 and 2008 from Chinese children	The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of Streptococcus pyogenes in children from different cities in mainland China who were diagnosed with scarlet fever, impetigo and pharyngitis, as well as to detect asymptomatic carriers, between 2005 and 2008, and to compare the results with isolates from rural Chinese children with acute glomerulonephritis in 2005 and in the 1990s. Susceptibility tests to determine MICs and analysis of the presence of erythromycin-resistant genes (mefA, ermB and ermA) and emm gene typing were performed on 466 S. pyogenes isolates from Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen. Superantigen genes (speA and speC) were examined by performing PCR on isolates with the most prevalent emm genotype. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin, cefradine and ofloxacin. The highest rate of resistance was against clarithromycin (98.1 %), followed by erythromycin (97.6 %), azithromycin and clindamycin (both 97.2 %), and tetracycline (94.0 %). Among the 466 isolates, 421 (90.3 %) harboured the ermB gene, 145 (31.1 %) were speA-positive and 273 (58.6 %) were speC-positive. The speA gene was common in emm1.0 (88.8 %) and emm6.5 (83.3 %) genotypes. The speC gene was frequently observed in emm4.0 (90.0 %), emm12.0 (69.6 %), emm18.0 (66.7 %), emm22.0 (75.9 %) and emm80.0 (80.0 %) genotypes. The most prevalent emm genotypes in mainland China in recent years were emm1.0 and emm12.0. All isolates remained sensitive to b-lactams and quinolone. © 2012 SGM.

84863115207	Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance and serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in Asian countries: An Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP) study	Antimicrobial resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a serious concern worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, despite the introduction of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). The Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP) performed a prospective surveillance study of 2,184 S. pneumoniae isolates collected from patients with pneumococcal infections from 60 hospitals in 11 Asian countries from 2008 to 2009. Among nonmeningeal isolates, the prevalence rate of penicillin- nonsusceptible pneumococci (MIC,≥4 μg/ml) was 4.6% and penicillin resistance (MIC,≥8 μg/ml) was extremely rare (0.7%). Resistance to erythromycin was very prevalent in the region (72.7%); the highest rates were in China (96.4%), Taiwan (84.9%), and Vietnam (80.7%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 59.3% of isolates from Asian countries. Major serotypes were 19F (23.5%), 23F (10.0%), 19A (8.2%), 14 (7.3%), and 6B (7.3%). Overall, 52.5% of isolates showed PCV7 serotypes, ranging from 16.1% in Philippines to 75.1% in Vietnam. Serotypes 19A (8.2%), 3 (6.2%), and 6A (4.2%) were the most prominent non-PCV7 serotypes in the Asian region. Among isolates with serotype 19A, 86.0% and 79.8% showed erythromycin resistance and MDR, respectively. The most remarkable findings about the epidemiology of S. pneumoniae in Asian countries after the introduction of PCV7 were the high prevalence of macrolide resistance and MDR and distinctive increases in serotype 19A.

84863250802	System and intranasal immunization of group B streptococcal C5a peptide	Objective: To study the system of streptococcal C5a peptidase (ScpB) and the specific antibody levels in serum, lung, vagina and recta after subcutaneous and intranasal immunization with different doses of C5a peptide. Methods: Recombinant protein C5a peptide was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography. The expressed product was identified by SDS-PAGE and peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). BALB/c mice were subcutaneously and intranasally injected with different doses of ScpB. Antibody titer was tested by ELISA. Opsonophagocytosis assay was used to test the function of antibody. Results: ScpB protein was successfully expressed and purified. The probability based mouse score of ScpB was 175 by PMF analysis. ELISA data showed that both subcutaneous and intranasal immunization could elicit significantly higher levels of IgG in immunized mice serum than that of control group (P < 0.01), 30 μg group was better than 5 μg and 10 μg group. Intranasal immunization could elicit higher levels of IgA in lung, vagina and rectum (P < 0.001) while system immunization could not. Opsonophagocytosis tests indicated that anti-serum of ScpB had opsonophagocytic activity than that of control (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The results demonstrated that intranasal immunization with ScpB could induce significantly higher levels of IgG and IgA, and its anti-serum had better opsonic activity.

84863165658	Diversity of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and relation to sequence typing in Streptococcus pneumoniae causing invasive disease in Chinese children	The objective of this paper was to investigate the sequence types (STs) and diversity of surface antigen pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) in 171 invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from Chinese children. A total of 171 pneumococci isolates were isolated from Chinese children with invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in 11 hospitals between 2006 and 2008. The pneumococci samples were characterized by serotyping, PspA classification, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The PspA of these strains could be assigned to two families. The PspA family 2 was the most common (120/171, 70.1%). No PspA family 3 isolates were detected. Family 1 could be subdivided into two clades, with 42 strains in clade 1 and 9 strains in clade 2, and family 2 could be subdivided into clades 3, 4, and 5, which respectively contained 5, 21, and 14 strains. In total, 65 STs were identified, of which ST320 (30/171, 17.5%), ST271 (23/171, 13.5%), and ST876 (18/171, 10.5%) were the most common types. PspA family 2 and family 1 were dominant among pneumococcal clones isolated from Chinese children with invasive disease.

A total of 435 S. aureus isolates were collected. Compared with CA meticillinsusceptible S. aureus (MSSA), the resistance rates of CA-MRSA to ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and tetracycline were higher (19.0 vs 2.6%, P,0.001; 14.7 vs 3.1%, P,0.001; 14.7 vs 3.1 %, P,0.01; and 46.0 vs 13.3%, P,0.001, respectively). Compared with hospital-associated (HA)-MRSA, the resistance rates ofCA-MRSA to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, rifampicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were lower (19 vs 94.8%, P,0.001; 14.7 vs 84.4 %, P,0.001; 5.5 vs 88.3 %, P,0.001; 46 vs 94.8 %, P,0.001; and 1.8 vs 9.1 %, P,0.01, respectively). The resistance rates of CA-MRSA, HA-MRSA and CA-MSSA to clindamycin (92.0, 77.9 and 64.1 %, respectively) and erythromycin (85.9, 77.9 and 63.1 %, respectively) were high. The MDR rates (resistance to three or more non-β-lactams) were 49.6, 100 and 14% in the CA-MRSA, HA-MRSA and CA-MSSA isolates, respectively.

0037133368	Chromosomal analysis of group B streptococcal clinical strains; bac gene-positive strains are genetically homogenous	A collection of 45 epidemiologically unrelated Streptococcus agalactiae strains (group B Streptococcus, GBS), belonging to different serotypes, isolated from pregnant women in China and Russia was studied. Strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) employing hybridization with nine genes potentially involved in virulence. Molecular sizes of GBS genomes varied from 2030 to 2290 kb. Location of the genes under study bac, bca, glnA, scpB, cyl, hylB, lmb, scaA and cfb on the GBS genomes was found to be conserved irrelevant to the serotype. Potential virulence genes scpB, hylB, lmb were located on a 91-kb SmaI fragment that is equal to 4.5% of total genome. Ribotyping of the strains under study revealed three different HindIII, nine EcoRI and 12 PvuII ribotypes among 45 strains. A strong correlation between the PvuII ribotype and the presence of the bac gene was observed, with 21 of 22 bac-positive strains belonging to the same PvuII ribotype P1. PFGE patterns of bac-positive strains were also similar. The possibility of close genetic relatedness of all bac-positive strains is discussed. © 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

84876088093	Genotype replacement within serotype 23F Streptococcus pneumoniae in Beijing, China: Characterization of serotype 23F	We investigated the genetic structure of 99 isolates of serotype 23F Streptococcus pneumoniae from children with acute respiratory infections collected over two periods from 1997 to 2006, and 2010. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; 97 were resistant to erythromycin, 95 of which carried the ermB gene and two carried both mefA/E and ermB genes. Multidrug resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics was exhibited by 90 isolates. Sequence types ST342 and ST81 were the most frequent in 1997-2006 and 2010, respectively. All CC81 isolates were non-susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics and had higher minimum inhibitory concentration values for penicillin than other clone complexes and sequence types. The increased β-lactam antibiotic resistance may have resulted from the replacement of multidrug-resistant clones related to ST81. Long-term studies on S. pneumoniae serotype 23F, especially the ST81 clone, should be conducted to better understand the epidemiological picture of this pathogen in China. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

84879516720	Serotype Distribution and Antimicrobial Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae Isolates Causing Invasive Diseases from Shenzhen Children's Hospital	Objective:To provide guidance for clinical disease prevention and treatment, this study examined the epidemiology, antibiotic susceptibility, and serotype distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) associated with invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs) among children less than 14 years of age in Shenzhen, China.Materials and Methods:All the clinical strains were isolated from children less than 14 years old from January 2009 to August 2012. The serotypes and antibiotic resistance of strains of S. pneumoniae were determined using the capsular swelling method and the E-test.Results:A total of 89 strains were isolated and 87 isolates were included. The five prevailing serotypes were 19F (28.7%), 14 (16.1%), 23F (11.5%), 19A (9.2%) and 6B (6.9%). The most common sequence types (ST) were ST271 (21.8%), ST876 (18.4%), ST320 (8.0%) and ST81 (6.9%) which were mainly related to 19F, 14, 19A and 23F, respectively. The potential coverage by 7-, 10-, and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were 77.0%, 77.0%, and 89.7%, respectively. Among the 87 isolates investigated, 11.5% were resistant to penicillin, and for meningitis isolates, the resistance rate was 100%. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was exhibited by 49 (56.3%) isolates. Eighty-four isolates were resistance to erythromycin, among which, 56 (66.7%) carried the ermB gene alone and 28 (33.3%) expressed both the ermB and mefA/E genes.Conclusions:The potential coverage of PCV13 is higher than PCV7 and PCV10 because high rates of serotypes 19A and 6A in Shenzhen. The clinical treatment of IPD needs a higher drug concentration of antibiotics. Continued surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes distribution of IPD isolates may be necessary. © 2013 Ma et al.

84881234637	Molecular characterization and antimicrobial resistance of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from children with skin and soft tissue infections	Objective The present study aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aurecs (CA-MRSA) isolates from children with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Methods A total of 60 CA-MRSA isolates were collected from children with SSTIs. The clinical data were recorded. The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The spa type was also analyzed by PCR. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene was detected. The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined with 15 antibiotics. Results Among the 60 SSTI cases, the most common form of the disease was abscess (n = 25, 41.7 %), followed by impetigo (n = 12, 20%). Twelve ST types were identified. The most common type was ST59 (n = 29, 48.3%), followed by ST88 and ST1 (6 each, 10.0%). Four SCCmec types were found. The most common type was SCCmecIV (55.0%, 33/60), followed by SCCmecV (28.3%, 17/60), SCCmecIII (15.0%, 9/60), and SCCmecII (1.7%, 1/60). Among the 21 spa types, the most common was t437 (46.7%). The prevalence of PVL was 50% in the CA-MRSA strains tested. The percentage of the CA-MRSA strains resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin was 90.0 %, 80.0 %, 46.7 %, 38.3 %, 38.3 %, 33.3 %, 28.3%, 11.6%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. The prevalence of multidrug resistant strains was 73.3%. Conclusions The most frequently isolated bacterial clones were MR-SA-ST59-SCCmecIVa-t437 and MRSA-ST59-SCCmecV-t437 in the children with SSTIs caused by CA-MRSA. The multidrug resistant strain was highly prevalent. Erythromycin and clindamycin should not be preferred in empiric treatment of children with community-acquired SSTIs.

84881354147	Molecular and Clinical Characteristics of Clonal Complex 59 Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infections in Mainland China	Detailed molecular analyses of Clonal Complex 59 (CC59) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from children in seven major cities across Mainland China were examined. A total of 110 CC59 isolates from invasive and non-invasive diseases were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), Staphylococcus cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Antibiotics susceptibilities, carriage of plasmids and 42 virulence genes and the expression of virulence factors were examined. ST59 (101/110, 91.8%) was the predominant sequence type (ST), while single locus variants (SLVs) belonging to ST338 (8/110, 7.3%) and ST375 (1/110, 0.9%) were obtained. Three SCCmec types were found, namely type III (2.7%), type IV (74.5%) and type V (22.7%). Seven spa types including t437, which accounted for 87.3%, were determined. Thirteen PFGE types were obtained. PFGE types A and B were the major types totally accounting for 81.8%. The dominant clone was ST59-t437-IVa (65.5%), followed by ST59-t437-V (14.5%). The positive rate of luks-PV and lukF-PV PVL encoding (pvl) gene was 55.5%. Plasmids were detected in 83.6% (92/110) of the strains. The plasmid size ranging from 23.4 kb to 50 kb was most prevalent which accounted for 83.7% (77/92). A significantly lower expression of hla was found in ST59-t437-IVa compared with ST59-t437-V. Among the 110 cases, 61.8% of the patients were less than 1 year old. A total of 90 cases (81.8%) were community-associated (CA) infections whereas 20 cases (18.2%) were hospital-associated (HA) infections. Out of the 110 patients, 36.4% (40/110) were diagnosed with invasive infectious diseases in which ST59-t437-IVa accounted for 67.5% (27/40). In brief, ST59-t437-IVa was proved as the dominant clone in CC59 MRSA strains. The carriage rate of pvl gene was high. CC59 MRSA could result in CA and HA infections. The majortiy of MRSA infection children were in young age. © 2013 Li et al.

84885385252	Hospital- and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: A 6-year surveillance study of invasive infections in Chinese children	Aim To investigate and compare the characteristics of invasive hospital-associated (HA) and community-associated (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in Chinese children. Methods Clinical data on 59 paediatric patients with invasive MRSA isolated from the normally sterile sites between 2006 and 2011 were obtained from the clinical MRSA surveillance database of Beijing Children's Hospital. The molecular characteristics of the invasive MRSA strains were then analysed. Results Invasive MRSA infections rose from 0.89 per 10 000 admissions in 2006 to 3.75 in 2011, with a notable increase in invasive CA-MRSA infections from 0 to 2.43 over the same period. The median age of the CA patients (n = 29) was 0.33 years, compared with 1.17 years for the HA patients (n = 30). Multisite infection, severe pneumonia and empyema were found in 55.2%, 73.1% and 61.5% of CA children and in 30%, 32% and 24% of HA patients, respectively. ST59-MRSA-IVa accounted for 40.7% of all isolates and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene carriage rate was significantly higher in patients with necrotizing pneumonia and osteoarthritis than in those with other diseases. Conclusion The incidence of paediatric invasive MRSA infection, particularly CA-MRSA infection, increased in Chinese children between 2006 and 2011. The invasive infections caused by CA-MRSA occurred more frequently in younger children with more severe pneumonia or empyema. ©2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

0141838026	Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance Streptococcus pneumoniae in Chinese children: Four hospitals surveillance	Objective. To investigate the nasal carriage of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci in children of < 5 years old in the following four cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an. Methods. A total of 647 pneumococci strains were isolated and detected. Minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics were determined by E-test. Disk diffusion test was used for the measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility. Results. Prevalence of penicillin non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae in the four cities was 41%, with Guangzhou (60.8%) ranking first, followed by Xi'an (45%), Shanghai (37%) and Beijing (25.9%). The majority of penicillin non-susceptibility isolates (23.9% - 53.8%) had a low level of resistance ( MIC 0.64 - 1.5 μg/ml). The most sensitive antimicrobials in terms of percentage of susceptible organisms were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (99.4%), followed by ceftriaxone (92.1%); cefurxime and cefaclor were slightly more sensitive than penicillin with susceptibility of 74.8% and 77.9%. Erythromycin, tetracycline and TMP-SMZ were highly resistant (83.6%, 82.1 % and 76.2% respectively ). Among erythromycin resistant isolates, 100% were resistant to azithromycin, 98.6% to clarithromycin, 97.2% to roxithromycin and spiramycin, and 96.6% to clindamycin. 97.2% (141/145) were typical of the macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramons B (MLSB) resistance phenotype, and 2. 8% (4/145) were M phenotype. The group of PRSP was with significantly higher rates of non-susceptibility for ceftriaxone (18.4%), cefurxime (58.6%), cefaclor (53.4% ), compared with the group of PEN-S (0.5%, 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively) and the rate of multi-drug resistance in the isolates of PRSP group (92.9%) was significantly higher than that of PEN-S group (59.2%). Conclusion. The rates of penicillin and multi-drug resistance among isolates of pneumococci carried nasally in are high children and the high prevalence of multi-drug resistance in the Chinese population may be becoming one of the most serious problems in this century.

0041764359	Antibiotics resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae and correlates of pbp2b-gene amplicom profile to penicillin resistance	Objective: To investigate the prevalence of penicillin and other antibiotics nonsusceptibility (including intermediate and resistant) among Pneumococci and to assess the correlation of pbp2b amplicon profiles to penicillin resistance in pneumococcal isolates by PCR and RFLP analysis. Method: Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by broth microdilution, E-test, and K-B disk. Primers pF and pR were used to amplify the pbp2b gene and its amplicon was subjected to Hae III digestion. Results: The percentage of nonsusceptilibity of S. pneumococcal to penicillin G raised from 9.9% in 1997 to 14.6% in 2000; pbp2b amplicon of 97.5% (39/40) pneumococcal isolates for which MICs of penicillin were ≤0.094μg/ml had one of three different susceptible restriction profiles, and 86.7% (26/30) isolates for which MICs were ≥ 0.12μg/ml had one of six. Low-concentration penicillin resistance (MICs = 0.12μg/ml to 0.5μg/ml) was associated with sensitive Hae III profiles (s1) in 4 isolates. Conclusion: Penicillin and beta-lactams retained their activity against S. pneumoniae in Beijing. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of pneumococcal pbp2b-specific amplicons is feasible for penicillin resistance screening.

84892893958	Comparative analysis of the virulence characteristics of epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from Chinese children: ST59 MRSA highly expresses core gene-encoded toxin	This study aims to investigate the prevalence of a novel cell wall-anchored protein gene, sasX, and to obtain information on the genetic basis for the pathogenic potential of the MRSA strains isolated from Chinese children. The molecular and virulence characteristics of the clinical strains were analyzed. Twenty-two sequence types (STs) were obtained, with six epidemic clones ST59, ST239, ST1, ST910, ST88, and ST338 accounting for 35.8, 22, 6.6, 6.6, 5.3, and 4.1% respectively. The expression levels of hla, psmα, and RNAIII were higher in ST59 than in other STs (p < 0.05). The sasX gene was detected in 26 (10.7%) MRSA isolates. ST239-MRSA-SCCmecIII-t037 (61.5%) was the predominant sasX-positive MRSA clone. The expressions of PSMα and RNAIII were higher in sasX-positive ST239 isolates than in sasX-negative ST239 ones (p < 0.01). Notably, the percentage of invasive infection in infections caused by sasX-positive ST239 MRSA was higher than that by sasX-negative ST239 MRSA (p = 0.008). This study indicated that ST59 was the predominant clone in the MRSA isolates obtained from Chinese children and might have stronger pathogenic potential. The prevalence of the sasX gene in the MRSA isolates from children was relatively low. Furthermore, the sasX gene might be related to the expressions of PSMα and RNAIII and infection invasiveness. © 2013 APMIS Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd..

84893105986	Spread of multidrug-resistant clonal complex 271 of serotype 19F Streptococcus pneumoniae in Beijing, China: Characterization of serotype 19F	We investigated the genetic structure of 120 isolates of serotype 19F Streptococcus pneumoniae from Chinese children with acute respiratory infections collected from 1997 to 2006, and 2010. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and levofloxacin, and only five strains were not susceptible to penicillin. The non-susceptibility rate to cephalosporins increased from 1997 to 2010. Of 119 erythromycin-resistant strains, 60 carried both ermB and mefA genes. The percentage of clonal complex 271 (CC271) increased from 14·3% in 1997-1998 to 92% in 2010, whereas that of CC983 decreased from 64·3% to 0%. CC271 had a higher non-susceptibility rate to β-lactam antibiotics than CC983 and other CCs. The increased non-susceptibility rate to β-lactam antibiotics in serotype 19F pneumococci was found to be associated with the spread of the international resistant clone CC271 presumably caused by antibiotic pressure. Long-term surveys of serotype 19F S. pneumoniae are required to monitor CC prevalence and trends in antimicrobial resistance. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2013.

84911109487	Research advance in prevention policies of neonatal group B streptococcus infection	Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is responsible for two distinct clinical syndromes in the newborn period categorised as either early- or late-onset GBS disease. Maternal GBS colonization of gastrointestinal tract or vaginal is the major risk factor for GBS diseases. There are two main strategies for identifying women at risk of giving birth to a GBS-infected infant: universal screening strategy and risk-based assessment. In the United States and other countries, the implementation of maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis policies has significantly reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS disease, but has little effect on the incidence of late-onset GBS disease. Penicillin is the first choice for antibiotic prophylaxis treatment. GBS strains which are isolated from pregnant women who are allergic to penicillin should undergo antibiotic susceptibility testing. Antibiotic prophylaxis measures have some disadvantages, so researchers should actively develop other precautions to prevent GBS infection.

11144279504	Alterations of murM gene and high-level penicillin-resistant as well as ceftriaxone resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae	Objective: To investigate the correlation between the variation of murM gene and penicillin-resistant and ceftriaxone resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methods: To amplify murM gene from chromosomal DNA of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates by PCR and then sequenced. Fifty-five strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were chosen, containing 10 penicillin-susceptible strains (MIC≤0.06μg/ml), 10 low-level penicillin-resistant strains (MIC 0.12-1μg/ml), 35 high-level penicillin-resistant strains(MIC≥2μg/ml), 13 of those were resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC≥2μg/ml). The nucleotide sequence of the murM gene from susceptible strain R36A was used as the control for comparison. Results: There were 16 strains in which the sequence of murM gene showed a striking divergence. One strain(penicillin MIC 3μg/ml, ceftriaxone MIC≥2μg/ml)revealed 3.4% nucleotide sequence divergence from the strain R36A. Fifteen strains revealed 10% nucleotide sequence divergence, in which penicillin MIC≥8μg/ml and/or ceftriaxone MIC≥2μg/ml. The variations of murM genes displayed a mosaic pattern. The variation of murM gene was closely associated with penicillin MIC and ceftriaxone MIC (

11144356592	Fluoroquinolone Resistance in Clinical Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from Asian Countries: ANSORP Study	Seventeen clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae showing reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 4 μg/ml) collected from eight different Asian countries were analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility, serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and DNA sequencing of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) in gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE. All isolates but one showed more than one amino acid alteration in QRDRs of four responsible genes. Ile460 → Val in parE was the most common mutation. Data suggest that Lys137 → Asn in parC may be a primary step in the development of high-level and multiple FQ resistance. An additional mutation of Ser81 → Phe in gyrA resulted in high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and gatifloxacin, whereas Ser79 → Phe in parC may exert an important role in the development of moxifloxacin resistance. Two novel amino acid changes in gyrB, Ala390 → Val and Asn423 → Thr, were found. Data from PFGE suggest an introduction and local spread of multiple resistant Spain

1142286466	ISSa4-Based Differentiation of Streptococcus agalactiae Strains and Identification of Multiple Target Sites for ISSa4 Insertions	A collection of 113 epidemiologically unrelated Streptococcus agalactiae strains were studied (group B streptococcus; GBS): they belonged to different serotypes and were isolated from pregnant women in China and Russia. The insertion sequence ISSa4 was found in 21 of 113 strains (18,6%). All of the strains with ISSa4 belonged to serotypes II and II/c and were characterized by the presence of IS1381 and IS861 as well as the absence of IS1548 and GBSi1. All of the strains with ISSa4 possessed both bca and bac virulence genes coding for α and β antigens, respectively. Among 21 ISSa4-positive strains, 13 different HindIII patterns (D1 to D13) hybridizing with an ISSa4 probe were found. One of them (D13) contained a single HindIII hybridization fragment 6.5 kb in size that was found to be specific for all ISSa4-positive GBS strains. Multiple target sites for insertions of ISSa4 were identified and included a putative pathogenicity island, "housekeeping" genes, and intergenic regions, as well as the genes for hypothetical proteins. No significant similarity was observed in the sequences of the target genes for ISSa4 insertions, in the relative location of the target genes on the chromosome, or the biological functions of the encoded proteins. The possible significance of ISSa4-based differentiation of the strains and the presence of possible "hot spots" for insertions of ISSa4 in GBS genome are discussed.

12144291202	Macrolide resistance and genotypic characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Asian countries: A study of the Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP)	Objectives: To characterize mechanisms of macrolide resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae from 10 Asian countries during 1998-2001. Methods: Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the isolates and their resistance mechanisms. Results: Of 555 isolates studied, 216 (38.9%) were susceptible, 10 (1.8%) were intermediate and 329 (59.3%) were resistant to erythromycin. Vietnam had the highest prevalence of erythromycin resistance (88.3%), followed by Taiwan (87.2%), Korea (85.1%), Hong Kong (76.5%) and China (75.6%). Ribosomal methylation encoded by erm(B) was the most common mechanism of erythromycin resistance in China, Taiwan, Sri Lanka and Korea. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, efflux encoded by mef(A) was the more common in erythromycin-resistant isolates. In most Asian countries except Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, erm(B) was found in >50% of pneumococcal isolates either alone or in combination with mef(A). The level of erythromycin resistance among pneumococcal isolates in most Asian countries except Thailand and India was very high with MIC
