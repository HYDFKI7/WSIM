1842634337	Diagnosis and Management of Immune-mediated Neuropathies	Immune-mediate neuropathies, or inflammatory neuropathies are neuropathies due to the dysregulation of the immune system. The injury to peripheral nerves can be divided into two phases: an early stage of immune injury, and a later stage of structural damage. The overall effects are axonal degeneration or demyelination depending on the target of immunological attacks. According to time course, there are two major types: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Clinical manifestations of both diseases include progressive motor weakness and sensory disturbance with some variations among different patients. The major findings of nerve conduction studies on GBS patients are prolonged distal motor latencies and minimal F-wave latencies with variable reduction of nerve conduction velocities. In CIDP patients, slowed nerve conduction velocities are the usual findings in addition to prolongation of distal motor latencies and minimal F-wave latencies. Certain subtypes of immune-mediated neuropathies are associated with high titers of anti-gangliosdie antibodies. Patients with GBS and CIDP can benefit from immunotherapy. For GBS, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are equally effective in reducing complications and neurological disability. Steroid of high dose is, however, harmful to GBS. Plasma exchange and IVIG can alleviate neurological deficits of CIDP with steroid to maintain the effects of plasma exchange and IVIG. In conclusion, careful clinical observations and judgment are the most important issue to manage patients with immune-mediated neuropathies.

22244486283	Reinnervation of muscular targets by nerve regeneration through guidance conduits	We established histopathologic and neurophysiologic approaches to examine whether different designs of polycaprolactone-engineered nerve conduits (hollow vs. laminated) could promote nerve regeneration as autologous grafts after transection of sciatic nerves. The assessments included morphometric analysis at the level of sciatic nerve, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and gastrocnemius muscle, and nerve conduction studies on sciatic nerves. Six months after nerve grafting, the nerve fiber density in the hollow-conduit group was similar to that in the autologous-graft group; the laminated-conduit group only achieved ∼20% of these values. The consequences of these differences were reflected in nerve growth into muscular targets; this was demonstrated by combined cholinesterase histochemistry for NMJ and immunohistochemistry for nerve fibers innervating NMJ with an axonal marker, protein gene product 9.5. Hollow conduits had similar index of NMJ innervation as autologous grafts; the values were higher than those of laminated conduits. Among the 3 groups there were same patterns of differences in the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers and amplitudes of compound muscle action potential. These results indicate that hollow conduits were as efficient as autologous grafts to facilitate nerve regeneration, and provide a multidisciplinary approach to quantitatively evaluate muscular reinnervation after nerve injury.

0029859323	Acute motor axonal neuropathy: An antibody-mediated attack on axolemma	The acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) form of the Guillain-Barre syndrome is a paralytic disorder of abrupt onset characterized pathologically by motor nerve fiber degeneration of variable severity and by sparing of sensory fibers. There is little demyelination or lymphocytic inflammation. Most cases have antecedent infection with Campylobacter jejuni and many have antibodies directed toward GM1 ganglioside-like epitopes, but the mechanism of nerve-fiber injury has not been defined. In 7 fatal cases of AMAN, immunocytochemistry demonstrated the presence of IgG and the complement activation product C3d bound to the axolemma of motor fibers. The most frequently involved site was the nodal axolemma, but in more severe cases IgG and C3d were found within the periaxonal space of the myelinated internodes, bound to the outer surface of the motor axon. These results suggest that AMAN is a novel disorder caused by an antibody- and complement-mediated attack on the axolemma of motor fibers.

0029879142	Early nodal changes in the acute motor axonal neuropathy pattern of the Guillain-Barré syndrome	The axonal patterns of Guillain-Barré syndrome, associated in many cases with antecedent Campylobacter jejuni infection, are now recognized as frequent causes of acute flaccid paralysis in some regions of the world. This study examined ultrastructurally the PNS of seven cases of the acute motor axonal neuropathy form of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In this disorder previous studies of advanced cases have found Wallerian-like degeneration of motor fibres in the spinal roots and peripheral nerves, with little lymphocytic inflammation or demyelination. The present study was focused on identifying early changes and establishing the sequence of changes. By electron microscopy the earliest and mildest changes consisted of lengthening of the node of Ranvier with distortion of the paranodal myelin, and in some instances with breakdown of the outermost myelin terminal loops. At this stage many nodes had overlying macrophages which extended their processes through the Schwann cell basal lamina covering the node and apposed the axolemma. Macrophage processes then extended beneath the myelin terminal loops, and the whole macrophage entered the periaxonal space at the paranode. Macrophage processes dissected the axon from the adaxonal Schwann cell plasmalemma and the macrophages advanced into the internodal periaxonal space, where they typically surrounded a condensed-appearing axon. At this stage the adaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm regularly degenerated and disappeared, so that the periaxonal space was bounded by the innermost myelin lamella, and the axolemma of many fibres could not be seen. The internodal myelin sheath and the abaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm remained normal. This arrangement appeared to be stable for some time, but in many fibres the axon subsequently underwent Wallerian-like degeneration. By interfering with impulse conduction, these nodal and periaxonal changes may explain paralysis in some pathologically mild cases. In addition, at early stages, these changes may be reversible, thus explaining the rapid recovery of some patients who become paralysed with acute motor axonal neuropathy. These observations, taken together with previous studies, suggest that acute motor axonal neuropathy is an antibody- and complement-mediated disorder in which the relevant epitopes are present on the nodal and internodal axolemma.

0030124630	Assessing small-fiber sensory neuropathy: quantitative sensory testing and sural nerve biopsy	Sensory neuropathies involving small-fibers (mostly the unmyelinated axons) are frequently encountered in systemic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, the most prevalent ones. Conventional evaluation includes nerve conduction studies (NCS), which access predominantly large myelinated fibers. Other approaches include quantitative sensory testing (QST) and nerve biopsy. We evaluated the clinical feasibility of these methods for neuropathic patients. Neuropathic patients had higher detection thresholds for cold- and warm-sensations than normal subjects. The differences were more obvious in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs, consisting with the idea of length-dependent process of neuropathy. Nerve biopsy is valuable in evaluating of the pathology of neuropathy, exhibiting varying degrees of demyelination and Wallerian-like degeneration. The loss of unmyelinated fibers is recognizable by nerve biopsy, although a quantifying procedure is necessary for objective assessment of the severity of neuropathy. We conclude that multi-disciplinary approaches including QST, NCS, nerve biopsy and skin biopsy, which is under developing, will provide complementary information for better diagnosis and understanding of small-fiber sensory neuropathy.

0029807225	Epidermal denervation and its effects on keratinocytes and Langerhans cells	Skin innervation has been considered to subserve sensory perception only, but several lines of evidence suggest that there are 'effector' influences of skin innervation on the immune system and keratinocytes. In this study, we transected the sciatic nerves of rats and examined the effects of denervation on the epidermis. In normal skin, the epidermis was densely innervated by fine axons that were immunostained with several axonal markers, including neuronal ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase (protein gene product 9.5). All of the epidermal axons in the regions innervated by sciatic nerve disappeared within 24-48 h after transection of sciatic nerve, and remained absent as long as subsequent reinnervation by regenerating axonal sprouts was prevented. Denervation produced changes in both the keratinocytes and the Langerhans cells, the bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells of the epidermis. The thickness of epidermis decreased within 7 days. By 48 h after transection, the Langerhans cells and their dendritic processes became intensely immunoreactive for protein gene product. Protein gene product 9.5 expression on Langerhans cells remained prominent as long as skin was denervated, but disappeared with reinnervation. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated the presence of the transcripts for protein gene product 9.5 in epidermis, consistent with the synthesis of the protein by the Langerhans cells. We conclude that epidermal sensory fibres have novel influences on both keratinocytes and Langerhans cells of the epidermis.

0030840412	Ultrastructural localization and regulation of protein gene product 9.5	PROTEIN gene product 9.5 (PGP), a ubiquitin hydrolase, is abundant in the nervous system. To investigate the ultrastructural localization of PGP and the regulation of its expression, we performed electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) on normal and transected rat sciatic nerves. In normal nerves, strong PGP-immunoreactivity was localized in the myelinated and unmyelinated axons with virtually no staining in the Schwann cells. After nerve degeneration, denervated Schwann cells exhibited intense staining for PGP, corroborated with up-regulation of PGP transcripts by RT-PCR. The present data suggest that the pattern of expression of PGP is more complicated than was expected previously, and reflects the integrity of nerves and status of axon-Schwann cell interactions.

0030862213	Skin innervation and its effects on the epidermis	Sensory innervation of the skin subserves protective sensations for the body to prevent thermal and noxious injuries. Neurophysiologically, they belong to the categories of Aδ and C fibers, usually with caliber less than one μm in diameter. Morphological demonstration of the terminals of these nerves in the epidermis has been recognized recently by sensitive immunocytochemistry and an axonal marker, the protein gene product 9.5 (PGP). PGP is a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, which is abundantly present in the nervous system, and particularly enriched in the unmyelinated nerves. Sensory nerves positive for PGP arise from the dorsal root ganglion, pass through the dermis, parallel the epidermis-dermis border, penetrate the basement membrane, move vertically and upwards in the epidermis with tortuous course and knobby appearance, and finally terminate at the granular layers of the epidermis. In rodents, denervation of the skin results in degeneration of epidermal nerves within 48 h of nerve transection, and thinning of the epidermis. In humans, application of this technique to evaluate disorders of the peripheral nervous system makes study of the degeneration of sensory nerve terminals possible. Patients with sensory neuropathy had fewer epidermal nerves than normal subjects, consistent with the notion of distal axonopathy. This approach has the potential to evaluate human sensory neuropathy in temporal and spatial domains. In addition, the influences of epidermal denervation open a new field to explore the interactions between sensory nerves and keratinocytes.

0031411537	Clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies	Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) are inflammatory peripheral neuropathies with major differences in the course and duration of the illness. To determine if there are distinct features between these two pathologically similar disorders, we conducted this study and compared them clinically and electrophysiologically. There were fifteen patients in each group, and the analysis was based on: (1) the demographic data, (2) the clinical presentation and the findings of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and (3) the patterns of electrophysiological studies. In both groups, male patients were predominantly affected, with age of onset mainly in their fifth decade. Distal motor weakness and general hypo- or a-reflexia were the common features. Sensory impairment was more commonly seen in CIDP patients; facial and bulbar muscle weakness occurred more frequently in GBS patients. Both groups had increased CSF protein concentrations (15.7 ± 63.7 mg/dl in GBS and 174.6 ± 43 mg/dl in CIDP, P > 0.05). Eighty percent of CIDP patients followed a relapsing course. We compared GBS and CIDP according to the electrophysiological findings of the median nerves. The CIDP patients had more prolonged distal motor latencies and slower nerve conduction velocities than the GBS patients. A large proportion of CIDP patients had partial conduction block and temporal dispersion, the hallmarks of focal demyelination. There were more F-wave abnormalities in the CIDP group than in the GBS group. We concluded that GBS and CIDP are clinically and electrophysiologically distinct besides a difference in the duration of illness.

0031458821	Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies: A clinical and electrophysiological study	The core manifestation of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is recurrent focal neuropathy at the entrapment sites precipitated by trivial injuries. Clinically, HNPP simulates mononeuropathy or mononeuropathy multiplex. Pathologically, it is characterized by tomacula, redundant myelin folding. HNPP is an autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance and variable expression. While examining a patient with unusual presentation of multiple mononeuropathies, we identified an HNPP kindred in Taiwan and conducted extensive clinical and electrophysiological examinations. Among the fifteen family members examined, seven of them were clinically affected, with involvement of the median, ulnar and peroneal nerves. Eleven of the fifteen members had abnormal results on nerve conduction studies. The most frequently affected nerve was the median nerve, with prolonged distal motor latency and slowed sensory nerve conduction. Some of the members exhibited a pattern of generalized polyneuropathy. Our results indicate that HNPP is under-recognized because many of the HNPP family members are subclinically affected. Clinical suspicion and positive family history are important for setting the diagnosis.

0031258437	Sensory and motor denervation influence epidermal thickness in rat foot glabrous skin	Denervation in man often results in shiny, dry, thin skin. A previous study has shown that the epidermis of glabrous skin in the rat becomes approximately 40% thinner within 1 week following sciatic nerve transection, but which nerve fiber type or types influence epidermal thickness is unknown. In this study, we compared the effects on the epidermis of selective sensory, motor, and sympathetic denervation. Protein gene product 9.5 and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunocytochemical staining were used to determine the extent of denervation of epidermis, dermis, and sweat glands in the footpads. Epidermal thickness of the glabrous plantar skin of the foot was measured to verify the specificity and reliability of each animal model, the relevant regions of the peripheral nervous system were examined by light or electron microscopy or both. Epidermal thickness decreased significantly following sciatic nerve transection (58% of control, P < 0.05) and dorsal root ganglionectomy (59%; P < 0.05). The thickness also decreased following lumbar ventral rhizotomy (61%; P < 0.01), destruction of lumbar spinal motor neurons (66%; P < 0.05), and botulinum toxin-induced paralysis of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles (70%; P < 0.05). A slight decrease followed dorsal rhizotomy (84%; P < 0.01). In contrast, no significant alterations in epidermal thickness were detected following sham operation and sympathectomy. Epidermal thinning was paralleled by reductions in the amounts of transcripts for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin. These results suggest that selective loss of both sensory and motor fibers to the hind limb can contribute to reducing epidermal thickness in rat foot glabrous skin.

0032213460	Regional difference in epidermal thinning after skin denervation	Denervation of skin has a profound influence on epidermis; epidermal thinning was a consistent finding in rats. However, it is not clear whether the degree of epidermal thinning was similar in the region receiving the same innervation. In mice, how early epidermal nerves were degenerated after nerve injury remained unknown. To address these issues, we transected the sciatic nerve in mice and compared the changes of epidermal thickness in different areas of the hind foot skin. Epidermal nerves degenerated within 48 h after nerve transection, similar to what was observed in rats. Seven days after nerve transection, there was differential thinning of epidermis. The interpad area, in the center of the sciatic nerve-innervated region, exhibited the most profound degree of epidermal thinning (34.6 ± 3.1 vs 47.8 ± 2.4 μm, P < 0.01). The heel area, in the periphery of the sciatic nerve-innervated zone, did not show significant thinning of epidermis after denervation (37.3 ± 4.8 vs 41.5 ± 5.1 μm, P > 0.05). The degree of epidermal thinning after denervation in the pad area was the intermediate one: with 98.8 ± 4.8 vs 120.1 ± 7.3 μm, P < 0.02, in the fete pegs, and 51.1 ± 4.1 vs 62.1 ± 6.0 μm, P < 0.02, in the dermal papilla. The differential thinning was obvious when the thickness of the denervated epidermis was normalized to that of the control epidermis with the ratios of 0.73 ± 0.03 in the interpad area, 0.83 ± 0.04 in the rete peg, 0.85 ± 0.05 in the dermal papilla, and 0.92 ± 0.05 in the heel. Epidermal thinning was reversed by reinnervation of the epidermis after sciatic nerve crush (41.5 ± 1.5 vs 45.0 ± 2.0 μm in the interpad area, P > 0.05). These findings suggest that sensory nerves exhibit trophic influences on the epidermis presumably through the effects of diffusible factors.

0032464560	Quantitative sensory testing: Normative values and its application in diabetic neuropathy	Abnormal sensation (paresthesia) is one of the frequent complaints in patients with peripheral nerve disorders, in particular, diabetic neuropathy. The underlying pathophysiology includes dysfunctions or degeneration of myelinated and unmyelinated nerves. Functions of large myelinated sensory axons, which can be measured by nerve conduction studies, are responsible for proprioceptive sensation. Small myelinated and unmyelinated sensory axons (small-fibers) subserve nociceptive functions, the detection of pain and thermal stimuli. It is difficult to assess small fibers in clinical neurophysiology laboratory. The application of quantitative sensory testing, by measuring the thresholds to thermal and vibratory stimuli offers a convenient approach to quantify dysfunctions of small-diameter nerves. By establishing the normative values of quantitative sensory testing in Chinese, we evaluated its diagnostic potentials in diabetic neuropathy. Our results indicated that sensory thresholds in Chinese were similar to those reported elsewhere under standard procedures of quantitative sensory testing, and small-fiber dysfunction was more frequent than large-fiber dysfunction in diabetic neuropathy. Up to 75% of patients with diabetic neuropathy had elevated thresholds to thermal stimulus in the lower limb. Fifty percent of these patients had elevated vibratory thresholds. The present study documents the feasibility of performing quantitative sensory testing in evaluating diabetic neuropathy. The results indicate that dysfunction of small-diameter nerves should be considered in managing patients of diabetic neuropathy.

0032566719	Expression of type VI adenylyl cyclase in the central nervous system: Implication for a potential regulator of multiple signals in different neurotransmitter systems	The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of a calcium-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase type VI (type VI AC) in the central nervous system using an antiserum directed against the N-terminus of type VI AC. Our results indicate that type VI AC immunoreactivity is generally expressed in many brain regions with different levels of intensity. Most interestingly, the majority of the detected type VI AC immunoreactivity is present in cells of neuronal phenotype. Double immunostaining of type VI AC and markers of various neurotransmitter systems suggest that type VI AC might participate in regulation of the classical neurotransmitter systems and therefore appeared to play a very important role in the central nervous system.

26244435815	Neurological manifestations in severe acute respiratory syndrome	During the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, there were 664 probable SARS patients reported in Taiwan. SARS patients usually present with symptoms related to the respiratory system while neurological manifestations have rarely been described. There were three patients who developed axonopathic polyneuropathy 3-4 weeks after onset of SARS; their clinical condition and electrophysiological studies revealed obvious improvement at follow-up. Two SARS patients have experienced myopathy and three other patients developed rhabdomyolysis. These neuromuscular disorders in SARS patients were considered as critical illness neuropathy and myopathy, but the possibility of direct attack by SARS coronavirus on the nerve and muscle could not be excluded. Large artery ischemic stroke were described in five SARS patients with poor prognosis. Multiple factors contributed to this vascular insult included hypercoagulabe status related to both SARS coronavirus and the usage of intravenous immunoglobulin, septic and cardiogenic shock, and possible vasculitis. The relationship between SARS and above neurological problems still needs further clarification. Pathological and microbiological studies are mandatory to delineate this issue.

26444544500	Skin denervation in vasculitic neuropathy	Background: Skin denervation in vasculitic neuropathy has rarely been documented despite frequent manifestations of small-fiber neuropathy including reduced sensitivity and neuropathic pain. Recently, skin biopsy has been established as a new approach to diagnose small-fiber sensory neuropathy. Objectives: To investigate the pathologic features of cutaneous nerves and to evaluate inflammatory vasculopathy in the skin of patients with vasculitis. Design: Case series. Setting: National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei. Patients: Six patients with vasculitic neuropathy. Interventions: Patients had 3-mm punch biopsy specimens taken from the distal part of the leg (without active vasculitic lesions) and a sural nerve biopsy specimen was taken in addition to detailed neurologic examinations, laboratory investigations, and nerve conduction studies. Main Outcome Measures: Results of nerve conduction studies, epidermal nerve fiber density studies, and immunohistochemistry. Results: All 6 patients had combined large-and small-nervef iber involvement on the neurologic examinations. Nerve conduction studies showed a pattern of axonal neuropathy or mononeuropathy multiplex. Epidermal nerve fiber densities were significantly reduced in the skin of all patients, consistent with concomitant small-fiber neuropathies. Perivascular infiltration by T cells and macrophages was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. All patients experienced neurologic improvement in muscle strength and alleviation of sensory symptoms after immunotherapy with corticosteroids, plasma exchange, or cyclophosphamide. Conclusions: Small-diameter sensory nerves are affected in vasculitis in addition to the well-known effect of vasculitis on large-diameter nerves. Significant inflammatory vasculopathy is present in the skin despite the absence of clinically active vasculitic lesions. © 2005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

27644569681	Influence of aging on thermal and vibratory thresholds of quantitative sensory testing	Quantitative sensory testing has become a common approach to evaluate thermal and vibratory thresholds in various types of neuropathies. To understand the effect of aging on sensory perception, we measured warm, cold, and vibratory thresholds by performing quantitative sensory testing on a population of 484 normal subjects (175 males and 309 females), aged 48.61 ± 14.10 (range 20-86) years. Sensory thresholds of the hand and foot were measured with two algorithms: the method of limits (Limits) and the method of level (Level). Thresholds measured by Limits are reaction-time-dependent, while those measured by Level are independent of reaction time. In addition, we explored (1) the correlations of thresholds between these two algorithms, (2) the effect of age on differences in thresholds between algorithms, and (3) differences in sensory thresholds between the two test sites. Age was consistently and significantly correlated with sensory thresholds of all tested modalities measured by both algorithms on multivariate regression analysis compared with other factors, including gender, body height, body weight, and body mass index. When thresholds were plotted against age, slopes differed between sensory thresholds of the hand and those of the foot: for the foot, slopes were steeper compared with those for the hand for each sensory modality. Sensory thresholds of both test sites measured by Level were highly correlated with those measured by Limits, and thresholds measured by Limits were higher than those measured by Level. Differences in sensory thresholds between the two algorithms were also correlated with age: thresholds of the foot were higher than those of the hand for each sensory modality. This difference in thresholds (measured with both Level and Limits) between the hand and foot was also correlated with age. These findings suggest that age is the most significant factor in determining sensory thresholds compared with the other factors of gender and anthropometric parameters, and this provides a foundation for investigating the neurobiologic significance of aging on the processing of sensory stimuli. © 2005 Peripheral Nerve Society.

2942615009	Cutaneous and sympathetic denervation in neonatal rats with a mutation in the delta subunit of the cytosolic chaperonin-containing t-complex peptide-1 gene	The mutilated-foot rat (mf rat) is an autosomal recessive mutant with characteristic digit deformities in adult animals, and this phenotype mimics many aspects of human sensory neuropathy. The genetics of mf rats was recently elucidated. To understand whether the genotype is responsible for cutaneous denervation before clinically overt mutilation in adult mf rats, we investigated skin innervation in postnatal day 7 (P7) mf rats and compared the patterns with P7 wild-type rats. The mf rat carries a G→A mutation in the gene encoding the delta subunit of the cytosolic chaperonin-containing t-complex peptide-1 (Cct4). In the footpad skin of P7 mf rats, there was a >90% loss of epidermal nerves (0.7-7.9% of P7 wild-type rats) as indicated by neuronal markers including protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP). The epidermis of hairy skin in hind feet was completely denervated in mf rats as well. Compared with an approximately 80% reduction in the size of dermal nerve fascicles and a parallel loss of nerve fibers, the nearly complete absence of epidermal innervation suggests further sensory nerve degeneration at the level of nerve terminals in the epidermis. In contrast, the loss of epidermal nerves in the abdominal skin of mf rats was less extensive than that in the footpad skin of mf rats; CGRP (+) and SP (+) fibers were moderately reduced (28.3-56.4% of levels of wild-type rats) with normal amounts of PGP 9.5 (+) and GAP43 (+) nerves. Sympathetic innervation as assessed by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was absent from the footpad and abdominal skin of mf rats. In conclusion, there is regional skin denervation with diffuse sympathetic denervation in P7 mf rats. These results suggest that the mutation in Cct4 underlies cutaneous nerve degeneration in mf rats. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

3042742738	Effects of aging on human skin innervation	To understand the effect of aging on human skin innervation, we investigated intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density of skin biopsies. IENF densities of the distal leg were lower in elderly (≥ 60 years of age) than in young adults (19-39 years of age; 7.80 ± 0.79 vs 13.55 ± 0.85 fibers/mm, p < 0.01). A similar trend was also observed in the distal forearm (11.67 ± 1.55 vs 19.39 ± 1.60 fibers/mm, p < 0.001). IENF densities were negatively correlated with age according to multiple linear regression analysis on the entire study population (age range: 19-78 years) with standardized coefficients of -0.462 (p < 0.001) in the distal leg and -0.335 (p = 0.005) in the distal forearm. These findings suggest a significant reduction in IENF densities with age. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

33645227238	A rapid and reliable detection system for the analysis of PMP22 gene dosage by MP/DHPLC assay	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) are caused by a 1.5-Mb duplication and a deletion at chromosome 17p11.2-12 encompassing the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22), respectively. We developed a rapid and reliable detection system for duplications/deletions of the PMP22 gene based on measurement of gene copy number. The method involves amplification of a test locus with unknown copy number and a reference locus of known copy number by multiplex PCR (MP), followed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) or capillary electrophoresis detection to identify single copy changes. Thirty-two patients with CMT1A, 17 patients with HNPP, and 61 unaffected individuals were analyzed. Using the same competitive MP protocol, the measured PMP22 gene dosage revealed concordant results between DHPLC and capillary electrophoresis analysis. The results of the MP/DHPLC or the MP/capillary electrophoresis assay were all confirmed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We concluded that the MP/ DHPLC assay is an efficient, accurate, and reliable technique for gene dosage determination of the PMP22 gene for CMT1A duplication and HNPP deletion. This technique further extends the application of DHPLC as an alternative method for the measurement of gene amplifications and heterozygous deletions in different genetic diseases. © The Japan Society of Human Genetics and Springer-Verlag 2006.

33645388864	An in vivo study of tricalcium phosphate and glutaraldehyde crosslinking gelatin conduits in peripheral nerve repair	In order to modulate the mechanical properties of gelatin, we previously developed a biodegradable composite composed by tricalcium phosphate and glutaraldehyde crosslinking gelatin (GTG) feasible for surgical manipulation. In this study, we evaluated the in vivo applications of GTG conduit for peripheral nerve repair. The effect of sciatic nerve reconstruction was compared between resorbable permeable GTG conduits and durable impermeable silicone tubes. Traditional methods of assessing nerve recovery following peripheral nerve repair including histomorphometric and electrophysiologic features were conducted in our study. In addition, autotomy score and sciatic function index (SFI) in walking tract analysis were used as additional parameters for assessing the return of nerve function. Twenty-four weeks after sciatic nerve repair, the GTG conduits were harvested. Microscopically, regeneration of nerves was observed in the cross-section at the mid portion of all implanted GTG conduits. The cross-sectional area of regenerated nerve of the GTG group was significant larger than that of the silicone group. In the compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), the mean recovery index of CMAP amplitude was 0.24 ± 0.02 for the silicone group, 0.41 ± 0.07 for the GTG group. The mean SFI increased with time in the GTG group during the evaluation period until 24 weeks. Walking tract analysis showed a higher SFI score in the GTG group at both 12 and 24 weeks. The difference reached a significant level at 24 weeks. Thus, the histomorphometric, electrophysiologic, and functional assessments demonstrate that GTG can be a candidate for peripheral nerve repair. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33646836945	Gelatin-tricalcium phosphate membrane modified with NGF and cultured Schwann cells for peripheral nerve repair: A tissue engineering approach	This study attempted to enhance the efficacy of peripheral nerve regeneration using our previously developed gelatin-tricalcium phosphate (GTG) conduits by incorporating them with nerve growth factors and cultured Schwann cells. The nerve growth factors were covalently immobilized onto the GTG conduits (GEN) using carbodiimide. Schwann cells were harvested from neonatal Lewis rats, cultured for seven days and injected into the GEN conduits. The experiment was performed in three groups: GTG conduits, GEN conduits and GEN conduits with Schwann cells injected (GEN+ Sc). The effects of different conduits (GTG, GEN and GEN with Schwann cells) on the peripheral nerve regeneration were evaluated in rat sciatic nerve repair model. 24 weeks after implantation of conduits, degradation of the conduits in all groups was illustrated by the fragmentation of the conduits. All conduits were well tolerated by the host tissue. Under microscopic evaluations, regenerated nerve tissue with myelinated and unmyelinated axons presented in all groups. Histomorphometrically, the total nerve area of GEN+ Sc group was significantly higher than GTG group. Conversely, the autotomy score evaluated 12 weeks after nerve repair showed better results for GTG group. Besides, GEN+ Sc group had the highest average recovery index of compound muscle action potential, but the difference among each group did not reach statistical significance. Although the electrophysiological recovery of nerve was not significantly improved with GEN+ Sc conduit, nerve repair using tissue engineered conduits still provided better histological results. However, it should be noticed that autotomy may be the price paid for enhanced peripheral nerve.

33745216468	Reduced epidermal nerve density among hand-transmitted vibration-exposed workers	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate ultrastructural changes of epidermal nerve density (END) in workers exposed to hand-transmitted vibration. METHODS: Ten male subjects with occupational exposure to hand-transmitted tools for 46.9 hours weekly for an average of 6.5 years were included in this study. We performed a skin biopsy from the forearms and compared the END with 10 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Nine of the 10 subjects had abnormally low END. The END of the exposed workers was significantly lower than the control group (4.1 ± 2.8 vs 9.0 ± 4.3 fibers/mm, P = 0.005). The difference remained even after one subject with possible undiagnosed diabetes was not included (4.3 ± 2.9 vs 9.6 ± 4.2 fibers/mm, P = 0.005). The reduction of END did not correlate with the abnormality of nerve conduction studies or quantitative sensory testing. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of END suggested the involvement of small-diameter nerve fibers among this population, and such a histologic change might either be independent or precede changes of large myelinated nerve fibers.

33746296478	Levamisole-induced multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy: Clinical characteristics, outcome, and impact of treatment in 31 patients	Levamisole (LEV) has been used as an immunomodulating medication in patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers and as an adjuvant for chemotherapy. LEV, with or without 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), induces multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy (MIL). We identified 31 patients with LEV-induced MIL: 7 from our institution and 24 from a MEDLINE search. Twenty-one patients (67.7%) had been treated with a combination of LEV and 5-FU, while 10 patients had been treated with LEV alone. The onset of MIL was delayed in patients who took LEV and 5-FU in combination compared with the patients treated with LEV alone (11.7 ± 3.7 vs. 4 ± 2.5 wk, p < 0.001). Colon cancer (67.7%) was the most common indication for LEV administration. Gait ataxia occurred in 20 (64.5%) patients, and dysphagia was noted in 16 (51.6%) patients. Imaging studies revealed periventricular enhancement in 17 (54.8%) patients and supratentorial lesions in 16 (51.6%) patients. Cerebrospinal fluid studies showed lymphocytic pleocytosis in 10 of 21 (47.6%) patients. Early diagnosis of MIL and discontinuation of LEV is essential, yielding good recovery in most cases. Treatment with corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin may be needed for this serious inflammatory encephalopathy. Twenty-nine patients exhibited improved clinical status and imaging findings after initial steroid or immunoglobulin treatment. Plasmapheresis may be an alternative regimen for patients with steroid resistance. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

33845494973	Gelatin-tricalcium phosphate membranes immobilized with NGF, BDNF, or IGF-1 for peripheral nerve repair: An in vitro and in vivo study	In the present study, NGF, BNDF from the neurotrophin family and IGF-1 were covalently immobilized on gelatin-tricalcium phosphate (GTG) membrane using carbodiimide. We investigated the effects of these growth factors released from the GTG composites on cultured PC12 cells and sciatic nerve regeneration across a 10-mm-long gap in rats. In PC12 cell culture, the total protein content and MTT assay indicated more cell attachment on the composites modified with growth factors. The IGF-1 group showed a higher survival promotion effect on PC12 cells than did BDNF and NGF groups. On the other hand, NGF released from the composite showed the highest level of neuritogenesis for PC12 cells in neurite outgrowth assay. In the animal study, the GTG conduits modified with various growth factors were well tolerated by the host tissue. In the regenerated nerves, the number of the axons per unit area of the BDNF group was significantly higher than that of NGF and GTG groups but similar to that of IGF-1 group. However, the average axon size was the largest in NGF group. This result was in concordance with the neurite outgrowth assay in which NGF showed the highest neuritogenic potential. In the assessment of motor and sensory recovery after nerve repair, conduits modified with various neurotrophic factors showed a more favorable outcome in compound muscle action potential. The BDNF group had a better gastrocnemic muscle weight ratio than blank GTG repair. Nevertheless, the different effects of GTG conduits modified with various neurotrophic factors on functional recovery cannot be simply illustrated in the sciatic function index. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33846860205	Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: A follow-up study in Taiwan	Background: Acute-disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, whose epidemiology, clinical presentations and functional outcome are incompletely understood in Asian populations. Objective: To assess the clinical presentations, predisposing factors and functional outcome of ADEM in Taiwan. Methods: 50 patients initially diagnosed with ADEM (male, 19; female, 31) were enrolled from 1991 to 2005. Diagnosis of ADEM or multiple sclerosis was established during a follow-up period of 2-120 months. 8 adult patients were noted to have taken the immunomodulatory drug, levamisole, within 3 months before onset of symptoms. The remaining 42 patients (male, 17; female, 25) were categorised by age as children (<16 years, n = 12), young adults (16-49 years, n = 21) and elderly adults (≥50 years, n = 9). The clinical manifestations, predisposing factors and radiological findings were compared between different age groups and adult patients with or without levamisole use. Functional outcome was compared by a log-rank test. Results: Preceding upper respiratory tract infection was evident in 21 (50%) patients and only one young-adult patient had received Rubella vaccine immunisation. The frequency of fever was higher in children (p = 0.04) and psychiatric symptoms were more prevalent in elderly patients (p = 0.03). Functional recovery was faster in children than in adults (p = 0.002). Initial Expanded Disability Status Scale score (odds ratio (OR) 1.9, p = 0.03) and no fever (OR 0.04, p = 0.06) were associated with poor outcome (modified Rankin scale ≥2). After a mean (SD) follow-up of 31.8 (9.9) months, 4 (9.5%) patients developed multiple sclerosis (3 (25%) children, 1 (4.7%) young adult, p = 0.03). The neurological disability, radiological and cerebrospinal fluid findings did not differ between patients with and without levamisole use. One elderly adult patient previously receiving levamisole developed multiple sclerosis of relapse-remitting type after a mean follow-up period of 36.9 months. Conclusion: The clinical presentations, functional outcome and risk of developing multiple sclerosis differed between different age groups. Functional recovery was faster in children than in adults. Poor functional outcome was related to initial high Expanded Disability Status Scale score and absence of fever.

33947699443	Effects of decompression on neuropathic pain behaviors and skin reinnervation in chronic constriction injury	Decompression is an important therapeutic strategy to relieve neuropathic pain clinically; there is, however, lack of animal models to study its temporal course of neuropathic pain behaviors and its influence on nerve regeneration to sensory targets. To address these issues, we established a model of decompression on rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) and investigated the effect on skin reinnervation. Animals were divided into a decompression group, in which the ligatures were removed, and a CCI group, in which the ligatures remained at postoperative week 4 (POW 4). At this time point, the skin innervation indexes of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), substance P (SP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were reduced in both groups to similar degrees. Beginning from POW 6, the decompression group exhibited significant reductions of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia compared to the CCI group (p < 0.001). At POW 8, neuropathic pain behaviors had completely disappeared in the decompression group, and the decompression group had a higher skin innervation index of SP than the CCI group (0.45 ± 0.05 vs. 0.16 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). These indexes were similar in both groups for PGP 9.5 (0.32 ± 0.09 vs. 0.14 ± 0.04, p = 0.11) and CGRP (0.38 ± 0.06 vs. 0.21 ± 0.07, p = 0.09). These findings demonstrate the temporal changes in the disappearance of neuropathic pain behaviors after decompression and suggest that decompression causes different patterns of skin reinnervation for different markers of skin innervation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

34250683497	Reversal of ERK activation in the dorsal horn after decompression in chronic constriction injury	Injury-induced neuropathic pain is related to changes in the central terminals of dorsal root ganglia neurons, i.e., dorsal horn plasticity. We investigated the influences of decompression by removing ligatures producing chronic constriction injury (CCI) in Sprague-Dawley rats at postoperative week (POW) 4, the decompression group; for comparison, all ligatures remained through the experimental period in the CCI group. The effect was evaluated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in the dorsal horn, i.e., number of phosphorylated ERK (+) cells in the dorsal horn. At POW 1, the dorsal horn indexes had increased to a similar degree in both groups (2.40 ± 0.58 vs. 2.27 ± 0.36, p = 0.73). At POW 8, thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia had completely disappeared with a normalization of dorsal horn index (1.17 ± 0.11 vs. 1.02 ± 0.12 at POW 0, p = 0.07) in the decompression group; in contrast, the dorsal horn index remained elevated in the CCI group (2.48 ± 0.30, p < 0.001) with persistent neuropathic pain behaviors at POW 8. This report suggests that ERK activation in the dorsal horn is correlated with neuropathic pain behaviors and its normalization reflects the reversal of neuropathic pain behaviors after decompression. © 2007.

34447256798	Skin denervation and cutaneous vasculitis in eosinophilia-associated neuropathy	Background: Eosinophilia is frequently associated with peripheral neuropathy, and neuropathic pain is a major presentation. Little is known about the involvement of sensory nerve terminals and the vasculature in the skin of patients with eosinophilia. Objectives: To investigate the skin innervation and the pathological abnormalities of the cutaneous vasculature and their clinical significance in eosinophilia-associated neuropathy. Design: Case series. Setting: National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Patients: Twelve patients with neuropathy and concomitant eosinophilia (with an eosinophilic ratio of white blood cell classification > 10% or absolute eosinophil count of > 1000/μL). Interventions: Clinical assessments of neurological deficits, laboratory tests, nerve conduction studies, and a skin biopsy specimen 3 mm in diameter taken from the distal leg without active skin lesions. Main Outcome Measures: Quantitation of epidermal innervation, immunopathological findings of the cutaneous vasculature, and motor disability grade. Results: Six patients fulfilled the criteria of Churg-Strauss syndrome, and the other 6 patients were categorized as having primary eosinophilia. All of the 12 patients had mononeuropathy multiplex or polyneuropathy with sensory symptoms as the initial manifestation. Intraepidermal nerve fiber densities were reduced in 10 patients (83.3%), being significantly lower than in the controls (mean ± SD, 2.12 ± 2.30 vs 10.56 ± 3.69 fibers/mm, respectively; P < .001) and negatively correlated with the disability grade (P = .003). Nine patients (75.0%), including all of the 6 patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome, had cutaneous vasculitis, and two-thirds of the 9 patients had perivascular infiltration of eosinophils. Conclusion: Skin denervation with cutaneous vasculitis is a major manifestation of eosinophilia-associated neuropathy. ©2007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

34347347163	Effects of aging on contact heat-evoked potentials: The physiological assessment of thermal perception	Age significantly influences the detection thresholds to noxious heat; such thresholds depend on responses in the cerebral cortex to thermal stimuli and the psychophysical perception of such responses. To understand the influence of age on cerebral responses, we used contact heat-evoked potentials (CHEPs) to investigate the physiology of cerebral responses to thermal stimuli in 70 healthy subjects (33 men and 37 women, 39.56 ± 12.12 years of age). With heat stimulation of fixed intensity (51°C) on the distal forearm and distal leg, CHEPs revealed consistent waveforms with an initial negative peak (N1 latency: 398.63 ± 28.55 and 449.03 ± 32.21 ms for upper and lower limbs) and a later positive peak (P1 latency: 541.63 ± 37.92 and 595.41 ± 39.24 ms for upper and lower limbs) with N1-P1 interpeak amplitude of 42.30 ± 12.57 μV in the upper limb and 39.67 ± 12.03 μV in the lower limb. On analyses with models of multiple linear regression, N1-P1 amplitudes were negatively correlated with age and N1 latencies were correlated with gender, with females having shorter latencies. The verbal rating scale (VRS) for pain perception was higher in females than males, and decreased with aging. In addition, VRS paralleled changes in N1-P1 amplitude and N1 latency; the higher the VRS, the shorter the N1 latency and the higher the N1-P1 amplitude. These results provide evidence that CHEPs are influenced significantly by aging, corresponding to aging-related changes in thermal pain perception. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34548281256	Use of multiplex PCR and CE for gene dosage quantification and its biomedical application for SMN, PMP22, and α-globin genes	Many genetic diseases are caused by the presence of point mutations, small insertions, and deletions in respective genes, and the number of diseases known to be caused by deletions and duplications involving large DNA genomes is increasing. These changes lead to underexpression or overexpression of the gene, according to changes in gene dosage. The methods for the detection of point mutations, small insertions, and deletions are well established, but the detection of larger genomic deletions or duplications is more difficult. Due to the lack of efficient and technically feasible protocols for gene dosage quantification, we describe a diagnostic protocol employing a combination of available methods. The efficient and accurate gene dosage quantification platform is combined with multiplex PCR and CE, and applied to detect dosages of several genes, including SMN, PMP22, and α-globin genes. The reliability of this novel methodology shows that it is a relatively speedy and low-cost procedure and a significant tool for genetic diagnosis. Its sensitivity and specificity for identifying deletion and duplication genotypes approach 100%. Moreover, once we establish this powerful system, we will further apply this technique to the rapid detection of trisomy syndromes and microdeletion syndromes, including trisomy 13, Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and others. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

35048831742	Magnetic nanoparticle labeling of mesenchymal stem cells without transfection agent: Cellular behavior and capability of detection with clinical 1.5 T magnetic resonance at the single cell level	The purpose of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of labeling human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by ionic superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) without a transfection agent and verifying its capability to be detected with clinical 1.5 T magnetic resonance (MR) at the single-cell level. Human hMSCs were incubated for 24 h with an ionic SPIO, Ferucarbotran. The labeling efficiency of hMSCs was determined by iron content measurement spectrophotometrically, and the influence of labeling on cell behavior was ascertained by examination of cell viability using the trypan blue exclusion method, cell proliferation analysis using MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) change, differentiation capacity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production measured by dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) fluorescent probe.

36749096903	Glycemic control is related to the severity of impaired thermal sensations in type 2 diabetes	Background: Small-fibre sensory neuropathy of diabetes presenting as impaired thermal sensations is associated with ominous consequences, such as foot ulcer and amputation, but there is a lack of systematic studies on its occurrence in large cohorts. We investigated (1) the impact of glycemic control on thermal thresholds, (2) the frequencies and patterns of sensory deficits, and (3) the contribution of sensory nerve abnormalities to neuropathic symptoms. Methods: Quantitative sensory testing and nerve conduction studies were performed to measure warm and cold thresholds of extremities, and amplitudes of nerve action potentials on 498 type 2 diabetic patients and 434 control subjects with similar age and gender distributions, enrolled during the same period. Results: The diabetic patients had higher thermal thresholds than control subjects (p < 0.0001). Thermal thresholds of the lower and upper extremities were linearly correlated with HbA

37748999328	Painful neuropathy with skin denervation after prolonged use of linezolid	The prolonged use of linezolid, a new antibiotic against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, might cause painful neuropathy. This finding raises the possibility that small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin, which are responsible for transmitting nociceptive information, might be affected. We report a 53-year-old female who developed pure small-fibre painful neuropathy (visual analogue scale, VAS = 82 on 0-100 scale) with marked skin denervation in the leg (epidermal nerve density, END = 2.32 fibres/mm, norm <5.88 fibres/mm) and significant elevation of the warm threshold in the foot (40.0°C, norm <39.4°C) after the use of linezolid for 6 months. Eight months after the discontinuation of linezolid, the skin became fully reinnervated (END = 9.04 fibres/mm), with disappearance of neuropathic pain (VAS = 0) and normalisation of the warm threshold (36.3°C). Nerve conduction studies for large-diameter motor and sensory nerves were normal. This report documents a pure small-fibre sensory neuropathy after prolonged use of linezolid, and the relationship between skin innervation and corresponding neuropathic pain.

0033010120	Trophic interactions between sensory nerves and their targets	Neurotrophins are target-derived trophic factors essential for the survival and maintenance of neurons. Among these, nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are particularly important for sensory neurons. The actions of neurotrophins are through the p75 low-affinity receptor and the high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase (trk). Each neurotrophin has its preferred receptor, i.e. trkA for NGF, and trkC for NT-3. The primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion are classified into two categories, namely, the large and small sensory neurons based on their size. The large sensory neurons with the expression of trkC depend on NT-3 for development and subserve the function of position sensations. Some of the small sensory neurons express trkA and are NGF-dependent. They are responsible for nociceptive sensation, the detection of painful and thermal stimuli. A more intriguing observation is the bidirectional interactions between nociceptive nerves and their target, the skin. The peripheral processes of small sensory neurons innervate the epidermis of the skin as 'free nerve endings'. In denervated skin, there is a drastic reduction in the epidermal thickness, a finding corroborated by the phenomenon of trophic change, the shining and thinning of the skin, in the disorders of peripheral nerves. The performance of animals with peripheral nerve disorders improved after administration of neurotrophic factors. Based on these results, the therapeutic potentials of neurotrophic factors in human are under investigation.

0032853994	Influence of cutaneous nerves on keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal thickness in mice	We evaluated the influence of skin innervation on the epidermis in mice. The rich innervation of skin was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry with protein gene product 9.5, a ubiquitin carboxy hydrolase. Protein gene product-immunoreactive nerve fibers were in the epidermis, subepidermal plexus, dermal nerve trunks, and nerve terminals around sweat glands. Effects of denervation on the plantar surface of the hind foot was assessed by comparing the thickness of the epidermis, which was innervated by the sciatic nerve. Within 48 h after sectioning of the sciatic nerve, protein gene product (+)-nerves in the territory of the sciatic nerve were completely degenerated. There was a significant thinning of the denervated epidermis 72 h post-transection (30.5±1.1 vs 41.4±2.9 μm, 74±4% of the control side). The reduction in epidermal thickness persisted when skin remained denervated (69-75% of the control side). Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine was reduced 24 h after denervation (71±6% of the control side). Reduction in bromodeoxyuridine-incorporation was most pronounced within 48 h after denervation (19±6% of the control side). Therefore, the reduction in bromodeoxyuridine-labeling followed a similar temporal course as the thinning of the epidermis (25-50%). Both epidermal thinning and reduced bromodeoxyuridine-labeling were reversed by epidermal reinnervation three months after denervation. Patterns of keratinocyte differentiation and programmed cell death were unaffected by skin denervation. These findings are consistent with the notion that skin innervation exerts influence on the proliferation of keratinocytes and the thickness of the epidermis, and offers a new look at the interaction between nociceptive nerves and their innervated targets.

0032860006	Modulation of keratinocyte proliferation by skin innervation	Several lines of evidence suggest that sensory nerves ending at the skin have profound influences on their target, the epidermis. To test the hypothesis, we examined the consequences of denervation on the paw skin of rats by eliminating its innervation. We investigated temporal changes of nerve degeneration, keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, gene expression, and epidermal thickness. Nerve terminals in the epidermis began to degenerate within 24 h after denervation. All epidermal nerves were completely degenerated by 2 d. During the interval of nerve degeneration, there was a significant reduction of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation from 24 h of nerve injury (39 ± 7% of the control side, p 0.01). By 2 d, there was a further reduction of bromodeoxyuridine labeling (11 ± 8%, p < 0.0001). The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine remained depressed when the skin was denervated (35 ± 11%, p < 0.01). Four days after eliminating skin innervation, the denervated epidermis became thinner than the control epidermis (70 ± 8% of the control, p < 0.01). Epidermal thinning was associated with a significant decrease in expression of glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin transcripts (33 ± 8% of the control epidermis from postoperative day 4, p < 0.001). Other aspects of keratinocyte differentiation, including the patterns of keratin expression, and programmed cell death, were unaltered by skin denervation. These data indicate that skin denervation is sufficient to influence keratinocyte proliferation and therefore epidermal thickness.

0032867772	Age-dependent acrylamide neurotoxicity in mice: Morphology, physiology, and function	Acrylamide intoxication produces peripheral neuropathy characterized by weakness and ataxia in both humans and experimental animals. Previous studies on animals of different ages and species indicate that the longest and largest nerves are affected earlier with the major pathology in the terminal parts of axons, i.e., distal axonopathy. However, several issues have remained elusive; for example, what are the earliest pathological changes? An equally intriguing question is whether younger animals are more susceptible to acrylamide than older animals. To address these issues, we compared the vulnerability to acrylamide of 3- and 8-week-old mice. These mice were intoxicated with acrylamide in drinking water (400 ppm). The sequence of intoxication could be categorized into three stages. In the initial stage, there was no visible weakness or ataxia. The only noticeable changes were poor performance on the rota-rod test and swelling of motor nerve terminals. Obvious weakness and ataxia of hindlimbs developed gradually (here designated as the early stage). The weakness and ataxia progressed at variable speeds in mice of different ages, and eventually the forelimbs (quadriparesis) were affected in the late stage. Each stage appeared earlier in 3-week-old mice than in 8-week-old mice (7.1 ± 1.1 vs 15.6 ± 4.0 days, P < 0.01 for the early stage; and 15.3 ± 2.1 vs 31.7 ± 6.0 days, P < 0.01 for the late stage). The progression of neurological deficits was also faster in the younger mice (7.2 ± 1.8 vs 16.3 ± 4.2 days, P < 0.01). Pathological changes in the distal parts of motor nerves innervating hindfoot muscles were evaluated by combined cholinesterase histochemistry and immunocytochemistry for neuronal markers to demonstrate motor nerve terminals and neuromuscular junctions simultaneously. In the initial stage, there was axonal swelling in motor nerve terminals. As acrylamide intoxication continued, axonal swelling extended into junctional folds and into the intramuscular nerves, which resulted in Wallerjan-like degeneration. Our results indicate that younger mice show a much higher susceptibility to acrylamide intoxication, and pathological changes precede neurological symptoms.

0034106408	Pathology of nerve terminal degeneration in the skin	To characterize the pathology of epidermal nerve degeneration and regeneration, we investigated temporal and spatial changes in skin innervation of the mouse footpad. Within 24 hours after sciatic nerve axotomy, terminals of epidermal nerves appeared swollen and there was a mild reduction in epidermal nerve density (5.7 ± 2.8 vs 12.7 ± 2.2 fibers/mm, p < 0.04). Epidermal nerves completely disappeared by 48 hours (0.2 ± 0.2 vs 14.2 ± 0.9 fibers/mm, p < 0.001). Concomitant with the disappearance of epidermal nerves, the immunocytochemical pattern of the subepidermal nerve plexus became fragmented. At the electron microscopic level, the axoplasm of degenerating dermal nerves was distended with organelles and later became amorphous. Beginning from day 28 after axotomy, collateral sprouts from the adjacent saphenous nerve territory extended into the denervated area with a beaded appearance. They never penetrated the epidermal-dermal junction to innervate the epidermis. In contrast, 3 months after nerve crushing, the epidermis on the surgery side resumed a normal innervation pattern as the epidermis on the control side (10.3 ± 3.9 vs 10.6 ± 1.5 fibers/mm, p = 0.1). This study demonstrates the characteristics of degenerating and regenerating nerves, and suggests that successful reinnervation mainly originates from regenerating nerves of the original nerve trunks. All these findings provide qualitative and quantitative information for interpreting the pathology of cutaneous nerves.

39449091574	Identification of deletion and duplication genotypes of the PMP22 gene using PCR-RFLP, competitive multiplex PCR, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification: A comparison	We evaluated the efficacy of PCR-RFLP, competitive multiplex PCR, and a commercially available system of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for the determination of deletion and duplication genotypes ofthe PMP22 gene. We compared the methods for efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity. We determined the gene dosage ofthe PMP22 gene via PCR-RFLP, competitive multiplex PCR, and MLPA. To demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of these three methods, a total of 185 samples from 42 patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), 57 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), and 86 unaffected individuals, were analyzed. Molecular diagnosis by PCR-RFLP was performed on all 185 samples; 24 HNPP deletions and 33 CMT1A duplications were identified. In contrast, 25 HNPP deletions and 38 CMT1A duplications were identified correctly using competitive multiplex PCR and MLPA. Six samples were incorrectly identified by PCR-RFLP (one HNPP deletion and five CMT1A duplications). Competitive multiplex PCR and MLPA demonstrated reliability and relative speed compared to PCR-RFLP; they were superior to PCR-RFLP for gene dosage quantification. Multiplex PCR and MLPA should be the methods of choice for detection of deletion and duplication genotypes in molecular genetic diagnoses. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

39049102869	Patterns of contact heat evoked potentials (CHEP) in neuropathy with skin denervation: Correlation of CHEP amplitude with intraepidermal nerve fiber density	Objective: Contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPs) provide an objective approach to investigate cerebral responses to thermal stimuli mediated by Aδ fibers. Skin denervation is often associated with reduced thermal sensibilities. We aimed to investigate the influences of skin denervation on CHEPs in neuropathic patients. Methods: CHEPs were recorded at the vertex area by applying contact heat stimuli of 51 °C on the distal leg of neuropathic patients with sensory symptoms and pathological evidence of skin denervation in the distal leg. Patterns and parameters of CHEPs in the neuropathic group were compared with those in the control group of age- and gender-matched subjects. Results: There were 25 neuropathic patients with reduced intraepidermal fiber (IENF) density (1.46 ± 1.70 fibers/mm, range: 0-5.32). In the control group, well-defined averaged tracings of CHEPs with an initial negative peak (N-wave) followed by a positive peak (P-wave) were consistently recorded in all 25 subjects. The peripheral conduction velocities of CHEPs were 9.92 ± 4.06 m/s (range: 6.06-16.60), in the range of Aδ fibers. The group of neuropathic patients had markedly reduced N-P amplitudes (p < 0.0001) and prolonged N-wave latencies (p = 0.049) compared to the control group. IENF density was the only neuropathic parameter correlated with N-P amplitude on multiple linear regression analysis (p = 0.010) compared to large-fiber parameters. Conclusions: In neuropathic patients with pathological evidence of skin denervation, there were reduced amplitude and prolonged latencies in CHEPs mediated by Aδ fibers. The reduction of CHEP amplitude corresponded to the degree of skin denervation. Significance: CHEP offers electrophysiological evidence of thermal responses and provides an objective, non-invasive approach to assess the physiological counterparts of skin denervation in neuropathic patients. © 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

33645047165	Skin denervation and cutaneous vasculitis in systemic lupus erythematosus	To understand the clinical significance and mechanisms of cutaneous denervation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we assessed intraepidermal nerve fibre (IENF) density of the distal leg in 45 SLE patients (4 males and 41 females, aged 38.4 ± 13.6 years) and analysed its correlations with pathology, lupus activity, sensory thresholds and electrophysiological parameters. Compared with age- and gender-matched control subjects, SLE patients had lower IENF densities (3.08 ± 2.17 versus 11.27 ± 3.96 fibres/mm, P < 0.0001); IENF densities were reduced in 38 patients (82.2%). Pathologically, 11 patients (24.4%) were found to have definite cutaneous vasculitis; the severity and extent of cutaneous vasculitis were correlated with IENF densities. Patients with active lupus had even lower IENF densities than those with quiescent lupus (1.86 ± 1.37 versus 4.15 ± 2.20 fibres/mm, P = 0.0002). By linear regression analysis, IENF densities were negatively correlated with the SLE disease activity index (r = 0.527, P = 0.0002) and cumulative episodes of lupus flare-up within 2 years before the skin biopsy (r = 0.616, P = 0.0014). Clinically, skin denervation was present not only in the patients with sensory neuropathy but also in the patients with neuropsychiatric syndrome involving the CNS. SLE patients had significantly elevated warm threshold temperatures (P = 0.003) and reduced cold threshold temperatures (P = 0.048); elevated warm threshold temperatures were associated with the reduced IENF densities (P = 0.032). In conclusion, cutaneous vasculitis and lupus activities underlie skin denervation with associated elevation of thermal thresholds as a major manifestation of sensory nerve injury in SLE. © The Author (2006).

0034864616	Cutaneous nerve terminal degeneration in painful mononeuropathy	Nociceptive nerves innervate the skin and play an important role in the generation of neuropathic pain. However, it remains elusive whether and how nociceptive nerve terminals degenerate in neuropathic pain conditions. To address this issue, we investigated cutaneous innervation in a model of painful mononeuropathy, the chronic constriction injury (CCI). The hind paws of rats were immunocytochemically stained with a pan-axonal marker, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Within 2 days after CCI, rats exhibited thermal hyperalgesia, and there was a partial depletion of epidermal nerves. The extent of reduction in epidermal nerves after CCI was variable with an epidermal nerve density of 3.65 ± 1.97 fibers/mm (compared to 15.39 ± 1.58 fibers/mm on the control side, P < 0.02). There was a mild but concomitant increase in PGP 9.5 (+) Langerhans cells in the epidermis of the skin with CCI (10.19 ± 1.99 vs 7.75 ± 1.36 cells/mm, P < 0.05). In the skin denervated by tight ligation of the sciatic nerve, epidermal nerves were completely depleted (0 fibers/mm vs 12.26 ± 1.44 fibers/mm on the control side, P < 0.001). Animals with tight ligation of the sciatic nerve exhibited thermal anesthesia. These findings suggest that the epidermis is partially denervated in CCI, and that a partial injury of nerves is correlated with the development of neuropathic pain. © 2001 Academic Press.

0034602577	Cutaneous nerve degeneration induced by acrylamide in mice	Acrylamide is a neurotoxin producing distal axonopathy. Previous studies mainly focused on large-diameter motor and sensory nerves, and the influences of acrylamide neurotoxicity on small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin remained elusive. We investigated skin innervation in mice intoxicated by acrylamide. Small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin degenerated after acrylamide intoxication. Epidermal nerve swelling was the earliest sign of acrylamide intoxication, with 29.5±2.4% of swollen epidermal nerves in the initial stage (P<0.001). There was a trend of progressive loss of epidermal nerves with a significantly reduced epidermal nerve density in the late stage (P<0.003). In the mean time, degenerating dermal nerves exhibited a beaded appearance. These results suggest the scenario of small-diameter cutaneous nerve degeneration in acrylamide neurotoxicity: beginning with epidermal nerve terminal swelling in the initial stage and resultant epidermal nerve depletion in the late phase.

0034975946	Skin biopsy: A new window on small-fiber sensory neuropathy	Sensory nerve terminals in the epidermis of the skin called free nerve endings are responsible for thermal and nociceptive stimuli. The examination of these nerves traditionally requires nerve biopsy at the ultrastructural level. Routine nerve conduction studies can only evaluate large myelinated nerves. Symptoms of neuropathy usually start from the distal parts of the extremities and follow a glove-stocking distribution. These phenomena raise the question of whether the skin could be used for the research and diagnosis of small-fiber sensory neuropathy. During the last five years, we have explored this issue using multidisciplinary approaches including: (1) the study of the pathology of cutaneous nerve degeneration/regeneration in various animal models, and (2) the examination of the pattern of cutaneous innervation in healthy subjects and neuropathic patients using the results of immunohistochemistry tests on 3 mm punches of skin biopsy specimens. As the first step in characterizing the pathology of epidermal nerve degeneration, we investigated temporal and spatial changes in skin innervation of the footpad of a mouse. Within 24 h after sciatic nerve axotomy, terminals of epidermal nerves appeared swollen. Epidermal nerves completely disappeared by 48 h. Concomitant with the disappearance of epidermal nerves, the immunocytochemical pattern of the subepidermal nerve plexus became fragmented. Three months after crushing the nerve, the epidermis on the surgical side showed a normal innervation pattern resembling the epidermis on the control side. The characteristics of degenerating and regenerating nerves provide qualitative and quantitative information for interpreting the pathology of cutaneous nerves. We further extended these approaches to examine the cutaneous innervation in human subjects. In the distal area of the leg of 35 neuropathic patients, the epidermal nerve density was markedly reduced compared with 55 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects (p<0.001). Dermal nerves of neuropathic patients became fragmented and swollen, similar to what was observed in animal studies. Epidermal nerve densities correlated variably with sensory thresholds of warm and cold stimuli but had the best diagnostic efficiency when both sensitivity and specificity were considered. In conclusion, skin biopsy offers the advantage of studying temporal and spatial changes of sensory neuropathy. This is an entirely new field for both neuroscientists and neurologists.

79951540678	Skin denervation and its clinical significance in late-stage chronic kidney disease	Objective: To investigate the skin innervation and its clinical significance in late-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Design: Case series. Setting: National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Patients: Forty consecutive nondiabetic patients with late-stage CKD (14 female and 26 male; mean [SD] age, 60.7 [12.3] years), including 2 cases with stage 3 CKD, 6 with stage 4 CKD, and 32 with stage 5 CKD, ie, end-stage kidney disease. Interventions: Clinical evaluation of neurological deficits, nerve conduction study, autonomic function tests, and a 3-mm-diameter skin biopsy specimen taken from the distal leg. Main Outcome Measures: Quantitation of epidermal innervation, parameters of nerve conduction study, R-R interval variability, and sympathetic skin response. Results: Clinically, 21 patients (52.5%) were symptomatic with paresthesia over the limbs or autonomic symptoms. The intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density was markedly reduced in patients with CKD compared with age and sex-matched controls (mean [SD], 2.8 [2.0] vs 8.6 [2.8] fibers/mm; P<.001). Skin denervation was observed in 27 patients (67.5%). Fifteen patients (37.5%) had abnormalities on nerve conduction studies, and 29 patients (72.5%) had abnormal results on autonomic function tests. By analysis with multiple regression models, the IENF density was negatively correlated with the duration of renal disease (P=.02). Additionally, the R-R interval variability at rest was linearly correlated with the IENF density (P=.02) and the absence of sympathetic skin responses at the soles was associated with reduced IENF density (P=.03). Conclusions: Small-fiber sensory and autonomic neuropathies constitute the major form of neuropathy in latestage CKD. Furthermore, skin denervation was associated with the duration of renal disease. ©2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

84861550298	Spontaneous inflammatory pain model from a mouse line with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis	Background: N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis was used to induce a point mutation in C57BL/6 J mice. Pain-related phenotype screening was performed in 915 G3 mice. We report the detection of a heritable recessive mutant in meiotic recombinant N1F1 mice that caused an abnormal pain sensitivity phenotype with spontaneous skin inflammation in the paws and ears. Methods: We investigated abnormal sensory processing, neuronal peptides, and behavioral responses after the induction of autoinflammatory disease. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and polymerase chain reaction product sequencing were used to identify the mutation site. Results: All affected mice developed paw inflammation at 48 weeks. Histological examinations revealed hyperplasia of the epidermis in the inflamed paws and increased macrophage expression in the spleen and paw tissues. Mechanical and thermal nociceptive response thresholds were reduced in the affected mice. Locomotor activity was decreased in affected mice with inflamed hindpaws, and this reduction was attributable to the avoidance of contact of the affected paw with the floor. Motor strength and daily activity in the home cage in the affected mice did not show any significant changes. Although Fos immunoreactivity was normal in the dorsal horn of affected mice, calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity significantly increased in the deep layer of the dorsal horn. The number of microglia increased in the spinal cord, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex in affected mice, and the proliferation of microglia was maintained for a couple of months. Two hundred eighty-five SNP markers were used to reveal the affected gene locus, which was found on the distal part of chromosome 18. A point mutation was detected at A to G in exon 8 of the pstpip2 gene, resulting in a conserved tyrosine residue at amino acid 180 replaced by cysteine (Y180 C). Conclusions: The data provide definitive evidence that a mutation in pstpip2 causes autoinflammatory disease in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis mouse model. Thus, our pstpip2 mutant mice provide a new model for investigating the potential mechanisms of inflammatory pain. © 2012 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84867002160	Different trigemino-vascular responsiveness between adolescent and adult rats in a migraine model	Background: Pediatric migraine displays different clinical features from adult migraine. Because the trigemino-vascular system (TGVS) plays a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology, this study compared TGVS responses in a migraine model induced by intracisternal (i.c.) instillation of capsaicin in adolescent and adult rats. Methods: TGVS responses measured included c-Fos-protein-expressing neurons in the trigeminal cervical complex (TCC), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) expression in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dura mater, and dural protein extravasation. The formulas for estimating total numbers of activated TCC neurons were established based on the c-Fos-positive neuronal numbers in three sample sections, +0.6, -1.2 and -9mm and +0.6, -0.6 and -6 mm, from the obex in adult and adolescent rats, respectively. Results: After capsaicin instillation, adolescent rats had comparable TCC neurons activated as adult rats, but less TGVS peripheral responsiveness than adults, including CGRP immunoreactivity in the TG, and protein extravasation and CGRP depletion (inversely reflected by CGRP immunoreactivity) in the dura mater. Conclusions: Age-dependent differences in TGVS responsiveness in the i.c. capsaicin-induced migraine model of rats are reminiscent of less severe migraine in pediatric patients. This finding may provide new insight into the pathophysiology of migraine and guide the development of new anti-migraine drugs for children. © 2012 International Headache Society.

84877769492	Patterns of target tissue reinnervation and trophic factor expression after nerve grafting	BACKGROUND:: Reinnervation of target tissues determines functional outcomes after nerve grafting, which is important in traumatic injury caused by accidents or consequences resulting from surgical removal of tumors. Previous studies documented the influences of nerve repair mainly based on nerve morphometry but rarely compared the final outcomes according to target reinnervation patterns by nerve fibers of different categories. METHODS:: In a mouse model of nerve grafting, the authors analyzed the innervation indexes of different target tissues after transection-reimplantation on the sciatic nerve, which were defined as a parameter on the operated side normalized to that on the control side. RESULTS:: Muscle reinnervation appeared to be the best compared with skin reinnervation (p < 0.0001) and sweat gland reinnervation (p < 0.0001) at postoperative month 3. The sudomotor reinnervation was relatively higher than the cutaneous reinnervation (p = 0.014). The abundance of trophin transcripts for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin 3 (NT3) was higher in plantar muscles on the operated side than those on the control side. In contrast, transcripts of BDNF, GDNF, nerve growth factor, and NT3 were all similar in the footpad skin between the operated and control sides. CONCLUSIONS:: The results suggested that, compared with the skin, muscles achieved the best reinnervation after nerve grafting, which was related to higher expression of BDNF, GDNF, and NT3 in muscles than in the skin. © 2013 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

43049159672	Comparison of two PCR-based molecular methods in the diagnosis of CMT 1A and HNPP diseases in Chinese	Objectives: Current molecular diagnostic methods in detecting Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) diseases are either not sensitive or time-consuming and costing. The aims of this study are improving the accuracy and speeding up the diagnosis. Patients and methods: We developed real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) and three polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs) methods to test 53 unrelated CMT1A patients, 12 unrelated HNPP patients and 100 normal control subjects. Results: QPCR in detection of pmp22 gene duplication (CMT1A) and deletion (HNPP) showed a sensitivity of 100.00% (53/53) and 100.00% (12/12), respectively. And this method also showed a specificity of 100% (100/100) in CMT1A and 100% (100/100) in HNPP, respectively. In contrast, using three polymorphic STRs method showed a sensitivity of 50/53 (94%) in CMT1A and 12/12 (100.00%) of HNPP patients, respectively. And this method showed a specificity of 97% (100/103) in CMT1A and 100% (100/100) in HNPP, respectively. Conclusion: QPCR and three STRs methods both demonstrate a rapid and robust diagnosis with almost complete informativeness. The high sensitivity and heterozygosity of these three polymorphic markers in detecting CMT1A/HNPP subjects of Caucasian and Chinese showed the potential to become pan-ethnic screening markers in the future. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

42949122538	Enhancement of cutaneous nerve regeneration by 4-methylcatechol in resiniferatoxin-induced neuropathy	To generate an experimental neuropathy model in which smalldiameter sensory nerves are specifically affected and to test a potential treatment, adult mice were given a single injection (50 μg/kg, i.p.) of the capsaicin analog resiniferatoxin (RTX). On Day 7 after RTX treatment, there was a 53% reduction in unmyelinated nerve density in the medial plantar nerve (p = 0.0067) and a 66% reduction in epidermal nerve density of hind paw skin (p = 0.0004) compared with vehicle-treated controls. Substance PYimmunoreactive dorsal root ganglion neurons were also markedly depleted (p = 0.0001). These effects were associated with the functional deficit of prolonged withdrawal latencies to heat stimuli (p = 0.0007) on a hot plate test. The potential therapeutic effects of 4-methylcatechol (4MC) on this neuropathy were then tested by daily injections of 4MC (10 μg/kg,i.p.) from Days 7 to 35 after neuropathy induction. On Day 35, 4MCtreated mice had an increase in unmyelinated (p = 0.014) and epidermal nerve (p = 0.0013) densities and a reduction in thermal withdrawal latency (p = 0.0091) compared with RTX-only controls. These results indicate that 4MC promoted regeneration of unmyelinated nerves in experimental RTX-induced neuropathy and enhanced function.

42949132910	Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with gadolinium use	Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is an idiopathic, progressive, systemic fibrosis that occurs in patients with renal diseases. Recently, gadolinium-containing contrast (Gd-contrast) has become a suspected causal factor for NFS. This report discusses two female patients with end-stage renal disease, aged 70 and 51 years, respectively, who developed histologically proven NSF after exposure to Gd-contrast. Clinically, both patients were characterized by fibrosis and induration of skin and muscle mainly in the limbs with joint contracture. In the first case, NSF developed gradually after undergoing evaluation by Gd-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and subsequent surgery for her urothelial carcinoma. In the second patient, NSF developed after undergoing evaluation by Gd-contrast MRI for her right shoulder bursitis with calcification, and the conditions of NSF continued to worsen after the surgical treatment of this right shoulder lesion. Although the role of Gd-contrast in NSF is still not well known, the correlation in our cases strongly suggests that it should be used with cautioned in patients with end-stage renal disease. Both of our patients underwent surgery before or during the development of NSF, indicating that the surgical procedure may be a contributing factor. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

51349161587	Depletion of peptidergic innervation in the gastric mucosa of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats	Autonomic neuropathy affecting the gastrointestinal system is a major presentation of diabetic neuropathy. Changes in the innervation of gastric mucosa or muscle layers can contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms. The present study investigated this issue by quantitatively analyzing the immunohistochemical patterns of the gastric innervation in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. In control rats, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) (+) nerve fibers appeared in the gastric mucosa and muscle layers. Double immunohistochemical staining showed that immunoreactivities for SP and CGRP were co-localized with a pan-neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5. Both SP (+) nerve fibers (p < 0.001) and CGRP (+) nerve fibers (p < 0.005) were decreased in the gastric mucosa within 4 weeks of diabetes; the reduction persisted throughout 24 weeks. Diabetic rats treated with insulin did not show decrease of SP or CGRP (+) fibers in the mucosa 4 weeks after STZ injection (p > 0.05). There was no significant change in SP (+) nerve fibers (p > 0.05) or CGRP (+) nerve fibers (p > 0.05) of the gastric muscle layers. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the expression levels of SP and CGRP mRNA in the thoracic dorsal root ganglia were similar between diabetic and control animals (p > 0.05). Qualitative and quantitative ultrastructural examinations on the gastric mucosa documented unmyelinated nerve degeneration. These results suggest the existence of gastric sensory neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetes, and this pathology provides a foundation for understanding diabetic gastropathy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

53349163291	Influences of surgical decompression on the dorsal horn after chronic constriction injury: Changes in peptidergic and δ-opioid receptor (+) nerve terminals	To understand plastic changes in the dorsal horn related to neuropathic pain, we developed a model of decompression in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) and investigated corresponding changes in the dorsal horn. At postoperative week 4 (POW 4) of CCI, rats were divided into a decompression group, in which ligatures were removed, and a CCI group, in which ligatures remained. Spinal cords were immunostained for substance P (SP), the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Areas of immunoreactive nerve terminals in the dorsal horn were quantified and expressed as the dorsal horn index (immunoreactive areas of the operated side compared with those of the contralateral side). At POW 4, dorsal horn indexes of all of these molecules were significantly reduced in both groups to similar degrees (0.36∼0.43). At POW 8, neuropathic pain behaviors had completely disappeared in the decompression group with significant reversal of the dorsal horn indexes compared with the CCI group (0.81±0.02 vs. 0.58±0.09, P<0.001 for SP and 0.75±0.04 vs. 0.55±0.03, P<0.001 for DOR). In the CCI group, neuropathic pain behaviors became normalized at POW 12 with corresponding changes in dorsal horn indexes for both SP and DOR similar to those of the decompression group. In contrast, changes in the dorsal horn indexes of CGRP were similar in both the CCI and decompression groups throughout the experimental period. These findings suggest that CCI and decompression cause different patterns in peptidergic and DOR (+) nerve terminals in the dorsal horn. © 2008 IBRO.

53849117141	Macrophage physiological function after superparamagnetic iron oxide labeling	Our goal was to analyze the changes in morphology and physiological function (phagocytosis, migratory capabilities, humoral and cellular response, and nitric oxide secretion) of murine macrophages after labeling with a clinically used superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), ferucarbotran. In SPIO-treated macrophages, nanoparticles were taken up in the cytoplasm and accumulated in a membrane-bound organelle. Macrophage proliferation and viability were not modified after SPIO labeling. Phagocytic function decreased after labeling with only 10 μg Fe/mL. SPIO, whereas other functions including migration and production of tumor necrosis factor-α and nitric oxide increased at the highest SPIO concentration (100 μg Fe/mL).

60749127816	Role of acid-sensing ion channel 3 in sub-acute-phase inflammation	Background: Inflammation-mediated hyperalgesia involves tissue acidosis and sensitization of nociceptors. Many studies have reported increased expression of acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) in inflammation and enhanced ASIC3 channel activity with pro-inflammatory mediators. However, the role of ASIC3 in inflammation remains inconclusive because of conflicting results generated from studies of ASIC3 knockout (ASIC3-/ -) or dominant-negative mutant mice, which have shown normal, decreased or increased hyperalgesia during inflammation. Results: Here, we testedwhether ASIC3 plays an important role in inflammation of subcutaneous tissue of paw and muscle in ASIC3-/- mice induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or carrageenan by investigating behavioral and pathological responses, as well as the expression profile of ion channels. Compared with the ASIC3+/+ controls, ASIC3-/- mice showed normal thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia with acute (4-h) intraplantar CFA- or carrageenan-induced inflammation, but the hyperalgesic effects in the sub-acute phase (1-2 days) were milder in all paradigms except for thermal hyperalgesia with CFA-induced inflammation. Interestingly, carrageenan-induced primary hyperalgesia was accompanied by an ASIC3-dependent Nav1.9 up-regulation and increase of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant sodium currents. CFA-inflamed muscle did not evoke hyperalgesia in ASIC3-/- or ASIC3+/+ mice, whereas carrageenan-induced inflammation in muscle abolished mechanical hyperalgesia in ASIC3-/- mice, as previously described. However, ASIC3-/ - mice showed attenuated pathological features such as less CFA-induced granulomas and milder carrageenan-evoked vasculitis as compared with ASIC3+/+ mice. Conclusion: We provide a novel finding that ASIC3 participates in the maintenance of sub-acute-phase primary hyperalgesia in subcutaneous inflammation and mediates the process of granuloma formation and vasculitis in intramuscular inflammation. © 2009 Yen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0034773763	Quantitative pathology of cutaneous nerve terminal degeneration in the human skin	Pathological diagnosis of neuropathy has traditionally depended on ultrastructural examinations of nerve biopsy specimens, particularly for sensory neuropathies affecting unmyelinated and small-myelinated nociceptive nerves. These sensory nerves terminate in the epidermis of the skin, and the pathology of neuropathy usually begins from nerve terminals. We investigated the feasibility of diagnosing small-fiber sensory neuropathy by evaluating cutaneous innervation. Skin biopsy specimens of 3-mm in diameter were obtained from the distal leg and the distal forearm of 55 healthy controls and 35 patients with sensory neuropathy. In the healthy controls, conventional intraepidermal nerve fiber densities (IENF densities) as measured using the image analysis system in the distal forearm and in the distal leg were correlated (r=0.55, P<0.0001), with significantly higher values in the distal forearm than in the distal leg (17.07±6.51 vs 12.92±5.33 fibers/mm, P<0.001). Compared to IENF densities of healthy controls, these values of neuropathic patients were significantly reduced in the distal forearm (5.82±6.50 fibers/mm, P<0.01) and in the distal leg (2.40±2.30, P<0.001). We further explored the possibility of quantifying skin innervation by counting "ocular intraepidermal nerve fiber density" (ocular nerve fiber density) with no aid of an image analysis system. This was based on the fact that the epidermal length on specifically defined sections was very close to the predicted epidermal length of 3 mm, the diameter of skin punches (P=0.14). Ocular nerve fiber densities were significantly correlated with IENF densities as measured by the image analysis system (r=0.99, P<0.0001). Dermal nerve fibers of neuropathic patients either disappeared or became degenerated. These findings were consistent with the notion of early terminal degeneration in neuropathy, and will facilitate quantitative interpretation of epidermal innervation in human neuropathy.

73349122896	Effects of 4-methylcatechol on skin reinnervation: Promotion of cutaneous nerve regeneration after crush injury	We assessed the effects of treatment with 4-methylcatechol (4MC), a known inducer of nerve growth factor, on peripheral nerve regeneration by analyzing cutaneous and muscular reinnervation in mice after sciatic nerve crush injury. At 3 months postinjury, the skin innervation index was significantly higher in the 4MC group than the control group (p=0.0002); there was also increased unmyelinated fiber density (p=0.0042) and unmyelinated fibers/Remak bundle (p = 0.001) in sural nerves, indicating unmyelinated nerve fiber regeneration. These changes were accompanied by increases of transcripts for nerve growth factor (p = 0.0026) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (p=0.03) in the 4MC group. In contrast, muscle innervation indices were similar in both groups and were higher than the skin innervation index (p < 0.0001). The regeneration of myelinated nerve fibers, as assessed by fiber density, diameter and g ratio analyses in sural nerves, and amplitudes of muscle action potential in sciatic nerves, was similar in both groups. Taken together, these data suggest that 4MC specifically promoted the regeneration of unmyelinated nerve fibers and reinnervation of the skin by increasing the expression of nerve growth factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. © 2009 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

7744235658	Neuromuscular disorders in severe acute respiratory syndrome	Objective: To delineate and clarify neuromuscular disorders in patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Design: Case series with follow-up ranging from 3 weeks to 2 months. Setting: National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei. Patients: We investigated 4 patients with SARS who had concomitant neuromuscular problems. A diagnosis of SARS was based on the demonstration of serum coronavirus antibodies. Clinical presentations, laboratory results, electrophysiologic findings, and follow-up conditions were determined. Results: Patients developed neuromuscular problems approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS. Two women experienced motor-predominant peripheral nerve disorders. A man developed myopathy and a third woman experienced neuropathy and myopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from 2 patients with neuropathy disclosed normal protein content and the absence of pleocytosis and SARS coronavirus antibodies. Both patients with myopathy had elevated serum creatine kinase levels. A rapid clinical and electrophysiologic improvement was evident during follow-up examinations, with a good prognosis. Conclusions: The neuromuscular problems in patients with SARS are considered to be critical-illness polyneuropathy or myopathy, possibly coexistent. Further pathological and microbiological studies are necessary to determine the relationship between SARS coronavirus and neuromuscular problems.

77951541607	Distinct and shared cerebral activations in processing innocuous versus noxious contact heat revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging	Whether innocuous heat (IH)-exclusive brain regions exist and whether patterns of cerebral responses to IH and noxious heat (NH) stimulations are similar remain elusive. We hypothesized that distinct and shared cerebral networks were evoked by each type of stimulus. Twelve normal subjects participated in a functional MRI study with rapidly ramped IH (38°C) and NH (44°C) applied to the foot. Group activation maps demonstrated three patterns of cerebral activation: (1) IH-responsive only in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL); (2) NH-responsive only in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), posterior insular cortex (IC), and premotor area (PMA); and (3) both IH- and NH-responsive in the middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior IC, cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), lentiform nucleus (LN), and midbrain. According to the temporal analysis of regions of interest, the IPL exclusively responded to IH, and the S2, posterior IC, and PMA were exclusively activated by NH throughout the entire period of stimulation. The IFG, thalamus, ACC, and LN responded differently during different phases of IH versus NH stimulation, and the NH-responsive-only S1 responded transiently during the early phase of IH stimulation. BOLD signals in bilateral IPLs were specifically correlated with the ratings of IH sensation, while responses in the contralateral S1 and S2 were correlated with pain intensity. These results suggest that distinct and shared spatial and temporal patterns of cerebral networks are responsible for the perception of IH and NH. © 2009Wiley-Liss, Inc.

77953863131	European federation of neurological societies/peripheral nerve society guideline on the use of skin biopsy in the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. report of a joint task force of the european fe-deration of neurological societies and the peripheral nerve society	Background: Revision of the guidelines on the use of skin biopsy in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, published in 2005, has become appropriate owing to publication of more relevant articles. Most of the new studies focused on small fiber neuropathy (SFN), a subtype of neuropathy for which the diagnosis was first developed through skin biopsy examination. This revision focuses on the use of this technique to diagnose SFN. Methods: Task force members searched the Medline database from 2005, the year of the publication of the first EFNS guideline, to June 30th, 2009. All pertinent articles were rated according to the EFNS and PNS guidance. After a consensus meeting, the task force members created a manuscript that was subsequently revised by two experts (JML and JVS) in the field of peripheral neuropathy and clinical neurophysiology, who were not previously involved in the use of skin biopsy. Results and Conclusions: Distal leg skin biopsy with quantification of the linear density of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF), using generally agreed upon counting rules, is a reliable and efficient technique to assess the diagnosis of SFN (Recommendation Level A). Normative reference values are available for bright-field immunohistochemistry (Recommendation Level A) but not yet for confocal immunofluorescence or the blister technique. The morphometric analysis of IENF density, either performed with bright-field or immunofluorescence microscopy, should always refer to normative values matched for age (Recommendation Level A). Newly established laboratories should undergo adequate training in a well-established skin biopsy laboratory and provide their own stratified for age and gender normative values, intra-and interobserver reliability, and interlaboratory agreement. Quality control of the procedure at all levels is mandatory (Good Practice Point). Procedures to quantify subepidermal nerve fibers and autonomic innervated structures, including erector pili muscles, and skin vessels, are under development but need to be confirmed by further studies. Sweat gland innervation can be examined using an unbiased stereologic technique recently proposed (Recommendation Level B).A reduced IENF density is associated with the risk of developing neuropathic pain (Recommendation Level B), but it does not correlate with its intensity. Serial skin biopsies might be useful for detecting early changes of IENF density, which predict the progression of neuropathy, and to assess degeneration and regeneration of IENF (Recommendation Level C). However, further studies are warranted to confirm its potential usefulness as an outcome measure in clinical practice and research. Skin biopsy has not so far been useful for identifying the etiology of SFN. Finally, we emphasize that 3-mm skin biopsy at the ankle is a safe procedure based on the experience of 10 laboratories reporting absence of serious side effects in approximately 35 000 biopsies and a mere 0.19% incidence of non-serious side effects in about 15 years of practice (Good Practice Point). © 2010 EFNS and PNS.

77955442857	Clinical presentations and skin denervation in amyloid neuropathy due to transthyretin Ala97Ser	Objective: Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) due to amyloidogenic transthyretin (TTR) is often associated with impairment of thermonociceptive functions. This study investigated skin innervation and its clinical significance in genetically defined FAP due to a hot-spot Ala97Ser TTR mutation (Ala97Ser). Methods: Skin biopsies were performed on the distal leg of patients with Ala97Ser, and intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) densities were quantified. Results: There were 19 unrelated patients with Ala97Ser manifesting a late-onset (59.47 ± 5.70 years) generalized neuropathy with disabling motor, sensory, and autonomic symptoms. Against a background of a slowly progressive course, 7 patients (36.8%) exhibited additional rapid declines in neurologic deficits, which were associated with elevation of the protein content in the CSF (p < 0.001). The IENF density was markedly reduced in Ala97Ser patients compared to age-and gender-matched controls (0.99 ± 1.11 vs 8.31 ± 2.87 fibers/mm, p < 0.001). Skin denervation was present in all patients and was lower in patients with a higher disability grade (0.17 ± 0.26 vs 1.37 ± 1.16 fibers/mm, p = 0.003). Albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF was observed in 14 patients (73.7%), and the IENF density was negatively correlated with the CSF protein concentration (p = 0.015). Conclusions: Skin denervation was common in Ala97Ser, and degeneration of cutaneous nerve terminals was correlated with the severity of clinical phenotypes and the level of CSF protein. © 2010 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

77955451750	Pathology and functional diagnosis of small-fiber painful neuropathy	Small-fiber sensory neuropathy with neuropathic pain had been a diagnostic challenge for neurologists. We and several groups have developed skin biopsy with quantitation of intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density as a diagnostic approach. In the skin with small-fiber sensory neuropathy, there are pathological hallmarks: reduced IENF density with degeneration of subepidermal nerve plexuses and dermal nerves. Skin denervation is a major presentation of diabetic neuropathy and inflammatory neuropathies including Guillain-Barr? syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The skin biopsy approach also provides an opportunity to examine dermal vasculature and inflammatory vasculopathy is demonstrated in vasculitic neuropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, and eosinophilia-associated neuropathy. In addition to neuropahtologic evidence, the functional consequences of cutaneous nerve degeneration can be assessed with quantitative sensory testing (QST), contact heat evoked potential (CHEP), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). One major etiology of small-fiber sensory neuropathy is familial amyloid polyneuropathy caused by mutations of transthyretin (TTR). We recently conducted studies on a large cohort of unique TTR mutation on Ala97Ser in Taiwan. These patients had significant skin denervation in addition to motor and autonomic neuropathy. Taken together, the skin biopsy with quantitation of IENF density provides diagnostic utility for small-fiber sensory neuropathy and the combination of psychophysical, physiological, and neuroimaging examinations offer comprehensive assessments for patients with neuropathic pain due o cutaneous nerve degeneration.

79951688136	Pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in type 2 diabetes: Skin denervation and contact heat-evoked potentials	OBJECTIVE - Neuropathic pain due to small-fiber sensory neuropathy in type 2 diabetes can be diagnosed by skin biopsy with quantification of intra-epidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density. There is, however, a lack of noninvasive physiological assessment. Contact heat- evoked potential (CHEP) is a newly developed approach to record cerebral responses of Aδ fiber-mediated thermonociceptive stimuli. We investigated the diagnostic role of CHEP. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - From 2006 to 2009, there were 32 type 2 diabetic patients (20 males and 12 females, aged 51.63±10.93 years) with skin denervation and neuropathic pain. CHEPs were recorded with heat stimulations at the distal leg, where skin biopsy was performed. RESULTS - CHEP amplitude was reduced in patients compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects (14.8 ± 15.6 vs. 33.7 ± 10.1 μV, P < 0.001). Abnormal CHEP patterns (reduced amplitude or prolonged latency) were noted in 81.3% of these patients. The CHEP amplitude was the most significant parameter correlated with IENF density (P=0.003) and pain perception to contact heat stimuli (P = 0.019) on multiple linear regression models. An excitability index was derived by calculating the ratio of the CHEP amplitude over the IENF density. This excitability index was higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects (P = 0.023), indicating enhanced brain activities in neuropathic pain. Among different neuropathic pain symptoms, the subgroup with evoked pain had higher CHEP amplitudes than the subgroup without evoked pain (P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS - CHEP offers a noninvasive approach to evaluate the degeneration of thermonociceptive nerves in diabetic neuropathy by providing physiological correlates of skin denervation and neuropathic pain. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.

79952734334	Painful neuropathy due to skin denervation after metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity	A 53-year-old male patient developed insidious onset of length-dependent painful neuropathy on a background of encephalopathy during prolonged treatment with metronidazole for a cumulative dose of 146 g in 88 days. The reversible encephalopathy was documented with gradual resolution of hyperintense lesions in bilateral cerebellum and brainstem on brain MRI together with the improvement in symptoms of ataxia and dysarthria. The concomitant impairment of small-diameter sensory nerves posed a diagnostic challenge. The authors took advantage of serial skin biopsies to demonstrate reversible metronidazole- induced small-fibre sensory neuropathy, that is, skin denervation after metronidazole and corresponding skin reinnervation with the disappearance of sensory symptoms.

79955649652	Extensive bilateral striocerebellar calcifications associated with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism	Intracranial calcifications are not uncommon radiographic findings and usually are nonpathological. However, striocerebellar calcifications may result from metabolic derangements, one common one being hypoparathyroidism. Here, we report a case of Hashimoto's hypothyroidism where the patient experienced disturbance of consciousness and urinary incontinence and had extensive bilateral striocerebellar calcifications. After supplementation with levothyroxine, there were no more episodes of disturbed consciousness. Striocerebellar calcifications may be associated with metabolic derangement as a result of hypothyroidism, although the mechanism by which calcification occurs is not fully understood. Evaluation of thyroid function is recommended in patients with disturbed consciousness and striocerebellar calcifications. © 2011.

0035953147	Degeneration of nociceptive nerve terminals in human peripheral neuropathy	Patients with peripheral neuropathy have symptoms involving small-diameter nociceptive nerves and elevated thermal thresholds. Nociceptive nerves terminate in the epidermis of the skin and are readily demonstrated with the neuronal marker, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). To investigate the pathological characteristics of elevated thermal thresholds, we performed PGP 9.5 immunocytochemistry on 3 mm punch skin biopsies (the forearm and the leg) from 55 normal subjects and 35 neuropathic patients. Skin innervation was evaluated by quantifying epidermal nerve densities. Epidermal nerve densities were reduced in neuropathic patients compared to normal subjects. Epidermal nerve densities were variably correlated with thermal thresholds. The proportion of neuropathic patients with reduced epidermal nerve densities was larger than the proportion of neuropathic patients with elevated thermal thresholds. These results indicated that degeneration of epidermal nerve terminals preceded the elevation of thermal thresholds. Skin biopsy together with immunocytochemical demonstration of epidermal innervation offers a new approach to evaluate small-fiber sensory neuropathy. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

0036247333	Plasma exchange versus double filtration plasmapheresis in the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome	Previous studies have shown that both plasma exchange (PE) and double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) are effective treatments in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Whether PE and DFPP have similar effects in GBS is not clear. This report compares the therapeutic effectiveness of PE and DFPP in GBS patients treated in 3 major hospitals in northern Taiwan. A total of 102 patients were included in this survey, including 39 with PE (hereafter PE group) and 63 with DFPP (hereafter DFPP group). Both groups showed significant improvement of disability scores after treatment. However, time to onset of effect was shorter (5.6 ± 3.5 versus 7 ± 3.4 days, p < 0.05), and changes of disability scores were more prominent (1.3 ± 0.8 versus 0.8 ± 0.8, p < 0.05) in the PE group than the DFPP group. Mortality and outcome after 6 months were not different between the 2 groups. In conclusion, both PE and DFPP are effective treatments in GBS. PE was superior to DFPP in short-term effectiveness. The long-term effectiveness was not different.

0036451837	Neuropathology of skin denervation in acrylamide-induced neuropathy	Previous studies have established the neurotoxicity and pathology of acrylamide to large-diameter nerves. It remains unclear (1) whether small-diameter sensory nerves are vulnerable to acrylamide and (2) if so, how the pathology evolves during intoxication. We investigated the influence of acrylamide on small-diameter sensory nerves by studying the pathology of sensory nerve terminals in the skin. The neurotoxic effects of acrylamide (400 ppm in drinking water) on mice were assessed by immunostaining the skin with protein gene product 9.5, a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, particularly useful for demonstrating cutaneous nerve terminals. Within 5 days of acrylamide administration (the initial stage), epidermal nerves showed two major changes: (1) terminal swelling and (2) increased branching. There was a progressive reduction in epidermal nerve density (END) thereafter. Fifteen days after acrylamide intoxication (the late stage), reduction in END became evident (25.22 ± 2.19 fibers/mm vs 41.74 ± 2.60 fibers/mm in control mice, P < 0.003). At this stage, there was significant dermal nerve degeneration with ultrastructural demonstrations of vacuolar changes. These findings establish the pathological consequences of acrylamide neurotoxicity in cutaneous sensory nerves with far-reaching implications: (1) providing an animal system to study "dying-back" pathology of nociceptive nerves and (2) forming the ultrastructural foundation for interpreting the pathology of cutaneous nerve degeneration in skin biopsies. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

80053378698	Quantitation of sudomotor innervation in skin biopsies of patients with diabetic neuropathy	Previous assessments of the sudomotor system have depended on functional tests, and only a few studies document the pathologic findings of postganglionic nerve degeneration quantitatively and at the ultrastructural level. We developed a quantitative system of sudomotor innervation in skin biopsies of the distal leg by immunostaining of nerve fibers with anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) and by counterstaining with Congo red. A computerized area-based morphometric analysis was used to quantify the sweat gland innervation index (SGII), defined as the area of nerve fibers normalized to the area of sweat glands. This approach reduced the variations in measurements of sweat gland areas compared to the commonly used method by ∼5.6-fold (2.47% ± 2.54% vs 13.97% ± 14.24%, p < 0.001); hence, variations in SGII were also reduced. We examined 35 Type 2 diabetic patients (24 men and 11 women; mean age, 56.5 ± 12.8 years), with symmetrical length-dependent neuropathy and reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density (0.76 ± 0.95 fibers/mm). By light and electron microscopy, PGP9.5-positive nerve terminals surrounded Congo red-positive sweat gland secretory coils in controls; these periglandular nerve terminals were either absent or markedly reduced in diabetic patients. Diabetic patients had lower SGII values than age-and sex-matched controls (2.60% ± 1.96% vs 4.84% ± 1.51%, p < 0.0001). The SGII values were lower in patients with anhidrosis of the feet versus those with normal sweating of the feet (0.89% ± 0.71% vs 3.10% ± 1.94%, p < 0.01). Thus, skin biopsy offers combined assessment of sudomotor innervation. © 2011 2011 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

81855211777	Amyloid neuropathy with transthyretin mutations: Overview and unique Ala97Ser in Taiwan	Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is a major etiology in differential diagnosis of symmetric axonal-form polyneuropathy, but had been considered an unusual disease in Taiwan. We have reviewed the pathology of nerve biopsies and sequenced the entire 4 exons of transthyretin (TTR), the most common genetic mutation of FAP. Our studies indicated that the mutation of TTR at Ala97Ser (TTR Ala97Ser) was a new mutation only reported in ethnic Taiwanese, and this mutation accounted for the most frequent etiology of adult-onset pan-modality (involving motor, sensory, and autonomic components of peripheral nerves) polyneuropathy with the pathology of axonal degeneration type. Over the past 10 years, there have been advancements in the management of FAP due to TTR mutations: (1) symptomatic treatments of dyaautonomia, especially orthostatic hypotension, and (2) therapies with liver transplantation and small molecules to reduce or stabilize TTR.

84859098620	Effect of glycemic control on sudomotor denervation in type 2 diabetes	OBJECTIVE - Sudomotor symptoms are a common component of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, but the pathology of sudomotor innervation and its relationship with glycemic control have remained obscured. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We enrolled 42 patients (26 males and 16 females aged 56.64 ± 12.67 years) with diabetic neuropathy defined by symmetric distally predominant sensory symptoms, abnormal nerve conduction studies, and reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the leg. Skin biopsies of the distal leg were immunostained with antiprotein gene product 9.5 for nerve fibers and counterstained with Congo red for sweat glands. Sweat gland innervation index (SGII) was quantified with a new computerized area-based morphometric system. RESULTS - Protein gene product 9.5(+) nerve terminals surrounded secretory coils of the sweat glands in the skin of control subjects. Sudomotor denervation was present in diabetic patients, manifesting as depletion of periglandular nerve fibers with lower SGII compared with 42 age- and sex-matched control subjects (2.54 ± 1.87 vs. 4.68 ± 1.51%, P < 0.001).

84859882029	P2X3-mediated peripheral sensitization of neuropathic pain in resiniferatoxin-induced neuropathy	Patients suffering from sensory neuropathy due to skin denervation frequently have paradoxical manifestations of reduced nociception and neuropathic pain. However, there is a lack of satisfactory animal models to investigate these phenomena and underlying mechanisms. We developed a mouse system of neuropathy induced by resiniferatoxin (RTX), a capsaicin analog, and examined the functional significance of P2X3 receptor in neuropathic pain. From day 7 of RTX neuropathy, mice displayed mechanical allodynia (p< 0.0001) and thermal hypoalgesia (p< 0.0001). After RTX treatment, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of the peripherin type were depleted (p= 0.012), while neurofilament (+) DRG neurons were not affected (p= 0.62). In addition, RTX caused a shift in neuronal profiles of DRG: (1) increased in P2X3 receptor (p= 0.0002) and ATF3 (p= 0.0006) but (2) reduced TRPV1 (p= 0.036) and CGRP (p= 0.015). The number of P2X3(+)/ATF3(+) neurons was linearly correlated with mechanical thresholds (p= 0.0017). The peripheral expression of P2X3 receptor in dermal nerves was accordingly increased (p= 0.016), and an intraplantar injection of the P2X3 antagonists, A-317491 and TNP-ATP, relieved mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, RTX-induced sensory neuropathy with upregulation of P2X3 receptor for peripheral sensitization of mechanical allodynia, which provides a new therapeutic target for neuropathic pain after skin denervation. © 2012.

0037314722	Cutaneous innervation in Guillain-Barré syndrome: Pathology and clinical correlations	Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is traditionally considered to be a large-fibre neuropathy. However, the presence of hypo-aesthesia, dysaesthesia and dysautonomia in GBS patients raises the possibility that small-diameter sensory and autonomic nerves may also be affected. To investigate small-fibre neuropathy in GBS, we performed a skin biopsy from the distal leg of 20 patients with the demyelinating form of GBS. Skin sections were immunohistochemically stained with anti-serum against protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase. Cutaneous innervation was evaluated by measuring epidermal nerve density (END), and END was further correlated with various clinical and electrophysiological parameters. In GBS patients, END values were much lower than in age- and gender-matched control subjects (5.03 ± 1.18 versus 10.16 ± 0.87 fibres/mm, P < 0.001). Eleven patients (55%) had reduced epidermal innervation with pathological evidence of active nerve degeneration in the dermis: fragmentation of subepidermal nerve plexuses and a beaded appearance of dermal nerves. GBS patients had significantly elevated thermal thresholds with higher warm threshold temperatures (44.54 ± 1.04 versus 39.00 ± 0.35°C, P < 0.001) and lower cold threshold temperatures (25.57 ± 1.11 versus 29.05 ± 0.21°C, P = 0.032). Reduced END values were associated with an elevated warm threshold (P = 0.027), ventilatory distress (P = 0.037) and dysautonomia (P = 0.001). END values were negatively correlated with disability grade on a scale of 1-6 (slope -0.134 ± 0.038, P = 0.0018). Patients with reduced END values tended to have a slower recovery than those with normal END values (P = 0.013, median time 12 versus 2 weeks). Pathologically, sudomotor innervation of the skin was reduced in five of 17 (29.4%) GBS patients in whom sweat glands could be recognized. These findings suggest that small-fibre sensory and autonomic neuropathies exist in a significant proportion of GBS patients, and that END values are correlated with functional disabilities. In summary, GBS should be considered a global neuropathy instead of a pure large-fibre neuropathy.

84866410792	Patterns of nerve injury and neuropathic pain in ischemic neuropathy after ligation-reperfusion of femoral artery in mice	Ischemia is an important etiology of painful neuropathies. We generated a mouse system of ischemic neuropathy by ligation-reperfusion of the femoral artery to mimic neuropathic pain and nerve injury patterns observed clinically. Mice exhibited spontaneous neuropathic pain behaviors, which were most obvious after ischemia for 5 h. Mechanical and cold allodynia developed by post-operative day (POD) 7 and persisted through the experimental period up to POD 56. Neuropathic pain behaviors were alleviated with intraperitoneal gabapentin (50 and 100 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. Large-fiber deficit assessed with nerve conduction studies was demonstrated by reduced amplitudes of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) on POD 7 (48.4% of the control side, p < 0.001). Small-fiber impairment was demonstrated by decreased epidermal nerve density (END) on POD 7 (29.1% of the control side, p < 0.001). Reductions in CMAP amplitudes and ENDs persisted through POD 56. Our system replicated the clinical manifestations of ischemic neuropathy: (1) neuropathic pain with cold and mechanical allodynia and (2) nerve injury to both large and small fibers with pathologic and physiologic evidence. This system produced by a simple procedure provides an opportunity to investigate mechanisms and further treatments of ischemic neuropathy on genetically engineered mice. © 2012 Peripheral Nerve Society.

Methods: Patients with new-onset aneurysmal SAH in World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade IV or V neurologic condition who had perfusion CT performed at admission were eligible for the study. The study retrospectively enrolled 38 patients seen between January 2007 and July 2009. The decision to perform an early obliteration was made by the family after a discussion with the neurosurgeons, neurointensivists, and interventional radiologists. The functional outcomes were correlated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months, and quantitative perfusion CT data were collected. Results: This study included 10 (26%) grade IV and 28 (74%) grade V patients. Favorable outcomes occurred in 19 (50%) patients, and 11 (29%) patients died. After a multivariate logistic regression analysis of the parameters, older age (odds ratio 1.104, P = 0.0317), bilateral prolonged mean transient time (MTT) at the thalami (odds ratio 4.155, P = 0.0362), and early obliteration (odds ratio 0.098, P = 0.003) were predictive of poor outcome. Conclusions: Early bilateral prolonged MTT at the thalami and old age are associated with a poor outcome. Early obliteration benefits a significant portion of SAH patients.

84870289039	Role of Peptidergic Nerve Terminals in the Skin: Reversal of Thermal Sensation by Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide in TRPV1-Depleted Neuropathy	To investigate the contribution of peptidergic intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENFs) to nociceptive responses after depletion of the thermal-sensitive receptor, transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1), we took advantage of a resiniferatoxin (RTX)-induced neuropathy which specifically affected small-diameter dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and their corresponding nerve terminals in the skin. Thermal hypoalgesia (p<0.001) developed from RTX-treatment day 7 (RTXd7) and became normalized from RTXd56 to RTXd84. Substance P (SP)(+) and TRPV1(+) neurons were completely depleted (p = 0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively), but RTX had a relatively minor effect on calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)(+) neurons (p = 0.029). Accordingly, SP(+) (p<0.0001) and TRPV1(+) (p = 0.0008) IENFs were permanently depleted, but CGRP(+) IENFs (p = 0.012) were only transiently reduced and had recovered by RTXd84 (p = 0.83). The different effects of RTX on peptidergic neurons were attributed to the higher co-localization ratio of TRPV1/SP than of TRPV1/CGRP (p = 0.029). Thermal hypoalgesia (p = 0.0018) reappeared with an intraplantar injection of botulinum toxin type A (botox), and the temporal course of withdrawal latencies in the hot-plate test paralleled the innervation of CGRP(+) IENFs (p = 0.0003) and CGRP contents in skin (p = 0.01). In summary, this study demonstrated the preferential effects of RTX on depletion of SP(+) IENFs which caused thermal hypoalgesia. In contrast, the skin was reinnervated by CGRP(+) IENFs, which resulted in a normalization of nociceptive functions. © 2012 Hsieh et al.

84884290022	Effect of aging on the cerebral processing of thermal pain in the human brain	The perception of pain changes as people age. However, how aging affects the quality of pain and whether specific pain-processing brain regions mediate this effect is unclear. We hypothesized that specific structures in the cerebral nociceptive system mediate the effect of aging on the variation in different pain psychophysical measures. We examined the relationships between painful heat stimulation to the foot and both functional magnetic resonance imaging signals and gray matter volume in 23 healthy subjects (aged 25∼71 years). Increased age was related to decreased subjective ratings of overall pain intensity and the "sharp" quality of pain. Group activation maps of multiple linear regression analyses revealed that age predicted responses in the middle insular cortex (IC) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to pain stimuli after controlling for their gray matter volumes. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signals in the contralateral middle IC and S1 were related to ratings of "sharpness," but not any affective descriptors of pain. Importantly, activity in the contralateral middle IC specifically mediated the effect of age on overall pain perception, whereas activity in the contralateral S1 mediated the relationship between age and sharp sensation to pain. The analyses of gray matter volume revealed that key nociceptive cerebral regions did not undergo significant age-related gray matter loss. However, the volume of the cingulate cortex covaried with pain perception after adjusting for corresponding neural activity to pain. These results suggest that age-related functional alterations in pain-processing regions are responsible for changes in pain perception during normal aging. © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

84883780993	fMRI evidence of degeneration-induced neuropathic pain in diabetes: Enhanced limbic and striatal activations	Persistent neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve degeneration in diabetes is a stressful symptom; however, the underlying neural substrates remain elusive. This study attempted to explore neuroanatomical substrates of thermal hyperalgesia and burning pain in a diabetic cohort due to pathologically proven cutaneous nerve degeneration (the painful group). By applying noxious 44°C heat stimuli to the right foot to provoke neuropathic pain symptoms, brain activation patterns were compared with those of healthy control subjects and patients with a similar degree of cutaneous nerve degeneration but without pain (the painless group). Psychophysical results showed enhanced affective pain ratings in the painful group. After eliminating the influence of different pain intensity ratings on cerebral responses, the painful group displayed augmented responses in the limbic and striatal structures, including the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), superior frontal gyrus, medial thalamus, anterior insular cortex, lentiform nucleus (LN), and premotor area. Among these regions, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals in the ACC and LN were correlated with pain ratings to thermal stimulations in the painful group. Furthermore, activation maps of a simple regression analysis as well as a region of interest analysis revealed that responses in these limbic and striatal circuits paralleled the duration of neuropathic pain. However, in the painless group, BOLD signals in the primary somatosensory cortex and ACC were reduced. These results suggest that enhanced limbic and striatal activations underlie maladaptive responses after cutaneous nerve degeneration, which contributed to the development and maintenance of burning pain and thermal hyperalgesia in diabetes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84897752907	Painful neuropathy with skin denervation after prolonged use of linezolid	The prolonged use of linezolid, a new antibiotic against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, might cause painful neuropathy. This finding raises the possibility that small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin, which are responsible for transmitting nociceptive information, might be affected. We report a 53-year-old female who developed pure small-fibre painful neuropathy (visual analogue scale, VAS =82 on 0-100 scale) with marked skin denervation in the leg (epidermal nerve density, END =2.32 fibres/mm, norm <5.88 fibres/mm) and significant elevation of the warm threshold in the foot (40.0°C, norm <39.4°C) after the use of linezolid for 6 months. Eight months after the discontinuation of linezolid, the skin became fully reinnervated (END =9.04 fibres/mm), with disappearance of neuropathic pain (VAS =0) and normalisation of the warm threshold (36.3°C). Nerve conduction studies for large-diameter motor and sensory nerves were normal. This report documents a pure small-fibre sensory neuropathy after prolonged use of linezolid, and the relationship between skin innervation and corresponding neuropathic pain.

84911005653	Redistribution of voltage-gated sodium channels after nerve decompression contributes to relieve neuropathic pain in chronic constriction injury	Nerve decompression is an important therapeutic strategy to relieve neuropathic pain and promote the peripheral nerve regeneration. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of nerve decompression on relief of neuropathic pain behaviors, redistribution of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), and skin reinnervation with chronic constriction injury (CCI). At post-operative week (POW) 4, animals were divided into a decompression group, in which the ligatures were removed, and a CCI group, in which the ligatures remained. Thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia at POW 8 had distinct reductions in decompression group compared to CCI group. At that time in CCI group, morphological evidence of pan VGSCs (Pan Nav) and isoforms of VGSCs (Nav1.6, Nav1.9, except for Nav1.8) were shown the widely distribution along the injured sciatic nerve. All of the VGSCs in decompression group became clustering around the node of Ranvier, similar to the pattern of control sciatic nerve at POW 8. Skin reinnervation was demonstrated by epidermal nerve density (END) for protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5)-immunoreactive (IR) nerve fibers and a significant difference between groups only at POW 24 (p=0.01). Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) is participated in the nerve fiber growth and sprouting, a difference in END for GAP-43-IR nerve fibers at POW 24 between groups were also significant (p=0.02). These observations demonstrated that nerve decompression was accompanied with the disappearance of neuropathic pain behaviors after CCI. Morphological studies provided the evidence that redistribution of VGSCs along the injured sciatic nerve but still with an incomplete skin reinnervation. These significant findings demonstrated a role of VGSCs in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain, and gave an approaching in pharmacological basis of therapeutics.

84912039242	Normal values and symptom correlation of a simplified oatmeal-based gastric emptying study in the Chinese population	Background and Aim: Instant oatmeal has been proposed as a good alternative to the standardized low-fat egg white test meal for gastric emptying studies. We aim to establish normal values of oatmeal-based gastric emptying scintigraphy and test its correlation with gastroparesis symptoms in the Chinese population. Methods: This study prospectively enrolled 60 healthy volunteers, 30 functional dyspepsia and 30 diabetes patients with gastroparesis symptoms. All participants were evaluated using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index. Each participant ingested instant oatmeal mixed with 1 mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid, and serial imaging was immediately acquired for 3h in the supine position using a left anterior oblique projection. Time-activity curves were generated and quantitative parameters were determined. Normal values were established from healthy volunteers and further applied in the symptomatic patients. Results: All participants finished the test meal and tolerated the procedure well. All gastric emptying parameters were not significantly affected by age or gender. Values above the 95th percentile of T<inf>1/2</inf>, gastric retention at 1, 2, and 3 h (85 min, 65%, 28%, and 8%, respectively) were indicative of delayed gastric emptying. Values below the 5th percentile of gastric retention at 0.5 and 1h (40% and 15%, respectively) were indicative of rapid gastric emptying. The lower gastric retention limit at 0.5 and 1h were 40% and 15%, respectively. Four (13.3%) diabetes and four (13.3%) functional dyspepsia patients had delayed emptying while three diabetes patients (10%) had rapid emptying. Gastric emptying parameters correlated best with vomiting (r=0.621) and nausea (r=0.566) in diabetes patients. Conclusions: We established normal values of oatmeal-based gastric emptying scintigraphy and observed good correlation with cardinal gastroparesis symptoms in the Chinese population.

11244319598	Immunohistochemical study of skin nerve regeneration after toe-to-finger transplantation: Correlations with clinical, quantitative sensory, and electrophysiological evaluations	Cutaneous nerve regeneration following toe-to-finger transplantation was studied by immunohistochemical technique using antibody to protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) which is a specific neuronal marker. By this technique, epidermal and dermal nerves were semi-quantified and the Meissner's corpuscles were quantified. There were also quantitative sensory tests (QST) including pinprick, pressure and temperature, as well as electrophysiological studies including digital nerve sensory conduction, digital nerve somatosensory evoked potentials and sympathetic skin response at the pulp of the transplanted toes. The opposite corresponding normal finger and normal toe served as controls. Study subjects were 20 adult patients with toe-to-finger transplantation for at least one year. A score system was used to quantify the results of histochemical, psychophysiological and electrophysiological studies. Clinically 7 patients had good recovery and 13 patients had poor recovery. Cutaneous nerve regeneration in the transplanted toes was incomplete with epidermal nerve, dermal nerve and the Meissner's corpuscle significantly reduced. The nerve regeneration was correlated with clinical recovery, QST and electrophysiological data. These findings indicate that immunohischemical technique is useful to evaluate skin nerve regeneration following toe-to-finger transplantation, and that although nerve regeneration did occur, it was incomplete and correlated with the severity of hand injury.

12144255965	Skin denervation, neuropathology, and neuropathic pain in a laser-induced focal neuropathy	Small-diameter sensory nerves innervating the skin are responsive to noxious stimuli, and an injury to these nerves is presumably related to neuropathic pain. Injury-induced neuropathic pain in animals can be produced by laser irradiation, which usually requires concomitant use of photosensitive dyes, known as the photochemical approach. It is not clear whether laser irradiation alone can induce neuropathic pain. In addition, two issues are important to apply these approaches: the relationship between the extent of laser irradiation and the occurrence of neuropathic pain, and the susceptibility of small-diameter sensory nerves in the skin to laser-induced neuropathic pain. To address these issues, we designed a new model of focal neuropathy by applying a diode laser of 532 nm (100 mW) to the sciatic nerve and evaluated small-diameter nerves by quantifying skin innervation and large-diameter nerves by measuring amplitudes of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP). Immediately after laser irradiation, epineurial vessels were occluded due to the formation of thrombi, and the blood flow through these vessels was markedly reduced. On postoperative day (POD) 2, animals developed characteristic manifestations of neuropathic pain, including spontaneous pain behaviors, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia. These phenomena peaked during PODs 7-21, and lasted for 3-6 weeks. The neuropathology at the irradiated site of the sciatic nerve included a focal area of axonal degeneration surrounded by demyelination and endoneurial edema. The extent of damage to large-diameter motor and sensory nerves after laser irradiation was evaluated by nerve conduction studies. On the irradiated sides, amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were reduced to 65.0% (P < 0.0001) and 42.5% (P < 0.01) of those on the control sides, respectively. Motor innervation of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) on plantar muscles was examined by combined cholinesterase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. The ratio of innervated NMJs on the operated sides decreased to 76.3% of that on the control side. Skin innervation in the territory of the irradiated sciatic nerves was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with neuronal markers. Among these markers, epidermal nerve densities for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP) were significantly lower on the irradiated sides than the control sides with a different degree of loss for each marker (42.1-53.1%, P < 0.05). Results suggest that laser-induced focal neuropathy provides a new system for studying neuropathic pain. With this approach, the extent of nerve injury can be quantified. Both small-diameter epidermal nerves and large-diameter sensory and motor nerves are susceptible to laser-induced injury of different degrees. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
