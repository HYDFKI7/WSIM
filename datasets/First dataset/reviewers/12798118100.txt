84948730756	Bifurcation Analysis and Sliding Mode Control of Chaotic Vibrations in an Autonomous System	We study the bifurcations and sliding mode control of chaotic vibrations in an autonomous system. More precisely, a Hopf bifurcation controller is designed so as to control the unstable subcritical Hopf bifurcation to the stable supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Research result shows that the control method can work very well in Hopf bifurcation control. Besides, we controlled the system to any fixed point and any periodic orbit to eliminate the chaotic vibration by means of sliding mode method. And the numerical simulations were presented to confirm the effectiveness of the controller.

20544445513	Codimension two bifurcation of a vibro-bounce system	A three-degree-of-freedom vibro-bounce system is considered. The disturbed map of period one single-impact motion is derived analytically. A center manifold theorem technique is applied to reduce the Poincaré map to a three-dimensional one, and the normal form map associated with Hopf-flip bifurcation is obtained. Dynamical behavior of the system, near the point of codimension two bifurcation, is investigated by using qualitative analysis and numerical simulation. It is found that near the point of Hopf-flip bifurcation there exists not only Hopf bifurcation of period one single-impact motion, but also Hopf bifurcation of period two double-impact motion. The results from simulation show that there exists an interesting torus doubling bifurcation near the codimension two bifurcation. The torus doubling bifurcation makes the quasi-periodic attractor associated with period one single-impact motion transform to the other quasi-periodic attractor represented by two attracting closed circles. The torus bifurcation is qualitatively different from the typical torus doubling bifurcation occurring in the vibro-impact systems. Different routes from period one single-impact motion to chaos are observed by numerical simulation.

24344490827	Quasi periodic impact motions and routes to chaos of an impact system with two single-degree-of-freedom oscillators	An impact system, with two single-degree-of-freedom oscillators, is under consideration based on the Poincaré map. The system consists of linear components, but the displacements of two oscillators are limited due to the mutual impacts. Such model plays an important role in the studies of mechanical systems with impacts, e.g., vibro-impact forming machinery, gears, inertial shaker and pile driver, etc. Period n single-impact motions and associated disturbed maps are obtained analytically. The existence condition and stability criterion of period n single-impact motions are derived.

26444559056	Structural and thermodynamic properties of GaN at high pressures and high temperatures	The structural and thermodynamic properties of GaN have been investigated systematically using the molecular dynamics method with Buckingham potential. These properties including phase transition, lattice constant, thermal expansion, isothermal bulk modulus, and specific heat were calculated in a wide range of temperatures (300-3000 K) and pressures (0-65 GPa). The obtained structural and thermodynamic parameters under normal state are found to be in good agreement with the existing experimental data and theoretical results. Meanwhile, some thermodynamic parameters have been predicted at elevated temperatures and high pressures based on the reliable potential model.

28244469550	Properties of MgO at high pressures: Shell-model molecular dynamics simulation	Shell-model molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been performed to investigate the melting of the major Earth-forming mineral: periclase (MgO), at elevated temperatures and high pressures, based on the thermal instability analysis. The interatomic potential is taken to be the sum of pair-wise additive Coulomb, van der Waals attraction, and repulsive interactions. The MD simulation with selected Lewis-Catlow (LC) potential parameters is found to be very successful in describing the melting behavior for MgO, by taking account of the overheating of a crystalline solid at ambient pressure. The thermodynamic melting curve is estimated on the basis of the thermal instability MD simulations and compared with the available experimental data and other theoretical results in the pressure ranges 0-150 GPa. Our simulated melting curve of MgO is consistent with results obtained from Lindemann melting equation and two-phase simulated data at constant pressure by Belonoshko and Dubrovinsky, in the pressure below 20 GPa. The extrapolated melting temperatures in the lower mantle are in good agreement with the results obtained from Wang's empirical model up to 100 GPa. Compared with experimental measurements, our results are substantially higher than that determined by Zerr and Boehler, and the discrepancy between DAC and MD melting temperatures may be well explained with different melting mechanisms. Meanwhile, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of Mg-Mg, O-Mg, and O-O ion pairs near the melting temperature have been investigated. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33645456263	Motion of the multi-degree-of-freedom vibratory system with a clearance	A multi-degree-of-freedom vibratory system with a clearance is considered. The system consists of linear components, but the maximum displacement of one of the masses is limited to a threshold value by the symmetrical rigid stops. Such models play an important role in the study of mechanical systems with clearances or gaps. Local codimension two bifurcation of maps, associated with Hopf-pitchfork case, is analyzed using the center manifold theorem and normal form method of maps. The period-one double-impact symmetrical motion and Poincare map of the vibratory system with symmetrical rigid stops are derived analytically. The existence and stability of period-one double-impact symmetrical motion are analyzed explicitly. Near the point of codimension two bifurcation there exists not only Hopf bifurcation of period-one double-impact symmetrical motion, but also pitchfork bifurcation of the motion, which results in the period-one double-impact unsymmetrical motion. With change of the forcing frequency, the unsymmetrical double-impact periodic motion will undergo Hopf bifurcation. The routes of quasi-periodic impact motions to chaos are observed from simulation results.

33646376207	A quantitative description model for direction relations based on direction groups	The description models for spatial relations, especially those for direction relations, have gained increasing attention in GIS and Cartography community in recent decades. In this paper, such a quantitative model for spatial direction relations is discussed. It has been suggested that people often describe directions between two objects using multiple directions but not a single one; therefore a description model for direction relations should use multiple directions, i.e. direction group. A direction group consists of two components: the azimuths of the normals of direction Voronoi edges between two objects and the corresponding weights of the azimuths. The former can be calculated by means of Delaunay triangulation of the vertices and the points of intersection of the two objects; the latter can be calculated using the common areas of the two objects or the lengths of their direction Voronoi diagram (DVD) edges.The advantages of this model exist in four aspects: (1) direction computations are converted into a 1-dimension space problem and use lines (DVDs) to solve it, therefore direction computation process is simplified; (2) once Dir(A,B), the directions from A to B, is obtained, Dir(B,A) can be got without complex computations; (3) A quantitative direction group can be transformed into a qualitative one easily; (4) quantitative direction relations between objects can be recorded in 2-dimension tables, which is very useful in spatial reasoning. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.

33748081103	Double Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and torus bifurcation of a class of vibratory systems with symmetrical rigid stops	A multidegree-of-freedom system having symmetrically placed rigid stops and subjected to periodic excitation is considered. The system consists of linear components, but the maximum displacement of one of the masses is limited to a threshold value by the symmetrical rigid stops. Repeated impacts usually occur in the vibratory system due to the rigid amplitude constraints. Such models play an important role in the studies of mechanical systems with clearances or gaps. Double Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of the system is analyzed by using the center manifold and normal form method of maps. The period-one double-impact symmetrical motion and homologous disturbed map of the system are derived analytically. A center manifold theorem technique is applied to reduce the Poincaré map to a four-dimensional one, and the normal form map associated with double Neimark-Sacker bifurcation is obtained. The bifurcation sets for the normal-form map are illustrated in detail. Local behavior of the vibratory systems with symmetrical rigid stops, near the points of double Neimark-Sacker bifurcations, is reported by the presentation of results for a three-degree-of-freedom vibratory system with symmetrical stops. The existence and stability of period-one double-impact symmetrical motion are analyzed explicitly. Also, local bifurcations at the points of change in stability are analyzed, thus giving some information on dynamical behavior near the points of double Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. Near the value of double Neimark-Sacker bifurcation there exist period-one double-impact symmetrical motion and quasi-periodic impact motions. The quasi-periodic impact motions are represented by the closed circle and "tire-like" attractor in projected Poincaré sections. With change of system parameters, the quasi-periodic impact motions usually lead to chaos via "tire-like" torus doubling. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Existence and stability of period-n single-impact motions of the pile driver are analyzed by theoretical and numerical methods, and the characteristic of period-n single-impact motions is described. The singularity of the Poincare mapping, caused by the grazing contact of driver and pile, is considered. The influence of singularities on global bifurcations and transitions to chaos is elucidated. These transitions are not regular bifurcations but arise from piecewise property and singularity of the impact mapping.

33845368934	Periodic motions and bifurcations of vibratory systems with plastic impacts repeated	Vibratory systems with repeated impacts are considered. Dynamics of such systems, in inelastic impact cases, are studied with special attention to existence of two different types of periodic-impact motions, bifurcations and singularity by applying bifurcation theory of mapping. Regularity and transition of two types of periodic-impact motions are studied by use of a mapping derived from the equations of motion. The mapping of vibratory systems with repeated inelastic impacts is of piecewise property due to synchronous and non-synchronous motions of impact components immediately after the impact, and singularities caused by the grazing contact motions of impact components. The piecewise property and grazing singularity of Poincare mapping of such systems lead to non-standard bifurcations of periodic-impact motions. The influence of the piecewise property and singularities on global bifurcations and transitions to chaos is elucidated. The routes from periodic-impact motions to chaos are analyzed by numerical analyses.

The results indicate that a uniform flattop spectral response can be obtained when the length difference of interference arms and the coupling coefficient of the couplers are equal to certain values. The passband and stopband of optical interleaver are improved remarkably. Compared with conventional MZI using 2 × 2 fiber couplers, the most advantage of the present method is that the coupling ratio of couplers can be controlled accurately because the interference effect of the monitor light can be sheered away in the course of fabricating couplers. A novel structure of filter is fabricated by using the fused biconical taper technics in experiment. The experiment results are in good agreement with the analytical ones.

These systems have a rich variety of nonlinear behavior, which are investigated here by numerically integrating the Lagrangian equations of motion. A tiny change in parameters can lead to an enormous difference in the long-term behavior of the system. Bubbles of periodic orbits may also occur within the bifurcation sequence. Hyperchaotic behavior is also observed in cases where two of the Lyapunov exponents are positive, one is zero, and one is negative.

Periodic and chaotic motions can be clearly distinguished by all of the analytical tools applied here, namely Poincaré sections, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, and Lyapunov dimensions.

Hyperchaotic behavior is also observed in cases where two of the Lyapunov exponents are positive, one is zero, and one is negative. The routes to chaos are analyzed using Poincaré maps, which are found to be more complicated than those of nonlinear rotational machines. Periodic and chaotic motions can be clearly distinguished by all of the analytical tools applied here, namely Poincaré sections, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, and Lyapunov dimensions. By studying numerical simulations, it is possible to provide reliable theory and effective numerical method for other systems. © 2009.

70350135510	Using proportional and different controller to control chaos in non-autonomous mechanical system	The complex dynamics behaviour of the centrifugal flywheel governor system subjected to external disturbance is studied. The dynamical equation of the system is established using Lagrangian and Newton's second law. Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents are presented to analyse hyperchaotic behaviour of the system. The hyperchaotic behaviour of system of two positive Lyapunov exponents along with one zero and one negative Lyapunov exponent is obtained. Routes from Hopf bifurcation to chaos are analysed by the bifurcation diagram and phase portraits, and the Lyapunov exponents corresponded to bifurcation diagrams of the system are confirmed. The hyperchaotic behaviour of the system is controlled by using proportional and different controller methods. Based on the non-linear feedback control, the different stable periodic orbits are obtained and by adjusting the feedback coefficients. The centrifugal flywheel governor system subjected to external disturbance is researched numerically. The results show that the method can control effectively the system, and the range of control is board. Copyright © 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

77950035669	Chaotic bubbles and phase locking for a shaker system in the vicinity of three coexisting critical points	In this paper, the dynamical model of the shaker system, Poincaré maps, Jacobian matrix and power spectrum are established. Different phase-locking phenomena and chaotic bubbles are investigated in the vicinity of three coexisting critical points including Hopf-Hopf bifurcation point, 1:3 resonance point and 1:4 resonance point. In two strong resonance cases, phase-locking dynamics and associated bifurcations are easily to occur. Coexisting attractors have also been introduced to provide mechanisms for chaotic bubbles with connections between pieces. The occurrence of phase locking on doubling torus to multi-period leads to interruption of torus-doubling bifurcation. Isolated chaotic bubbles are birth via period-doubling bifurcation of such a multi-period. Phase-locking phenomena on T

77951159606	Synchronization of two physical systems with fully unknown parameters by adaptive control	In this paper, the chaos and chaos synchronism of two physical systems are studied further by numerical simulation. The adaptive synchronism method is used to synchronize Rikitake and Porous Media systems with fully unknown parameters and two significantly different initial conditions. The sufficient condition of global asymptotic synchronization with adaptive control amplitudes is attained from the theory of Lyapunov stability. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness and feasibility of the scheme in synchronizing two systems with different structure and initial conditions, and the proposed methods have some more advantageous and succinct excellence than others, can be extended to other applications. © 2009 IEEE.

77957334935	A new scheme of general hybrid projective complete dislocated synchronization	Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, a new type of chaos synchronization, general hybrid projective complete dislocated synchronization (GHPCDS), is proposed under the framework of drive-response systems. The difference between the GHPCDS and complete synchronization is that every state variable of drive system does not equal the corresponding state variable, but equal other ones of response system while evolving in time. The GHPCDS includes complete dislocated synchronization, dislocated anti-synchronization and projective dislocated synchronization as its special item. As examples, the Lorenz chaotic system, Rössler chaotic system, hyperchaotic Chen system and hyperchaotic Lü system are discussed. Numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of these methods. © 2010.

77957351174	The high-pressure melting curve of CaO	Shell-model molecular dynamics simulation has been performed to investigate the melting of the major Earth-forming mineral CaO at elevated temperatures and high pressures, based on thermal instability analysis. The interatomic potential is taken to be the sum of effective pair-wise additive Coulomb, van der Waals attraction, and repulsive interactions. It is shown that the simulated molar volume of CaO is successful in reproducing recent experimental data and our DFT-GGA calculations up to the coremantle boundary pressure of 135 GPa. The pressure dependence of the simulated high pressure melting temperature of CaO is in good agreement with the results obtained from the Lindemann melting equation at a pressure of below 7 GPa. The extrapolated melting temperatures are in good agreement with the results obtained from Wang's empirical model up to 60 GPa. The predicted high pressure melting curve, being very steep at lower pressures, rapidly flattens on increasing pressure. The thermodynamic properties of the rocksalt phase of CaO are summarized in the 0135 GPa pressure range and for temperatures up to 9300 K. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Then this method is applied to secure communication through chaotic masking. Using three coupled identical systems, proposes a novel method of chaos encryption, after encrypting in the first two coupled systems, encrypt again in the later two coupled systems. In consideration of interfering Gauss white noise, the results of encoding and decoding are simulated and analyzed. The characteristics of noise are analyzed and then a de-noising method using wavelet transform is presented. With Matlab, the effects of signal de-noising could be demonstrated. © 2011.

79960729084	Two hyperchaotic systems with four-wing attractors and their synchronization	In this paper, an approach to generate multi-wing attractors in coupled chaotic systems is investigated. By coupling two identical Lü systems, novel four-wing hyperchaotic attractors are generated. In particular, novel four-wing hyperchaotic attractors are also generated by coupling a lorenz system and a Lü system. The paper shows that the equilibria of the proposed systems have certain symmetries with respect to specific coordinate planes. In addition, general hybrid projective dislocated synchronization between the two proposed systems is discussed, and this synchronization is applied to secure communication through chaotic masking, using the chaotic signal to mask a continuous signal and a discrete signal. In consideration of interfering random white noise, analyzes the characteristics of noise and then presents a de-noising method using wavelet transform. Simulation results show that the two systems can realize synchronization, further more, the information signal can be recovered undistorted when applying this method to secure communication. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

81255137081	Molecular dynamics of NaCl melting under pressure	We have performed one-phase molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the melting curve of NaCl over a wide range of pressures. To ensure faithful MD simulations, two types of potentials, the shell-model (SM) and the two-body rigid-ion BornMayerHugginsFumiTosi (BMHFT) potentials, are fully tested. Compared with SM potential, the MD simulation with BMHFT potential is very successful in reproducing accurately the measured volumes of NaCl. The BMHFT potential can also produce a satisfactory melting curve, consistent with both experiments and two-phase simulations. Hence we recommend that the BMHFT should be the reliable potential for simulating high-pressure properties of NaCl. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84871789865	The effect of the phase transition on the elasticity of cubic platinum carbide	A study of the high-pressure elastic properties of ideal stoichiometric platinum carbide (PtC) in the rock-salt (RS) and zinc-blende (ZB) structures was conducted using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, in which we employ the generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew-Burke-Eruzerhof form together with plane-wave basis sets for expanding the crystal orbitals and periodic electron density. Our calculation shows that the recently synthesized compound PtC possess a high-bulk modulus value in the RS phase and the ZB phase is more stable. The investigation of the elastic stability under pressure indicated that the transition pressure from ZB to RS structure of PtC is about 30 GPa and the high-pressure RS phase is stable up to 100 GPa. Our conclusions are consistent with the other theoretical predictions but are reversed with the diamond anvil cell experimental results. Therefore, the experimental observation of the RS structure in PtC remains a puzzle and our study indicates that more experimental and theoretical works need to be performed to ascertain the true nature of the newly discovered PtC material. In addition, the pressure dependence of the bulk modulus K, the shear modulus G, the Young's modulus E, the Poisson's ratio υ, the Debye temperature Θ

The calculated results reveal that Cs-terminated surface is more stable than C-termination in energy. From the analysis of the spin-polarized density of states, we find that half-metallic characteristics of the bulk CsN is preserved at both the possible terminated surfaces. Moreover, we also find that the atomic magnetic moments at the (0 0 1) surfaces are greatly different from the bulk values. Finally, the surface free energy is also discussed in order to offer some hints to fabricate CsN thin film. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
