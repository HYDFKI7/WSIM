33750297635	Rolling bearings fault diagnosis based on adaptive Gaussian chirplet spectrogram and independent component analysis	Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings through the use of vibration analysis is an established technique for detecting early stages of component degradation. The location dependent characteristic defect frequencies make it possible to detect the presence of a defect and to diagnose on what part of the bearing the defect is. The difficulty of localized defect detection lies in the fact that the energy of the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and hence can be easily buried by noise. To solve this problem, the adaptive Gaussian chirplet distribution for an integrated time-frequency signature extraction of the machine vibration is developed; the method offers the advantage of good localization of the vibration signal energy in the time-frequency domain. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used for the redundancy reduction and feature extraction in the time-frequency domain, and the self-organizing map (SOM) was employed to identify the faults of the rolling element bearings. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very effective. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

34247222494	Transient fault signal detection using Wigner higher-order moment spectra methods	Most mechanical faults in machinery reveal themselves through transient events in vibration signals. That is, the vibration generated by industrial machines always contains nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Many analysis methods in current use are optimal for Gaussian and linear models but are suboptimal when the problem is one of analysing non-stationary, non-linear and non-Gaussian signals.Focusing on the defects of different joint time-frequency representations, the analysis of transient vibration signals is considered using Wigner higher-order based time-frequency distributions in this paper. The Wigner higherorder moment spectra (WHOS), which are the extensions of the Wigner-Ville distribution(WVD) to higher-order moment spectra domains, can describe the higher-order moment spectral characteristics from the time domain and the frequency domain simultaneourly. The simulation case show that this technique has high time-frequency resolution and reduced interference terms. © 2006 IEEE.

Improved forecasting strategy increases the times of model building and creates datascts for modeling dynamically to avoid using the previous values predicted to forecast and generate the predictions only based on the true observations. Automatic prediction algorithm can satisfy the requirement of real-time prognostics by automates the whole process of ARIMA modeling and forecasting based on the Box-Jenkins's methodology and the improved forecasting strategy.

58849107082	Broken rotor bars fault detection in induction motors using Park's Vector modulus and FWNN approach	In this paper a new integrated diagnostic method based on the current Park's Vector modulus analysis and fuzzy wavelet neural network classifier is proposed for the diagnosis of rotor cage faults in operating three-phase induction motors. Detection of broken rotor bars has long been an important but difficult job in the detection area of induction motor faults. The characteristic frequency components of a faulted rotor in the stator current spectrum are very close to the power frequency component but by far less in amplitude, which brings about great difficulty for accurate detection. In order to overcome the shortage of broken rotor bars characteristic components being submerged by the fundamental one in the spectrum of the stator line current, Park's Vector modulus(PVM) analysis is used to detect the occurrence of broken rotor bar faults in our work. Simulation and experimental results are presented to show the merits of this novel approach for the detection of cage induction motor broken rotor bars. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

However, when a motor operates under light load or no-load conditions, the motor current signature analysis (MCSA) method based on supply-side current can not diagnose the broken rotor bar faults of inverter-fed squirrel-cage induction motor due to the spectrum leakage submerging other spectral response in its vicinity.

84893861066	Practical aspects of broken rotor bars detection in PWM voltage-source-inverter-fed squirrel-cage induction motors	Broken rotor bars fault detection in inverter-fed squirrel cage induction motors is still as difficult as the dynamics introduced by the control system or the dynamically changing excitation (stator) frequency. This paper introduces a novel fault diagnosis techniques using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) to solve the problems. Switching function concept and frequency modulation theory are firstly used to model fault current signal. The competency of the amplitude of the sideband components at frequencies (1±2s)fs as indices for broken bars recognition is subsequently studied in the controlled motor via open-loop constant voltage/frequency control method. The proposed techniques are composed of five modules of anti-aliasing signal acquisition, optimal-slip-estimation based on torque-speed characteristic curve of squirrel cage motor with different load types, fault characteristic frequency determination, nonparametric spectrum estimation, and fault identification for achieving MCSA efficiently. Experimental and simulation results obtained on 3 kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors show that the model and the proposed techniques are effective and accurate. © 2013 Hong-yu Zhu et al.

84897691241	Agricultural machine path tracking method irrelevant to travel speeds	An agricultural machine path tracking method irrelevant to travel speeds, aiming at the path tracking control problem in autonomous operations of intelligent agricultural machines, was presented. The method was robust to changes in travel speeds of agricultural machines. Firstly, the space parameter-driven nonlinear relative kinematics model between the agricultural machine and the tracked path was deduced and the rationality and feasibility of designing control method based on the model was proved. Secondly, the paper dealt with the model by input-state linearization and utilized the optimal control method to stabilize the linear model obtained by feedback linearization, and an agricultural machine path tracking control law irrelevant to travel speeds was then obtained. Finally, path tracking experiments of an agricultural machine were carried out. The experimental results showed that the precision of straight path tracking and curve path tracking were 4 cm and 7 cm respectively and not affected by changes in travel speeds. Therefore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method were verified.

84899683589	Robust adaptive path tracking control of agricultural machines based on cascaded control strategy	Yaw rate dynamics of agricultural machines will change under the influence of implement loads and external disturbances, and thus the path tracking performance of position error-based control methods deteriorates. For this reason, a robust adaptive path tracking control method based on cascaded control strategy is proposed. By this method, the path tracking control task is decomposed into two cascaded control tasks which are the lateral position control task and the yaw rate control task. In the former task, the desired yaw rate of the agricultural machine is determined by utilizing fuzzy adaptive pure pursuit model according to the lateral position error and the heading error. In the latter one, a robust adaptive control method is developed to guarantee that yaw rate has the desired response performance even if the agricultural machine suffers from the implement load variations and the external disturbances. The effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method are verified by a series of simulation experiments and actual agricultural machine experiments.

84899483044	Adaptive sliding mode control method based on nonlinear integral sliding surface for agricultural vehicle steering control	Automatic steering control is the key factor and essential condition in the realization of the automatic navigation control of agricultural vehicles. In order to get satisfactory steering control performance, an adaptive sliding mode control method based on a nonlinear integral sliding surface is proposed in this paper for agricultural vehicle steering control. First, the vehicle steering system is modeled as a second-order mathematic model; the system uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics as well as the external disturbances are regarded as the equivalent disturbances satisfying a certain boundary. Second, a transient process of the desired system response is constructed in each navigation control period. Based on the transient process, a nonlinear integral sliding surface is designed. Then the corresponding sliding mode control law is proposed to guarantee the fast response characteristics with no overshoot in the closed-loop steering control system. Meanwhile, the switching gain of sliding mode control is adaptively adjusted to alleviate the control input chattering by using the fuzzy control method. Finally, the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method are verified by a series of simulation and actual steering control experiments. © 2014 Taochang Li and Jingtao Hu.

84900501757	Design and experiment of variable rate spaying system on Smith-Fuzzy PID control	To achieve variable rate spraying, a pressure-based variable rate spaying system was designed to control the spray rate by adjusting the opening percentage of electrical regulating valve at the bypass pipeline. This returns excessive flow discharged by a piston diaphragm pump according to the flow rate of the spray pipeline, and adjusts the boom width by shutting ON or OFF selected solenoid valves at each section. The ARM9 based variable rate controller was designed to measure the system pressure and flow rate, and generate the control signal. A commercial 3W-250 boom sprayer with 12 flat fan spray nozzles was modified to a variable rate sprayer and mounted behind the LOVAL TA800 tractor. The 12 nozzles were divided to 6 boom sections and the pump was derived by the power take-off shaft of the tractor. The variable rate sprayer was represented by a directed graph of fluid network that consists of a set of junctions, called nodes, and certain lines joining a pair of nodes, called the edges. To reduce the complexity of the spray network, the fluid resistance of the short pipeline was ignored, some nodes were merged, one virtual node was increased to represent the external atmospheric pressure, and finally the graph of the variable rate spraying system involved 6 nodes and 12 edges. The flow rate and pressure distribution within the spray network under, steady state conditions was described by the junction of continuity equations and the loop energy equations. The electrical regulating actuator was also modelled to describe the relationship between the voltage control signal and the valve opening percentage. The fuzzy-PID control algorithm was adopted for the nonlinear, time-varying variable rate spraying system to achieve better performance than with the conventional PID control algorithm. The fuzzy control algorithm was used for tuning the PID parameters online. The Smith predictor based on the system model was introduced to overcome the side effects of long time-lag that included the response delay of the flow meter at a low spray rate and the electrical regulating valve and to stabilize the delay of the spray rate. The variable rate spraying experiments were accomplished at 3 different desired nozzle spray rates which are 0.864, 0.72 and 0.576 m

84901620278	Micro mechanical gyro denoising method based on improved wavelet threshold	The noise of MEMS gyro is one of the significant factors that affect the precision of integrated navigation system. Based on the transplanter's GPS/INS integrated navigation system, an improved wavelet threshold denoising method is proposed by the analysis of conventional hard threshold and soft threshold wavelet denoising. An improved threshold function is constructed by the improved method, and it has nice continuity and can completely avoid eliminating the useful signal in noise and can automatically adjust the compression level of wavelet coefficients. Contrast test is made by using hard threshold, soft threshold and improved wavelet threshold denoising method based on the actual output data of micro mechanical gyro in the transplanter's GPS/INS integrated navigation system. The results show that the signal after being processed by the improved wavelet threshold denoising method has improved the signal-to-noise ratio by about 3 times and the mean square error is small.

84905241853	Fault diagnosis of incipient broken rotor bars for squirrel-cage induction motor under continuous variable load condition	Under continuous variable load condition, the stator current of squirrel-cage induction motor is a non-stationary signal, therefore the motor-current-signature analysis (MCSA) method based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) can hardly diagnosis the incipient broken rotor bar defect. This paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis method for the incipient broken rotor bars of squirrel-cage induction motor operating under continuous variable load condition. Firstly, the Hilbert transformation is performed on the stator transient current to eliminate the effect of the fundamental frequency. Then, the discrete wavelet transformation is conducted on the envelope of the obtained analytic signal; and according to the faulty frequency 2sf characteristic pattern, it is judged if the broken rotor bar defect occurs. Finally, combining the wavelet energy techniques, the quantitative analysis of the fault state is given. The experiment verification was performed on a 3 kw motor experiment test bench; the experiment results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84906908009	Compensation model for measurement error of wheel turning angle in agricultural vehicle guidance	A measurement error was caused by using the kingpin turning angle in place of the wheel turning angle in agricultural vehicle guidance. A relation model between the wheel turning angle and the kingpin turning angle was established to compensate the measurement error. Then, a simulation was carried out, showing that the error between the wheel turning angle and the kingpin turning angle increased with the increase of the kingpin inclination. Next, a test was conducted to verify the correctness of the model, and the results showed that the model improved the accuracy of measurement for the wheel turning angle. The mean error decreased by 0.48°, and the maximum error decreased by 0.71° after model compensation. Finally, in practical application, the proposed model improved the performance of agricultural vehicle guidance system.
