84926522498	A proxy approach to integrate heterogeneous CAD resources for distributed collaborative design	Collaborative product design on heterogeneous computer-aided design (CAD) platforms has shown its significance to todays global manufacturing industries. This article proposes a novel collaboration framework for supporting distributed collaborative design with heterogeneous CAD resources. The unique feature of the framework is that, instead of directly accessing heterogeneous CAD resources, a so-called co-proxy model is defined and created to work as the replication agent representing original CAD resources during collaborative sessions. The co-proxy model is designed to represent corresponding CAD resources with both structured polygonal graphics for visualisation and a set of embedded virtual topological elements (VTE), so as to support collaborative design manipulations such as virtual assembly and annotation. Moreover, the co-proxy model comes with an external link mechanism, with which the powerful modelling and editing functionalities from heterogeneous CAD systems can be reasonably integrated into the distributed collaboration framework. The proposed framework together with its enabling technologies has been implemented into a prototype system named as Co-DMU, which is generally applicable for feature-based CAD modelling systems with automation interfaces provided.

17244363446	Routing protocol with mobility prediction in mobile ad-hoc networks	Introducing the routing protocol of MANET and comparing it with others, a routing protocol with mobility prediction available to both route finding and maintenance stages, which is named as PAODV (Predictable AODV), is proposed on the basis of the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV). It can acquire such information as the position, velocity and moving direction of moving nodes via GPS, and take the time predicted for the adjacent nodes in link to move within the max. useful communication range as a judgement criterion. Then, build relatively steady routes in route finding stage, and further, predict in advance the moment at which the link just breaks down in route maintenance stage, thus reducing package's lass rate and the overhead due to the time for route restructuring. The simulation results showed that PAODV has lower control overhead and higher package delivery rate than AODV.

33646917733	The impact of TCP segment size and routing change on congestion control protocol performance in mobile ad hoc networks	TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) congestion control Algorithms are simulated and analyzed in mobile ad hoc networks. The main research concentrates on the impact of TCP segment size on congestion control protocol performance. The protocols analyzed here include the Reno, SACK and Vegas protocol. The simulation and comprehensive analysis show that the impact of TCP segment size on congestion control protocol performance does exist. But different from common anticipation, the impact mainly occurs in the environment with sparse nodes and high-speed nodes. Different congestion control protocols present different performances associated with different network settings, e.g. mild Vegas protocol presents good performance in low speed and generic density environment, and radical Reno protocol adapts to the environment of sparse nodes and high-speed nodes. © 2005 IEEE.

33745167665	A dual-channel routing scheme in ad hoc networks	This paper proposes an on-demand routing scheme called Dual-Channel Routing (DCR) for ad hoc wireless networks that utilizes dual channels dynamically to improve performance. By exploiting dual channels, we can achieve a higher network throughput than using one channel, because dual transmissions can take place without interfering. The IEEE 802.11 standard allows for the use of multiple channels available at the physical layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. Our scheme establishes and utilizes two routes of maximally disjoint paths and distributes them into two different channels respectively. Even if only one of the two routes of the session is invalidated, the source uses the remaining valid route to deliver data packets in two channels alternately. The results of simulation show that our scheme has better network performance. © 2005 IEEE.

33749985776	Graphics-assisted approach to rapid collision detection for multi-axis machining	Collision detection is a critical problem in multi-axis NC machining with complex machining environments. Using a combination of machining environment culling and a two-phase collision detection strategy, a rapid and robust collision detection approach is implemented. With this approach, the machining environment is initially subdivided and organized hierarchically using a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree structure. Before carrying out precise collision detection, the machining environment is culled conservatively to remove most of the irrelevant geometries from further checking steps which are relatively time consuming. For the later stage of precise collision detection, which is the most complicated and time-consuming task in many existing approaches, a strategy of using two-phase collision detection is developed in order to make the approach not only efficient in computation and but also maintain a high detection precision at the same time. Another important benefit of this approach is that it takes advantage of the rapid performance of graphics hardware to generate visibility information very efficiently. We show how this information could be used in assisting collision detection. An example of five-axis machining in a complex environment is adopted as the case study to demonstrate the proposed approach. It has shown that the collision detection task can be achieved with a near real-time performance. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.

Simulation result indicated that the velocity distribution appeared to be double W-shape, and somewhat symmetrical. In addition, the velocity values in each W-shape distribution also appeared symmetrical. It also indicated that two bifurcation channels from the same low-level bifurcation channel had different velocity values due to different singular losses.

65649144278	Experimental and FEM study on sinking of miniature inner grooved copper tube	Miniature inner grooved copper tubes (mIGCT) which have an outer diameter less than 6 mm are in demand for the production of heat pipes. In this work, it is proposed to manufacture such tubes by a multi-stage tube sinking process with an initial mIGCT having an outer diameter of 6 mm. A FEM simulation approach is used to analyze stress, strain and damage distribution for the proposed process. For comparison, a smooth copper tube is also used in the simulation study. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to investigate plastic deformation of the grooves and teeth of the tube. Results show that the maximum stress and strain are occurred at the grooves area, while the maximum damage is located at the top of the teeth. The ratio of groove width to tooth width (β) is reduced after each drawing pass. Bonding, folding and segmenting, which represent potential flaws, have also been observed in the multi-stage tube sinking process, and are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

70449553605	Computer-aided process planning for fabrication of three-dimensional microstructures for bioMEMS applications	In recent years, there has been increasing interest from both academies and industries in developing micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technology for biological applications, known as bioMEMS or biochips. Targeting at high throughput biomolecule analysis, drug compound screening, and reduction of reagent and sample volume, today's bioMEMS devices come with miniaturised design and increased complexity of microstructures. Fabrication of such a complex bioMEMS structure involves a number of layer fabrication cycles. Moreover, a two-dimensional (2D) mask is required for each process. Thus, manually generating such a complex process plan has become a difficult task. With recent advances in material technology, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone material has been widely applied in nowadays bioMEMS fabrication. This paper proposes a novel automated process planning approach for fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) microstructures in bioMEMS. This approach can handle both PDMS casting and traditional micro fabrication processes. It integrates a novel solid decomposition method and a feasibility search algorithm. Also, it can directly handle the solid model of an integrated microstructure with B-rep representation, and automatically generate the data of the fabrication process plan along with masks. A process planner prototype has been implemented. An application example is presented to demonstrate the functionality of the prototype.

Wireless ad hoc networks employing the IEEE 802.11 protocol in Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) mode are becoming increasingly popular. In this paper, an available bandwidth estimation scheme for IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc network is presented. Our scheme does not modify the CSMA/CA MAC protocol in any manner, but gauges the effect of phenomena such as medium contention, channel interference, which influence the available bandwidth, on it. Based on the effect of the phenomena on the working of the medium-access scheme, we estimate the available bandwidth of a wireless host to each of its neighbors.

Therefore how to make SIP NAT friendly becomes a worthy topic. This paper proposes an efficient approach P2P-Grid architecture model based ICE which uses Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (STUN) and TURN synthetically at the beginning of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) process (establishing the multimedia sessions), the agents ignore their own NAT topologies. In the process of establishing sessions, agents explore the NAT topology by a request/response interaction, and a smart sorting algorithm is also used to find and select the optimal path for media streams to traverse NAT. The program was tested on Linux platform. The result shows that the media streams can traversal various NAT efficiently. © 2009 IEEE.

With ethanol as the working fluid, risen meniscus test is conducted to study the capillary force of wick structures. Infrared (IR) thermal imaging is used to identify and locate the liquid meniscus. The effects of sintered layer, V-grooves and powder size on capillary force are explored. The results show that the capillary force of composite wick structures is larger than that of grooved and sintered ones. Interaction wetting between groove and sintered powder happens during the liquid rise in composite wick, which provides an additional source of capillary force. It exhibits a variation of capillary force of composite wicks with different powder size due to the difference of open pore size and quantity in sintered porous matrix. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

77951131729	A rough set based data mining approach for house of quality analysis	As the first phase of quality function deployment (QFD) and the only interface between the customers and product development team, house of quality (HOQ) plays the most important role in developing quality products that are able to satisfy customer needs. No matter in what shape or form HOQ can be built, the key to this process is to find out the hidden relationship between customers' requirements and product design specifications. This paper presents a general rough set based data mining approach for HOQ analysis. It utilises the historical information of customer needs and the design specifications of the product that was purchased, employs the basic rough set notions to reveal the interrelationships between customer needs and design specifications automatically. Due to the data reduction nature of the approach, a minimal set of customer needs that are crucial for the decision on the correlated design specifications is derived. The end result of the approach is in the form of a minimal rule set, which not only fulfils the goal of HOQ, but can be used as supporting data for marketing purposes. A case study on the product of electrically powered bicycles is included to illustrate the approach and its efficiency. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

77953609421	A novel connector-knowledge-based approach for disassembly precedence constraint generation	Maintenance and recycling of a product often requires its disassembly. To have a successful disassembly process, it essentially asks for a comprehensive study of disassembly constraints. Related studies have revealed that precedence constraints offer important information to remove the infeasible disassembly plans to attain practical and feasible ones. Standard connectors play an important role to fasten two or more components together. By analyzing the disassembly knowledge and experiences of connectors, it is possible to derive precedence constraint directly. In this paper, different approaches for disassembly precedence constraint generation are first reviewed. Then, a novel connector-knowledge-based approach is presented for automatic generation of disassembly precedence constraints. As a preliminary research, threaded fasteners and keys are analyzed and corresponding precedence rules are extracted. By integrating this novel knowledge-based reasoning (KR) with the geometric reasoning approach, both approaches are utilized to their best advantages. Necessary disassembly constraint information can be automatically generated with less computational complexity. A typical shaft assembly in a gear reducer is selected as the case study to illustrate the proposed approach. The result has shown that this KR approach is simple and efficient in generating reasonable disassembly constraints. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

77955353190	A location-based multi-path routing approach in ad hoc networks	In QoS routing for wired networks, multiple path routing is popularly used. Because of excessive routing overhead, algorithms are not well suited for ad hoc networks. A Location-Based Multi-path Routing (LBMR) approach in Ad hoc is provided in this paper. This approach gets a shortest path by limiting the search for a new route to a smaller "request zone" of the ad hoc network (as in the LAR protocol) and uses intermediate nodes' location information to find another disjoint path by using Dijkstra's algorithm at destination node. Providing multiple routes helps to minimize route recovery process and to control message overhead. A per-packet allocation scheme is arranged to distribute data packets into two paths of active sessions. The results of simulation show that this routing method has good network performance with high packet delivery ratio, low control overload and low average end-to-end delay. ©2010 IEEE.

Distance measuring, as the core of all location algorithms, may cause large range error. RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication), one of the common methods of distance measuring in WSN node localization, is very sensitive to the environment, thereby it causes great range error. The antenna diversity technique, mostly used to enlarge the capacity of channels and expand the cover range of the signal in order to improve the quality of the transmission signal, is applied in the WSN node localization.

Based on previous works, an object-oriented approach is proposed to define software modules and objects for disassembly constraint generation and representation. The prototype is implemented as an embedded application on the API platform of commercial CAD software. Hence it provides a tight and seamless integration, which can not only utilize the CAD model information directly, but also aid an on-going design process. This integration makes it possible for designers to optimize their design work for disassembly properties, such as ease of disassembly, at design stages.

Because of excessive routing overhead, algorithms are not well suited for MANET networks. The IEEE 802.3 DCF standard allows for the use of multiple channels available at the physical layer, by improving the capacity of MANET networks by using multiple channel interfaces, a dual channel routing (DCR) scheme is introduced that proactively maintains all nodes' location information based on periodic exchanges of these information in one channel. The location advertisements are distributed to all nodes in the network. The resulting replicated distributed database represents the entire network topology. Every node uses this connectivity map to calculate the shortest path to every other node. Then, source transmits data packet in another channel. This traffic distribution efficiently utilizes available network resources and prevents nodes of the route from being congested in heavily loaded traffic situations. DCR is a hybrid proactive/reactive scheme. Because there is no interference between two channels, the results of simulation show that the scheme can improve networks performance. © 2010 IEEE.

77957887812	Live parametric design modifications in CAD-linked virtual environment	This paper presents a solution to support parametric design modification in a virtual reality (VR) environment. It builds upon a novel computer-aided design (CAD) and VR integration framework, namely, CAD-linked virtual reality environment. With this framework, semantic information in CAD models, such as constraints, design features, and parametric settings can be automatically extracted during the creation of VR environment and be integrated into the virtual assembly (VA) models. Moreover, the persistent naming mechanism originating from feature-based modeling technology is introduced into the CAD-VR integration, based on which a persistent linkage between VA models and their CAD counterparts can be established. Users are able to visualize design features and to access the associated parametric info in VR environment and also to change the parametric settings online whenever necessary. The modified parametric settings are then sent back to the linked CAD models so that parts can be re-evaluated. The modified CAD part can then be reloaded into the VA model under an automated mechanism. Such communications between CAD and VR applications are supported in a live mode utilizing the COM interfaces provided by CAD server. With this solution, a quick return loop from VR to CAD is achieved. Therefore, it provides the possibility to support quick design change review and "what-if" evaluations for applications such as collaborative system design and immersive project review in VR. This constitutes the major contribution of the work to product development process. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

However, most of the research works evaluated tribo-maintainability at maintenance stages. This paper analyzed the tribo-maintainability related design factors from systematic perspective and concluded a more complete set of six factors.

79551541628	Dominance evaluation of structural factors in a passive air-breathing direct methanol fuel cell based on orthogonal array analysis	This study comprehensively investigates the dominance of various structural factors in a passive air-breathing DMFC by means of orthogonal array analysis (OAA). Two membrane types, two assembly patterns of the diffusion layer and two open ratios of the current collector are prepared. Three target variables are selected as the performance indexes including the maximum power density (MPD), limiting current density (LCD) and open circuit voltage (OCV). The range analysis (RA) method and effect curves (ECs) are used to characterize the OAA data. The RA results demonstrate that the current collector and diffusion layer combine to dominate the values of MPD and LCD in a wide range of methanol concentrations from 0.5 to 8 M. The dominant structural factors related to the value of OCV at different methanol concentrations are also explored. In addition, the effect curves show that a medium methanol concentration like 2 M generally promotes higher values of MPD and LCD, while a relatively lower methanol concentration like 0.5. M benefits a higher value of OCV than others in a general statistical sense. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

With this method, the coarse microtopography of three-dimension structures can be well integrated with macroscopic models, so that a multiscale microtopographic model of functional surface structures can be established. For experimental investigation, a multiscale 3D solid model is created to simulate the flow characteristics of fluid in a ploughed V-shaped microchannel, and the influences of the Reynolds number, the surface height scale coefficient and the fractal dimension on the flow characteristics are analyzed. The results show that (1) the frictional resistance coefficient decreases with the increase in the Reynolds number, but increases with the surface height scale coefficient; (2) the influence of the fluid vortex due to surface roughness, which becomes significant with the roughness increase, is non-neglectable; and (3) the frictional resistance coefficient of microchannels decreases with the increase of the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal dimension.

Although relatively high accuracy has been achieved by existing methods, most of these prediction methods are computationally intensive. Naïve bayesian classifier is a simple and efficient classifier. But the attribute independence assumption can not represent the dependency relationship between attributes in the real word, and the classification performance may be affected to some extent. The improvement of the naïve Bayesian was made. The linear relationship between condition attributes and decision attribute was derived and the relationship coefficients was determined by least square method. So a new bayesian classifier was designed. The proposed method was applied to the recognition of splice sites in DNA sequences. The simulation results show the performance is notably improved compared with the naïve bayesian classifier and the existing discovery tools, while the speed of the proposed method is significantly faster.

Then, the topographical features of micro groove surfaces and the effects of machining parameters on these features are investigated. The results show that the distributions of fractal dimension and roughness of contour profiles in different positions on the micro-ploughing groove surfaces are subject to some specific statistical laws, that there is a relatively strong positive correlation between the average fractal dimension and the average roughness, and that, in a certain range of manufacturing parameters, an increasing groove depth and a decreasing machining feed may cause an increase in average fractal dimension and roughness. In addition, based on the experimental investigation, some digital models are constructed with an improved W-M fractal function to describe the micro-ploughing groove surfaces with specific topographical features, which are beneficial to the initiative design and simulation of functional surface structures fabricated via micro-ploughing.

The mechanism of this method is analyzed through ray dynamics, which indicate that the light-propagating regimes are considerably different as the structure inclination angle α changes. For typical encapsulant materials (index=1.41), the optimal α is 22.5°-45°. Then the performance of LED COB devices with PLS configurations are verified through 3-D Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations as well as experimental measurements. Results show that the light-extraction efficiency is significantly improved. A simulated enhancement of 42% and a measured enhancement of 41.07% are observed. These results are in good consistency with the ray dynamic analysis, confirming our predictions about PLS methods.

84877581637	Comparison of static contact angle of various metal foams and porous copper fiber sintered sheet	Wettability is one of the most intrinsic properties of solid material, which can be quantitatively characterized by contact angle. After the surface morphology was observed, the wettability mechanism of various metal foams and porous copper fiber sintered sheet (PCFSS) was analyzed based on the static contact angle measured by the sessile drop method. The effect of porosity and sintering parameters of PCFSS on the contact angle was also investigated. It is demonstrated that the PCFSS presented much larger contact angle than various metal foams due to the difference of pore shape and surface morphology. The contact angle of PCFSS was affected by the change of the porosity, sintering temperature and sintering time. For the PCFSS with different porosities, the contact angle was increased firstly, and then was decreased as the porosity was increased from 70% to 90%. Moreover, when sintering temperature was increased or sintering time was extended, the contact angle was decreased slightly. The PCFSS with 80% porosity sintered at 800 C for 30 min presented the maximum static contact angle (∼143), exhibited excellent hydrophobic property. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84881491443	A simple fracture energy prediction method for fiber network based on its morphological features extracted by X-ray tomography	The fracture behavior of a novel porous metal fiber sintered sheet (PMFSS) was predicted using a semi-empirical method combining the knowledge of its morphological characteristics and micro-mechanical responses. The morphological characteristics were systematically summarized based on the analysis of the topologically identical skeleton representation extracted from the X-ray tomography images. The analytical model firstly proposed by Tan et al. [1] was further modified according to the experimental observations from both tensile tests of single fibers and sintered fiber sheets, which built the coupling of single fiber segment and fiber network in terms of fracture energy using a simple prediction method. The efficacy of the prediction model was verified by comparing the predicted results to the experimental measurements. The prediction error that arose at high porosity was analyzed through fiber orientation distribution. Moreover, the tensile fracture process evolving from single fiber segments at micro-scale to the global mechanical performance was investigated. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885036405	Generation algorithm of anisotropic surface and its application	Most artificial surfaces generated by the existing fractal surface generation algorithms are isotropic, which are different from most anisotropic mechanical surfaces. In order to solve this problem, the existing anisotropic surface generation methods are reviewed and the morphology of the anisotropic fractal surface generated by the method of frequency domain stretching is analyzed. Then, the method is improved by introducing an angle parameter in the frequency domain, which makes the direction of anisotropy controllable. Experimental results indicate that the surface obtained by the improved method is obviously anisotropic, that the fractal dimension of the extracted profile depends on the stretch radio, and that the surface filtering can be implemented by controlling the frequency component of the extracted profile, which makes the multi-scale resolution possible. Moreover, according to the anisotropy of the ploughed micro-groove's surface, the profiles are scanned by a surface coarseness profiling instrument Talysurf CLI 1000, and the fractal feature of the micro-groove surface is analyzed, based on which a geometrical model of ploughed micro-groove is established via the secondary development of AutoCAD.

84886568206	Research on the WSN node localization based on TOA	Regarding the tracking of moving target in the large-scale fixed scene, a new routing algorithm of LAODV in the principle of TOA localization is proposed. Then, the participation field of the fixed node based on the node location information is properly controlled, while the routing request area is reduced through combination of AODV and LAR during transmission of the location information. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm renders satisfactory performance in terms of average delay reduction from end to end, packet loss rate, and routing overhead. As a result, the delay and system overhead during localization could be minimized. © 2013 Qing-hui Wang et al.

84886301619	Three-dimensional reconstruction and morphologic characteristics of porous metal fiber sintered sheet	This paper presents an approach to achieve morphological characterizing for complex porous materials based on micro X-ray tomography images, with an example of a novel porous metal fiber sheet produced through solid-state sintering method. The geometrical reconstruction was performed after selection of volume of interest and image processing of anisotropic diffusion smooth. The reconstructed gray level images were then transferred into binary images by adjusting binarization threshold according to the actual porosity. Taking into account the tubular structural feature of the fibers, skeleton extraction algorithm based on the distance transform function was applied and further improved by the scale axis transform method. The skeleton was later pruned and segmented according to the contact points to perform morphological characterizing. Compared with actual manufacturing parameters, the style, length, radius, orientation and tortuosity of fiber segments were discussed. The results show that our proposed method can well describe the actual geometrical and morphological characteristics, which will provide a promising method for the structural description of fibrous networks. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84890287177	Characterization of three- and four-point bending properties of porous metal fiber sintered sheet	A novel porous metal fiber sintered sheet (PMFSS) with high porosity was fabricated by the solid-state sintering method of copper fibers. In this study, both three- and four-point bending setup were established to characterize the bending properties of PMFSS. Similar three stages in the three- and four-point bending fracture process were observed for the PMFSS with 80% porosity sintered at 900. °C for 60. min. Comparing with the three-point bending, it is found that much smaller bending force was obtained in the four-point bending test under the same displacement conditions. Moreover, the porosity and sintering parameters were also varied to investigate the influence on the bending properties of PMFSS. Both three- and four-point bending strength were found to be decreased with increasing porosity ranging from 70% to 90%. Higher sintering temperature produced higher bending strength for the PMFSS sintered in the temperature range of 700-1000. °C. Besides, the extension of holding time also could slightly affect the bending strength. © 2013.

84898842071	An autonomous waist-mounted pedestrian dead reckoning system by coupling low-cost MEMS inertial sensors and GPS receiver for 3D urban navigation	Global positioning system (GPS) offers a perfect solution to the 3-dimension(3D) navigation. However, the GPS-only solution can't provide continuous and accurate position information in the unfavourable environments, such as urban canyons, indoor buildings, dense foliages due to signal blockage, interference, or jamming etc. A pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system integrating the self-contained inertial sensors with GPS receiver is proposed to provide a seamless outdoor/indoor 3D pedestrian navigation. The MEM sensor module attached to the user's waist is composed of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis digital compass and a barometric pressure sensor, which doesn't rely on any infrastructure. The positioning algorithm implements a loosely coupled GPS/PDR integration. The sensor data are fused via a complementary filter to reduce the integral drift and magnetic disturbance for accurate heading. The four key components of the PDR algorithm: step detection, stride length estimation, heading and position determination are described in detail and implemented by the microcontroller. The step is detected using the accelerometer signals by the combination of three approaches: sliding window, peak detection and zero-crossing. The step length is estimated using a simple linear relationship with the step frequency. By coupling the step length, azimuth and height, 3D navigation is achieved. The performance of the proposed system is carefully verified through several field outdoor and indoor walking tests. The positioning errors are below 3% of the total traveled distance. The main error source comes from the orientation estimation. The results indicate that the proposed system is effective in accurate tracking. © 2014 Kavala Institute of Technology.

The results show that the ranging system can accomplish the real-time dynamic filtering and reduce the NLOS error, and has a higher measurement precision. Furthermore, the ranging system can be directly applied to the location under the NLOS environment.

84904877144	A pedestrian dead reckoning system integrating low-cost MEMS inertial sensors and GPS receiver	The body-mounted inertial systems for pedestrian navigation do not require any preinstalled facilities and can run autonomously. The advantages over other technologies make it especially attractive for the applications such as first responders, military and consumer markets. The hardware platform integrating the low-cost, low-power and small-size MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) inertial sensors and GPS (global positioning system) receiver is proposed. When the satellite signals are available, the location of the pedestrian is directly obtained from the GPS receiver. The inertial sensors are the complement of the GPS receiver in places where the GPS signals are not available, such as indoors, urban canyons and places under dense foliages. The height tracking is achieved by the barometer. The proposed PDR (pedestrian dead reckoning) algorithm is real-timely implemented in the platform. The simple but effective step detection and step length estimation method are realized to reduce the computation and memory requirements on the microprocessor. A complementary filter is proposed to fuse the data from the accelerometer, gyroscope and digital compass for decreasing the heading error, which is the main error source in positioning. The reliability and accuracy of the proposed system is verified by field pedestrian walking tests in outdoors and indoors. The positioning error is less than 4% of the total traveled distance. The results indicate that the pedestrian dead reckoning system is able to provide satisfactory tracking performance. © 2014 Kavala Institute of Technology.

84911464355	Automated defect detection in textured materials using wavelet-domain hidden Markov models	An approach that addresses defect detection in textured surfaces based on the wavelet-domain hidden Markov tree (HMT) model is proposed. The proposed scheme includes two successive stages, i.e., training and inspection. During the training process, an HMT for the wavelet transform (WT) of an a priori acquired defectfree template image is modeled using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. With the trained HMT, a log-likelihood map (LLM) that consists of the likelihood of each coefficient can be efficiently constructed. This LLM provides a good classifier for discriminating defects from regular textures. By comparing the LLM of any defective sample under inspection with that of the template, a thresholding process can typically set the coefficients corresponding to the regular texture background to zero, while preserving those corresponding to defective regions. Therefore, in a reconstructed image obtained by the inverse two-dimensional WT of the modified coefficients, the texture patterns will be significantly eliminated, whereas the defective regions will be distinctly highlighted. The performance of the proposed method has been extensively evaluated by a variety of samples with different defect types, shapes, sizes, and texture backgrounds. Experimental results in comparison with other methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on defect detection in textured surfaces.
