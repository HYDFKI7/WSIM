16544372735	Expression of MRP14 gene is frequently down-regulated in Chinese human esophageal cancer	Migration inhibitory factor-related protein 14 (MRP14) is one of calcium-binding proteins, referred as S100A9. The heterodimeric molecule formed by MRP14 with its partner MRP8 (S100A8) is the major fatty acid carrier in neutrophils. The MRP8/14 complex has been also implicated in the intracellular transport of arachidonic acid and its precursors in keratinocytes. We show here the involvement of MRP14 in human esophageal cancer. In an initial study, mRNA differential display - reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) was performed with two esophageal carcinomas, one esophageal adenocarcinoma and matched normal adjacent mucosa. DD-PCR with the arbitrary primer OPA3 showed that one cDNA band was highly expressed in normal tissues, but disappeared or substantially decreased in tumor counterparts. It was later identified to be the 3'-end of migration inhibitory factor-related protein 14 (MRP14). Northern blotting, RT-PCR and Western blotting corroborated the down-regulation of MRP14 in 58/64 squamous cell carcinomas and 2/2 adenocarcinomas as compared with adjacent normal epithelia of the esophagus. MRP14 was undetectable in 3/3 esophageal-carcinoma cell lines. Immunochemistry demonstrated that expression of MRP14 was restricted to normal esophageal epithelia. No mutation was found in the genomic DNA of the MRP14 gene by PCR and directed DNA sequencing. Our finding suggested that the reduction of MRP14 expression is a frequent event in Chinese human esophageal cancer.

33749019499	Expression of ΔDNMT3B variants and its association with promoter methylation of p16 and RASSF1A in primary non-small cell lung cancer	Despite the role of DNMT3B in de novo DNA methylation, a correlation between DNMT3B expression and promoter DNA methylation has not being established in tumors. We recently reported ΔDNMT3B, a subfamily of DNMT3B, with seven variants, as the predominant expression forms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesized that expression of the ΔDNMT3B variants plays a role in promoter methylation formation during lung tumorigenesis. Expression of seven ΔDNMT3B variants was measured in 119 NSCLCs and the corresponding normal lungs using reverse transcription-PCR. The expression patterns of ΔDNMT3B variants were analyzed with the status of p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylation in the tumors as well as in patients' clinical variables, including outcomes. Expression of ΔDNMT3B variants was detected in 94 of 119 (80%) tumors but in only 22 (18%) of the corresponding normal lungs (P < 0.0001). ΔDNMT3B1, ΔDNMT3B2, and ΔDNMT3B4 were the most frequently detected transcripts in the tumors (62%, 76%, and 46%, respectively). The expression of ΔDNMT3B variants was associated with p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylation in the tumors, but the strongest association was between ΔDNMT3B4 and RASSF1A. Forty-two of 46 (91%) tumors with RASSF1A promoter methylation expressed ΔDNMT3B4 compared with only 13 of 73 (18%) tumors without the promoter methylation (P < 0.0001). Strong associations were also observed between expression of the variants in the tumors and in patients' clinical outcomes. Expression of ΔDNMT3B variants is common in NSCLC and may play an important role in the development of promoter methylation. ©2006 American Association for Cancer Research.

33749020195	A novel DNMT3B subfamily, ΔDNMT3B, is the predominant form of DNMT3B in non-small cell lung cancer	De novo promoter DNA methylation represses gene transcription and is a common mechanism to inactivate tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. DNMT3B plays an important role in de novo DNA methylation. We report here the identification of a novel DNMT3B subfamily, termed ΔDNMT3B, whose expression is initiated through a promoter located at intron 4 and exon 5 of the DNMT3B gene. At least 7 transcriptional variants of ΔDNMT3B have been observed as the result of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Predicted proteins derived from these variants suggest that 4 of the variants share a conservative enzymatic domain but contain a variable PWWP motif, a putative DNA binding structure, whereas 3 of the variants lack the enzymatic domain due to predicted premature translational termination. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, ΔDNMT3B variants are frequently expressed and are the predominant forms of DNMT3B. Similarly, ΔDNMT3B variants are frequently expressed in primary NSCLC but are not detectable or are expressed at low levels in corresponding normal lung tissue. Our results indicate that ΔDNMT3B is the major expression form of DNMT3B in NSCLC and may play an important role in the development of aberrant promoter methylation during lung tumorigenesis.

33846003113	Treatment and prognosis of brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer: A retrospective study	Background and objective: Now the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastasis is not a standard program. The aim of this study is to summarize the factors related to survival of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. Methods: A total of 111 NSCLC patients with brain metastases (from September 1995-May 2004) were defined as symptomatic group (37 patients) and asymptomatic group (74 patients) according to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The patients in the symptomatic group were given whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT, DT 30-40 Gy/20 f) first, and then received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The patients in the asymptomatic group were given cisplatin-based chemotherapy first, and then received WBRT. During the treatment, 49 patients received chemotherapy of BCNU or VM-26 irregularly. Results: The median survival time was 11 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rate was 40.79% and 13.26% respectively. The survival time was not significantly different between the symptomatic group and asymptomatic group. Median chemotherapy of asymptomatic group was 3 cycles (1-6 cycles) before WBRT. Those patients who received 3 or 4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT had better survival (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0035). The treatment of BCNU or VM-26 was a benefit factor for survival (P = 0.0219) in asymptomatic group. The hematologic toxicity of grade III or IV was not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). The number of brain metastasis (P = 0.000), extracranial metastasis (P = 0.022) and WHO performance status (P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: The patients with asymptomatic brain metastases receive 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT may be reasonable. During the therapy, the patients with administration of BCNU or VM-26 may have survival benefit.

33846003505	Prognostic analysis of intrapulmonary metastasis for patients with non-small cell lung cancer	Background and objective: It is well known that more than 40% patients were initially diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with intrapulmonary or/and distant metastasis. However, up to now, the reports about effects of different metastatic sites on survival were limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinicopathologic and survival difference by retrospective analysis among sole intrapulmonary metastasis, sole extrathoracic distant metastasis and simultaneous metastasis of lung and other extrathoracic organs for the patients with advanced NSCLC, and to analyze the prognosis-related factors of NSCLC with intrapulmonary metastasis. Methods: Of the 425 patients with stage IV NSCLC diagnosed by pathology and through staging evaluation and treated at Beijing Cancer Hospital with long follow-up during Oct. 1995 to Dec. 2003, 81 cases had sole intrapulmonary metastasis, 98 cases had sole extrathoracic distant metastasis and 68 cases presented simultaneous lung metastasis and extrathoracic spread. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was performed to estimate the survival of patients with different metastasis, Log-Rank test was used to compare their survival difference, and univariate analysis was used to find prognostic related factors. Results: Median survival time (MST) and 1-, 2-, 3-year survival rate (SR) for patients with sole intrapulmonary metastasis were 13 months (95% CI: 11-15), 57%, 21%, 7%, respectively; MST was 22 months (95% CI: 18-26) for patients with N1 and/or N2 and 10 months (95% CI: 7-13) for patients with N3 (P = 0.001). Among the patients with ipsilateral, contralateral and bilateral intrapulmonary metastasis, difference of MST and 1-, 2-, 3-year SR had no statistical significance (P>0.05); Survival of patients with sole intrapulmonary metastasis was not significantly different from that of patients with sole brain or bone metastasis (P>0.05), but was longer than that of patients with simultaneous lung and extrathoracic spread (P=0.021). One way analysis of variance showed that no significant association were found among age, pathologic subtype, differentiation degree or response of first-line chemotherapy and survival of the patients with sole intrapulmonary metastasis (P>0.05), but sex and invasive status of lymph node (N1/N2 vs N3) were found to influence the survival of the patients (P = 0.018, P = 0.001). Further stratified analysis by age showed that invasion of lymph node was independent prognostic factor (P = 0.002); whereas for the patients with simultaneous metastasis of lung and distant organs, metastatic numbers (2 vs ≥3) of organ were independent prognostic factor (P = 0.013). Conclusion: No statistical difference is found among survival of NSCLC patients with sole intrapulmonary metastasis and with sole brain, bone metastasis. Invasive status of lymph node and metastatic number of organ are important prognostic factors for patients with sole intrapulmonary metastasis and simultaneous metastasis of lung and extrathoracic organs, respectively.

36348974733	ΔDNMT3B variants regulate DNA methylation in a promoter-specific manner	DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is critical in de novo DNA methylation during development and tumorigenesis. We recently reported the identification of a DNMT3B subfamily, ΔDNMT3B, which contains at least seven variants, resulting from alternative pre-mRNA splicing. ΔDNMT3Bs are the predominant expression forms of DNMT3B in human lung cancer. A strong correlation was observed between the promoter methylation of RASSF1A gene but not p16 gene (both frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer) and expression of ΔDNMT3B4 in primary lung cancer, suggesting a role of ΔDNMT3B in regulating promoter-specific methylation of common tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. In this report, we provide first experimental evidence showing a direct involvement of ΔDNMT3B4 in regulating RASSF1A promoter methylation in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of ΔDNMT3B4 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a rapid demethylation of RASSF1A promoter and reexpression of RASSF1A mRNA but had no effect on p16 promoter in the lung cancer cells. Conversely, normal bronchial epithelial cells with stably transfected ΔDNMT3B4 gained an increased DNA methylation in RASSF1A promoter but not p16 promoter. We conclude that promoter DNA methylation can be differentially regulated and ΔDNMT3Bs are involved in regulation of such promoter-specific de novo DNA methylation. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

39749106934	NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species are responsible for the high susceptibility to arsenic cytotoxicity in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells	We have previously demonstrated that an acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived cell line NB4 exhibited a relatively higher basal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than other leukemia cell lines, which is one of the mechanisms determining a higher apoptotic susceptibility of NB4 cells to arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced apoptosis. Here we identified the source of the basal ROS generation in NB4 cells. We demonstrated the existence of all the components of phagocytic NADPH oxidase in NB4 cells and found that this oxidase could be effectively activated. The basal ROS generation in NB4 cells could be blocked by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, but not by inhibitors of mitochondria respiratory chain, implying that NADPH oxidase played an essential role in maintaining the basal ROS level in NB4 cells. Furthermore, ATO-induced cytotoxicity was reduced by pre-treatment with DPI in NB4 cells, suggesting the involvement of NADPH oxidase in ATO-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, increasing the NADPH oxidase activity may be a novel mechanism to enhance cytotoxicity induced by anticancer agents. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0034329414	Novel human esophagus-specific gene C1orf10: cDNA cloning, gene structure, and frequent loss of expression in esophageal cancer	We have identified a novel human gene, designated C1orf10, using modified differential display PCR. The C1orf10 gene, which spans 5 kb in length, is composed of three exons. The deduced protein contains 495 amino acids with one transmembrane domain. The amino acid sequence of C1orf10 is characterized by the presence of a calcium-binding motif of about 90 amino acids at its N-terminal and a conserved consecutive repeat sequence of 60 amino acids that was identiffed previously only in bacterial ice nucleation proteins. In normal adult tissues, C1orf10 is highly expressed only in the esophagus and was undetectable in a total of 15 other tissues examined, suggesting its important role in esophageal cells. The expression of C1orf10 is either dramatically reduced or absent in esophageal cancer cell lines (3/3) as well as primary esophageal cancer tissues (35/37) compared with the corresponding normal esophageal mucosa. Using a radiation hybrid panel, C1orf10 was found to be located on chromosome 1q21. These findings suggest that expression of C1orf10 is unique to esophageal cells and that loss of its expression may play a role in the development of esophageal cancer. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

77954285224	Isolation and identification of petroleum degrading bacteria and their remediation ability	In this paper, three strains of bacteria, WTS, Z3-P and H4-1, were isolated from petroleum-contaminated soils sampled from oil fields in Shandong Shengli, Xinjiang Karamay and Shaanxi Changqing. The ability of the strains to degrade diesel was examined, and after 10days the results showed that each strain was able to remove more than 60% of the total petroleum hydrocarbons, the WTS was proved that it had the most powerful ability, and the removal was 75%. When the strains were applied to real petroleum-contaminated soils, the degradation half-life of petroleum was about 30 days, and reduced to less than one fourth of that under natural conditions. Physiological and biochemical analyses and 16S rRNA sequencing were conducted to identify the three strains. The results showed that WTS, H4-1 and Z3-P belong to Citrobacter sp., Alcaligenes xylosoxydans, and Bacillus sp., respectively.

84866553227	DNA Methylation status of Wnt antagonist SFRP5 can predict the response to the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in non-small cell lung cancer	Background: It is well known that genetic alternation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays critical roles in tumorgenesis of lung cancer and can predict outcome of non-small-cell lung cancer treatment, especially the EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) therapy. However, it is unclear whether epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation involve in the response to the EGFR-TKI therapy. Methods. Tumor samples from 155 patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC who received EGFR-TKI therapy were analyzed for DNA methylation status of Wnt antagonist genes, including SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP5, DKK3, WIF1, and APC, using methylation specific PCR (MSP) method. EGFR mutations detections were performed in the same tissues samples using Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC). Results: We found that Wnt antagonists tend to methylate simultaneously. Methylation of sFRP1 and sFRP5 are reversely correlated with EGFR mutation (P=0.005, P=0.011). However, no correlations of methylations of other Wnt antagonist genes with EGFR mutation were found. The patients with methylated SFRP5 have a significant shorter progression free survival than those with unmethylated SFRP5 in response to EGFR-TKI treatment (P=0.002), which is independent of EGFR genotype. Conclusions: Patients with unmethylated SFRP5 are more likely to benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy. © 2012 Zhu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84877796691	Unnatural amino acid mediated protein bioorthogonal labeling	The bioorthogonal chemistry has become a valuable tool for specific labeling of biomolecules in living systems. One emerging example is to convert the palladium-mediated carbon-carbon bond formation reaction, a landmark reaction in organic synthesis, into the biocompatible reaction for biomolecule modifications. A prerequisite to enable such reactions to be executed on biological samples is to incorporate the corresponding bioorthogonal functional groups into target biomolecules. The genetic code expansion strategy is a leading technology on introducing diverse bioorthogonal functionalities into proteins, and the most recently developed pyrrolysine system can now allow unnatural amino acids (UAAs) bearing bioorthogonal handles into proteins in prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells and even in living animals. In this perspective, we will first introduce some of the forefronts of the bioorthognal reactions as well as the genetic code expansion strategy. We then will discuss the advantages and attractiveness of combining these newly emerged tools, Pd-mediated biomolecular labeling and pyrrolysine-based genetic code expansion system in particular, to specifically label and study proteins in living mammalian cells. More biocompatible reactions and more flexible UAA incorporation system will significantly strengthen and expand our ability to specifically manipulate proteins in their native cellular environment. © 2012 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

84877815387	Ligand-free palladium-mediated site-specific protein labeling inside gram-negative bacterial pathogens	Palladium, a key transition metal in advancing modern organic synthesis, mediates diverse chemical conversions including many carbon-carbon bond formation reactions between organic compounds. However, expanding palladium chemistry for conjugation of biomolecules such as proteins, particularly within their native cellular context, is still in its infancy. Here we report the site-specific protein labeling inside pathogenic Gram-negative bacterial cells via a ligand-free palladium-mediated cross-coupling reaction. Two rationally designed pyrrolysine analogues bearing an aliphatic alkyne or an iodophenyl handle were first encoded in different enteric bacteria, which offered two facial handles for palladium-mediated Sonogashira coupling reaction on proteins within these pathogens. A GFP-based bioorthogonal reaction screening system was then developed, allowing evaluation of both the efficiency and the biocompatibilty of various palladium reagents in promoting protein-small molecule conjugation.

45349099696	Emodin enhances cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs in prostate cancer cells: The mechanisms involve ROS-mediated suppression of multidrug resistance and hypoxia inducible factor-1	The intrinsic or acquired resistance to multiple drugs (MDR) of cancer cells remains one of the main obstacles for chemotherapy. Development of small molecule targeting to hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has been recently proposed as strategy for treatments of drug-resistant solid tumors. In the present study, emodin, proven as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator by our previous work, was applied in combination with cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic drugs in the multidrug resistant prostate carcinoma cell line DU-145 and normal human dermal fibroblasts. Results showed that emodin/cisplatin co-treatment remarkably elevated ROS level and enhanced chemosensitivity in DU-145 cells, compared with cisplatin-only treatment, but exerted little effect on non-tumor cells. The effect of co-treatment on MDR1 gene and its upstream regulator HIF-1 was then investigated in DU-145. Co-treatment downregulated MDR1 expression and promoted drug retention, and meanwhile suppressed transactivation of HIF-1 in response to hypoxia without changing expression of HIF-1α. The experiments on tumor-bearing mice showed that co-treatment inhibited the tumor growth in vivo, owing to oxidative stress and MDR1 downregulation within tumors. HIF-1 transactivation and clonegenesis were suppressed in cells isolated from the tumors. Finally, examinations for the body weight, the organ histology and the antioxidant capacity of serum suggested that no systemic toxicity related to co-treatment was discernable. In conclusions, emodin, as a novel small inhibitor of HIF-1, may be recognized an effective adjunctive to improve efficacy of cytotoxic drugs in prostate cancer cells with over-activated HIF-1 and potent MDR. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, influencing factors and adverse events of celecoxib plus platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer as first-line treatment. Methods: Previously untreated patients of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with COX-2 positive, confirmed by immunohistochemical staining, were randomized to receive GP, NP or TP regimens. Celecoxib of 400 mg Bid was given, po 5-7 days before chemotherapy,and not stopped until evidence of disease progression or toxicity. Adverse events were cirtified according to NCI-CTC criteria. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the survival rate. COX regression was used to define the predictive factors. Primary endpoint: median survival time, 1-year survival rate and median progression free survival time. Secondary endpoint: response rate and toxicity. Results: Forty-four evaluable patients were enrolled in the study from February 2005 to March 2007. Response rate was 45%, disease control rate 59%. Median progression free survival time and median survival time were 6months (95%CI: 4-8 months) and 18 months (95%CI: 9-27months), respectively. One-year survival rate was 68%. Numbers of chemotherapy cycles and overall evaluation were the predictive factors for PFS in COX model (P=0.023 and 0.000). No factor was defined to affect survival time. Neutropenia and nausea/vomit were the most common toxicity. Conclusion: Celecoxib combined with platinum-based chemotherapy appears to be well tolerated and demonstrates encouraging activity in patients of previously untreated advanced NSCLC.

51449115865	PML/RARα fusion protein mediates the unique sensitivity to arsenic cytotoxicity in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells: Mechanisms involve the impairment of cAMP signaling and the aberrant regulation of NADPH oxidase	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells are characterized by PML/RARα fusion protein, high responsiveness to arsenic trioxide (ATO)-induced cytotoxicity and an abundant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study we investigated the association among these three features in APL-derived NB4 cells. We found that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS generation was more abundant in NB4 cells compared with monocytic leukemia U937 cells. By using PR9, a sub-line of U937 stably transduced with the inducible PML/RARα expression vectors, we attributed disparities on ROS generation and ATO sensitivity to the occurrence of PML/RARα fusion protein, since PML/RARα-expressing cells appeared higher NADPH oxidase activity, higher ROS level and higher sensitivity to ATO. On the other hand, the basal intensity of cAMP signaling pathway was compared between NB4 and U937 as well as between PR9 cells with or without PML/RARα, demonstrating that PML/RARα-expressing cells had an impaired cAMP signaling pathway which relieved its inhibitory effect on NADPH oxidase derived ROS generation. In summary, the present study demonstrated the correlation of PML/RARα with cAMP signaling pathway, NADPH oxidase and ROS generation in APL cells. PML/RARα that bestows NB4 cells various pathological features, paradoxically also endows these cells with the basis for susceptibility to ATO-induced cytotoxcity. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

52949115982	Critical role of △DNMT3B4/2 in regulating RASSF1A promoter-specific DNA methylation in non-small cell lung cancer	Background: ΔDNMT3B (anew DNMT3B subfamily) expression is initiated through a novel promoter. We idenfified at least 7 transcription variants of ΔDNMT3B as a result of alternative pre-mRNA processing. The aim of this study was to detect the expression pattern of ΔDNMT3B variants in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the role of ΔDNMT3B variants in regulating the promoter-specific DNA methylation. Methods: Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets were designed to distinguish individual ΔDNMT3B variants according to their splicing patterns. The expressions of seven ΔDNMT3B variants were measured in 13 cell lines, 109 NSCLC patients, and the corresponding normal lung tissues using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The status of the p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors was detected using a methylation specific PCR (MSP). The relationships of the expression patterns of the ΔDNMT3B variants were analyzed by observing the status of p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors. The siRNA and the anti-sense oligo-dioxynucleotide specifically targeting the junction of exon 5 and 7 of ΔDNMT3B were designed and transfected by lipofectmane 2000 into H1299 and H358 call lines. RASSF1A promoter methylation from cells treated by sIRNA-ΔDNMT3B4/ 2 was detected using MSP and Bisulfite sequencing, and Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of DNMT3B and ΔDNMT3B. Cell growth and call cycle distribution were measured by applying real-time cell growth analysis and flowcytometry, respectively. Result: ΔDNMT3B variants, not DNMT3B, were the predominant transcripts in both NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors. The expression of ΔDNMT3B4 strongly correlated to the promoter methylation status of RASSF1A in a primary NSCLC. The knockdown of ΔDNMT3B4/2 by RNA-interference or anti-sense approaches resulted in a complete demethylation of RASSF1A promoter with the reactivation of a RASSF1A gene expression in less than 12 hours, but no effect resulted from the p

58149096974	Negative regulation of virus-triggered IFN-β signaling pathway by alternative splicing of TBK1	Induction of Type I IFNs is a central event in antiviral responses and must be tightly controlled. The protein kinase TBK1 is critically involved in virus-triggered type I IFN signaling. In this study, we identify an alternatively spliced isoform of TBK1, termed TBK1s, which lacks exons 3-6. Upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection, TBK1s is induced in both human and mouse cells and binds to RIG-1, disrupting the interaction between RIG-I and VISA. Consistent with that result, overexpression of TBK1s inhibits IRF3 nuclear translocation and leads to a shutdown of SeV-triggered IFN-β production. Taken together, our data indicate that TBK1s plays an inhibitory role in virus-triggered IFN-β signaling pathways. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

58149105356	Cancer cell killing via ROS: To increase or decrease, that is a question	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as a second messenger in cell signaling and are essential for various biological processes in normal cells. Any aberrance in redox balance may relate to human pathogenesis including cancers. Since ROS are usually increased in cancer cells due to oncogene activation, relative lack of blood supply or other variances, and ROS do involve in initiation, progression and metastasis of cancers, ROS are considered oncogenic. Ironically, ROS production is a mechanism shared by all non-surgical therapeutic approaches for cancers, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy, due to their implication in triggering cell death, therefore ROS are also used to kill cancer cells. Because of the double-edged sword property of ROS in determining cell fate, both pro- or anti-oxidant therapies have been proposed for treatments of cancers. Based on either side, a number of drugs, agents and approaches are developed or in the progress of development, some of which have shown clinical promise. This review summarizes the current understanding on ROS-manipulation strategies in cancer treatment and underlying mechanisms. ROS-producing or -eliminating agents and the potential drugs in this aspect are categorized. An effort is made in particular to discuss the paradox in the rationales of two opposite ROS-manipulation strategies and the concerns for their use. Selectivity between tumor and non-tumor cells may depend on difference of their redox environments. A combinational set of cellular parameters including redox status, antioxidant enzymes expression, cell signaling and transcription factor activation profiles, namely "redox signaling signature", is waiting for being developed in order to choose ROS-elevating or ROS-depleting therapy specific to certain type of cancer cells. In clinical setting individualized choice of an optimal ROS-manipulation therapy may require accurate and convenient measurements for ROS as well as "redox signaling signature" for prediction of efficacy and systemic toxicity. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

Methods: A total of 44 treatment-naive patients of advanced NSCLC with positive cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were designed to receive celecoxib plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine, novelbine or docetaxol) from February 2005 to May 2007. On 5-7 day before chemotherapy, 400 mg celecoxib was administered twice a day orally until obvious evidence of disease progression or intolerable toxicity was found. Adverse events were recorded according to NCI-CTC criteria. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year survival rate, response rate (RR) and safety. Additionally, we detected epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) status including EGFR gene amplification by real-time PCR and gene mutations by DHPLC followed by sequencing. Results: The response rate was 45% (20/44), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 59% (26/44). The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 6 m and 18 m, respectively. The 1-year survival rate was 68%. Chemotherapy cycle numbers and best response were found to be the predictive factors for PFS by COX model analysis (P = 0.023 and P = 0.000, respectively). No factor was found to affect OS. The most common toxicities included neutropenia and nausea/vomit. EGFR gene amplification was an independent prognostic factor influencing OS (P = 0.0002). Patients with EGFR mutations (exon 21) had a tendency of disease progression (P = 0.041). Conclusion: Encouraging activities of celecoxib combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy were demonstrated in treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC, with good tolerances. For COX-2 IHC positive patients, positive EGFR amplification and mutation might be related to poor clinical outcomes. © Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.

66849091226	Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations in plasma DNA samples predict tumor response in Chinese patients with stages IIIB to IV non-small-cell lung cancer	Purpose: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain can predict tumor response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, obtaining tumor tissues for mutation analysis is challenging. We hypothesized that plasma-based EGFR mutation analysis is feasible and has value in predicting tumor response in patients with NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Plasma DNA samples and matched tumors from 230 patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC were analyzed for EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21 by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. We compared the mutations in the plasma samples and the matched tumors and determined an association between EGFR mutation status and the patients' clinical outcomes prospectively. Results: In 230 patients, we detected 81 EGFR mutations in 79 (34.3%) of the patients' plasma samples. We detected the same mutations in 63 (79.7%) of the matched tumors. Sixteen plasma (7.0%) and fourteen tumor (6.1%) samples showed unique mutations. The mutation frequencies were significantly higher in never-smokers and in patients with adenocarcinomas (P = .012 and P = .009, respectively). In the 102 patients who failed platinum-based treatment and who were treated with gefitinib, 22 (59.5%) of the 37 with EGFR mutations in the plasma samples, whereas only 15 (23.1%) of the 65 without EGFR mutations, achieved an objective response (P = .002). Patients with EGFR mutations had a significantly longer progression-free survival time than those without mutations (P = .044) in plasma. Conclusion: EGFR mutations can be reliably detected in plasma DNA of patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC and can be used as a biomarker to predict tumor response to TKIs. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

67650249217	Protein identification and mRNA analysis of phytochrome-regulated genes in Arabidopsis under red light	Phytochromes are a family of plant photoreceptors that mediate physiological and developmental responses to red and far-red light. According to the affymetrix ATH1 microarray, phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) together play a key role in transducing the Rc signals to light-responsive genes. In order to select those red light-responsive genes associated with phyA or phyB, a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to compare the protein expression patterns of the phyAphyB double mutant and the wild type of Arabidopsis thaliana (col-4) which grew under constant red light conditions for 7 d. Thirty-two protein spots which exhibited differences in protein abundance were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry. The expression of ten genes corresponding to ten protein spots was analyzed by a semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Two of the ten genes were confirmed by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). The results showed that phytochromes may exert their function by regulating mRNA or protein expressions. Proteomic analysis may provide a novel pathway for identifying phytochrome-dependent genes. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

68949160948	Expression of ΔDNMT3B variants and its association with estrogen/ progestogen receptor status in breast cancer	Objective: Our previous study has showed that ΔDNMT3B is the predominant form of DNMT3B in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we aimed to explore the expression patterns of the ΔDNMT3B variants in breast cancer and to identify whether the pattern was similar to that in NSCLC or not and its clinical significance. Methods: Expression of seven ΔDNMT3B variants in 59 breast cancer and the corresponding normal tissue was measured using RT-PCR. The correlations between the expressions of ΔDNMT3B variants and the clinical parameters including ER/PR status, clincopathologic feature and survivals were analyzed. Results: There were significant differences in the expression ratios of ΔDNMT3B1-7 variants between breast cancer tissues and normal tissues (P < 0.001). The positive ratio of ΔDNMT3B1-7 variants were 66%, 71%, 17%, 51%, 76.2%, 50% and 61% in tumor tissue, respectively; while 16%, 8.4%, 3.38%, 3.38%, 11.8%, 13.5% and 5.08% in the corresponding normal tissue, which was different from the pattern of ΔDNMT3B1-7 expression in NSCLC (62%, 76%, 2.5%, 46%, 18%, 27% and 16% in tumor tissue, respectively; while 18%, 11%, 0%, 3.3%, 0%, 0% and 0% in normal lung tissue, respectively; P < 0.0001). Expressions of ΔDNMT3B2, 3B4 and 3B7 were higher in the patients with negative estrogen receptor (ER) than those with positive estrogen receptor (P = 0.035, P = 0.0141 and P = 0.0219, respectively). ΔDNMT3B7 expression was higher for the patients with negative progestogen receptor (PR) compared to those with positive progestogen receptor (P = 0.0379). Expression ratio of ΔDNMT3B5 in stage III tumors is lower than that in stage I/II ones (P = 0.041). But we did not find any relation between the ΔDNMT3B variants and the patients' survival. Conclusion: The pattern of ΔDNMT3B variants in breast cancer is different from that in NSCLC. Expressions of ΔDNMT3B2, 3B4 and 3B7 are associated with estrogen receptors status. While ΔDNMT3B7 is associated with progestogen receptor. No relation between the ΔDNMT3B variants and the patients' survival were found. © Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.

69049091861	Erlotinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer after gefitinib failure	Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer after failure of gefitinib treatment. Patients and methods: Patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who had progressed after gefitinib treatment, were included in this study; patients received erlotinib 150 mg/day until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Results: Twenty-one patients were included in this study. Among them, 14 (66.7%) were male and 7 (33.3%) were female; median age was 63 years; 10 (47.6%) patients were smokers; 9 (42.9%)patients had squamous cell carcinoma subtype; 8 (38.1%) patients had adenocarcinoma subtype and 4 (19%) patients had the other NSCLC subtype. Out of 21 patients, 2 (9.5%) had PR and 4 (19.0%) had SD, giving an overall response rate of 9.5% and a disease control rate of 28.5%. The median TTP were 55 days, the median OS were 135 days. Two patients with PR to erlotinib treatment were female never smokers with adenocarcinoma histology and both had partial response to prior gefitinib treatment. Three of four patients with a SD to erlotinib treatment also had SD from prior gefitinib therapy. Smoking history, histology and response to erlotinib were significantly correlated with survival. The most common toxic effects were skin rash. Conclusions: Erlotinib may be an option for a more highly selected subset of patients, especially those who had already benefited from prior gefitinib treatment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

72349088822	Cetuximab combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: To observe the efficacy and safety of cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to investigate the association of status of K-RAS gene mutation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotype with clinical outcome. Methods: Between Jan. 2006 and Sep. 2009, nineteen patients with advanced NSCLC received cetuximab (4 weeks) combined with chemotherapy in Department of Thoracic Oncology at Beijing Cancer Hospital. Response, survival and toxicity were retrospectively assessed, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression was evaluated by ELISA Kit. The status of K-RAS gene mutation was tested by PCR-RFLP and EGFR gene amplification was measured by EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Partial response(PR) was observed in 26.3%(5/19) of the patients and stable disease(SD) in 52.6%(10/19). Median progression free survival(PFS) was 6 months (95% CI: 3.6-8.4). Median overall survival (MST) and 1-year survival rate(SR) were 10.6 months (95% CI: 6.6-14.6) and 47.6%, respectively. Mild or moderate skin rash was the most common toxicity related with cetuximab. K-RAS gene mutation, EGFR protein level and amplification have little correlation with prognosis. Conclusion: Cetuximab combined with chemotherapy was tolerable and the skin rash related with cetuximab was mild to moderate. Cetuximab may prolong survival of the patients who failed to previous chemotherapy. © 2009 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

77249170980	A phase II trial of gefitinib as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China	Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib as maintenance therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who obtained disease control (DC) after first-line chemotherapy in Chinese population. Methods: Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC treated with standard chemotherapy and obtained DC were assigned to receive gefitinib as maintenance treatment. The primary end point was overall survival time (OS), the second end point was disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival time (PFS). DCR included complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) and plus stable disease (SD). The impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status on the treatment as exploratory point was also evaluated by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Results: Among 75 enrolled patients, the overall response rate was 37% and the DCR (CR + PR +SD) was 66%. The median PFS and OS were 17.13 months and 26.13 months respectively, with 1- and 2-year survival rates 89.3% and 34.7%. Patients harboring somatic EGFR mutations obtained a prolonged median PFS and OS compared with EGFR wide type (25.1 vs. 13.0 months, P=0.019 and 33.37 vs. 25.57 months, P=0.014, respectively). In COX regression model, only EGFR mutation status was the independently factor influencing both PFS and OS (P=0.029 and 0.017, respectively), however, rash status was the predictor in terms of PFS (P=0.027). Conclusion: Gefitinib produced encouraging survival when delivered as maintenance therapy in Chinese patients obtaining DC after first-line chemotherapy, especially for patients carrying somatic EGFR mutations. EGFR mutation is an independently predictive factor of survival. © 2010 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

75449102229	The association between EGFR gene amplification and the prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer: A meta-analysis	Background and objective: Many studies concluded that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification might be related with the prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer. However, the results were not consistent. To identify whether EGFR gene amplification could affect the prognosis, a meta-analysis was conducted based on the published works. Methods: According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, articles were selected from medical electronic databases searching, including PubMed, Cochrane library and CNKI. Te qualities of included articles were scored based on the European Lung Cancer Working Party scale, and the hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were also collected. Meta-analysis was completed using software Review Manager 4.2. Results: Forest plot from 12 studies in which 1 221 included patients were all treated with EGFR-TKI showed that the prognosis of patients harboring EGFR gene amplification were superior to negative ones (HR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.68-0.99, P=0.04), and for Caucasian patients who received EGFR-TKI, the survivals were longer in EGFR gene amplification positive cases than those without amplification (HR=0.42, 95%CI: 0.31-0.57, P<0.001). Meta results from 8 studies in which 658 included patients did not receive EGFR-TKI indicated that the casualty hazard of amplification positive patients was comparable with negative ones. However, for Asia patients who failed to receive EGFR-TKI, the prognosis of patients with EGFR gene amplification were inferior to negative ones (HR=1.88, 95%CI: 1.21-2.93, P=0.005). Conclusion: EGFR gene amplification may be a positive predictive factor in terms of survival for Caucasian patients receiving EGFR-TKI rather than Asia patients. However, the prognosis was inferior in Asia patients with EGFR amplification to those without the amplification, if they failed to receive EGFR-TKI.

75749131958	EGFR mutations are associated with prognosis but not with the response to front-line chemotherapy in the Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer	The study aimed to investigate associations of tumor tissue EGFR mutations with response to the front-line chemotherapy and prognosis in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. EGFR genotypes of 145 chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IIIB and IV NSCLC were examined by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). All patients received the front-line chemotherapy. There were 69 patients who received gefitinib therapy (32 as second-line and 37 as third-line therapy). About 37.9% (55/145) of the patients was detected to have EGFR mutations in their tumor tissue DNA. The response rate (RR, complete response plus partial response) to the chemotherapy for mutated EGFR carriers was 34.5% (19/55), similar to 33.3% (30/90) for wild-type EGFR carriers (P = 0.881). The patients with EGFR mutations had increased median survival time and 1- and 2-year survival rate than those with wild-type EGFR (23 vs 16 months, 86.38% vs 62.64%, 38.78% vs 27.16%, P = 0.0273). Among Stage IV NSCLC patients, mutated EGFR carriers had a longer progression-free survival (PFS) than wild-type EGFR carriers (5 vs 3 months, P = 0.040). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that response to the front-line chemotherapy (RR vs PD) and EGFR mutation were independent prognostic factors (HR = 0.461, 95% CI: 0.271-0.783, P = 0.0042; HR = 0.598, 95% CI: 0.372-0.961, P = 0.0335, respectively) for patients with advanced NSCLC. We conclude that EGFR mutations in the Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC were not associated with response to the front-line chemotherapy, but Stage IV NSCLC patients with mutated EGFR had a longer PFS after the front-line chemotherapy.

76749151984	Potential clinical significance of a plasma-based KRAS mutation analysis in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Purpose: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS mutation may be resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). This study aims to evaluate a plasma-based KRAS mutation analysis and the clinical significance of plasma KRAS mutation as a predictive marker for tumor resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC. Experimental Design: DNA extracted from plasma and matched tumor tissues were obtained from 273 patients with advanced stage NSCLC. Patients were followed up prospectively for treatment outcomes. KRAS mutations in codon 12 and 13 were detected using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Mutations in plasma and matched tumors were compared. Associations between KRAS mutation status and patients' clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: KRAS mutation was found in 35 (12.8%) plasma samples and 30 (11.0%) matched tumor tissues. The consistency of KRAS mutations between plasma and tumors is 76.7% (23 of 30; κ = 0.668; P < 0.001). Among 120 patients who received EGFR-TKI treatment, the response rate was only 5.3% (1 of 19) for patients with plasma KRAS mutation compared with 29.7% for patients with no KRAS mutation in plasma DNA (P = 0.024). The median progression-free survival time of patients with plasma KRAS mutation was 2.5 months compared with 8.8 months for patients with wild-type KRAS (P < 0.001). Conclusions: KRAS mutation in plasma DNA correlates with the mutation status in the matched tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC. Plasma KRAS mutation status is associated with a poor tumor response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients and may be used as a predictive marker in selecting patients for such treatment. ©2010 AACR.

77950868814	Mutational analysis of Arabidopsis PP2CA2 involved in abscisic acid signal transduction	The homozygous T-DNA mutant of the PP2CA2 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana was identified at DNA and RNA levels. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed expression of PP2CA2 was induced by NaCl and ABA. When grown in presence of increasing concentration of exogenous ABA the pp2ca2 mutant showed a significant loss of ABA sensitivity in terms of seed germination, efficiency of post-germination growth and root growth. In presence of all ABA and NaCl concentrations tested the germination percentage of wild-type seeds was lower than that of mutant ppca2 seeds. Furthermore, in the presence of exogenous ABA, the pp2ca2 seeds showed higher germination percentages than wildtype at different stages of development and the pp2ca2 seedlings showed a reduced inhibition of root growth compared with wild-type plants. The above results indicated that the pp2ca2 was an ABA-hyposensitive mutant. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

77951554600	Advances in the treatment for non-small cell lung cancer with solitary metastasis	Lung cancer is one of the most common tumors which are threatening human lives. About 40% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were diagnosed at stage IV. Among these patients, a few presented with early-stage primary lesion accompanied with solitary metastasis in single organ. The management and prognosis of these patients are different from those of patients diagnosed with multiple metastases. For NSCLC with solitary brain metastasis, if the primary tumor has been resected completely or controlled properly, synchronous or heterochronous resection of the solitary brain metastatic focus will raise the 5-year survival rate to 10%-30%. Presently, radical resection of primary and cerebral metastatic tumor or stereotactic radiation combined with whole brain radiotherapy is recommended for such patients. The morbility of solitary adrenal gland metastasis in NSCLC is about 1.62%-3.5%. Radical resection of primary and metastatic tumors combined with chemotherapy could prolong survival of these patients. The 5-year survival rate for these patients could reach 25%-40%. In conclusion, radical resection of the primary and metastatic tumors could prolong the survival of NSCLC patients with solitary metastasis in the brain or adrenal gland or other sites.

In a randomised phase 2 study in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adding vandetanib 100 mg to docetaxel significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with docetaxel alone, including a longer PFS in women. These results supported investigation of the combination in this larger, definitive phase 3 trial (ZODIAC). Methods: Between May, 2006, and April, 2008, patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB-IV) NSCLC after progression following first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned 1:1 through a third-party interactive voice system to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m

77956155185	High prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in lymphoma patients	OBJECTIVE: To understand hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in lymphoma patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted in 459 cases from Jan. 2008 to Dec. 2008, including 276 cases of lymphoma and 183 cases of lung cancer. Electrochemiluminescence assay was used to test serum samples from both groups for HBV-related markers, including HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb and HBcAb. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that there was a higher prevalence of HBsAg positive rate in lymphoma patients(11.95%, 33/276) than that in lung cancer patients (4.92%, 9/183, P=0.0104), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the highest among all lymphomas (14.77%, 26/176, P=0.0052). CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrated that lymphoma patients have a higher incidence of HBV infection. Compared with lung cancer, lymphoma should not only supervise the detection of HBV, but also pay attention to the prevention and treatment of HBV reactivation.

77956894860	Positive expression of ERCC1 predicts a poorer platinum-based treatment outcome in Chinese patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer	The goal of this study is to determine role of excision repair cross-complementing group 1 gene (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) expression in predicting response and survival in Chinese patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy tissues were retrospectively obtained from 124 advanced NSCLC patients. Protein expression levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations between expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 and clinic-pathologic parameters were analyzed. The study shows that ERCC1 and RRM1 expression was detected in 43 (35%) and 50 (40%) of the 124 tumor samples, respectively. Expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 was negatively associated with tumor response. Fifty-four percent patients whose tumors did not express ERCC1 had partial response (PR) compared to 33% whose tumors expressed the protein (P = 0.022). Similarly, 54% patients whose tumor did not express RRM1 had PR compared to 36% whose tumors expression the protein (P = 0.042). Further, patients whose tumors lacked of ERCC1 but not RRM1 expression had a longer median survival time than those tumors expressed ERCC1 (13.4 months versus 9.1 months; P = 0.006), which is independent of other prognostic factors (P = 0.0066). In conclusion, tumor ERCC1 expression is associated with tumor response and patients' survival in Chinese advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based regimen and may serve as a biomarker in predicting tumor response and clinical outcome in the patient population. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.

78650852845	High expression of ERCC1 is a poor prognostic factor in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving cisplatin-based therapy	Objective: to determine the role of excision repair cross-complementing group 1 gene (ERCC1) and ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) expression in predicting response and survival in Chinese patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy tissues were retrospectively obtained from 160 advanced NSCLC patients. mRNA expression levels of ERCC1 and RRM1 were determined by real-time PCR. Results: Associations between mRNA expression level of ERCC1 and RRM1 and clinic-pathologic parameters were analyzed. One handred and forty two (88.75%) specimens were successfully amplified. mRNA expression level of ERCC1 and RRM1 was negatively associated with tumor response. ERCC1 expression levels ranged from 0.01 to 78.79 [median 0.63, mean 4.25 and standard deviation (SD) 9.23 and RRM1 from 0.00 to 30.91 (median 0.63, mean 0.87 and SD 3.36). By adopting cut-off values according to median expression levels, we found that MST in patients with low ERCC1 mRNA levels was significantly longer in overall population than in patients with higher levels (18.63 versus 13.69 months, log-rank 5.73, P=0.017), but we did not found the survival benefit of the patients with low expression level of RRM1. (19.07 versus 14.88, log-rank 1.66, P=0.197). Further, in the multivariable Cox regression model analysis we found that low level of ERCC1 expression, the presence of weight loss and target therapy, were significant prognostic factors for survival. Conclusion: ERCC1 expression is associated with patients' survival in Chinese advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based regimen and may serve as a biomarker in predicting tumor response and clinical outcome in the patient population. © 2010 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

79952058404	Personalised therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer: Consensus and controversy	The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including gefitinib and erlotinib, have been proven to provide significant benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival in patients who have received at least one line of prior chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses of previous placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive status was associated with improved outcomes with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, leading to further investigation of these agents in the first-line setting. However, selection by clinical characteristics has proved inadequate for identifying all patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive disease. Recently, several randomised and multicentre phase III clinical trials investigated the efficacy and tolerability of first-line gefitinib or erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with confirmed epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation non-small-cell lung cancer. The results demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor mutation is a key to achieving exceptional outcomes with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, regardless of patient clinical characteristics. However, there are also some dilemmas in genotype-based personalised tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. It is not yet clear whether this approach should only be applied after standard first-line chemotherapy or be used as first-line therapy to start with. In addition, as a non-invasive and repeatable source of genotypic information, it is uncertain whether repeated determination of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status in peripheral blood could be helpful. In future, more clinical studies combined with prospective molecular analysis are warranted to verify the best strategy for individualised target therapy in selected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. © 2010 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.

79953172959	Retreatment with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor after initial failure in advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Background and objective The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFRTKI) shows favorable antitumor activity against chemorefractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patients with advanced NSCLC have limited treatment options available if they are refractory to EGFR-TKI. To study the influence of the retreatment EGFR-TKI after failure of first-line TKI, we carried out this retrospective study. Methods Total 71 patients were analyzed who experienced treatment failure from their initial use of EGFR-TKI. After a period of time, they were retreated with TKI as tumor progression was observed. Results Of the 71 patients who received retreatment TKI, it was observed in 7% in partial response (PR), 36.6% in stable disease (SD), 56.3% in progressive disease (PD). Disease control rate (DCR) was 43.7%. Twenty-six (36.6%) patients were well controlled by retreatment with TKI monotherapy for not less than 3 months. Five (7.0%) patients had partial response. Exon 21 mutation, PFS not less than 6 months during initial treatment TKI, and the interval not less than 3 months between initial treatment, and retreatment with TKI was associated with a good progression free survival based on univariate COX analysis (P=0.034; P=0.013; P=0.046). Conclusion It has been shown the possibility that retreatment with TKI might be useful when (1) Exon 21 has active mutation, (2) initial treatment shows a favorable PFS (≥ 6 months), and (3) there has been a period of time (≥3 months) following the termination of the initial TKI treatment.

79955096632	The spatial variations of bacterioplankton community composition in Lake Dianchi and their relation to environmental factors	Lake Dianchi is in a serious eutrophication state. However, the water quality varies spatially in the lake. In order to explore the spatial distribution of bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs), as well as to identify the key factors that affect the distribution of BCCs, 9 surface water samples were investigated along the trophic gradient in the summer of 2009 by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). In total, fifty-two terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) were detected in all samples. The nine samples had different bacterial compositions and predominant types. But the Shannon-Weiner diversity indices and evenness in all the samples were low, which indicated that the ecological status of Lake Dianchi was fragile. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis indicated that the samples that scattered closely had similar water qualities, verified by cluster analysis using UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using averages). Meanwhile, the BBCs of 9 samples could be divided into four clusters. The result of canonical corresponding analysis (CCA) also illuminated the environmental factors affecting the BCC, among which NH

79953192556	Analysis of prognostic factors in 541 female patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Background and objective As there is a sharp increase in the incidence of lung cancer in women in recent years, it has brought broad concerns with its unique clinical and epidemiological characteristics and better prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical data of women with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) retrospectively to explore the prognostic factors. Methods Clinical data of 541 female patients with advanced NSCLC were collected and followed up till death. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS). SPSS 11.0 statistical analysis software was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Results The mean age is 59 years (20 years-86 years), adenocarcinoma account for 80.2% (434/541). The median OS was 15 months (95%CI: 13.87-16.13), and 1, 2, 5-year survival rates were 58.8%, 23.7% and 3.20% respectively. Univariate analysis showed that clinical stage, ECOG score, weight loss, clinical symptoms, liver/bone/brain metastasis and received more than one chemotherapy regimen, good response to the first-line chemotherapy, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy and radiotherapy treatment were significantly correlated with the OS and survival rate (P<0.05). Combined with multivariate analysis, weight loss before treatment, ECOG score, received EGFR-TKI targeted therapy and response to first-line chemotherapy were independent prognostic factor for survival (P<0.05). Conclusion There is a higher percentage of adenocarcinoma in female NSCLC. Weight loss before treatment, ECOG score, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy and response to first-line chemotherapy may become independent prognostic factors for survival of female patients with advanced NSCLC.

79955368580	Influence of Ectomycorrhizal Fungi on Absorption and Balance of Essential Elements of Pinus tabulaeformis Seedlings in Saline Soil	Pinus tabulaeformis seedlings were grown under a factorial design to measure biomass accumulation and P, Na and K concentrations of plants, with 3 different ectomycorrhizal fungus (EMF) strains (Boletus edulis, Xerocomus chrysenteron and Gomphidius viscidus) and two P treatments (with or without extra P). Growth and mineral nutrition of pine seedlings were stimulated by three EMF under salinity stress. Na concentrations were changed and plant K and P concentrations were increased significantly by EMF. Adding extra P made no difference in accumulation of seedlings biomass, and did not assist element absorption of plants. Although three strains of EMF can all enhance the tolerance of pine seedlings to salinity stress, they may utilize different mechanisms because of different performance in absorption of elements. The increased P and K accumulation and the balance of ion concentrations might be due to the enhanced tolerance of EMF-inoculated plants to saline conditions. © 2011 Soil Science Society of China.

0036710210	RhCG is downregulated in oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but expressed in multiple squamous epithelia	To better understand the molecular events underlying the development of oesophageal cancer, we have isolated the genes dysregulated in primary oesophageal cancer tissues using a modified differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR). In the present study, a gene designated C15orf6 was identified. The C15orf6 gene, encompassing 25 kb, is composed of 11 exons with a mRNA of 1948 bp. Database searching showed that C15orf6 was 100% homologous to the Rh type C-glycoprotein (RhCG) with the same open reading frame, but 16 bp longer than RhCG at the 5′-end. The gene was highly expressed in human oesophagus, cervix, oral cavity, skin and kidney, but undetectable in the other 14 adult normal tissues examined. Northern blot, RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that RhCG/C15orf6 was frequently lost or dramatically reduced in primary oesophageal cancer tissues (30/34) compared with the corresponding normal oesophageal mucosa. Three oesophageal-cancer cell lines tested lacked RhCG/C15orf6 expression. Immunohistochemistry revealed that in normal oesophageal tissues, RhCG/C15orf6 was mainly expressed in the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells. In addition, Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG) expression was also commonly silenced in both oesophageal cancer cell lines (2/3) and primary oesophageal cancer tissues (11/13). To our knowledge, this is the first time that RhAG expression has been seen in oesophageal epithelium and extends the functional role of the RhAG protein beyond the erythrocyte. These data suggest that inactivation of RhCG/C15orf6 and RhAG occurs frequently during the development of human oesophageal cancer. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

79960889662	Erlotinib versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (OPTIMAL, CTONG-0802): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study	Background: Activating mutations in EGFR are important markers of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The OPTIMAL study compared efficacy and tolerability of the TKI erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Methods: We undertook an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 22 centres in China. Patients older than 18 years with histologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a confirmed activating mutation of EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation) received either oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects, or up to four cycles of gemcitabine plus carboplatin. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a minimisation procedure and were stratified according to EGFR mutation type, histological subtype (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status. The primary outcome was progression-free survival, analysed in patients with confirmed disease who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00874419, and has completed enrolment; patients are still in follow-up. Findings: 83 patients were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 82 to receive gemcitabine plus carboplatin; 82 in the erlotinib group and 72 in the chemotherapy group were included in analysis of the primary endpoint. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in erlotinib-treated patients than in those on chemotherapy (13.1 [95% CI 10.58-16.53] vs 4.6 [4.21-5.42] months; hazard ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.10-0.26; p<0.0001). Chemotherapy was associated with more grade 3 or 4 toxic effects than was erlotinib (including neutropenia in 30 [42%] of 72 patients and thrombocytopenia in 29 [40%] patients on chemotherapy vs no patients with either event on erlotinib); the most common grade 3 or 4 toxic effects with erlotinib were increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations (three [4%] of 83 patients) and skin rash (two [2%] patients). Chemotherapy was also associated with increased treatment-related serious adverse events (ten [14%] of 72 patients [decreased platelet count, n=8; decreased neutrophil count, n=1; hepatic dysfunction, n=1] vs two [2%] of 83 patients [both hepatic dysfunction]). Interpretation: Compared with standard chemotherapy, erlotinib conferred a significant progression-free survival benefit in patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and was associated with more favourable tolerability. These findings suggest that erlotinib is important for first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

80051628984	Immediate versus delayed treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors after first-line therapy in advanced mon-small-cell lung cancer	Objective: To analyze the outcomes of patients who received TKI immediately after the first-line without progression as maintenance treatment (immediate group) vs. those received delayed treatment upon disease progression as second-line therapy (delayed group). Methods: The study included 159 no-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received gefitinib or erlotinib as maintenance treatment in the immediate group (85 patients) or as second-line therapy in the delayed group (74 patients). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). EGFR mutation status was detected using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Results: PFS was 17.3 and 16.4 months in the immediate and delayed groups respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99*95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.69-1.42*P=0.947). In a subgroup analysis that included only patients with EGFR mutation however PFS was significantly longer in the immediate group than in the delayed group (HR 0.48*95% CI: 0.27-0.85*P=0.012). In patients with wild type EGFR the risk for disease progression was comparable between the two groups (HR 1.23*95% CI: 0.61-2.51*P=0.564). No significant difference was demonstrated between the immediate and delayed group in terms of the overall survival (OS) (26.1 months vs. 21.6 months respectively*HR=0.537z.ast;95% CI: 0.27 to 1.06*P=0.072). There was also no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups. Conclusions: EGFR TKI maintenance improves PFS in patients with EGFR mutation. Prospectively designed clinical studies that compare TKI immediate vs. delayed treatment after first-line chemotherapy upon disease progression are needed. © 2011 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80054731734	Role of EGFR mutation status in patients with stage III non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy	Background and objective The presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations is predictive of a better response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and initial chemotherapy in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to analyze the association between the EGFR mutations and the outcome of combined chemoradiotherapy in stage III non-squamous NSCLC. Methods Patients with stage III non-squamous NSCLC whose EGFR mutation status had been identified were retrospectively analyzed. The response of 87 patients to combined chemoradiotherapy, the two-year survival rate, and the response of 128 patients to initial chemotherapy were evaluated. Results The response rate to combined chemoradiotherapy was 84.6% (33/39) in EGFR mutation-positive patients, significantly higher than the 56.3% (27/48) response rate in EGFR mutation- negative patients (P=0.004). Two-year survival rates were 53.8% and 50% in EGFR mutation-positive and mutationnegative patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in the overall survival for both patient groups. The overall response rate to initial chemotherapy was 34.5% (19/55) in EGFR mutation-positive patients, compared with the 21.9% (16/73) response rate in EGFR mutation-negative patients. Conclusion EGFR mutation-positive status can predict better response to combined chemoradiotherapy, but is not associated with overall survival in patients with stage III non-squamous NSCLC.

80054911223	A randomized phase 3 trial comparing pemetrexed/carboplatin and docetaxel/carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer	Introduction: This study compared survival without toxicity in patients with advanced, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with first-line pemetrexed/carboplatin or docetaxel/carboplatin. Methods: This multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial comprised patients randomized (1:1) to pemetrexed/carboplatin (n = 128) or docetaxel/carboplatin (n = 132). Patients received treatment on day 1 of each 21-day cycle (maximum of six cycles). Treatment included carboplatin (area under the curve = 5 mg/ml × min) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m) or docetaxel (75 mg/m). The primary outcome measure, survival without treatment-emergent grade 3/4 toxicity, was defined as the time from randomization to the first treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse event or death and was analyzed using a log-rank test. The analysis population included 106 patients in the pemetrexed/carboplatin (Pem/Carb) group and 105 patients in the docetaxel/carboplatin (Doc/Carb) group. Results: Survival without treatment-emergent grade 3/4 toxicity was significantly longer in the Pem/Carb versus the Doc/Carb group (log-rank p < 0.001; median survival without treatment-emergent grade 3/4 toxicity: 3.2 versus 0.7 months; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.45 [95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.61]). Overall survival was similar in the Pem/Carb versus the Doc/Carb group (log-rank p = 0.934; median survival: 14.9 versus 14.7 months; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.93 [95% confidence interval: 0.66-1.32]). Compared with the Doc/Carb group, fewer patients in the Pem/Carb group experienced grade 3/4 drug-related, treatment-emergent neutropenia, leukopenia, or febrile neutropenia, and more patients experienced anemia and thrombocytopenia. There were three study drug-related deaths during treatment in each group. Conclusions: The favorable benefit-to-risk profile of pemetrexed/carboplatin suggests that pemetrexed/carboplatin is an appropriate first-line treatment option for chemonaïve patients with advanced, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

80555135679	Study of inactivating sulfate reducing bacteria with zero-valent iron nanoparticles	This research investigates the ability and effect of nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) particles in inactivating sulfate-reducing bacteria; and conjectures the mechanism through observing transformation of SRB and NZVI. According to the research results, when adding 0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg/mL NZVI to the injection water, the inactivating rate of SRB would be 0, 75.6%, 90.0%, 99.9% and 99.9%. The dyeing and ESEM results show that NZVI adsorbs closely to the SRB cell when inactivating SRB, and it is oxidated on the surface of the bacteria cells. 5 mg/mL NZVI kills SRB greatly and the inhibition may mainly through coating the cells, inhibiting cell proliferation, rather than destroying the cellular structure.

83755173110	Guanylate binding protein 4 negatively regulates virus-induced type I IFN and antiviral response by targeting IFN regulatory factor 7	IRF7 is known as the master regulator in virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs (IFN-I). In this study, we identify GBP4 virus-induced protein interacting with IRF7 as a negative regulator for IFN-I response. Overexpression of GBP4 inhibits virus-triggered activation of IRF7-dependent signaling, but has no effect on NF-κB signaling, whereas the knockdown of GBP4 has opposite effects. Furthermore, the supernatant from Sendai virus-infected cells in which GBP4 have been silenced inhibits the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus more efficiently. Competitive coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that overexpression of GBP4 disrupts the interactions between TRAF6 and IRF7, resulting in impaired TRAF6-mediated IRF7 ubiquitination. Our results suggest that GBP4 is a negative regulator of virus-triggered IFN-I production, and it is identified as a novel protein targeting IRF7 and inhibiting its function.

82255161972	Epidermal growth factor receptor genotype in plasma DNA and outcome of chemotherapy in the Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Background The genotype of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor and effectiveness of therapy, but its role in cytotoxic chemotherapy is still unknown. Previous studies indicated that certain EGFR mutations were associated with response and progression free survival following platinum based chemotherapy. Our recent studies have identified that EGFR genotypes in the tumour tissues were not associated with response to the first-line chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we investigated associations of EGFR genotypes from plasma of patients with advanced NSCLC and response to first-line chemotherapy and prognosis. Methods We enrolled 145 advanced NSCLC patients who had received first-line chemotherapy in our department. We examined plasma EGFR genotypes for these patients and associations of EGFR mutations with response to chemotherapy and clinical outcomes. Results There were 54 patients with known EGFR mutations and 91 cases of wild types. No significant difference was detected in the response rate to first-line chemotherapy between mutation carriers and wild-type patients (37.0% vs. 31.9%). The median survival time and 1-, 2-year survival rates were higher in mutation carriers than wild-types (24 months vs. 18 months, 85.7% vs. 65.7% and 43.7% vs. 25.9%, P=0.047). Clinical stage (IV vs. IIIb), response to the first-line chemotherapy (partial vs. no) and EGFR genotype were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion Plasma EGFR mutations in the Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC is not a predictor for the response to first-line chemotherapy, but an independent prognostic factor indicating longer survival.

84860479704	Gefitinib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (INFORM; C-TONG 0804): A multicentre, double-blind randomised phase 3 trial	Background: Maintenance treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without disease progression after first-line chemotherapy is a subject of ongoing research. The aim of the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, INFORM study was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the EGFR-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the maintenance setting. Methods: Patients were aged 18 years or older, were of east Asian ethnic origin, had a life expectancy of more than 12 weeks, histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIb or IV NSCLC, a WHO performance status of 0-2, and had completed four cycles of first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy without disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Between Sept 28, 2008 and Aug 11, 2009, 296 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either gefitinib (250 mg per day orally) or placebo (orally) within 3-6 weeks after chemotherapy until progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Randomisation was done via an interactive web response system with computer-generated randomisation codes. Our primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This completed study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00770588. Findings: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with gefitinib (n=148) than with placebo (148) (median progression-free survival 4·8 months [95% CI 3·2-8·5] vs 2·6 months [1·6-2·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·42, 95% CI 0·33-0·55; p<0·0001). Adverse events occurred more frequently with gefitinib than with placebo; the most common adverse events of any grade were rash (73 [50%] of 147 in the gefitinib group vs 14 [9%] of 148 in the placebo group), diarrhoea (37 [25%] vs 13 [9%]), and alanine aminotransferase increase (31 [21%] vs 12 [8%]). The most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 adverse event was alanine aminotransferase increase (3 [2%] of 147 in the gefitinib group, none of 148 in the placebo group). Ten of 147 (7%) patients given gefitinib and five of 148 (3%) patients given placebo had serious adverse events. Three deaths were thought to be related to treatment with gefitinib: one from interstitial lung disease; one from lung infection; and one from pneumonia. Interpretation: Maintenance treatment with gefitinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients from east Asia with advanced NSCLC who achieved disease control after first-line chemotherapy. Clinicians should consider these data when making decisions about maintenance treatment in such patients. Funding: AstraZeneca. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863195820	Comparative analysis of cytopathologic and histopathologic diagnosis in the transbronchial needle aspiration specimens	Objective To study the cytopathologic features of transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) samples and to evaluate the role of cytopathology in the diagnosis and staging of lung carcinomas, as compared to histopathology. Methods Three hundred seventy-four cytology specimens were collected by TBNA using 21-gauge needle, including 65 lung masses and 309 lymph nodes. Direct smears and liquid-based thin-layer preparations were performed for each case. The correlation between cytology and histopathologic diagnoses were analyzed. Results The sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate, false negative rate and accuracy of cytopathology in diagnosing lung carcinomas by TBNA was 95. 7% (88/92) (266/278), 100% (96/96), 0(0/96), 4.3% (12/278) and 96. 8% (362/374) , respectively. Overall 62. 8% ( 167/266) of the cases were precisely typed, including 95. 7% (88/92) of small cell carcinoma, 73. 5% ( 25/34 ) of squamous cell carcinoma and 67. 9% ( 53/78 ) of adenocarcinoma. There was no statistical difference in the diagnostic accuracy of cytopathology between lung mass aspiration and mediastinal lymph node aspiration, as well as between subcarinal lymph node aspiration and other lymph node aspiration (all P >0. 05).

84864141816	Photocaging strategy for functionalisation of oligonucleotides and its applications for oligonucleotide labelling and cyclisation	We have used a photocaging strategy to develop novel phosphoramidites and expand the repertoire of protecting groups for modification of oligonucleotides by solid-phase synthesis. We synthesised five photolabile phosphoramidites and four new photolabile controlled pore glasses (CPGs). By using these photolabile phosphoramidites and CPGs, modified oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with phosphate, amine, acid, thiol and carbonyl moieties at 5' and/or 3' ends were readily synthesised. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of introducing a carbonyl at the 5' end and thiol groups at both ends of ODNs with photolabile modifiers. Terminal labelling was also easily realised in solution or by on-column solid-phase synthesis. By using the photolabile amine modifier and the photolabile acid CPG, cyclisation of an oligodeoxynucleotide was achieved with good yields. This study provides an alternative way to introduce functional groups into oligonucleotides and expand the scope of oligonucleotide bio-orthogonal labelling. Caging oligonucleotides: Five photolabile phosphoramidites and four photolabile CPGs were synthesised for oligodeoxy-nucleotide modifications with phosphate, amine, acid, thiol and carbonyl moieties at 5' and/or 3' ends (see scheme).

84865050504	Phosphorylated EGFR expression may predict outcome of EGFR-TKIs therapy for the advanced NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR	Background: EGFR mutation is a strong predictive factor of EGFR-TKIs therapy. However, at least 10% of patients with EGFR wild-type are responsive to TKIs, suggesting that other determinants of outcome besides EGFR mutation might exist. We hypothesized that activation of phosphorylated EGFR could be a potential predictive biomarker to EGFR-TKIs treatment among patients in wild-type EGFR. Method. Total of 205 stage IIIb and IV NSCLC patients, tissue samples of whom were available for molecular analysis, were enrolled in this study. The phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 1068 (pTyr1068) and 1173 (pTyr1173) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, and EGFR mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatograph (DHPLC). Results: Among 205 patients assessable for EGFR mutation and phosphorylation analysis, 92 (44.9%) were EGFR mutant and 165 patients (57.6%) had pTyr1173 expression. Superior progression-free survival (PFS) was seen after EGFR-TKIs therapy in patients with pTyr1068 expression compared to pTyr1068 negative ones (median PFS 7.0 months vs. 1.2 months, P < 0.001). Inversely, patients with pTyr1173 had a shorter PFS (4.8 months VS. 7.7 months, P = 0.016). In subgroup of patients with wild-type EGFR, pTyr1068 expression positive ones had a significantly prolonged PFS (4.2 months vs.1.2 months P < 0.001) compared with those without pTyr1068 expression. Sixteen patients with both wild-type EGFR and pTyr1068 who responded to EGFR-TKIs had median PFS of 15.6 months (95%CI: 7.28-23.9). Conclusion: pTyr1068 may be a predictive biomarker for screening the population for clinical response to EGFR-TKIs treatment; especially for patients with wild-type EGFR. © 2012 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84865442609	Influence of chemotherapy on EGFR mutation status among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer	Purpose: EGFR mutation is a predictor of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment response in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it remains unclear whether chemotherapy affects EGFR mutation status in NSCLC. We investigated the influence of chemotherapy on EGFR mutations in plasma and tumor tissues from patients with NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Samples were derived from three cohorts: one, 264 patients with advanced NSCLC who received first-line chemotherapy with matched pre- and postchemotherapy blood samples; two, 63 patients with stages IIb to IIIb disease with pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumor tissues; and three, 79 patients with advanced NSCLC who underwent palliative surgery. EGFR mutation status was determined and analyzed to reveal potential impact of chemotherapy. Results: In the first cohort, EGFR mutations were detected in 34.5% of the prechemotherapy plasma samples (91 of 264) but in only 23.1% of the postchemotherapy plasma samples (61 of 264). The decrease in EGFR mutation rate was statistically significant (P < .001). Patients whose EGFR mutations switched from positive to negative after chemotherapy had a better partial response (PR) than patients with a reverse change (P = .037). A similar decrease in EGFR mutation rate was observed in tissues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the second cohort (34.9% [22 of 63] v 19.0% [12 of 63]; P = .013). In the third cohort, 38.0% of the tumors (30 of 79) showed an intratumor heterogeneity of EGFR mutation, whereas 62.0% (49 of 79) were homogeneous, either with EGFR mutation or no mutation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that chemotherapy may reduce EGFR mutation frequency in patients with NSCLC, likely the result of a preferential response of subclones with EGFR mutations in tumors with heterogeneous tumor cell populations. © 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

84865845420	EML4-ALK Rearrangement and its clinical significance in chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: To identify the clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes of Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to investigate possible associations of NSCLC with echinoderm microtubule- associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Methods: Patients with stage IV NSCLC were screened for EML4-ALK rearrangement and EGFR mutations at the Peking University Cancer Hospital. EML4-ALK was identified using fluorescent in situ hybridization and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. EGFR mutations were determined using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: The incidence of EML4-ALK was 9.7% (11/113). Patients with EML4-ALK were more likely to present the EGFR wild type (WT; p = 0.033). Response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) was similar between patients with EML4-ALK rearrangement and EGFR mutation (33.3 vs. 46.9%, p = 0.451), but progression-free survival (PFS) was inferior compared to those with EGFR mutation (2.1 vs. 8.8 months, p = 0.032), and similar to patients with WT/nonrearrangement (2.1 vs. 2.2 months, p = 0.696; and general p = 0.023 between the three cohorts). Moreover, 2 patients with concurrent EML4-ALK and EGFR mutations had superior PFS after EGFR-TKI compared to patients with single EML4-ALK rearrangement. Conclusions: Patients with EML4-ALK conferred similar objective response rates after EGFR-TKI although inferior PFS compared to those with EGFR mutation. Coexistence of EML4-ALK and EGFR mutation might represent a separate NSCLC genotype. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84865712449	The detection of EGFR mutation status in plasma is reproducible and can dynamically predict the efficacy of EGFR-TKI	Background: The validity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in serum and plasma DNA as a surrogate of tumor tissue has been comprehensively explored. However, the concordance between peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples in EGFR mutation detection remains variable. The question as to whether real-time samples for EGFR mutation analysis are required before epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy remains unanswered. Methods: This study included two cohorts:(i) 822 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with primary tumor tissue and matched plasma samples at initial diagnosis; and (ii) 207 patients with advanced NSCLC who had plasma samples taken immediately before EGFR-TKI therapy, in which 157 cases had matched tumor tissues. Denaturing High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) determined EGFR mutation status. Results: Among a total of 822 patients with matched samples, the EGFR mutation rates were 36.3% and 32.1% in tissue and plasma samples, respectively. Concordance of EGFR mutation between two kinds of samples was 77.0% (631/822),with 63.5% (188/296) of accuracy of EGFR mutation in plasma DNA. In 207 advanced NSCLC patients who had plasma samples taken immediately before EGFR-TKI therapy, the objective response rate (ORR) after EGFR-TKI therapy was significantly higher in EGFR mutant patients than those in EGFR wild-type patients (51.4% vs. 22.6%, P < 0.001), regardless of the treatment lines of EGFR-TKI. In patients with two or more lines of EGFR-TKI therapy, EGFR mutation status in plasma samples, but not in tissues, was a predictor for progression-free survival (PFS) after EGFR-TKI therapy (mutant vs. wild-type: 10.1 months vs. 3.7 months, P = 0.038). Conclusions: An EGFR mutation test using plasma DNA samples was validated and reproducible. Obtaining real-time samples for EGFR mutation detection is critical in order to predict the outcomes of EGFR-TKI. © 2012 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty. Ltd.

0036923770	Analysis of prognostic factors of sequential treatment in 355 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Objective To investigate the prognostic factors of 355 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer for researching an individual treatment module. Methods From March 1988 to October 2000, after diagnosed by histology or cytology and staged by staging examinations, 355 novel advanced NSCLC patients (stage III, 134; stage IV, 221) were enrolled, who were given at least 2-cycle chemotherapy. Response rate and survival were observed and prognostic factors were analysed. Results Out of 355 patients, 101 got partial response and 147 had stable disease. Response rate was 28. 45%, and tumor control rate was 69.86%. Median survival duration was 16 months. The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 58.41%, 29.35%, 14.60% and 8.60%, respectively. In the patients with stage IV, median survival duration was 14 months, and 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 54.62%, 25.59%, 12.70% and 6.73%, respectively. COX multiple variable analysis showed that improved/stable ECOG score (P=0.0440) and chemotherapy (after second-line failure) combined with γ-IFN (P=0.0390) had prognostic significance. Conclusion Improvement of quality of life is quite important in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Combination with γ-IFN or TAM and radiotherapy of primary tumor may be helpful to improve the survival of patients with stage IV.

84871727314	Caged circular antisense oligonucleotides for photomodulation of RNA digestion and gene expression in cells	We synthesized three 20mer caged circular antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (R20, R20B2 and R20B4) with a photocleavable linker and an amide bond linker between two 10mer oligodeoxynucleotides. With these caged circular antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, RNA-binding affinity and its digestion by ribonuclease H were readily photomodulated. RNA cleavage rates were upregulated ∼43-, 25- and 15-fold for R20, R20B2 and R20B4, respectively, upon light activation in vitro. R20B2 and R20B4 with 2- or 4-nt gaps in the target RNA lost their ability to bind the target RNA even though a small amount of RNA digestion was still observed. The loss of binding ability indicated promising gene photoregulation through a non-enzymatic strategy. To test this strategy, three caged circular antisense oligonucleotides (PS1, PS2 and PS3) with 2′-OMe RNA and phosphorothioate modifications were synthesized to target GFP expression. Upon light activation, photomodulation of target hybridization and GFP expression in cells was successfully achieved with PS1, PS2 and PS3. These caged circular antisense oligonucleotides show promising applications of photomodulating gene expression through both ribonuclease H and non-enzyme involved antisense strategies. © 2012 The Author(s).

84871389466	Electrochemiluminescent assay for detection of extremely rare mutations based on ligase reaction and bead enrichment	The detection of rare mutations is particularly essential in many areas of biomedical research. Here, we report an ultrasensitive method to detect extremely rare point mutations based on electrochemiluminescent assay. The point mutation among large excess wild-type alleles is exclusively amplified through ligase detection reaction. The products corresponding to the amplification of mutant alleles are selectively captured by magnetic beads and then labeled with electrochemiluminescent substrates. Thus, point mutations with a percentage as small as 0.01% in the DNA population can be detected by electrochemiluminescent assay. Moreover, because the electrochemiluminescent signal of the mutation is proportional to the percentage of mutant alleles in the DNA population, the percentage of mutant alleles can be roughly accessed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84873887494	Detection and Clinical Significance of Intratumoral EGFR Mutational Heterogeneity in Chinese Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	Purpose: This study evaluated occurrence and potential clinical significance of intratumoral EGFR mutational heterogeneity in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods: Eighty-five stage IIIa-IV NSCLC patients who had undergone palliative surgical resection were included in this study. Of these, 45 patients carried EGFR mutations (group-M) and 40 patients were wild-type (group-W). Each tumor sample was microdissected to yield 28-34 tumor foci and Intratumoral EGFR mutation were determined using Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) and Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS). EGFR copy numbers were measured using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results: Microdissection yielded 1,431 tumor foci from EGFR mutant patients (group-M) and 1,238 foci from wild-type patients (group-W). The EGFR mutant frequencies in group-M were 80.6% (1,154/1,431) and 87.1% (1,247/1,431) using DHPLC and ARMS, respectively. A combination of EGFR-mutated and wild-type cells was detected in 32.9% (28/85) of samples by DHPLC and 28.2% (24/85) by ARMS, supporting the occurrence of intratumoral heterogeneity. Thirty-one patients (36.5%) were identified as EGFR FISH-positive. Patients harboring intratumoral mutational heterogeneity possessed lower EGFR copy numbers than those tumors contained mutant cells alone (16.7% vs. 71.0%, P<0.05). Among 26 patients who had received EGFR-TKIs, the mean EGFR mutation content was higher in patients showing partial response (86.1%) or stable disease (48.7%) compared with patients experiencing progressive disease (6.0%) (P = 0.001). There also showed relationship between progression-free survival (PFS) and different content of EGFR mutation groups (pure wild type EGFR, EGFR mutation with heterogeneity and pure mutated EGFR) (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Approximately 30% of patients presented intratumoral EGFR mutational heterogeneity, accompanying with relatively low EGFR copy number. EGFR mutant content was correlated with the response and prognosis of EGFR-TKIs. © 2013 Bai et al.

84875104148	Plasma catestatin level in patients with acute myocardial infarction and its correlation with ventricular remodelling	Background The evaluation of ventricular remodelling and functional recovery is essential in predicting the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Objective To determine the plasma catestatin level in patients with AMI, and investigate the association between plasma catestatin and heart function, and with left ventricular remodelling (LVR). Methods Fifty-eight consecutive patients who were admitted within 12 h of the onset of their ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction symptoms between 1 October 2009 and 30 June 2011 were prospectively recruited. Circulating catestatin was measured by ELISA. All patients underwent an echocardiography examination during the first week; 31 patients had a second echocardiography examination 3 months after the myocardial infarction. Results Plasma catestatin at the time of admission was significantly higher in patients than in normal controls. The level increased further in the first week after AMI. Three months after AMI, the plasma catestatin level of patients was comparable to that of normal controls. The plasma level of catestatin correlated with anterior AMI and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the acute stage. Compared with patients without LVR, those with LVR had significantly higher level of plasma brain natriuretic peptide on day 7 and a significantly higher level of plasma catestatin on admission and on days 3 and 7 (p=0.033, p=0.001, p=0.006, p=0.021, respectively). Conclusions Plasma catestatin levels were raised after AMI. An early increase of catestatin correlated with anterior AMI and LVEF. Plasma catestatin after the onset of AMI might be associated with the magnitude of progressive ventricular remodelling 3 months after AMI.

84874781893	Alterations in EGFR and Related Genes following Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Chinese Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	Introduction: Genetic aberrancies within epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway are associated with therapeutic outcomes of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the impact of chemotherapy on EGFR-related genes alterations has not been defined in NSCLC. Our study aims to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Neoadj-Chemo) on EGFR activating mutations and associated EGFR-TKIs resistance-related genes. Patients and Methods: Matched tumor samples were obtained retrospectively from 66 NSCLC patients (stages IIb-IIIb) corresponding to pre- and post- Neoadj-Chemo. EGFR mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and confirmed by Amplification Refractory Mutation System technology (ARMS), KRAS mutations, T790M mutation and c-MET amplification were identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), ARMS, and real-time PCR, respectively. Results: Before Neoadj-Chemo, EGFR mutations were identified in 33.3% (22/66) of NSCLC patients. Only 18.2% (12/66) of patients carried EGFR mutations after Neoadj-Chemo (p = 0.013). The median peak value of EGFR 19 exon mutations decreased non-significantly after Neoadj-Chemo. KRAS mutation rate decreased from 4.6% (3/66) to 3.0% (2/66) with Neoadj-Chemo. Although the overall percentage of patients exhibiting c-MET amplifications (6.1% [4/66]) did not change with Neoadj-Chemo, two patients transitioned from negative to positive c-MET amplification, and two patients reversed these changes post-Neoadj-Chemo. T790M mutations were absent from all samples. Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy tends to decrease the mutation frequency of EGFR mutation and downstream genes, which suggests that real-time samples analysis for genetic aberrancies within EGFR pathways have important value to delineate specific patient populations and facilitate individualized treatment. © 2013 Wang et al.

84875468205	Novel function of Trim44 promotes an antiviral response by stabilizing VISA	Virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) functions as a critical adaptor in the regulation of both the production of type I IFNs and the subsequent control of the innate antiviral response. In this study, we demonstrate that tripartite motif (Trim)44 interacts with VISA and promotes VISA-mediated antiviral responses. The overexpression of Trim44 enhances the cellular response to viral infection, whereas Trim44 knockdown yields the opposite effect. Trim44 stabilizes VISA by preventing VISA ubiquitination and degradation. These findings suggest that Trim44 functions as a positive regulator of the virus-triggered immune response by enhancing the stability of VISA.

84878471164	Quality of life (QoL) analyses from optimal (CTONG-0802), a phase III, randomised, open-label study of first-line erlotinib versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)	Background: The OPTIMAL study found that erlotinib improved progression-free survival (PFS) versus standard chemotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This report describes the quality of life (QoL) and updated PFS analyses from this study.Patients and methods: Chinese patients ≥18 years with histologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a confirmed activating mutation of EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation) received erlotinib (150 mg/ day; n = 82) or gemcitabine-carboplatin (n = 72). The primary efficacy end point was PFS; QoL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) questionnaire, Trial Outcome Index (TOI) and Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS).Results: Patients receiving erlotinib experienced clinically relevant improvements in QoL compared with the chemotherapy group in total FACT-L, TOI and LCS (P < 0.0001 for all scales). Erlotinib scored better than chemotherapy for all FACT-L subscales from baseline to cycles 2 and 4 (non-significant). In the updated analysis, PFS was significantly longer for erlotinib than chemotherapy (median PFS 13.7 versus 4.6 months; HR = 0.164, 95% CI = 0.105-0.256; P < 0.0001), which was similar to the previously reported primary analysis. Conclusion: Erlotinib improves QoL compared with standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. © The Author 2013.

84879784343	Intercalated combination of chemotherapy and erlotinib for patients with advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer (FASTACT-2): A randomised, double-blind trial	Background: The results of FASTACT, a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study, showed that intercalated chemotherapy and erlotinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. We undertook FASTACT-2, a phase 3 study in a similar patient population. Methods: In this phase 3 trial, patients with untreated stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by use of an interactive internet response system with minimisation algorithm (stratified by disease stage, tumour histology, smoking status, and chemotherapy regimen) to receive six cycles of gemcitabine (1250 mg/m

84880623879	Detection of rare point mutation via allele-specific amplification in emulsion PCR	It is essential to analyze rare mutations in many fields of biomedical research. However, the detection of rare mutations is usually failed due to the interference of predominant wild-type DNA surrounded. Herein we describe a sensitive and facile method of detecting rare point mutation on the basis of allele-specific amplification in emulsion PCR. The identification and selective amplification of rare mutation are accomplished in one-pot reaction. The allele-specific primers coupled on magnetic beads allow the exclusive amplification and enrichment of the mutant amplicons. The productive beads bearing mutant amplicons are subsequently stained with the fluorescent dyes. Thus, the rare point mutations with a percentage as low as 0.1%, can be detected by fluorescent analysis. The relative percentages of mutation among different samples can be roughly accessed by counting the fraction of fluorescent positive beads through flow cytometry. © © 2013 by the The Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

84883050731	Icotinib versus gefitinib in previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (ICOGEN): A randomised, double-blind phase 3 non-inferiority trial	Background: Icotinib, an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had shown antitumour activity and favourable toxicity in early-phase clinical trials. We aimed to investigate whether icotinib is non-inferior to gefitinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority trial we enrolled patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer from 27 sites in China. Eligible patients were those aged 18-75 years who had not responded to one or more platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), using minimisation methods, to receive icotinib (125 mg, three times per day) or gefitinib (250 mg, once per day) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, analysed in the full analysis set. We analysed EGFR status if tissue samples were available. All investigators, clinicians, and participants were masked to patient distribution. The non-inferiority margin was 1·14; non-inferiority would be established if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio (HR) of gefitinib versus icotinib was less than this margin. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01040780, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR-TRC-09000506. Findings: 400 eligible patients were enrolled between Feb 26, 2009, and Nov 13, 2009; one patient was enrolled by mistake and removed from the study, 200 were assigned to icotinib and 199 to gefitinib. 395 patients were included in the full analysis set (icotinib, n=199; gefitinib, n=196). Icotinib was non-inferior to gefitinib in terms of progression-free survival (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·67-1·05; median progression-free survival 4·6 months [95% CI 3·5-6·3] vs 3·4 months [2·3-3·8]; p=0·13). The most common adverse events were rash (81 [41%] of 200 patients in the icotinib group vs 98 [49%] of 199 patients in the gefitinib group) and diarrhoea (43 [22%] vs 58 [29%]). Patients given icotinib had less drug-related adverse events than did those given gefitinib (121 [61%] vs 140 [70%]; p=0·046), especially drug-related diarrhoea (37 [19%] vs 55 [28%]; p=0·033). Interpretation: Icotinib could be a new treatment option for pretreated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

84884275991	Negative regulation of Nmi on virus-triggered Type i IFN production by targeting IRF7	Viral infection causes host cells to produce type I IFNs, which play a critical role in viral clearance. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7 is the master regulator of type I IFN-dependent immune responses. In this article, we report that N-Myc and STATs interactor (Nmi), a Sendai virus-inducible protein, interacted with IRF7 and inhibited virus-triggered type I IFN production. The overexpression of Nmi inhibited the Sendai virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs, whereas the knockdown of Nmi promoted IFN production. Furthermore, the enhanced production of IFNs resulting from Nmi knockdown was sufficient to protect cells from infection by vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, Nmi was found to promote the K48-linked ubiquitination of IRF7 and the proteasomedependent degradation of this protein. Finally, an impairment of antiviral responses is also detectable in Nmi-transgenic mice. These findings suggest that Nmi is a negative regulator of the virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs that targets IRF7. Copyright © 2013 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

84883758401	PIK3CA mutation in Chinese patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma	Objective: To investigate PIK3CA mutation in Chinese patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and explore their relationship with clinicopathological profiles. Methods: Tumor samples from 123 cases of LSCC were included in this study. PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and 20 were screened by pyrosequencing and confirmed by clone sequencing or amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). Denaturing performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was employed for evaluation of EGFR mutation in exon 19, 21 and KRAS mutation. Results: PIK3CA mutations were found in 3 (2.4%) patients. The mutation type included E545K, E452Q and H1047R. Of these three patients, one coupled with EGFR mutation, and the other two coupled with PIK3CA amplification. All the three patients shared the same clinicopathologic characteristics: male, less than 60 years old, had smoke history, stage III and carried wild-type KRAS. Conclusions: The frequency of PIK3CA mutation is low in Chinese patients with LSCC. The mutational status of PIK3CA is not mutually exclusive to EGFR mutation. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

12244275736	Establishment and comparative genomic hybridization analysis of human esophageal carcinomas cell line EC9706	Objective: To establish a long-standing cell line of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in pursuit of a model for in vitro study of carcinogenesis. Methods: Small tissue blocks taken from resected specimens of esophageal cancer were cultured, and cell line EC9706 was established. The biologic properties of EC9706 were characterized. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on the cell line. Results: The growth curve of EC9706 was detected. The cell generation time was 26 hours. The plate colony forming efficiency is 91.9%, with the capacity of forming clones in soft agar. EC9706 cells show high tumorigenecity as indicated by the rapid regeneration of moderate-poor-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas after injection into nude mice. CGH analysis indicated copy number gains of 1p1, 1q2-4, 2p1,2q1,5p,7p14,7q21,11q1,15q2,20q and losses of 2p2,2q2,3p,4,9p,14,18,Xq. High-level gain of 5p was observed. Conclusion: Established cell line EC9706 can serve as a useful tool for studying the carcinogenesis of ESCC.
