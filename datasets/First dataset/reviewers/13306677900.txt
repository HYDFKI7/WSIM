15244349518	Improvement of muscle strength in osteoarthritic knee patients after intraarticular knee injection of hyaluronan	Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether the knee concentric and eccentric muscle strengths can be improved in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthritis after intraarticular hyaluronan injections. Design: A total of 25 patients with bilateral knee osteoarthritis and with a radiographic Ahlbäck grading scale of I or II participated in this study. One session of intraarticular knee injection of hyaluronan was given to both knees (weekly intraarticular knee hyaluronan injections for a total of 5 wks). Knee concentric and eccentric muscle strengths were recorded between 10 and 90 degrees of knee flexion. The recordings were done on two angular velocities, 80 and 240 degrees/sec. This study took place in a tertiary medical center with a gait laboratory and a KIN-COM isokinetic dynamometer. Results: An increase in concentric and eccentric muscle strength adjusted for body weight (P < 0.01) was observed in both knees, ranging between 5.1% and 27.7%. Conclysion: The decreased knee muscle contraction strength (concentric and eccentric) can be improved in knee osteoarthritis patients with an Ahlbäck grading scale of I or II after five weekly intraarticular knee injections of hyaluronan.

21844475372	Ultrasound stimulation of tendon cell proliferation and upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen	Therapeutic ultrasound has been widely used in sports-related tendon injuries. However, previous research has not examined the molecular mechanism of this therapeutic effect on tendon cell proliferation. This study was designed to determine the in vitro effect of ultrasound on the proliferation of tendon cells intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon. Furthermore, the existence of a correlation between this effect and the expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was also examined. Using cultured tendon cells, cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. The expression of PCNA protein in cells was evaluated by immunocytochemistry. The mRNA expression of PCNA was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A dose-dependent increase in the cellularity of tendon cells by either pulsed or continuous mode ultrasound was demonstrated by MTT assay (p = 0.044 for the pulsed mode; p = 0.004 for the continuous mode). Ten minutes of treatment achieved maximum cellularity compared to 5 min of treatment time (p = 0.010 for pulsed ultrasound; p = 0.004 for continuous ultrasound). Immunocyto-chemical staining revealed that ultrasound treated tendon cells were stained more strongly for PCNA than were control cells. Upregulation of PCNA at the mRNA level was also confirmed by RT-PCR. In conclusion, ultrasound stimulates tendon cell proliferation in a process that is probably mediated by the upregulation of PCNA. © 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

0031656505	Comparison of the mechanical properties of the heel pad between young and elderly adults	Objective: To compare the mechanical properties of the human heel pad between young arid aged adults. Design: A 7.5-MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer was incorporated into a specially designed device to measure the thickness of the heel pad under different loads. The heel pad was compressed with serial increments of 0.5kg to a maximum of 3kg and then relaxed sequentially. Then the load-displacement curve of the heel pad during a loading-unloading cycle was plotted. Participants: Convenience sample of 33 volunteers without heel problems, aged 18 to 78 years, were divided into young (less than 40 years) and elderly (older than 60 years) groups. Main Outcome Measures: Unloaded heel-pad thickness, compressibility index, stiffness, and energy dissipation ratio were calculated from the load- displacement curves. Student's t-test was used to compare the mechanical properties of the heel between these two groups. Results: The average unloaded heel-pad thickness was 1.76 ± .20cm in the young group and 2.01 ± .24cm in the elderly group (p < .001). The average compressibility index was 53.3% ± 7.7% in the young group and 61.3% ± 5.5% in the elderly group (p < .001). Energy dissipation ratio representing shock absorbency of the heel pad, was 23.7% ± 6.9% in the young group and 35.3% ± 10% in the elderly group (p < .001). Conclusion: Unloaded heel-pad thickness, compressibility index, and energy dissipation ratio of the heel pad were significantly increased in the elderly group, indicating loss of the elasticity of the heel pad. The loss of elasticity may be responsible for the higher incidence of heel injury in elderly individuals.

0031671044	Treatment of emotionalism with fluoxetine during rehabilitation	Emotionalism (emotional lability) is a common but distressing phenomenon that occurs frequently in individuals suffering cerebral vascular accidents and other brain diseases. Patients with emotionalism sometimes embarrass their families and themselves, becoming socially disabled despite normal physical function. At its worst, emotionalism interferes with rehabilitation programs, delays progress and sometimes makes these programs impossible. This paper reports the effect of fluoxetine in treating three patients with persistent emotionalism (2 cases following cerebrovascular accidents, 1 case following encephalitis). All 3 patients demonstrated dramatic improvement in emotionalism within 6 days of treatment. The severity, frequency and duration of each episode were reduced greatly. The treatment improved the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program, relieved patient and family embarrassment, and enabled patients to resume rapidly their previous lifestyle patterns. All patients reached the functional goals planned prior to the onset of rehabilitation. We conclude that fluoxetine is highly effective in treating the symptoms of emotionalism in all patients, and allows for recovery of both physical and social function.

0032440825	Isolated vertical gaze palsy secondary to pontine infarction - A case report	We report the case of a 62-year-old man with isolated vertical gaze palsy which resulted from a pontine infarct. He had sudden loss of upward and downward gaze ablility, accompanied with binocular vertical diplopia. Ophthalmic examinations showed normal visual acuity, with no limitation of the lateral gaze. The results of a forced duction test were, nevertheless, normal. No other neurological deficits were noted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an upper pontine infarction without a midbrain infarct. The patient's eye movements returned to normal and the vertical diplopia disappeared completely within a month after onset.

0032544325	Use of fluorescein labelled antibody and fluorescence activated cell sorter for rapid identification of mycobacterium species	A fluorescein labelled antibody (Ab)/Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS)-based assay was developed for detection of a wide range of mycobacterial species directly from bacterial culture and sputum specimens. The whole process could be completed within 3 hours and had a high specificity and sensitivity for cultured bacteria. The method was also shown to be applicable for direct identification from clinical specimens. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with an antibody to mycobacterium species offers the routine clinical laboratory a single convenient test for the detection of tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Depending on the availability of species-specific antibody, the identification of Mycobacterium to the species level can be achieved.

26444480183	Effects of aging on the plantar soft tissue properties under the metatarsal heads at different impact velocities	The plantar soft tissue properties under the metatarsal heads at different impact velocities in different age groups were measured. Each metatarsus of the left foot in healthy young adults (n = 9, 19 to 35 years old) and in healthy older persons (n = 10, 42 to 72 years old) was examined in vivo using a self-constructed loading-unloading device at low, medium and high impact status; the impact velocities of the device were about 2.5, 5 and 10 cm/s, respectively. The device comprised a 5- to 12-MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer, a miniature load cell and a fixation frame. From low to high impact status, the elastic modulus (E) in young adults significantly increased from about 300 kPa to about 500 kPa. However, the E in the older group did not show this trend. From low to high impact status, the energy dissipation ratio (EDR) of the metatarsus significantly increased from about 30% to about 60% in the young group and significantly increased from about 40% to about 70% in the older group. Most of the metatarsus in the older subjects had significantly greater E and EDR than those in the younger persons. © 2005 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

29344472631	Ultrasound-guided shoulder injections in the treatment of subacromial bursitis	Objective: To investigate the treatment effectiveness between ultrasound-guided and blind injection techniques in the treatment of subacromial bursitis. Design: A total of 40 patients with sonographic confirmation of subacromial bursitis were recruited into this study. These patients were divided into blind and ultrasound-guided injection groups. The shoulder abduction range of motion was compared before injections and 1 wk after the completion of injections in both groups. Results: The shoulder abduction range of motion before injection in the blind injection group was 71.03 ± 12.38 degrees and improved to 100 ± 18.18 degrees 1 wk after the injection treatments. However, the improvement did not reveal significant statistical differences (P > 0.05). The shoulder abduction range of motion before injection in the ultrasound-guided injection group was 69.05 ± 14.72 degrees and improved to 139.29 ± 20.14 degrees 1 wk after the injection treatments (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Ultrasound may be used as an adjuvant tool in guiding the needle accurately into the inflamed subacromial bursa. The ultrasound-guided injection technique can result in significant improvement in shoulder abduction range of motion as compared with the blind injection technique in treating patients with subacromial bursitis.

30344487284	Plantar fasciitis treated with local steroid injection: Comparison between sonographic and palpation guidance	Purpose. To compare the effectiveness of sonographically guided and palpation-guided steroid injection for the treatment of proximal plantar fasciitis. Patients and Methods. Twenty-five consecutive patients with unilateral proximal plantar fasciitis were recruited and randomly divided into a sonographically guided group (n = 12) and palpation-guided group (n = 13). Proximal plantar fascia was assessed with a 5- to 12-MHz linear-array transducer. Pain intensity was quantified using a "tenderness threshold" (TT) and a visual analog scale (VAS). Injection of 7 mg (1 ml) of betamethasone and 0.5 ml of 1% lidocaine into the inflamed proximal plantar fascia was performed under the guidance of sonography or palpation. Patients were evaluated clinically and sonographically before injection and at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 1 year after injection. VAS- and TT-measured pain intensity, thickness, and echogenicity of the proximal plantar fascia, as well as the recurrence of heel pain, were assessed. Results. Both VAS- and TT-measured levels of pain improved significantly after steroid injection in both groups (p < 0.001). Also, the thickness decreased significantly after injection (p < 0.01 in the palpation-guided group; p < 0.001 in the sonographically guided group). The number of patients with hypoechogenicity at the proximal plantar fascia decreased after steroid injection in both groups (p < 0.01 for both groups). The recurrence rate of plantar fasciitis in patients of the palpation-guided group (6/13) was significantly higher than that of the sonographically guided group (1/12) (p < 0.05). Conclusions. Steroid injection can be an effective way to treat plantar fasciitis, and injection under sonographic guidance is associated with lower recurrence of heel pain. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3042635980	Ultrasound guidance in caudal epidural needle placement	Background: This study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using ultrasound as an image tool to locate the sacral hiatus accurately for caudal epidural injections. Methods: Between August 2002 and July 2003, 70 patients (39 male and 31 female patients) with low back pain and sciatica were studied. Soft tissue ultrasonography was performed to locate the sacral hiatus. A 21-gauge caudal epidural needle was inserted and guided by ultrasound to the sacral hiatus and into the caudal epidural space. Proper needle placement was confirmed by fluoroscopy. Results: In all the recruited patients, the sacral hiatus was located accurately by ultrasound, and the caudal epidural needle was guided successfully to the sacral hiatus and into the caudal epidural space. There was 100% accuracy in caudal epidural needle placement into the caudal epidural space under ultrasound guidance as confirmed by contrast dye fluoroscopy. Conclusions: Ultrasound is radiation free, is easy to use, and can provide real-time images in guiding the caudal epidural needle into the caudal epidural space. Ultrasound may therefore be used as an adjuvant tool in caudal needle placement.

33745052436	Ultrasound stimulation of types I and III collagen expression of tendon cell and upregulation of transforming growth factor β	Traumatic tendon injuries are commonly treated with ultrasound. However, previous research has not examined the molecular mechanism of this therapeutic effect on collagen synthesis of tendon cells. This study was designed to determine the effect of ultrasound on the expression of type I and type III collagen of tendon cells intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon. Whether a correlation exits between this effect and the expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which enhances collagen synthesis, was also investigated. Tendon cells after ultrasound treatment and protein expression of types I and III collagen were determined by immunocytochemistry. The mRNA expressions of α1(I) procollagen, α1(III) procollagen, and TGF-β were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the concentration of TGF-β in conditioned medium was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunocytochemical staining revealed that ultrasound-treated tendon cells were stained more strongly for types I and III collagen than were control cells. Upregulation of procollagen α1(I) gene, procollagen α1(III) gene, and TGF-β at the mRNA level was confirmed by RT-PCR. A dose-dependent increase in the concentration of TGF-β in conditioned medium obtained from cells treated with ultrasound was demonstrated by ELISA assay (p = 0.043). In conclusion, ultrasound stimulates the expression of type I and type III collagen in a process that is likely mediated by the upregulation of TGF-β. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

33748993142	Ultrasonographic examination for inversion ankle sprains associated with osseous injuries	OBJECTIVE: The study attempted to evaluate the value of ultrasonography in determining the therapeutic strategy for patients with osseous injuries caused by ankle sprains. DESIGN: A 10-MHz compact linear-array ultrasound transducer was used to assess patients with inversion ankle sprains. Eleven female and 12 male patients who had fractures detected by sonograms were included in the study. All 23 patients underwent radiographic examination for identification of fractures. Bone scintigraphy was performed for those who had negative x-ray findings. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had distal fibular tip fractures, three patients had the fifth metatarsal base fractures, one patient had a talar neck fracture, and one patient had a navicular fracture. These fractures were all detected by ultrasonography and then proved even by radiography or by bone scans. All the 23 patients had anterior talofibular ligament injuries. Among these patients, 11 had anterior ankle-joint recess effusion, and two had additional anterioinferior tibiofibular ligament injuries. Six weeks of immobilization with the ankle fracture brace was prescribed for all the patients after the identification of fractures. Their ankle pain symptoms soon improved. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is valuable in evaluating tiny foot and ankle fractures and coexistent soft tissue injuries. It can guide the treatment for patients with osseous injuries caused by ankle sprains. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

33845636050	Altered energy dissipation ratio of the plantar soft tissues under the metatarsal heads in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A pilot study	Background: Foot ulceration occurs frequently on the plantar aspect of the metatarsal head region, in which the altered foot biomechanics has been mentioned as a contributor. This study attempted to compare the energy dissipation in the plantar soft tissue under the metatarsal head between type 2 diabetic patients and age-matched healthy subjects in vivo. Methods: The plantar soft tissues under the metatarsal heads in each left foot of 13 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and eight age-matched healthy subjects were measured with a loading-unloading device. The system comprised a 5-12 MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer and a load cell that operated at an impact velocity of about 5 cm/s. The stress-strain plot was derived by simultaneously recording the stress response and tissue deformation during a loading-unloading cycle. The energy dissipation ratio in all subjects could then be analyzed. Findings: Although only the plantar soft tissue under the fourth metatarsal head in the diabetic patients endured significantly greater energy (P = 0.035) than the healthy subjects, a trend of an increased energy dissipation ratio for the metatarsals in the diabetic patients was observed. Interpretation: The plantar soft tissue under the metatarsal head in the diabetic patients endures high dissipated energy during a simulating walking status in the study. The increased dissipated energy in the tissue may be responsible for the tissue breakdown in the diabetic patients. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A randomized controlled trial of modified constraint-induced movement therapy for elderly stroke survivors: changes in motor impairment, daily functioning, and quality of life. Objective: To examine the benefits of modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) on motor function, daily function, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in elderly stroke survivors. Design: Two-group randomized controlled trial, with pretreatment and posttreatment measures. Setting: Rehabilitation clinics. Participants: Twenty-six elderly stroke patients (mean age, 72y) with 0.5 to 31 months postonset of a first-ever cerebrovascular accident. Interventions: Twenty-six patients received either mCIMT (restraint of the unaffected limb combined with intensive training of the affected limb) or traditional rehabilitation for a period of 3 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), FIM instrument, Motor Activity Log (MAL), and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The FMA evaluated the severity of motor impairment; the FIM instrument and MAL reported daily function; and the SIS detected HRQOL. Results: The mCIMT group exhibited significantly greater improvements in motor function, daily function, and the physical domain of HRQOL than the traditional rehabilitation group. Patients in the mCIMT group perceived significantly greater percent of recovery after treatment than patients in the traditional rehabilitation group. Conclusions: These findings suggest mCIMT is a promising intervention for improving motor function, daily function, and physical aspects of HRQOL in elderly patients with stroke. The mCIMT was well tolerated by the elderly patients even though it is a rigorous training program. © 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

33847740943	Effects of celecoxib on migration, proliferation and collagen expression of tendon cells	Sports-related tendinopathy is commonly treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. Tendon healing requires migration of tendon cells to the repair site, followed by proliferation and synthesis of collagen. This study was designed to determine the effects of COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) on the migration, proliferation, and types I and III collagen expression of tendon cells intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon. Using cultured tendon cells, cell migration and proliferation were evaluated by transwell filter migration assay and by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, respectively. The mRNA expression of α1(I) procollagen and α1(III) procollagen were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expression of types I and III collagen were determined by immunocytochemistry. Dose-dependent celecoxib inhibition was demonstrated for migration of tendon cells through the transwell filter migration assay (p = 0.002). Dose-dependent celecoxib inhibition of tendon cell proliferation also was demonstrated by MTT assay (p = 0.004). However, both RT-PCR and immunocytochemical staining revealed that mRNA and protein expression of types I and III collagen remained constant after celecoxib treatment. In conclusion, celecoxib inhibits tendon cell migration and proliferation. However, the expression of types I and III collagen remained unchanged.

34447522032	Microchambers and macrochambers in heel pads: Are they functionally different?	The heel pad consists of a superficial microchamber layer and a deep macrochamber layer. This study highlights the different biomechanical behaviors between the microchamber and macrochamber layers using ultrasonography. The heel pad in each left foot of six healthy volunteers aged ∼25 yr old was measured with a device consisting of a 10-MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer and a load cell. The testing heels were loaded on the ultrasound transducer with a loading velocity of ∼0.5 cm/s and were withdrawn when the specified maximum stress (158 kPa) was reached. Unloaded tissue thickness, end-loaded thickness, deformation proportion, average deformation, and rebound rates and elastic modulus of the microchamber and macrochamber layers were assessed. The unloaded thickness of the microchamber layer was ∼30% of the macrochamber layer. The microchamber layer also had significantly less unloaded thickness, end-loaded thickness, mean deformation rate, mean rebound rate, and deformation proportion than the macrochamber layer. A significant difference between the unloaded and end-loaded thickness in the macrochamber layer was observed. The average soft tissue deformation rate was significantly different from the rebound rate in the microchamber layer. A similar trend was detected in the macrochamber layer. The elastic modulus of the microchamber layer was 450 kPa (SD 240), which was nearly 10 times of that in the macrochamber layer. In conclusion, ultrasound can identify the heterogeneous tissue properties of the heel pad. The macrochamber layer responds to loading with large deformation, and the microchamber layer has a high degree of tissue stiffness. Copyright © 2007 the American Physiological Society.

37349084204	The pentapeptide KTTKS promoting the expressions of type I collagen and transforming growth factor-β of tendon cells	Pentapeptide KTTKS, a subfragment of type I collagen propeptide, has been demonstrated to promote the extracellular release of collagen in fibroblasts. The present study was designed to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of KTTKS on type I collagen expression of rat Achilles tendon cells. Genes related to the upregulation of collagen expression such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and mRNA-binding proteins (mRBP) E1 and K were also examined. MTT assay revealed cell viability was not affected by KTTKS treatment. Protein expression of type I collagen was determined by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Results showed that KTTKS induced type I collagen expression of tendon cells. The mRNA expressions of α1(I) procollagen, TGF-β, mRBP K, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were also enhanced after KTTKS treatment. The stability of preexisting α1(I) procollagen mRNA after the addition of α-amanitin was analyzed by RT-PCR at 24 and 48 h. Results showed that KTTKS slowed down the degradation of α1(I) procollagen mRNA (p = 0.021). Furthermore, the concentration of TGF-β in conditioned medium, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, increased dose dependently in cells treated with KTTKS (p = 0.001). In conclusion, KTTKS promotes the expression of type I collagen and maintains its mRNA stability in a process associated with the upregulation of TGF-β. © 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

0032835050	Myofascial trigger points in the ipsilateral gluteal muscles associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis: A case report	Background: Pyogenic sacroiliitis is a relatively rare condition and the clinical manifestations may mimic more common diseases of the hip, lumbar spine and abdomen. It may also activate myofascial trigger points [MTrPs] in the gluteal and piriformis muscles but this has never been reported. Findings: A patient who suffered from pyogenic sacroiliitis with prominent MTrPs in the ipsilateral gluteal and piriformis muscles is presented. The clinical symptoms and signs mimic herniated intervertebral disc. After the MTrP injection therapy, this patient had obtained total pain relief and immediate restoration of the ambulation function. Antibiotics were administered to treat the underlying pyogenic sacroiliitis for long-term remission and all active MTrPs were inactivated during the period of remission. Conclusions: Myofascial trigger points in the gluteal and piriformis muscles may be activated by sacroiliitis. Any patient who had previous history of fever, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and complains of radiating pain to the lower leg and active MTrPs in the gluteal and piriformis muscles should be examined for possible sacroiliitis.

0033211498	The Mechanical Properties of the Heel Pad in Unilateral Plantar Heel Pain Syndrome	Plantar heel pain syndrome has been attributed to entrapment neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, calcaneal spurs, and stress fractures of the calcaneus. Although deteriorated mechanical properties of the heel pads may play an important role in the pathogenesis of heel pain syndrome, this has received little notice. In this study, a specially designed compression relaxation device with a push-pull scale and a 10-MHz linear array transducer was used to determine thickness of the heel pad under different loading conditions. Twenty consecutive patients aged 29 to 77 years with unilateral plantar heel pain syndrome were enrolled. Thickness of heel pad bilaterally was measured when the heel pad was compressed by serial increments of 0.5 kg to a maximum of 3 kg and then relaxed sequentially. The load-displacement curve during a loading-unloading cycle was plotted, and the compressibility index and energy dissipation ratio of the heel pad were calculated accordingly. Phase I displacement of the heel pad (from 0 to 1 kg load) on the painless side was greater than that on the painful side (P < 0.01), but there was no statistically significant difference between painless and painful sides in thickness of unloaded heel pads, compressibility index, or energy dissipation ratio (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the affected heel pad in plantar heel pain syndrome was stiffer under light pressure than the heel pad on the painless side. The changed nature of chambered adipose tissue in a painful heel pad may be responsible for its increased stiffness under light pressure.

38549130365	Sonographic features of soft tissue tumors in the hand and forearm	Background: High-resolution sonography is well suited for screening soft tissue masses because of its safety, low cost, and real-time, dynamic imaging. The purpose of our study was to elaborate the preoperative sonographic features of soft tissue tumors of the hand and forearm and the corresponding histologic results. Methods: Thirty-one soft tissue tumors of the hand and forearm were evaluated by ultrasound preoperatively. The mobility, consistency, echogenicity, margin, and color Doppler signal of each tumor were assessed. Dynamic study was also performed. The pathologic diagnosis was obtained after subsequent surgery. Results: The pathologic diagnoses of these soft tissue lesions were lipoma (n = 6), ganglion cyst (n = 6), neurilemmoma (n = 3), neurofibroma (n = 3), giant cell tumor (n = 10), tenosynovitis (n = 2), and malignant lymphoma (n = 1). An adjacent tendon or communication duct extending to the joint space could be found in most giant cell tumors and ganglion cysts; a traceable nerve could be found in most nerve sheath tumors. All benign tumors appeared well-defined. The only malignant tumor appeared ill-defined without a color Doppler signal. Conclusion: Sonography enables a reliable diagnosis of the cystic or solid nature of soft-tissue lesions, accurate estimation of the volume, and precise three-dimensional localization of the abnormality. Examiners should perform a dynamic examination and trace the adjacent structure to obtain more diagnostic clues.

33645737212	Ibuprofen inhibition of tendon cell migration and down-regulation of paxillin expression	Sports-related tendon injuries are commonly treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Tendon healing requires migration of tendon cells to the repair site, followed by proliferation and synthesis of the extraceuular matrix. This study was designed to determine the effect of ibuprofen on the migration of tendon cells intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon. Whether a correlation exits between this effect and the expression of paxillin, which is a positive regulator of cell spreading and migration, was also investigated. The migration of tendon cells was evaluated ex vivo by counting the number of initial outgrowths from the tendon explants and in vitro by transwell filter migration assay. The spreading of tendon cells in culture was also evaluated microscopically. The mRNA and protein expressions of paxillin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Dose-dependent ibuprofen inhibition was demonstrated on the migration of tendon cells both ex vivo, and in vitro. Similar inhibition was also observed on the spreading of tendon cells. Suppression of mRNA expression and protein level of paxillin was revealed by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. The expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK remained unchanged. In conclusion, ibuprofen inhibits tendon cell migration in a process that is probably mediated by the down-regulation of paxillin. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

0034541838	Ultrasound evaluation of plantar fasciitis	Objective: To investigate the sonographic features of plantar fasciitis (PF). Methods: High-resolution ultrasound was used to measure the thickness and echogenicity of the proximal plantar fascia and associated heel pad thickness for 102 consecutive patients with PF (unilateral: 81, bilateral: 21) and 33 control subjects Results: The mean thickness of the plantar fascia was greater on the symptomatic side for patients with bilateral and unilateral PF than on the asymptomatic side for patients with unilateral PF, and also control subjects (5.47±1.09, 5.61±1.19, 3.83±0.72, 3.19±0.43 mm, respectively, p<0.001). A substantial difference in thickness between the asymptomatic side of patients with unilateral PF and control subjects was also noted (p=0.001). The heel pad thickness was not show different between control subjects and patients with PF. The incidence of hypoechoic fascia was 68.3% (84/123). Other findings among the patients from our test group included intratendinous calcification (two cases), the presence of perifascial fluid (one case), atrophic heel pads (one case), and the partial rupture of plantar fascia (one case). Conclusion: Increased thickness and hypoechoic plantar fascia are consistent sonographic findings in patients exhibiting PF. These objective measurements can provide sufficient information for the physician to confirm an initial diagnosis of PF and assess individual treatment regimens.

80052666385	Ultrasound-guided injection techniques for the low back and hip joint	Ultrasound has become a useful adjunct to many procedures performed in rehabilitation medicine. It has the advantages of cost-effectiveness, lack of radiation, and readiness of use and the ability to make dynamic examinations possible compared with other imaging tools. Through dynamic examinations, needles can be guided accurately to the target sites to increase the success rates of aspiration and injection procedures. At present, ultrasound-guided caudal epidural, sacroiliac joint, piriformis muscle, and hip-joint injections are commonly practiced in rehabilitation medicine. Perhaps the only disadvantage of ultrasound-guided injection technique is the long learning curve that is required for the physiatrists to be well acquainted with the simultaneous manipulation of ultrasound transducers, placement of needles, and the correct interpretation of musculoskeletal sonographic images. This is the first of two review articles on ultrasound-guided injections. This article will review the selected ultrasound-guided injection techniques that are performed in the low-back and hip-joint areas. Sonographic images and schematic illustrations of these ultrasound-guided injection techniques will be shown. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

56349139175	Therapeutic ultrasound stimulation of tendon cell migration	Ultrasound is a therapeutic agent commonly used to treat sports-related tendinopathy. Tendon healing requires tendon cells migration to the repair site, followed by the proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix. This study was designed to determine the effect of ultrasound on migration of tendon cells intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon. Furthermore, the existence of a correlation between this effect and the expression of the contractile actin isoform, α-smooth muscle (SM) actin, which is associated with cell mobility, was also examined. Cell migration was evaluated by transwell filter migration assay. The mRNA expressions of α-SM actin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Dose-dependent ultrasound enhancement of tendon cells migration through the transwell filter was demonstrated. Using immunofluorescence stain for α-SM actin, the percentages of α-SM actin-positive cells of total cells, nonmigrated cells, and migrated cells on the filter were calculated. Ultrasound-treated cells which had migrated to the bottom side of the filter were more likely to express α-SM actin than migrated control cells and nonmigrated cells. However, there was no change of mRNA and protein expression of α-SM actin as well as expression of FAK and p-FAK. In conclusion, ultrasound stimulates tendon cell migration in association with increased expression of α-SM actin of tendon cells.

62149148816	Ciprofloxacin-mediated inhibition of tenocyte migration and down-regulation of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation	Ciprofloxacin-induced tendinopathy and tendon rupture have been previously described, principally affecting the Achilles tendon. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Tendon healing requires migration of tenocytes to the repair site, followed by proliferation and synthesis of the extracellular matrix. This study was designed to determine the effect of ciprofloxacin on migration of tenocytes intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon. Whether a correlation exits between this effect and the expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is a positive regulator of cell motility, was also investigated. Using cultured tenocytes, migration was evaluated by counting the number of initial cell outgrowth from the tendon explants and by transwell filter migration assay. Tenocyte spreading was also evaluated microscopically. The serum-induced protein expression and phosphorylation of FAK were determined by Western blot analysis in synchronized tenocytes. Ciprofloxacin dose-dependently inhibited tenocytes outgrowth from the explants ex vivo, migration of tenocytes through the transwell filter, as well as cell spreading in vitro. Suppression of FAK phosphorylation was revealed by Western blot analyses. In conclusion, ciprofloxacin inhibits tenocyte migration in a process that is probably mediated by inhibition of FAK phosphorylation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77949340411	Ultrasound as a Screening Tool for Proceeding With Caudal Epidural Injections	Chen CP, Wong AM, Hsu C-C, Tsai W-C, Chang C-N, Lin S-C, Huang Y-C, Chang C-H, Tang SF. Ultrasound as a screening tool for proceeding with caudal epidural injections. Objective: To study the anatomical structure of the sacral hiatus using ultrasound. Based on the sonographic images of the sacral hiatus, the feasibility of caudal epidural injection can then be assessed. Design: Case-controlled study. Setting: Rehabilitation outpatient clinic in a tertiary medical center. Participants: Patients (N=47; 20 women, 27 men) with low back pain and sciatica who were to receive caudal epidural injection treatments were recruited into this study. Interventions: Sonographic images of the sacral hiatus were obtained from all the patients. An ultrasound machine capable of examining musculoskeletal tissues with real-time linear-array ultrasound transducer was used to measure the distance between the anterior wall and posterior wall of the sacral hiatus (diameter of the sacral hiatus) and the distance between bilateral cornua. Main Outcome Measures: Diameter of the sacral canal and distance between bilateral cornua measured in millimeters. Results: The mean diameter of the sacral canal was measured to be 5.3±2.0mm in our recruited patients. The mean distance between bilateral cornua was measured to be 9.7±1.9mm. Caudal epidural injections failed in 7 patients. In these 7 patients, 4 had very small diameter of the sacral canal (1.6, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.5mm). In 1 man, sonographic images revealed a closed sacral hiatus (no sacral canal diameter can be measured). Two patients revealed flow of fresh blood into the syringe while checking for the escape of cerebrospinal fluid after the needles were inserted into the sacral canal. For safety reasons, steroid injections were not performed in these 2 patients. Conclusions: Ultrasound may be used as an effective screening tool for caudal epidural injections. Anatomic variations of the sacral hiatus can be clearly observed using ultrasound. Sonographic images indicating a closed sacral canal and sacral diameters ranging from 1.2 to 1.6mm may suggest a higher failure rate in caudal epidural injection. © 2010 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

77949495008	Ibuprofen upregulates expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-1, -8, -9, and -13 without affecting expressions of types I and III collagen in tendon cells	Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are widely used to treat sports-related tendon injuries or tendinopathy. This study was designed to investigate the effect of ibuprofen on expressions of types I and III collagen, as well as collagen-degrading enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-1, -2, -8, -9, and -13. Rat Achilles tendon cells were treated with ibuprofen and then underwent MTT[3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate mRNA expressions of types I and III collagen, MMP-1, -2, -8, -9, and -13. Protein expressions of types I and III collagen, MMP-1, -8, and -13 were determined by Western blot analysis. Gelatin zymography was used to evaluate the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9. The results revealed that ibuprofen upregulated expressions of MMP-1, -8, -9, and -13, both at mRNA and protein levels. There was no effect of ibuprofen on mRNA and protein expressions of types I and III collagen. Gelatin zymography revealed that the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 was upregulated after ibuprofen treatment. In conclusion, ibuprofen upregulates the expressions of collagenases including MMP-1, -8, -9, and -13 without affecting the expressions of types I and III collagen. These findings suggest a molecularmechanismpotentially accounting for the inhibition of tendon healing by ibuprofen. © 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

78649560907	Ciprofloxacin up-regulates tendon cells to express matrix metalloproteinase-2 with degradation of type i collagen	Ciprofloxacin-induced tendinopathy and tendon rupture have been previously described, principally affecting the Achilles tendon. This study was designed to investigate the effect of ciprofloxacin on expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2 as well as type I collagen in tendon cells. Tendon cells intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon were treated with ciprofloxacin and then underwent MTT (tetrazolium) assay. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis were used, respectively, to evaluate the gene and protein expressions of type I collagen, and MMP-2. Gelatin zymography was used to evaluate the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and -9. Reverse zymography was used to evaluate TIMP-1 and -2. Immunohistochemical staining for MMP-2 in ciprofloxacin-treated tendon explants was performed. Collagen degradation was evaluated by incubation of conditioned medium with collagen. The results revealed that ciprofloxacin up-regulated the expression of MMP-2 in tendon cells at the mRNA and protein levels. Immunohistochemistry also confirmed the increased expressions of MMP-2 in ciprofloxacin-treated tendon explants. The enzymatic activity of MMP-2 was up-regulated whereas that of MMP-9, TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 was unchanged. The amount of secreted type I collagen in the conditioned medium decreased and type I collagen was degraded after ciprofloxacin treatment. In conclusion, ciprofloxacin up-regulates the expressions of MMP-2 in tendon cells and thus degraded type I collagen. These findings suggest a possible mechanism of ciprofloxacin-associated tendinopathy. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

78650974746	Sonographic measurements of the thickness of the soft tissues of the interscapular region in a population of normal young adults	Background. To use sonography (US) to measure the interscapular soft-tissue thickness and to determine any correlation with anthropometric indices.Methods. Fifty-five healthy young adults (21 men and 34 women) with a mean age of 22.1 ± 3.0 years (range, 18-35) were enrolled. High-resolution US was used to measure the bilateral soft-tissue thickness near the medial border of the scapula. Anthropometric indices, including body weight, height, and circumferences of chest, waist, and hip, were also measured.Results. On the right side, mean values ± standard deviation for the thickness of the trapezius, rhomboid, and posterior serratus muscles in millimeters were 4.9 ± 1.0, 6.3 ± 2.3, and 3.5 ± 1.4, respectively, for men and 3.4 ± 0.8, 3.8 ± 1.7, and 2.2 ± 1.5, respectively, for women. The thickness of each muscle was significantly greater in men than in women (p < 0.05). For both genders, no significant differences in the soft-tissue thicknesses were found between both sides. Based on the anthropometric indices, body weight was the only significant contributor to the soft-tissue thickness.Conclusions. US is a practical tool for measuring soft-tissue thickness in the interscapular region. Body weight and soft-tissue thickness are closely associated. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79954610862	The promoting effect of pentadecapeptide BPC 157 on tendon healing involves tendon outgrowth, cell survival, and cell migration	Chang CH, Tsai WC, Lin MS, Hsu YH, Pang JH. The promoting effect of pentadecapeptide BPC 157 on tendon healing involves tendon outgrowth, cell survival, and cell migration. J Appl Physiol 110: 774-780, 2011. First published October 28, 2010; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00945.2010.-Pentadecapeptide BPC 157, composed of 15 amino acids, is a partial sequence of body protection compound (BPC) that is discovered in and isolated from human gastric juice. Experimentally it has been demonstrated to accelerate the healing of many different wounds, including transected rat Achilles tendon. This study was designed to investigate the potential mechanism of BPC 157 to enhance healing of injured tendon. The outgrowth of tendon fibroblasts from tendon explants cultured with or without BPC 157 was examined. Results showed that BPC 157 significantly accelerated the outgrowth of tendon explants. Cell proliferation of cultured tendon fibroblasts derived from rat Achilles tendon was not directly affected by BPC 157 as evaluated by MTT assay. However, the survival of BPC 157-treated cells was significantly increased under the H2O2 stress. BPC 157 markedly increased the in vitro migration of tendon fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner as revealed by transwell filter migration assay. BPC 157 also dose dependently accelerated the spreading of tendon fibroblasts on culture dishes. The F-actin formation as detected by FITC-phalloidin staining was induced in BPC 157-treated fibroblasts. The protein expression and activation of FAK and paxillin were determined by Western blot analysis, and the phosphorylation levels of both FAK and paxillin were dose dependently increased by BPC 157 while the total amounts of protein was unaltered. In conclusion, BPC 157 promotes the ex vivo outgrowth of tendon fibroblasts from tendon explants, cell survival under stress, and the in vitro migration of tendon fibroblasts, which is likely mediated by the activation of the FAK-paxillin pathway.

80051547986	Decreased proliferation of aging tenocytes is associated with down-regulation of cellular senescence-inhibited gene and up-regulation of p27	Symptomatic tendinopathy tends to be age-related. However, the molecular mechanisms of ageing and its effects on tenocyte proliferation and cell cycle progression are unknown. We examined tenocytes from Achilles tendons in rats from three age groups (young, 2 months; middle-aged, 12 months, and near senescence, 24 months). Tenocyte proliferation was assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA β-gal) staining was performed in all groups of tenocytes. mRNA and protein expression of cellular senescence-inhibited gene (CSIG) and p27 was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The results of MTT assay revealed that tenocyte proliferation decreased with age (p < 0.05). Cell cycle progression was arrested at G0/G1 phase in senescent tenocytes. More senescent tenocytes expressed SA β-gal than young tenocytes did. By RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, the gene and protein expression of CSIG was found to be down-regulated, whereas that of p27 was up-regulated with age. In conclusion, the proliferation of tenocytes declines with age and is associated with the down-regulation of CSIG and up-regulation of p27. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

80055090758	Fluoroquinolone-associated Tendinopathy	The fluoroquinolones (FQs) are used to treat a wide range of infections because of their excellent gastrointestinal absorption, superior tissue penetration and broad-spectrum activity. Recently, FQ-associated tendinopathy and tendon rupture have been reported, especially in the elderly and patients with diabetes and renal failure. However, these adverse effects do not appear to be widely known among physicians. Because of the frequent use of FQs in clinical practice, physicians should be aware of their potential for severe disability from tendon rupture. Achilles tendinopathy or rupture is among the most serious side effects associated with FQ use, with reports markedly increasing, especially with the use of ciprofloxacin. The histopathologic findings include degenerative lesions, fissures, interstitial edema without cellular infiltration, necrosis and neovascularization. There are possible molecular mechanisms accounting for FQ-associated tendinopathy. First, ciprofloxacin mediates inhibition of cell proliferation and G2/M cell cycle arrest in tendon cells by down-regulation of cyclin B and cyclin-dependent kinase 1. Second, ciprofloxacin inhibits the spead and migration of tenocytes by down-regulation of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. Third, ciprofloxacin enhances the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 with degradation of type I collagen. Management of FQ-associated tendinopathy includes immediate discontinuation of FQs, rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical modalities and eccentric strengthening exercise. Tendon rupture may require surgical intervention.

83255193883	Reproducibility of sonographic measurement of thickness and echogenicity of the plantar fascia	Background: To evaluate the intra- and interrater reliability of ultrasonographic measurements of the thickness and echogenicity of the plantar fascia. Methods: Eleven patients (20 feet), who complained of inferior heel pain, and 26 volunteers (52 feet) were enrolled. Two sonographers independently imaged the plantar fascia in both longitudinal and transverse planes. Volunteers were assessed twice to evaluate intrarater reliability. Quantitative evaluation of the echogenicity of the plantar fascia was performed by measuring the mean gray level of the region of interest using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer software. Results: Sonographic evaluation of the thickness of the plantar fascia showed high reliability. Sonographic evaluations of the presence or absence of hypoechoic change in the plantar fascia showed surprisingly low agreement. The reliability of gray-scale evaluations appears to be much better than subjective judgments in the evaluation of echogenicity. Transverse scanning did not show any advantage in sonographic evaluation of the plantar fascia. Conclusions: The reliability of sonographic examination of the thickness of the plantar fascia is high. Mean gray-level analysis of quantitative sonography can be used for the evaluation of echogenicity, which could reduce discrepancies in the interpretation of echogenicity by different sonographers. Longitudinal instead of transverse scanning is recommended for imaging the plantar fascia. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

81855194429	Effect of therapeutic ultrasound on tendons	Ultrasound is a therapeutic agent commonly used to treat sports-related musculoskeletal conditions, including tendon injuries or tendinopathy. Despite the widespread popularity of therapeutic ultrasound, few clinical studies have proved its efficacy. Several animal studies have been conducted to explore its effectiveness. In addition, a number of in vitro studies investigating the mechanisms underlying the ability of this physical modality to enhance tendon healing or to treat tendinopathy are in progress. There is strong supporting evidence from animal studies about the positive effects of ultrasound on tendon healing. In vitro studies have also demonstrated that ultrasound can stimulate cell migration, proliferation, and collagen synthesis of tendon cells that may benefit tendon healing. These positive effects of therapeutic ultrasound on tendon healing revealed by in vivo and in vitro studies help explain the physiologic responses to this physical modality and could serve as the foundation for clinical practice.

84855384413	Quantification of skeletal muscle fibrosis at different healing stages using sonography	Objectives-This study attempted to quantify the degree of muscle fibrosis on sonograms of injured gastrocnemius muscles at different healing stages in a rat model. Correlations between the quantifications and histologic assessments of the injured muscles were also determined. Methods-Sonograms and histologic findings of gastrocnemius muscle fibrosis were obtained during the second, third, and fourth weeks after surgically induced lesions in the right gastrocnemius muscles of 15 Wistar rats. The echo intensity, reflecting the degree of brightness on a sonogram, was divided into 256 gray levels instead of decibels. The mean echo intensity of each pixel in the region of interest was calculated as a summation of the echo intensities in all pixels divided by the pixel numbers in the region. To control individual variations among the rats, we calculated aKvalue, defined as the difference in the mean echo intensity between normal and affected muscles. Results-Significant correlations (r > 0.7; P < .05) between mean echo intensity andK values and the fibrous tissue percentage were identified. The mean echo intensity in the injured gastrocnemius muscles was significantly (P= .029) greater than that in the normal muscles 3 weeks after injury. In histologic assessments, muscle fibrosis was most prominent 3 weeks after injury. However, the differences in fibrosis at different healing stages were not significant. Conclusions-Mean echo intensity and K values can reflect the extent of fibrosis in affected muscles and may be valuable for quantifying muscle fibrosis in clinical practice. © 2012 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

84858278863	The effect of aging on migration, proliferation, and collagen expression of tenocytes in response to ciprofloxacin	Quinolone-induced tendinopathy or tendon rupture tends to be age-related. However, the synergistic effects of quinolone and aging on tenocytes remained to be explored. Tenocytes intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon from two age groups (young: 2 months; and near senescent (old): 24 months) were treated with ciprofloxacin. Tenocyte migration and proliferation were assessed by transwell filter migration assay and MTT (3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, respectively. Messenger RNA and protein expressions of types I and III collagen were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Transwell filter migration assay revealed that ciprofloxacin inhibited tenocytes migration, which became more significant in old tenocytes (p < 0.05). The results of MTT assay revealed that tenocytes proliferation decreased after ciprofloxacin treatment (p < 0.05), which also became more significant in old tenocytes. The results of RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that mRNA and protein expressions of type I collagen remained unchanged in either young or old tenocytes with ciprofloxacin treatment, whereas the expressions of type III collagen were down-regulated by ciprofloxacin, which was more significant in old tenocytes. In conclusion, aging potentiated the ciprofloxacin-mediated inhibition of migration, proliferation, and expression of type III collagen of tenocytes. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Seven amputated lower limbs from six diabetic patients constituted the experimental group and one amputated lower limb from a diabetic patient served as the control. The limbs were placed in a fixation platform. A 5-12 MHz linear-array ultrasound transducer controlled by a stepping motor was used to load and unload tested heels. The loading-unloading velocity was 6 mm/s and the maximum loading stress was 178 kPa. Loading-unloading tests were performed before and after 1 mL HA injections into heels in the experimental group. The control limb underwent the same test before and after 1 mL NS injection. The unloaded thickness and Young's modulus of the macrochambers, microchambers and heel pads were determined before and after the interventions. The unloaded thickness of the macrochambers and the heel pad increased significantly (p = 0.012) after HA injection. The Young's modulus of the macrochambers decreased nonsignificantly after HA injections. Similar thickness and tissue stiffness changes were observed in the control limb.

84866153642	The effects of aging on quantitative sonographic features of rotator cuff tendons	Purpose.: Grayscale analysis is a practical, objective, and easy way to quantify echogenicity during ultrasonography. The purpose of the current study was to measure the changes in thickness and echogenicity that result from aging of the rotator cuff and long head of the biceps tendons. Methods.: The study comprised 45 volunteers, aged between 20 and 84 years and without history of shoulder pain. Participants were divided into three groups: young, middle-aged, and old. All subjects underwent standard ultrasonography of both shoulders. Tendon thickness and tear were recorded, and images in both transverse and longitudinal scans were taken for grayscale analysis. To reduce the attenuation effect from skin and subcutaneous fat, we used the ratio of echogenicity of the tendon to that of the reference muscle and compared the tendon echogenicity among the different age groups. Sonographic findings were also correlated with age. Results.: The supraspinatus tendon was significantly thicker in elderly participants and this was positively correlated with age. Moreover, the echogenicity ratio of the supraspinatus tendon decreased in the elderly group and showed a negative correlation with age. There was a higher prevalence of supraspinatus tendon tears in the older participants. Conclusions.: Our results indicate that supraspinatus tendons became thickened, hypoechogenic, and more likely to tear with age. The study presents a simple and useful method to investigate the echogenicity of the rotator cuff quantitatively. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0037229037	Inhibition of tendon cell migration by dexamethasone is correlated with reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin gene expression: A potential mechanism of delayed tendon healing	Local corticosteroid injection is commonly used to treat sports-related tendon injuries. However, isolated cases of tendon rupture following injection suggest that this treatment may impair the healing process. Tendon healing requires the migration of tendon cells to the repair site, followed by the proliferation and synthesis of the extracellular matrix. This study was designed to determine the effect of dexamethasone on the migration of tendon cells intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon at concentrations similar to those typically used for local injection treatment. Furthermore, the existence of a correlation between this effect and the expression of the contractile actin isoform, α-smooth muscle (SM) actin, which is associated with cell motility, was also examined. Using cultured tendon cells, migration was evaluated by counting the number of initial outgrowths from the tendon explants and by transwell filter migration assay. The distribution and assembly of α-SM actin were assessed by immunocytochemistry. The mRNA and protein expressions of α-SM actin were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Dose-dependent dexamethasone inhibition was demonstrated for both tendon cells outgrowth from the explants, ex vivo, and migration of tendon cells through the transwell filter, in vitro. Immunocytochemical staining revealed significant decreases in both the amount and assembly of α-SM actin in cells. Suppression of mRNA expression and protein level of α-SM actin was revealed from RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. In conclusion, dexamethasone inhibits tendon cell migration that is correlated with decreased gene expression of α-SM actin. © 2003 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

84871709325	Aging is associated with increased activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in tenocytes	Abstract. Background: Most tendon pathology is associated with degeneration, which is thought to involve cyclic loading and cumulative age-related changes in tissue architecture. However, the association between aging and degeneration of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tendons has not been investigated extensively. Methods. We examined tenocytes from Achilles tendons taken from rats of three different ages (2, 12, and 24 months). Tenocyte viability was assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the levels of mRNAs that encode type-I collagen, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Gelatin zymography was used to evaluate the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and -9. Furthermore, the concentration of TGF-β1 in conditioned medium was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The results of the MTT assay showed that the number of viable tenocytes decreased with age. No differences were observed in the levels of mRNAs that encode type-I collagen and TGF-β1 among the three age groups, and the TGF-β1 concentration did not change with age. However, mRNAs that encode MMP-2 and -9 were significantly more abundant in tenocytes from the aging group, and gelatin zymography revealed that the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and -9 also increased significantly with age. Furthermore, as compared with young group, mRNAs that encode TIMP-1 and -2 were significantly decreased in tenocytes from the aging group. Conclusions: Activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in tenocytes increase with age. This might provide a mechanistic explanation of how aging contributes to tendinopathy or tendon rupture with age. © 2013 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84880777440	Effectiveness of device-assisted ultrasound-guided steroid injection for treating plantar fasciitis	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of device-assisted ultrasound-guided steroid injection for treating plantar fasciitis. DESIGN: An ultrasound-guided injection device designed with space for securing a transducer and syringe was used to guide steroid injection. Patients with unilateral plantar fasciitis were enrolled and randomly divided into device-assisted ultrasound-guided and palpation-guided groups. Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale and tenderness threshold. Ultrasound and pain intensity evaluations were performed before injection and at 3 wks and at 3 mos postinjection. Betamethasone (7 mg) and 1% lidocaine (0.5 ml) were injected into the inflamed plantar fascia. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients who received either device-assisted ultrasound-guided or palpation-guided injection had significantly lower visual analog scale scores (P < 0.001) and higher tenderness threshold (P < 0.01) postinjection. However, the device-assisted group had higher tenderness threshold (9.02 ± 1.38 vs. 7.18 ± 2.11 kg/cm

However, the mechanism underlying diabetic tendinopathy is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of high glucose concentrations on the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases, type I collagen, and type III collagen in tendon cells. Methods. Tendon cells from rat Achilles tendons were treated with 6 mM, 12 mM, and 25 mM glucose, and then cell proliferation was evaluated by the 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-13 and type I and type III collagen was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was measured by gelatin zymography. Results: The MTT assay results showed that the glucose concentration did not affect tendon cell proliferation. The results of the real-time PCR assay revealed that the mRNA expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13 was up-regulated by treatment with 25 mM glucose, whereas the mRNA expression of type I and III collagen was not affected. Gelatin zymography showed that 25 mM glucose increased the enzymatic activity of MMP-9. Conclusions: High glucose concentration up-regulates the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13 in tendon cells, which may account for the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic tendinopathy. © 2013 Tsai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84893609402	Changes of synovial fluid protein concentrations in supra-patellar bursitis patients after the injection of different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid	Knee pain is commonly seen in orthopedic and rehabilitation outpatient clinical settings, and in the aging population. Bursitis of the knee joint, especially when the volume of the synovial fluid is large enough, can compress and distend the nearby soft tissues, causing pain in the knee joint. Out of all the bursae surrounding the knee joint, supra-patellar bursitis is most often associated with knee pain. Treatment strategies in managing supra-patellar bursitis include the aspiration of joint synovial fluid and then followed by steroid injection into the bursa. When supra-patellar bursitis is caused by degenerative disorders, the concept of viscosupplementation treatment may be effective by injecting hyaluronic acid into the bursa. However, the rheology or the changes in the concentrations of proteins (biomarkers) that are related to the development of bursitis in the synovial fluid is virtually unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the concentration changes in the synovial fluid total protein amount and individual proteins associated with supra-patellar bursitis using the Bradford protein assay and western immunoglobulin methods. A total of 20 patients were divided into two groups with 10 patients in each group. One group received the high molecular weight hyaluronic acid product of Synvisc Hylan G-F 20 and the other group received the low molecular weight hyaluronic acid product of Hya-Joint Synovial Fluid Supplement once per week injection into the bursa for a total of 3. weeks. Significant decreases in the synovial fluid total protein concentrations were observed after the second dosage of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid injections. Apolipoprotein A-I, interleukin 1 beta, alpha 1 antitrypsin, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 proteins revealed a trend of decreasing western immunoblotting band densities after hyaluronic acid injections. The decreases in apolipoprotein A-I and interleukin 1 beta protein band densities were significant in the high molecular weight hyaluronic acid injection group. Transthyretin, complement 5, and matrilin 3 proteins revealed a trend of increasing western immunoblotting band densities after hyaluronic acid injections. Transthyretin revealed significant increases in protein band densities in both the high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid injection groups. This study may provide the rationale for targeting several biomarkers associated with lipid transport, inflammation, and anti-aging as possible disease modifying therapies for the treatment of supra-patellar bursitis and even degenerative joint disorders. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84896696775	Gender-related effect of aging on the sonographic appearance of plantar fascia	Objectives: To investigate the association between demographic variables [especially age] and the sonographic appearance of the plantar fascia [PF]. Methods: Twenty-six healthy volunteers [52 feet, age 24-79 years] without inferior heel pain were recruited. The thickness of the PF of the participants was measured in sonographic examination. The mean grey level in the region of interest in the sonogram of each PF was calculated using image processing software. Pearson's correlation and stepwise regression analyses were performed between demographic variables and sonographic measures. Results: The mean thickness of the PF was 0.319 ± 0.059 cm for men and 0.309 ± 0.093 cm for women. Stepwise regression analysis showed that age is an independent predictor of the thickness of the PF, and age and gender are independent predictors of echogenicity of the PF. Pearson's correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations between age and thickness of the PF [r = 0.538] and between gender [male/female = 0/1] and echogenicity of the PF [r = 0.437]. A negative correlation between age and echogenicity of the PF [r = -0.344] was also shown. We divided the subjects into two gender-based groups and found significant correlations between age and sonographic measures only in the female group. Conclusions: The thickness of the PF increases and the echogenicity of the PF decreases with age. Although the echogenicity of the PF is higher in women than in men, the PF of women shows a greater association with aging. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84903757542	Low-level laser irradiation stimulates tenocyte proliferation in association with increased NO synthesis and upregulation of PCNA and cyclins	Low-level laser therapy is commonly used to treat tendinopathy or tendon injury. Tendon healing requires tenocyte migration to the repair site, followed by proliferation and synthesis of the extracellular matrix. There are few evidence to elucidate that low-level laser promote tenocyte proliferation. This study was designed to determine the effect of laser on tenocyte proliferation. Furthermore, the association of this effect with secretion of nitric oxide (NO) and the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclins D1, E, A, and B1 was investigated. Tenocytes intrinsic to rat Achilles tendon were treated with low-level laser (660 nm). Tenocyte proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay and immunocytochemistry with Ki-67 stain. NO in the conditioned medium was measured by ELISA. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the protein expressions of PCNA and cyclins D1, E, A, and B1. The results revealed that tenocytes proliferation was enhanced dose dependently by laser. NO secretion was increased after laser treatment. PCNA and cyclins E, A, and B1 were upregulated by laser. In conclusion, low-level laser irradiation stimulates tenocyte proliferation in a process that is mediated by upregulation of NO, PCNA, and cyclins E, A, and B1. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84912073103	Pentadecapeptide bpc 157 enhances the growth hormone receptor expression in tendon fibroblasts	BPC 157, a pentadecapeptide derived from human gastric juice, has been demonstrated to promote the healing of different tissues, including skin, muscle, bone, ligament and tendon in many animal studies. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully clarified. The present study aimed to explore the effect of BPC 157 on tendon fibroblasts isolated from Achilles tendon of male Sprague-Dawley rat. From the result of cDNA microarray analysis, growth hormone receptor was revealed as one of the most abundantly up-regulated genes in tendon fibroblasts by BPC 157. BPC 157 dose- and time-dependently increased the expression of growth hormone receptor in tendon fibroblasts at both the mRNA and protein levels as measured by RT/real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The addition of growth hormone to BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts dose- and time-dependently increased the cell proliferation as determined by MTT assay and PCNA expression by RT/real-time PCR. Janus kinase 2, the downstream signal pathway of growth hormone receptor, was activated time-dependently by stimulating the BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts with growth hormone. In conclusion, the BPC 157-induced increase of growth hormone receptor in tendon fibroblasts may potentiate the proliferation-promoting effect of growth hormone and contribute to the healing of tendon.

84912564711	The "Bodily Pain" scale of the short form-36 questionnaire is a predictor of outcome in patients who receive ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for plantar fasciitis - A preliminary study	Objectives: Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection is an effective treatment for plantar fasciitis. We aimed to examine whether the eight scales of the Short Form-36 [SF-36] quality of life questionnaire could predict outcome of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for plantar fasciitis. Methods: Sixteen patients [mean age 55.7 years] with unilateral plantar fasciitis received ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections and all evaluations. The SF-36 questionnaire was administered and tenderness threshold [TT] was measured before injection, at 3 weeks, and at 3 months post-injection. Differences in the eight SF-36 scales among the three time points were examined. Furthermore, baseline measurements and changes in the SF-36 scales were examined for their association with changes in TT at 3 weeks and 3 months post-injection. Results: The scale "bodily pain" [BP] decreased significantly after injection [baseline versus 3 months post-injection: 46.25±11.73 versus 63.06±18.26; p=0.036]. Baseline BP correlated with change in TT at 3 weeks [r=-0.554, p=0.026]. The change in BP correlated with change in TT at 3 weeks [r=0.594, p=0.015] and at 3 months [r=0.536, p=0.032]. Conclusion: The BP scale can be used to predict the outcome of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for plantar fasciitis. Less initial bodily pain leads to less improvement in objective inferior heel tenderness.

0346667106	Clinical trial of acupuncture for patients with spinal cord injuries	Objective: To examine whether electrical acupuncture therapy through adhesive surface electrodes and concomitant auricular acupuncture therapy could improve the neurologic or functional recovery in acute traumatic spinal cord injury patients. Design: A total of 100 acute traumatic spinal cord injury patients with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment grading of A and B were recruited into this study. They were randomly divided into the acupuncture and control groups. In the acupuncture group, electrical acupuncture therapy via the adhesive surface electrodes were applied to the bilateral Hou Hsi (SI3) and Shen Mo (B62) acupoints. In auricular acupuncture, four acupoints related to the spinal cord were selected for stimulation at the antihelix, helix, and lower portion of the ear-back areas. Acupuncture therapy was initiated early in the emergency room setting or soon after spinal surgical intervention. Rehabilitation therapy was also provided to the patients during acupuncture therapy. In the control group, only rehabilitation therapy was provided to the patients. Neurologic and functional scores were assessed during the time of admission, hospital discharge, and 1-yr postinjury follow-up. Results: There were significant improvements in neurologic (sensory and motor), functional, and FIM™ scores in the acupuncture group compared with the initial admission period when assessed during the time of hospital discharge and the 1-yr postinjury follow-up. A greater percentage of patients in the acupuncture group recovered to a higher ASIA impairment grading. Conclusion: The use of concomitant auricular and electrical acupuncture therapies, when implemented early in acute spinal cord injury, can contribute to significant neurologic and functional recoveries.
