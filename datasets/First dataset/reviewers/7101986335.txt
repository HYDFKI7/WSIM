Herein, we developed a fully biocompatible approach for patterning of cells on the PDMS surface by hydrophobin (HFBI) and collagen modification. HFBI and collagen were immobilized on the PDMS surface one after another by using copper grids as a mask. HFBI self-assembly on PDMS surface converted the PDMS surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, which facilitated the following immobilization of collagen. Collagen had admirable ability to support cell adhesion and growth. Consequently, the HFBI/collagen-modified PDMS surface could promote cell adhesion and growth. What is more, the native PDMS surface did not support cell adhesion and growth. Patterning of cells was achieved by directly culturing 293T cells (the human embryonic kidney cell line) on the PDMS surface patterned with HFBI/collagen. Further studies by means of gene transfection experiment in vitro showed that the patterned cells were of good bioactivities. Herein, the biocompatible preparation of cell patterns on the PDMS surface could be of many applications in biosensor device fabrication. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to improve the sensitivity and the stability, the sensor chip was fabricated on ceramic substrate, and using lift off process to pattern the heater and sensing detectors. The heating and sensing elements are Ti/Pt resistors and with the temperature coefficient is 3050ppm, Ti layer was introduced to improve the adhesion between Pt layer and the front surface of ceramic substrate. Direct Chip Attach(DCA) packaging was adopted to protect the chip and the circuits below it. The Constant Temperature Difference(CTD) control mode is introduced to detect high velocity flow, while calorimetric operation mode is used for low flow velocity measurement. The sensor is designed to operate in the two modes at the same time, and their outputs are detected by a Micro Controller Unit(MCU). Because the calorimetric control mode presents low zero point drift, it is used to calibrate the zero point of CTD control mode. The intelligent sensor system was tested in flow tunnel, if the calorimetric control mode shows the flow velocity less than 20m/s, the MCU computes the difference of the two modes outputs and gets a calibration voltage to change the zero point of the CTD control mode. When the calorimetric control mode shows the flow velocity higher than 20m/s, the last calibration zero point of the CTD control mode is considered as a accurate value. After calibration, the relative error of flow velocity measurement is less than 5% from 0m/s to 60m/s. © 2009 IEEE.

80053126077	Detecting magnetic field direction by a micro beam operating in different vibration modes	A new method to detect the magnetic field direction by using a silicon structure is presented in this paper. The structure includes a micro beam and an in-plane coil electrode. When the electrode under a magnetic field is applied with an alternating current, the micro beam is actuated under the effect of the Lorentz forces. Magnetic fields of different directions cause different vibration profiles. The direction of the magnetic field is obtained by measuring the vibration amplitudes of the micro beam, which is driven to work at first- and second-order resonant modes. A micro structure has been fabricated using the bulk micromachined silicon process. A laser Doppler vibrometer system is implemented to measure the vibration amplitudes. The experimental results show that the amplitude of the structure, which depends on the different modes, is a sine or cosine function of the angle of the magnetic field. It agrees well with the simulation result. Currently a resolution of 10° for the magnetic field direction measurement can be obtained using the detecting principle. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

80055039868	A fully packaged CMOS interdigital capacitive humidity sensor with polysilicon heaters	This paper presents a fully packaged CMOS interdigital capacitive humidity sensor with polysilicon heaters. The sensor was fabricated with the industrial standard CMOS process and the MEMS postprocessing step. Polyimide was used as the sensing material for its good linearity. To enlarge the depth of the recesses between the interdigital electrodes, the polysilicon heater was placed under the Al electrode and also the passivation between the interdigital electrodes was partly etched. As a result, thicker polyimide can be deposited between the Al electrodes and thus the sensitivity of the sensor can be improved. The etching resistant passivation between Al electrodes and polyimide was used to ensure the reliability of the sensor. To put it into practical use, the sensor was fully packaged, and by using the polysilicon heaters, both the hysteresis and the recovery time of the sensor could be greatly improved. The packaged humidity sensor was measured to show a good linearity and repeatability over the whole testing range. © 2006 IEEE.

83455195333	Application of silicon pressure sensor to nerve root retractor	For reducing or avoiding the iatrogenic nerve function injury due to the excessive retraction for a nerve root during a spine surgery, a silicon piezoresistive pressure sensor was employed in the nerve root retractor to quantitate the retraction for the nerve root and to improve the performance of spine surgery. To measure the pressure exerted upon the retracted nerve root, a pressure sensor was adhered to the nerve engagement surface of a nerve retractor. The rabbit and goat experiments were performed on nerve root retraction by different time durations and pressure extendings, while the nerve function injury was assessed by monitoring the electromyogram responses. Experiments show when the increase of average pressure is about 14 kPa, the change rates of latency and amplitude are 1.12% and 21.21%, respectively, which reveals that the retracted nerve root axonal is damaged. Furthermore, loading similar average pressare, the more the retraction time applies to the nerve root, the worse the nerve function is hurt. In conclusion, the relationship between the pressure exerted on the nerve root and the corresponding neuromuscular responses has been founded via the results of animal experiments, which shows the degree of nerve root impairment is positively correlated with the duration and extent of nerve root retraction, and can be used in the study of retraction threshold values.

0037051209	Study of grain growth of polysilicon formed by nickel-induced-lateral-crystallization of amorphous silicon and subsequent high temperature annealing	In this work, nickel induced lateral crystallization (NILC) of amorphous silicon at various temperatures has been investigated in detail. The crystallized film was characterized by micro Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Large leaf-like grains with a length on the order of 10-20 μm and a width on the order of 1-5 μm have been observed by NILC and subsequent heat treatment at 1000 °C. AFM measurements show that the crystallized film was combined by 'smooth' and 'rough' regions. Further TEM research reveals that the 'smooth' region has larger size and fewer defects, which may be a single grain with preferential 〈110〉 orientation. For the 'rough' region, many defects, dislocations and mismatches are found in it. It seems to be mixed by randomly oriented smaller grains. Further high temperature annealing can reduce the defects at the grain boundary and enlarge the grains. It was found that the NILC rate depends strongly on the annealing temperature. A maximum rate occurs at approximately 625 °C, the influences of other factors such as Ni pattern, amount of Ni, annealing time, etc., on the NILC rate are also investigated. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037113115	Investigation of grain formation and growth in nickel-induced lateral crystallization process	In this article a simple method to reveal the direction of grain growth in nickel-induced lateral crystallization (NILC) is demonstrated. This method uses 6000Å amorphous silicon film as the starting layer which is then crystallized by nickel. Then silicon dry etching is used to delineate the grains and the condition of grain growth in NILC is clearly shown. It is found that the grain growth directionality and uniformity are greatly dependent on the relative position and the shape of the nickel source origin. The optical microscope shows that the grain formation is in triangular shape. The structural condition is confirmed by an atomic force microscope which is used to scan over the grain. A mechanism of grain growth related to the movement of nickel silicide chains is proposed. Performances of n-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors fabricated on different positions of the crystallized region are compared and it is found that the grain growth directionality shown after this grain-revealing method has a high correlation with the quality of the silicon in that region. © 2002 American Institute of Physics. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.

One chip is thermal anemometer, which operates in Constant Temperature Difference (CTD) mode, another is calorimetric wind sensor, which operates in Constant Power (CP) mode. Both chips are designed to work at the same time. In the low wind speed (from 0 to 10m/s for example), the CP mode chip can detect accurate wind velocity and direction with less temperature drift, which is used as a reference for calculating the offset voltage of the CTD mode chip caused by the variation of ambient temperature; meanwhile the data are also as the output of the system. So compared with single chip wind sensors, the dual chips wind system can detect both low and high wind speed with higher accuracy and less temperature drift. The testing results indicate that the accuracy of low wind speed under 10m/s is ±0.3m/s and that of high speed from 10m/s to 40m/s is ±0.6m/s, and the measurement span is above 40m/s.

Since the proposed RF MEMS switch is actuated electrothermally, it can be operated at an extremely low operation voltage of 0.16 V. In this switch, two series switches are cascaded by a quarter wavelength section of transmission line suspended over the trench of the substrate to form a series-shunt configuration according to the principle of impedance transforming. By using a single bidirectional thermal MEMS actuator to control the signal, the switch provides higher reliability when through high power microwave signal. The measured results show that an insertion loss of 1.2 dB or better is achieved from DC-40 GHz. The isolation is -50 dB at 5 GHz, -45 dB at 20 GHz and -60 dB at 35 GHz. What is more, this switch also exhibits high linearity, and high power handing for DC-40-GHz applications. In the switch OFF state, self-actuation does not happen up to the input power of 40 dBm at 1 GHz. In the switch ON state, no significant insertion loss variations or problems in the contacts, due to the RF power, can be observed below 31 dBm input power. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
