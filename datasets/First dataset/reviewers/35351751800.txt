84927727857	Time-integrated and time-dependent angular analyses of B → J/ψKπ: A measurement of cos2β with no sign ambiguity from strong phases	We present results on B → J/ψKπ decays using e<sup>+</sup> e<sup>-</sup> annihilation data collected with the BABAR detector at the Y(4S) resonance. The detector is located at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy storage ring facility at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Using approximately 88 × 10<sup>6</sup> BB̄ pairs, we measure the decay amplitudes for the flavor eigenmodes and observe strong-phase differences indicative of final-state interactions with a significance of 7.6 standard deviations. We use the interference between the Kπ S-wave and P-wave amplitudes in the region of the K*(892) to resolve the ambiguity in the determination of these strong phases. We then perform an ambiguity-free measurement of cos2β using the angular and time-dependent asymmetry in B → J/ψK* <sup>0</sup>(K<inf>S</inf><sup>0</sup>π<sup>0</sup>) decays. With sin2β fixed at its measured value and cos2β treated as an independent parameter, we find cos2β = 2.72<inf>-0.79</inf><sup>+0.50</sup>(stat) ± 0.27(syst), determining the sign of cos2β to be positive at 86% C.L. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

84937645852	Measurement of ϒ production in pp collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV	The production of ϒ(1S), ϒ(2S) and ϒ(3S) mesons decaying into the dimuon final state is studied with the LHCb detector using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.3pb<sup>−1</sup> collected in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 2.76 TeV. The differential production cross-sections times dimuon branching fractions are measured as functions of the ϒ transverse momentum and rapidity, over the ranges p<inf>T</inf> < 15 GeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5. The total cross-sections in this kinematic region, assuming unpolarised production, aremeasured to be σ (pp → ϒ(1S)X) × B (ϒ(1S) → μ<sup>+</sup> μ<sup>−</sup>) = 1.111 ± 0.043 ± 0.044 nb, σ (pp → ϒ(2S)X) × B (ϒ(2S)→μ<sup>+</sup> μ<sup>−</sup>) = 0.264 ± 0.023 ± 0.011 nb, σ (pp → ϒ(3S)X) × B (ϒ(3S) → μ<sup>+</sup> μ<sup>−</sup>) = 0.159 ± 0.020 ± 0.007 nb, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.

84937645940	Measurement of the xb(3p) mass and of the relative rate of xb1(1p) and xb2(1p) production	The production of Xb mesons in proton-proton collisions is studied using a data sample collected by the LHCb detector, at centre-of-mass energies of √s = 7 and 8TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb<sup>−1</sup>. The Xb mesons are identified through their decays to γ(1S) and γ(2S)γ using photons that converted to e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>−</sup> pairs in the detector.

84940990259	A study of CP violation in B± DK± and B± D p ± decays with D K0K± p final states	A first study of CP violation in the decay modes B± [K<inf>S</inf><sup>0</sup>Kπ<sup>±</sup>]Dh<sup>±</sup> and B<sup>±</sup> [K<inf>S</inf><sup>0</sup>Kπ<sup>±</sup>]Dh<sup>±</sup>, where h labels a K or p meson and D labels a D0 or D<sup>0</sup> meson, is performed. The analysis uses the LHCb data set collected in pp collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb<sup>-1</sup>. The analysis is sensitive to the CP-violating CKM phase γ through seven observables: one charge asymmetry in each of the four modes and three ratios of the charge-integrated yields. The results are consistent with measurements of γ using other decay modes.

84941648152	Study of j/ψ production and cold nuclear matter effects in pPb collisions at √SNN = 5 TeV	The production of J/ψ mesons with rapidity 1.5 < y < 4.0 or −5.0 < y < −2.5 and transverse momentum p<inf>T</inf> < 14 GeV/c is studied with the LHCb detector in proton-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy √SNN = 5 TeV. The J/ψ mesons are reconstructed using the dimuon decay mode. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 1.6 nb<sup>−1</sup>. For the first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward production ratio are determined separately for prompt J/ψ mesons and J/ψ from b-hadron decays. Clear suppression of prompt J/ψ production with respect to proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the production of J/ψ from b-hadron decays is less suppressed. These results show good agreement with available theoretical predictions. The measurement shows that cold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the related quark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.

Here the symbol D0 indicates decay of a D0 or D̄0 into K+π-, while the symbol D*0 indicates decay of a D*0 or D̄*0 to D0π0 or D0γ. These final states can be reached through the b→c transition B-→D(*)0K- followed by the doubly Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)-suppressed D0→K+π-, or the b→u transition B-→D̄(*)0K- followed by the CKM-favored D̄0→K+π-. The interference of these two amplitudes is sensitive to the angle γ of the unitarity triangle. Our results are based on 232×106 Υ(4S)→BB̄ decays collected with the BABAR detector at SLAC. We find no significant evidence for these decays. We set a limit rB|A(B-→D̄0K-)/A(B-→D0K-)|<0.23 at 90% C.L. using the most conservative assumptions on the values of the CKM angle γ and the strong phases in the B and D decay amplitudes. In the case of the D* we set a 90% C.L. limit rB*2|A(B-→D̄*0K-)/A(B-→D*0K-) |2<(0.16)2 which is independent of assumptions on γ and strong phases. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

From a time-dependent maximum-likelihood fit we obtain for the parameters related to the CP violation angle 2β+γ: aDπ=-0.010±0.023±0.007, clepDπ=-0.033±0.042±0.012, aD*π=-0.040±0. 023±0.010, clepD*π=0.049±0.042±0.015,aDρ=-0. 024±0.031±0.009, clepDρ=-0.098±0.055±0.018, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. Using other measurements and theoretical assumptions, we interpret the results in terms of the angles of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity triangle and find |sin (2β+γ)|>0.64(0.40) at 68% (90%) confidence level. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646748906	Search for the charmed pentaquark candidate Θc(3100)0 in e+e- annihilations at s=10.58GeV	We search for the charmed pentaquark candidate reported by the H1 collaboration, the Θc(3100)0, in e+e- interactions at a center-of-mass (c.m.) energy of 10.58 GeV, using 124fb-1 of data recorded with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- facility at SLAC. We find no evidence for such a state in the same pD*- decay mode reported by H1, and we set limits on its production cross section times branching fraction into pD*- as a function of c.m. momentum. The corresponding limit on its total rate per e+e-→qq̄ event, times branching fraction, is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than rates measured for the charmed Λc and Σc baryons in such events. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The data were taken with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B Factory operating on and near the Υ(4S) resonance. We find B(D+→π+π0)=(1.25±0.10±0. 09±0.04)×10-3 and B(D+→K+π0)=(2.52±0.47±0. 25±0.08)×10-4, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the last error is due to the uncertainties in the absolute branching fraction scale for D+ mesons.

33746608115	Study of the decay B̄0→D*+ωπ-	We report on a study of the decay B̄0→D*+ωπ- with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B-factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Based on a sample of 232×106 BB̄ decays, we measure the branching fraction B(B̄0→D*+ωπ-)=(2.88±0. 21(stat.)±0.31(syst.))×10-3. We study the invariant mass spectrum of the ωπ- system in this decay. This spectrum is in good agreement with expectations based on factorization and the measured spectrum in τ-→ωπ-ντ. We also measure the polarization of the D*+ as a function of the ωπ- mass. In the mass region 1.1 to 1.9 GeV we measure the fraction of longitudinal polarization of the D*+ to be ΓL/Γ=0.654±0.042(stat.)±0.016(syst.).

33748686362	Measurement of the spin of the Ω-hyperon	A measurement of the spin of the Ω- hyperon produced through the exclusive process Ξc0→Ω-K+ is presented using a total integrated luminosity of 116fb-1 recorded with the BABAR detector at the e+e- asymmetric-energy B factory at SLAC. Under the assumption that the Ξc0 has spin 1/2, the angular distribution of the Λ from Ω-→ΛK- decay is inconsistent with all half-integer Ω- spin values other than 3/2. Lower statistics data for the process Ωc0→Ω-π+ from a 230fb-1 sample are also found to be consistent with Ω- spin 3/2. If the Ξc0 spin were 3/2, an Ω- spin of 5/2 could not be excluded. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33746862903	Dalitz plot analysis of the decay B±→K±K±K	We analyze the three-body charmless decay B±→K±K± K using a sample of 226.0±2.5 million BB̄ pairs collected by the BABAR detector. We measure the total branching fraction and CP asymmetry to be B=(35.2±0.9±1.6)×10-6 and ACP=(-1.7±2.6±1.5)%. We fit the Dalitz plot distribution using an isobar model and measure the magnitudes and phases of the decay coefficients. We find no evidence of CP violation for the individual components of the isobar model. The decay dynamics is dominated by the K+K- S-wave, for which we perform a partial-wave analysis in the region m(K+K-)<2GeV/c2. Significant production of the f0(980) resonance, and of a spin zero state near 1.55GeV/c2 are required in the isobar model description of the data. The partial-wave analysis supports this observation. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Our central value for the branching fraction, assuming the true Dalitz distribution is uniform and excluding the resonance, is B(B0→KS0KS0KL0)=(2.4-2.5+2.7±0.6) ×10-6 where the errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. We set a single-sided Bayesian upper limit of B(B0→KS0KS0KL0)<7.4×10- 6 at 90% confidence level using a uniform prior probability for physical values.

We include the effects of final-state radiation from the daughter mesons for the first time, and quote branching fractions for the inclusive processes B0→h+h′-nγ, where h and h′ are pions or kaons. The maximum value of the sum of the energies of the n undetected photons, Eγmax, is mode-dependent. Using a data sample of approximately 227×106 Υ(4S)→BB̄ decays collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at SLAC, we measure: B(B0→π+π-nγ;Eγmax =150MeV)=(5.1±0.4±0.2) ×10-6, B(B0→K+π-nγ;Eγmax =105MeV)=(18.1±0. 6±0.6)×10-6, B(B0→K+K-nγ;Eγmax =59MeV)<0.5×10-6(90%confidence level), where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. Theoretical calculations can be used to extrapolate from the above measurements the nonradiative branching fractions, B0.

33846441670	Inclusive Λc+ production in e+e- annihilations at s=10.54GeV and in Υ(4S) decays	We present measurements of the total production rates and momentum distributions of the charmed baryon Λc+ in e+e-→hadrons at a center-of-mass energy of 10.54 GeV and in Υ(4S) decays. In hadronic events at 10.54 GeV, charmed hadrons are almost exclusively leading particles in e+e-→cc̄ events, allowing direct studies of c-quark fragmentation. We measure a momentum distribution for Λc+ baryons that differs significantly from those measured previously for charmed mesons.

We measure an average scaled momentum of xp=0.574±0.009 and a total rate of NΛcqq̄=0.057±0.002(exp.)±0.015(BF)Λc+ per hadronic event, where the experimental error is much smaller than that due to the branching fraction into the reconstructed decay mode, pK-π+.

33846786557	Branching fraction measurement of B̄0→D(*)+π- and B-→D(*)0π- and isospin analysis of B̄→D(*)π decays	Using 65×106 Υ(4S)→BB̄ events collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- storage ring at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, we measure the color-favored branching fractions B(B̄0→D+π- )=(2.55±0.05±0.16)×10-3, B(B̄0→D*+π-)=(2. 79±0.08±0.17)×10-3, B(B-→D0π-)=(4.90±0. 07±0.22)×10-3 and B(B-→D*0π-)=(5.52±0. 17±0.42)×10-3, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. With these results and the current world average for the branching fraction for the color-suppressed decay B̄0→D(*) 0π0, the cosines of the strong phase difference δ between the I=1/2 and I=3/2 isospin amplitudes are determined to be cos δ=0.872-0.007-0.029+0. 008+0.031 for the B̄→Dπ process and cos δ=0.924-0.017-0. 054+0.019+0.063 for the B̄→D*π process.

Structure of the decay B̄s0→J/ψπ+π- is studied using data corresponding to 3fb-1 of integrated luminosity from pp collisions produced by the LHC and collected by the LHCb detector. Five interfering π+π- states are required to describe the decay: f0(980),f0(1500),f0(1790),f2(1270), and f2′(1525). An alternative model including these states and a nonresonant J/ψπ+π- component also provides a good description of the data. Based on the different transversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the final state is found to be compatible with being entirely CP odd. The CP-even part is found to be <2.3% at a 95% confidence level. The f0(500) state is not observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixing angle with the f0(980) of <7.7° at a 90% confidence level, consistent with a tetraquark interpretation of the f0(980) substructure. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

The data cannot be described with K+Ï€- resonances alone, which is confirmed with a model-independent approach. A highly significant Z(4430)- Ïâ€ Ï€- component is required, thus confirming the existence of this state. The observed evolution of the Z(4430)- amplitude with the Ïâ€Ï€- mass establishes the resonant nature of this particle. The mass and width measurements are substantially improved.

The resonant structure of the reaction B̄0→J/ψπ+π- is studied using data from 3fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected by the LHCb experiment, one third at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy and the remainder at 8 TeV. The invariant mass of the π+π- pair and three decay angular distributions are used to determine the fractions of the resonant and nonresonant components. Six interfering π+π- states, ρ(770), f0(500), f2(1270), ρ(1450), ω(782) and ρ(1700), are required to give a good description of invariant mass spectra and decay angular distributions. The positive and negative charge parity fractions of each of the resonant final states are determined. The f0(980) meson is not seen and the upper limit on its presence, compared with the observed f0(500) rate, is inconsistent with a model where these scalar mesons are formed from two quarks and two antiquarks (tetraquarks) at the eight standard deviation level. In the qq̄ model, the absolute value of the mixing angle between the f0(980) and the f0(500) scalar mesons is limited to be less than 17° at 90% confidence level. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb collaboration.

84907358645	First measurement of the charge asymmetry in beauty-quark pair production	The difference in the angular distributions between beauty quarks and antiquarks, referred to as the charge asymmetry, is measured for the first time in bb̄ pair production at a hadron collider. The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.0fb-1 collected at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy in proton-proton collisions with the LHCb detector. The measurement is performed in three regions of the invariant mass of the bb̄ system. The results obtained are ACbb̄(40<Mbb̄<75GeV/c2)=0.4±0.4±0.3%, ACbb̄(75<Mbb̄<105GeV/c2)=2.0±0.9±0.6%, ACbb̄(Mbb̄>105GeV/c2)=1.6±1.7±0.6%, where ACbb̄ is defined as the asymmetry in the difference in rapidity between jets formed from the beauty quark and antiquark, where in each case the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The beauty jets are required to satisfy 2<η<4, ET>20GeV, and have an opening angle in the transverse plane Δφ>2.6rad. These measurements are consistent with the predictions of the standard model. © Published by the American Physical Society.

84908032134	Evidence for CP violation in B+ →p p ¯ K+ decays	Three-body B+→pp¯K+ and B+→pp¯π+ decays are studied using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0fb-1 collected by the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. Evidence of CP violation in the B+→pp¯K+ decay is found in regions of the phase space, representing the first measurement of this kind for a final state containing baryons. Measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry of the light meson in the pp¯ rest frame yield AFB(pp¯K+,mpp¯<2.85GeV/c2)=0.495±0.012(stat)±0.007(syst) and AFB(pp¯π+,mpp¯<2.85GeV/c2)=-0.409±0.033(stat)±0.006(syst). In addition, the branching fraction of the decay B+→Λ¯(1520)p is measured to be B(B+→Λ¯(1520)p)=(3.15±0.48(stat)±0.07(syst)±0.26(BF))×10-7, where BF denotes the uncertainty on secondary branching fractions.

84908032390	Observation of Overlapping Spin-1 and Spin-3 D ¯ 0K- Resonances at Mass 2.86GeV /c2	The resonant substructure of Bs0→D¯0K-π+ decays is studied using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0fb-1 of pp collision data recorded by the LHCb detector. An excess at m(D¯0K-)≈2.86GeV/c2 is found to be an admixture of spin-1 and spin-3 resonances. Therefore, the DsJ∗(2860)- state previously observed in inclusive e+e-→D¯0K-X and pp→D¯0K-X processes consists of at least two particles. This is the first observation of a heavy flavored spin-3 resonance, and the first time that any spin-3 particle has been seen to be produced in B decays. The masses and widths of the new states and of the Ds2∗(2573)- meson are measured, giving the most precise determinations to date.

The resonant substructure of Bs0→D¯0K-π+ decays is studied with the Dalitz plot analysis technique. The study is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0fb-1 of pp collision data recorded by LHCb. A structure at m(D¯0K-)≈2.86GeV/c2 is found to be an admixture of spin-1 and spin-3 resonances. The masses and widths of these states and of the Ds2∗(2573)- meson are measured, as are the complex amplitudes and fit fractions for all the D¯0K- and K-π+ components included in the amplitude model. In addition, the Ds2∗(2573)- resonance is confirmed to be spin 2.

The angular distribution is described by two parameters, FH and the forward-backward asymmetry of the dimuon system A<sup>FB</sup>, which are determined in bins of the dimuon mass squared. The parameter F<inf>H</inf> is a measure of the contribution from (pseudo)scalar and tensor amplitudes to the decay width.

84918499749	Precision luminosity measurements at LHCb	Measuring cross-sections at the LHC requires the luminosity to be determined accurately at each centre-of-mass energy s. In this paper results are reported from the luminosity calibrations carried out at the LHC interaction point 8 with the LHCb detector for s = 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV (proton-proton collisions) and for sNN = 5 TeV (proton-lead collisions). Both the "van der Meer scan" and "beam-gas imaging" luminosity calibration methods were employed. It is observed that the beam density profile cannot always be described by a function that is factorizable in the two transverse coordinates. The introduction of a two-dimensional description of the beams improves significantly the consistency of the results. For proton-proton interactions at s = 8 TeV a relative precision of the luminosity calibration of 1.47% is obtained using van der Meer scans and 1.43% using beam-gas imaging, resulting in a combined precision of 1.12%. Applying the calibration to the full data set determines the luminosity with a precision of 1.16%. This represents the most precise luminosity measurement achieved so far at a bunched-beam hadron collider.

The charmless three-body decay modes B±→K±π+π-, B±→K±K+K-, B±→π±K+K- and B±→π±π+π- are reconstructed using data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0fb-1, collected by the LHCb detector. The inclusive CP asymmetries of these modes are measured to be ACP(B±→K±π+π-)=+0.025±0.004±0.004±0.007,ACP(B±→K±K+K-)=-0.036±0.004±0.002±0.007,ACP(B±→π±π+π-)=+0.058±0.008±0.009±0.007,ACP(B±→π±K+K-)=-0.123±0.017±0.012±0.007,where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third is due to the CP asymmetry of the B±→J/ψK± reference mode. The distributions of these asymmetries are also studied as functions of position in the Dalitz plot and suggest contributions from rescattering and resonance interference processes.

The data sample corresponds to integrated luminosities of 1.0 fb<sup>-1</sup>and 2.0 fb<sup>-1</sup> recorded at the centre-of-mass energies of 7TeV and 8TeV, respectively. The CP-violating asymmetry (Formula presented.) is measured to be (0.18 ± 0.29 (stat) ± 0.04 (syst))%. Searches for CP violation in different regions of phase space of the four-body decay, and as a function of the D<sup>0</sup>decay time, are also presented. No significant deviation from the CP conservation hypothesis is found.
