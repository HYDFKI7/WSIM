84930932721	A survey of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods	Brain tumor segmentation aims to separate the different tumor tissues such as active cells, necrotic core, and edema from normal brain tissues of White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). MRI-based brain tumor segmentation studies are attracting more and more attention in recent years due to non-invasive imaging and good soft tissue contrast of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. With the development of almost two decades, the innovative approaches applying computer-aided techniques for segmenting brain tumor are becoming more and more mature and coming closer to routine clinical applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview for MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods. Firstly, a brief introduction to brain tumors and imaging modalities of brain tumors is given. Then, the preprocessing operations and the state of the art methods of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation are introduced. Moreover, the evaluation and validation of the results of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation are discussed. Finally, an objective assessment is presented and future developments and trends are addressed for MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods.

15044355637	Control of hybrid machines with 2-DOF for trajectory tracking problems	There are two types of drivers in production machine systems: Constant velocity (CV) motor and servo-motor. If a system contains two drivers or more, among which some are of the CV motor while the other are the servo-motor, the system has the so-called hybrid driver architecture and is called hybrid machine for short. The hybrid system has the advantage of high payload and application flexibility. In this brief, we propose a control algorithm and show that the controlled hybrid machine is stable. A simulation is performed to verify the proposed controller. The CV motor has the velocity fluctuation due to the change of its workload. The common approach to attenuate the velocity fluctuation is via a flywheel which is attached on the shaft of the CV motor. We show that this can further improve the tracking performance of the hybrid system. A five-bar linkage with two degrees of freedom is used for illustration throughout the brief. © 2005 IEEE.

In accordance with failure of some sensor in a kind of dynamic system with direct measurable state, the discrete design method of observer was presented. The fuzzy observer is used to construct the state variable which can not be measured or is difficult to be measured by the failed sensor, thus the fault tolerant control is implemented. The simulation result for lateral flight control of some aircraft has shown the design method of the observer is effective.

3342954794	Robust stability criteria for system with delay & its application to FCS	A study is devoted to the delay-robust stability for linear system with time delay, using matrix analysis and comparison theory on differential-integral-difference equations. Since the matrix norm used to derive the results may be arbitrary consistent matrix norm, the obtained results possess some agility, and it makes quite convenient to check stability for linear systems with time delay. In particular, a sufficient and necessary condition for delay-robust stability is obtained, and a formula to calculate the maximum delay for systems with stability is given. At the end, the results are used to analyze a flight control system (FCS). Comparison with some literature shows that the criteria in this paper are not only simple, but also of small conservativeness.

84887456562	Complexity analysis and parameter estimation of dynamic metabolic systems	A metabolic system consists of a number of reactions transforming molecules of one kind into another to provide the energy that living cells need. Based on the biochemical reaction principles, dynamic metabolic systems can be modeled by a group of coupled differential equations which consists of parameters, states (concentration of molecules involved), and reaction rates. Reaction rates are typically either polynomials or rational functions in states and constant parameters. As a result, dynamic metabolic systems are a group of differential equations nonlinear and coupled in both parameters and states. Therefore, it is challenging to estimate parameters in complex dynamic metabolic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the complexity of dynamic metabolic systems for parameter estimation. As a result, the estimation of parameters in dynamic metabolic systems is reduced to the estimation of parameters in a group of decoupled rational functions plus polynomials (which we call improper rational functions) or in polynomials. Furthermore, by taking its special structure of improper rational functions, we develop an efficient algorithm to estimate parameters in improper rational functions. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of parameters in a dynamic metabolic system. The simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed method. © 2013 Li-Ping Tian et al.

4444319354	An analysis of two-heater active thermal control technology for device class testing	A novel technology for controlling temperature rise in the class testing is described in this article. This technology is based on two active heater sources and is called a two-heater active thermal control (2H-ATC) system. From a point of control, a lumped analytical model for representing the whole class testing process is very important, and is developed in this article. The model was validated by comparing the simulated result with the measured result on a commercial tester. Based on this model, we have studied the issue of optimization of the performance of the testing process, in particular examining effects of test system parameters on system performance. We have also observed a concept called critical heater power, which is important in achieving a minimum overshoot at the transition from the preheating stage to the testing stage. The outcome of this study has already been applied in practical process control during the whole class testing. © 2004 IEEE.

54949113744	Adaptive dynamic surface control of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems in pure-feedback form using fuzzy backstepping approach	This paper presents an adaptive fuzzy controller for the robust backstepping control of a class of uncertain nonlinear systems in pure-feedback form. The proposed approach incorporates the Nussbaum gain function (NGF) and the dynamic surface control (DSC) into the existing adaptive fuzzy control scheme. The major features of the proposed method are that: 1) the two problems, control directions and control singularity, are well solved by use of the NGF; 2) the problem of "explosion of complexity" inherent to the existing backstepping methods is eliminated by introducing the DSC technique; 3) the proposed control scheme has the adaptive mechanism with fewer adaptive laws, which results in less computation time burden. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a simulation example. ©2008 IEEE.

Our method consists of two steps. First, a novel scale-free network clustering approach is applied to such a biomolecular network to obtain various subnetworks. Second, computational models are generated for the subnetworks and simulated to predict their behavior in the cellular context. We discuss and evaluate some of the advanced computational modeling approaches, in particular, state-space modeling, probabilistic Boolean network modeling, and fuzzy logic modeling. The modeling and simulation results represent hypotheses that are tested against high-throughput biological datasets (microarrays and/or genetic screens) under normal and perturbation conditions.

By employing a novel Lyapunov function, we proved that PD plus simple gravity compensation control laws are enough to globally stabilize robotic manipulators. Following the same approach and passive property in robotic system, we presented output feedback control laws with simple gravity compensation to globally stabilize robotic manipulators. Since simple gravity compensation term, that is, unique gravity term at desired position, can be calculated off-line, our control algorithms reduce substantially the calculation complexity of the controller.

77649257699	Estimation of parameters in rational reaction rates of molecular biological systems via weighted least squares	The models of gene regulatory networks are often derived from statistical thermodynamics principle or Michaelis-Menten kinetics equation. As a result, the models contain rational reaction rates which are nonlinear in both parameters and states. It is challenging to estimate parameters nonlinear in a model although there have been many traditional nonlinear parameter estimation methods such as Gauss-Newton iteration method and its variants. In this article, we develop a two-step method to estimate the parameters in rational reaction rates of gene regulatory networks via weighted linear least squares. This method takes the special structure of rational reaction rates into consideration. That is, in the rational reaction rates, the numerator and the denominator are linear in parameters. By designing a special weight matrix for the linear least squares, parameters in the numerator and the denominator can be estimated by solving two linear least squares problems. The main advantage of the developed method is that it can produce the analytical solutions to the estimation of parameters in rational reaction rates which originally is nonlinear parameter estimation problem. The developed method is applied to a couple of gene regulatory networks. The simulation results show the superior performance over Gauss-Newton method.

77956166445	Iterative linear least squares method of parameter estimation for linear-fractional models of molecular biological systems	Based on statistical thermodynamics principle or Michaelis-Menten kinetics equation, the models for biological systems contain linear fractional functions as reaction rates which are nonlinear in both parameters and states. Generally it is challenging to estimate parameters nonlinear in a model although there have been many traditional nonlinear parameter estimation methods such as Gauss-Newton iteration method and its variants. However, in a linear fractional model both the denominator and numerator are linear in the parameters. Based on this observation, we develop an iterative linear least squares method for estimating parameters in biological system modeled by linear fractional function. The basic idea is to transfer optimizing a nonlinear least squares objective function into iteratively solving a sequence of linear least squares problems. The developed method is applied to a linear fractional function and an autoregulatory gene network.

79955864876	Recurrent neural network for non-smooth convex optimization problems with application to the identification of genetic regulatory networks	A recurrent neural network is proposed for solving the non-smooth convex optimization problem with the convex inequality and linear equality constraints. Since the objective function and inequality constraints may not be smooth, the Clarke's generalized gradients of the objective function and inequality constraints are employed to describe the dynamics of the proposed neural network. It is proved that the equilibrium point set of the proposed neural network is equivalent to the optimal solution of the original optimization problem by using the Lagrangian saddle-point theorem. Under weak conditions, the proposed neural network is proved to be stable, and the state of the neural network is convergent to one of its equilibrium points. Compared with the existing neural network models for non-smooth optimization problems, the proposed neural network can deal with a larger class of constraints and is not based on the penalty method. Finally, the proposed neural network is used to solve the identification problem of genetic regulatory networks, which can be transformed into a non-smooth convex optimization problem. The simulation results show the satisfactory identification accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2011 IEEE.

80054041604	Applications of graph theory in protein structure identification	There is a growing interest in the identification of proteins on the proteome wide scale. Among different kinds of protein structure identification methods, graph-theoretic methods are very sharp ones. Due to their lower costs, higher effectiveness and many other advantages, they have drawn more and more researchers' attention nowadays. Specifically, graph-theoretic methods have been widely used in homology identification, side-chain cluster identification, peptide sequencing and so on. This paper reviews several methods in solving protein structure identification problems using graph theory. We mainly introduce classical methods and mathematical models including homology modeling based on clique finding, identification of side-chain clusters in protein structures upon graph spectrum, and de novo peptide sequencing via tandem mass spectrometry using the spectrum graph model. In addition, concluding remarks and future priorities of each method are given. © 2011 Yan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

81455139901	Nonlinear model-based method for clustering periodically expressed genes	Clustering periodically expressed genes from their time-course expression data could help understand the molecular mechanism of those biological processes. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear model-based clustering method for periodically expressed gene profiles. As periodically expressed genes are associated with periodic biological processes, the proposed method naturally assumes that a periodically expressed gene dataset is generated by a number of periodical processes. Each periodical process is modelled by a linear combination of trigonometric sine and cosine functions in time plus a Gaussian noise term. A two stage method is proposed to estimate the model parameter, and a relocation-iteration algorithm is employed to assign each gene to an appropriate cluster. A bootstrapping method and an average adjusted Rand index (AARI) are employed to measure the quality of clustering. One synthetic dataset and two biological datasets were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method allows the better quality clustering than other clustering methods (e.g., k-means) for periodically expressed gene data, and thus it is an effective cluster analysis method for periodically expressed gene data.

84055198358	Estimating parameters in genetic regulatory networks with SUM logic	Many methods for inferring genetic regulatory networks have been proposed. However inferred networks can hardly be used to analyze the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks. Recently nonlinear differential equations are proposed to model genetic regulatory networks. Based on this kind of model, the stability of genetic regulatory networks has been intensively investigated. Because of difficulty in estimating parameters in nonlinear model, inference of genetic regulatory networks with nonlinear model has been paid little attention. In this paper, we present a method for estimating parameters in genetic regulatory networks with SUM regulatory logic. In this kind of genetic regulatory networks, a regulatory function for each gene is a linear combination of Hill form functions, which are nonlinear in parameters and in system states. To investigate the proposed method, the gene toggle switch network is used as an illustrative example. The simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately estimates parameters in genetic regulatory networks with SUM logic. © 2011 IEEE.

Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain this interesting process. In zebrafish somitogenesis, genes her1, her7, delta, and their proteins plays the important roles. However, an auto-repression model with time delay involved only by her1/her7 is able to explain zebrafish somitogenesis. This paper will systematically study the dynamics of this model. Specifically we investigate its stability, bifurcation (oscillation), and stability of oscillation. First, the conditions for both stability and bifurcation are presented based on the linearized model. Then three indices for bifurcation of this nonlinear model are derived by using linear functional operator analysis.

84862954998	An improved graph entropy-based method for identifying protein complexes	Protein complexes are essential entities that perform the major cellular processes and biological functions in live organisms. The identification of component proteins in a complex from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is an important step to understand the organization and interaction of gene products. In existing literature, methods for identifying protein complexes typically start from a selected seed, commonly a vertex (a single protein), in a PPI network. However, in many circumstances, a single protein seed is not enough to generate a meaningful complex, or more than one protein is known in a complex. In this paper, we present an improved seed-growth style algorithm to identify protein complexes from PPI networks based on the concept of graph entropy. Different from existing methods, the seed is assumed to be a clique (e.g., a vertex, an edge, a triangle) in a PPI network. The computational experiments have been conducted on PPI network of S. cerevisiae. The results have shown that the larger cliques are considered as seeds, the better the presented method performs in terms of f-score. In particular, up to K3-cliques are included as seeds, the average f-score is 57.32%, which is better than that of existing methods. © 2011 IEEE.

84862957397	Modeling gene regulatory subnetworks from time course gene expression data	Identifying gene regulatory network (GRN) from time course gene expression data has attracted more and more attentions. Due to the computational complexity, most approaches for GRN econstruction are limited on a small number of genes and low connectivity of the underlying networks. These approaches can only identify a single network for a given set of genes. However, for a large-scale gene network, there might exist multiple potential sub-networks, in which genes are only functionally related to thers in the sub-networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for identifying multiple sub-networks from gene expression data by incorporating community structure information into GRN inference. The proposed algorithm iteratively solves two optimization problems, and thus promisingly applies to large-scale GRNs. Experimental studies on synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the inference of sub-networks. © 2011 IEEE.

84863362579	Detecting nearly periodically expressed genes from their microarray time-course profiles	Periodic (more accurately, nearly periodic) biological processes play important roles in living organisms and can be studied at molecular level. Time-course gene expression profiles associated with those periodic biological processes appears nearly periodic. Detecting nearly periodically expressed genes from their microarray time-course data could help understand the molecular mechanism of those biological processes. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting periodically expressed genes from their time-course expression profiles. In the proposed method, a nearly periodical gene expression profile is modeled by a nearly periodic function, which is a linear combination of trigonometric sine function, cosine function, and a linear function in time variable plus a Gaussian noise term. As the model is nonlinear in parameters and time variable, a two-step parameter estimation method is employed for estimating parameters in the model. On the other hand, non-periodical gene expression profiles are modelled by a constant plus a Gaussian noise term. The statistical F-testing is used to make a decision if a gene is nearly periodically expressed or not. One synthetic dataset and two biological datasets were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can effectively detect nearly periodically expressed genes.

84867613437	Iteration method for predicting essential proteins based on orthology and protein-protein interaction networks	Background: Identification of essential proteins plays a significant role in understanding minimal requirements for the cellular survival and development. Many computational methods have been proposed for predicting essential proteins by using the topological features of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, most of these methods ignored intrinsic biological meaning of proteins. Moreover, PPI data contains many false positives and false negatives. To overcome these limitations, recently many research groups have started to focus on identification of essential proteins by integrating PPI networks with other biological information. However, none of their methods has widely been acknowledged.Results: By considering the facts that essential proteins are more evolutionarily conserved than nonessential proteins and essential proteins frequently bind each other, we propose an iteration method for predicting essential proteins by integrating the orthology with PPI networks, named by ION. Differently from other methods, ION identifies essential proteins depending on not only the connections between proteins but also their orthologous properties and features of their neighbors. ION is implemented to predict essential proteins in S. cerevisiae. Experimental results show that ION can achieve higher identification accuracy than eight other existing centrality methods in terms of area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, ION identifies a large amount of essential proteins which have been ignored by eight other existing centrality methods because of their low-connectivity. Many proteins ranked in top 100 by ION are both essential and belong to the complexes with certain biological functions. Furthermore, no matter how many reference organisms were selected, ION outperforms all eight other existing centrality methods. While using as many as possible reference organisms can improve the performance of ION. Additionally, ION also shows good prediction performance in E. coli K-12.Conclusions: The accuracy of predicting essential proteins can be improved by integrating the orthology with PPI networks. © 2012 Peng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84868664794	New global stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays	The study of the global stability is essential for designing and controlling genetic regulatory networks. Most existing results on this issue are based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, which results in checking the existence of feasible solutions to high dimensional LMIs. In our previous study, we present several stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays, based on M-matrix theory and the non-smooth Lyapunov function. In this paper, we design a smooth Lyapunov function and employ M-matrix theory to derive new stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays. Theoretically, these conditions are less conservative than existing ones in some cases. For genetic regulatory networks with n genes and n proteins, these conditions become to check if an nxn matrix is an M-matrix, which is much easier than existing results. To illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, two genetic regulatory networks are analyzed. © 2012 IEEE.

On average 25% of amino acids in protein structures are located in β-turns. Development of accurate and efficient method for β-turns prediction is very important. Most of the current successful β-turns prediction methods use support vector machines (SVMs) or Neural Networks (NNs), however a method that can yield probabilistic outcome, and has a well-defined extension to the multi-class case will be more valuable in β-turns prediction. Although kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification technique that has been applied successfully in many classification problems, however it is often not found in β-turns classification, mainly because it is computationally expensive. In this paper we used KLR to obtain sparse β-turns prediction in short evolution time after speeding it using Nystrom approximation method. Secondary structure information and position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are utilized as input features. We achieved Qtotal of 80.4% and MCC of 50% on BT426 dataset. These results show that KLR method with the right algorithm can yield performance equivalent or even better than NNs and SVMs in β-turns prediction. In addition KLR yields probabilistic outcome and has a well-defined extension to multi-class case. © 2012 IEEE.

In the last years, many studies have been devoted to the elucidation of transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulating activities of TFs or miRNAs, respectively. However, very limited attempts have been made to consider the dynamic characteristics of miRNA-TF-mRNA circuits, which are the biological network motifs considering miRNAs, TFs and genes as a whole in the complicated biological procedures like mouse lung development. Here we propose to mine miRNA-TF-mRNA circuits related to the mouse lung development by integrating TF-mRNA, miRNA-mRNA, TF-miRNA, and time-course expression data, and to further analyze the variations of these circuits in different stages of the lung development. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to take transcriptional and post-transcriptional information together to describe the mouse lung development.

84872678695	Identifying protein complexes in protein-protein interaction networks by using clique seeds and graph entropy	The identification of protein complexes plays a key role in understanding major cellular processes and biological functions. Various computational algorithms have been proposed to identify protein complexes from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. In this paper, we first introduce a new seed-selection strategy for seed-growth style algorithms. Cliques rather than individual vertices are employed as initial seeds. After that, a result-modification approach is proposed based on this seed-selection strategy. Predictions generated by higher order clique seeds are employed to modify results that are generated by lower order ones. The performance of this seed-selection strategy and the result-modification approach are tested by using the entropy-based algorithm, which is currently the best seed-growth style algorithm to detect protein complexes from PPI networks. In addition, we investigate four pairs of strategies for this algorithm in order to improve its accuracy. The numerical experiments are conducted on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI network. The group of best predictions consists of 1711 clusters, with the average f-score at 0.68 after removing all similar and redundant clusters. We conclude that higher order clique seeds can generate predictions with higher accuracy and that our improved entropy-based algorithm outputs more reasonable predictions than the original one. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84872707941	Computational approaches to predicting essential proteins: A survey	Essential proteins are indispensable to support cellular life. Identifying essential proteins can help us understand the minimal requirements for cell survival, which plays a significant role in the emerging field of synthetic biology. Moreover, essential proteins also serve as candidates of drug targets for developing novel therapy of diseases, such as cancer or infectious disease caused by emerging pathogens. However, it is expensive and time consuming to experimentally identify essential proteins. With accumulation of sequenced genomes, the gap between genome-wide essential protein data and sequence data become increasingly wide. Thus, computational approaches for detecting essential proteins are useful complements to limited experimental methods. There are many features related to protein essentiality. By taking advantage of these features, many computational approaches have been proposed to identify essential proteins. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art techniques for computational detection of essential proteins, and discuss some challenges for future research in this field. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although a number of automated algorithms have been developed to help identifying those high quality of peptide spectrum matches (PSMs), lack of trustworthy target PSMs remains an open problem. In this paper, we design the FC-Ranker algorithm to calculate the score of each target PSM. A nonnegative weight is assigned to each target PSM to indicate its likelihood of being correct. Particularly, we proposed a fuzzy SVM classification model and a fuzzy silhouette index for iteratively updating the scores of target PSMs. Furthermore, FC-Ranker provides a framework for tackling the problem of uncertainty of target PSMs, and it can be easily adjusted to adapt new datasets. © 2012 IEEE.

84875601557	A hybrid approach of support vector machines with logistic regression for β-turn prediction	A β-turn is a secondary protein structure type that plays a significant role in protein folding, stability, and molecular recognition. It is the most common type of non-repetitive structures. On average 25% of amino acids in protein structures are located in β-turns. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach of support vector machines (SVMs) with logistic regression (LR) for β-turn prediction. In this hybrid approach, the non β-turn class in a training set is under-sampled several times and combined with the β-turn class to create a number of balanced sets. Each balanced set is used for training one SVM at a time. The results of the SVMs are aggregated by using a logistic regression model. By adopting this hybrid approach, we cannot only avoid the difficulty of imbalanced data, but also have outputs with probability, and less ambiguous than combining SVM with other methods such as voting. Our simulation studies on BT426, and other datasets show that this hybrid approach achieves favorable performance in predicting β-turns as measured by the Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) when compared with other competing methods. © 2012 IEEE.

84874880374	Matrix decomposition methods in bioinformatics	With advances in biotechnology, a huge amount of high throughput biological data has been and will continuously be produced. The information contained in such data is very useful in understanding the biological process from which such data is collected. Generally, high throughput biological data such as gene expression data is presented in a data matrix. Through matrix decomposition methods, we can often discover some very useful information. In bioinformatics, principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and network component analysis (NCA) are widely used to help understand and utilize high throughput data. They are all matrix decomposition methods, but subject to different constraints. In this paper, each of these methods is introduced and its applications to high throughput biological data are discussed. We also compare these methods and discuss their pros and cons. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84874915404	Predicting β -turns in protein using kernel logistic regression	A β-turn is a secondary protein structure type that plays a significant role in protein configuration and function. On average 25% of amino acids in protein structures are located in β-turns. It is very important to develope an accurate and efficient method for β-turns prediction. Most of the current successful β-turns prediction methods use support vector machines (SVMs) or neural networks (NNs). The kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification technique that has been applied successfully in many classification problems. However, it is often not found in β-turns classification, mainly because it is computationally expensive. In this paper, we used KLR to obtain sparse β-turns prediction in short evolution time. Secondary structure information and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are utilized as input features. We achieved

84876157977	Robust identification method for nonlinear model structures and its application to high-performance aircraft	A common assumption is that the model structure is known for modelling high performance aircraft. In practice, this is not the case. Actually, structure identification plays the most important role in the processing of nonlinear system modelling. The integration of mode structure identification and parameter estimation is an efficient method to construct the model for high performance aircraft, which is nonlinear and also contains uncertainties. This article presents an efficient method for identifying nonlinear model structure and estimating parameters for high-performance aircraft model, which contains uncertainties. The parameters associated with nonlinear terms are considered one after the other if they should be included in the nonlinear model until a stopping criterion is met, which is based on Akaike's information criterion. A numerically efficient U-D factorisation is presented to avoid complex computation of high-order matrices. The proposed method is applied to flight test data of a high-performance aircraft. The results demonstrate that the proposed method could obtain the good aircraft model with a reasonably good fidelity based on the comparison with flight test data. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84880385497	Symmetry compression method for discovering network motifs	Discovering network motifs could provide a significant insight into systems biology. Interestingly, many biological networks have been found to have a high degree of symmetry (automorphism), which is inherent in biological network topologies. The symmetry due to the large number of basic symmetric subgraphs (BSSs) causes a certain redundant calculation in discovering network motifs. Therefore, we compress all basic symmetric subgraphs before extracting compressed subgraphs and propose an efficient decompression algorithm to decompress all compressed subgraphs without loss of any information. In contrast to previous approaches, the novel Symmetry Compression method for Motif Detection, named as SCMD, eliminates most redundant calculations caused by widespread symmetry of biological networks. We use SCMD to improve three notable exact algorithms and two efficient sampling algorithms. Results of all exact algorithms with SCMD are the same as those of the original algorithms, since SCMD is a lossless method. The sampling results show that the use of SCMD almost does not affect the quality of sampling results. For highly symmetric networks, we find that SCMD used in both exact and sampling algorithms can help get a remarkable speedup. Furthermore, SCMD enables us to find larger motifs in biological networks with notable symmetry than previously possible. © 2013 IEEE.

84883313797	Construction of uncertain protein-protein interaction networks and its applications	Recent developments in experiments have resulted in the publication of many high-quality, large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of PPI networks have been found to contain false positives, which have negative effects on the further research of PPI networks. We construct an uncertain protein-protein interaction (UPPI) network, in which each protein-protein interaction is assigned with an existence probability using the topology of the PPI network solely. Based on the uncertainty theory, we propose the concept of expected density to assess the density degree of a subgraph, the concept of the relative degree to describe the relationship between a protein and a subgraph in a UPPI network. To verify the effectiveness of the UPPI network, we propose a novel complex prediction method named CPUT (Complex Prediction based on Uncertainty Theory). In CPUT, the expected density combined with the absolute degree is used to determine whether a mined subgraph from the UPPI network can be represented as a core component with high cohesion and low coupling while the relative degree is the criterion of binding an attachment protein to a core component to form a complex. We employ CPUT and the existing competitive algorithms on two yeast PPI networks. Experimental results indicate that CPUT performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

84893187621	Nonlinear-model-based analysis methods for time-course gene expression data	Microarray technology has produced a huge body of time-course gene expression data and will continue to produce more. Such gene expression data has been proved useful in genomic disease diagnosis and drug design. The challenge is how to uncover useful information from such data by proper analysis methods such as significance analysis and clustering analysis. Many statistic-based significance analysis methods and distance/correlation-based clustering analysis methods have been applied to time-course expression data. However, these techniques are unable to account for the dynamics of such data. It is the dynamics that characterizes such data and that should be considered in analysis of such data. In this paper, we employ a nonlinear model to analyse time-course gene expression data. We firstly develop an efficient method for estimating the parameters in the nonlinear model. Then we utilize this model to perform the significance analysis of individually differentially expressed genes and clustering analysis of a set of gene expression profiles. The verification with two synthetic datasets shows that our developed significance analysis method and cluster analysis method outperform some existing methods. The application to one real-life biological dataset illustrates that the analysis results of our developed methods are in agreement with the existing results. © 2014 Li-Ping Tian et al.

84893202136	M-matrix-based stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays and noise perturbations	Stability is essential for designing and controlling any dynamic systems. Recently, the stability of genetic regulatory networks has been widely studied by employing linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, which results in checking the existence of feasible solutions to high-dimensional LMIs. In the previous study, the authors present several stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays, based on M-matrix theory and using the non-smooth Lyapunov function, which results in determining whether a low-dimensional matrix is a nonsingular M-matrix. However, the previous approach cannot be applied to analyse the stability of genetic regulatory networks with noise perturbations. Here, the authors design a smooth Lyapunov function quadratic in state variables and employ M-matrix theory to derive new stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays. Theoretically, these conditions are less conservative than existing ones in some genetic regulatory networks. Then the results are extended to genetic regulatory networks with time-varying delays and noise perturbations. For genetic regulatory networks with n genes and n proteins, the derived conditions are to check if an n × n matrix is a non-singular M-matrix. To further present the new theories proposed in this study, three example regulatory networks are analysed. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.

84894515093	Prioritizing human disease genes by multiple data integration	Now multiple types of data are available for prioritizing human disease genes, including gene-disease associations, disease phenotype similarities, locations of genes or their corresponding proteins in biological networks, etc. Integrating multiple types of data is expected to be effective for prioritizing human disease genes. In this paper, we propose a multiple data integration method based on the theory of Markov Random Field (MRF) and the method of Bayesian analysis for prioritizing human disease genes. The proposed method is not only flexible in easily incorporating different kinds of data, but also reliable in predicting candidate disease genes. Numerical experiments are carried out by integrating known gene-disease associations, protein complexes, protein-protein interactions and gene expression profiles. Predictions are evaluated by both the leave-one-out method and the fold enrichment method. The sensitivity and the specificity can reach at roughly 80% simultaneously. The method achieves 56.02-fold enrichment on average when integrating all those biological data in our experiments. © 2013 IEEE.

84894515342	Prioritization of candidate genes based on disease similarity and protein's proximity in PPI networks	Identifying the genes causing a genetic disease is a key challenge in human health. Recently molecular interaction data has been used to prioritize candidate genes with respect to a particular disease. As a result, different methods have been implemented to rank genes which cause a given disease. However it has been suggested in literature that, to prioritize candidate genes it is necessary to consider disease similarity along with the protein's proximity to disease genes in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. This paper proposes a new algorithm called proximity disease similarity algorithm (ProSim) which considers both properties simultaneously. Prostate cancer, Alzheimer disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 case studies are then used to test the proposed method. Results in terms of leave-one-out cross validation and ROC curves indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. © 2013 IEEE.

84894566482	PPI modules detection method through ABC-IFC algorithm	A novel clustering model is proposed which combines the optimization mechanism of artificial bee colony (ABC) with the fuzzy membership matrix in this paper. The clustering model contains two parts: one is to search optimum cluster centers using ABC mechanism, the other is to implement clustering using intuitionistic fuzzy clustering (IFC) method. Firstly, the cluster centers are set randomly and the initial clustering results are obtained using fuzzy membership matrix. The new cluster centers are updated with the nodes that contain the maximal amount of information in the previous clusters of onlookers by ABC algorithm. If the onlookers are incapable of updating, the scouts will generate new cluster centers via global searching. Then the clustering result is obtained through IFC method based on the new optimized cluster centers. Considering that some protein nodes in PPI networks are unreachable, which leads to the traditional distance based clustering criteria infeasible. Therefore the new objective function is designed. The improved algorithm, named ABC-IFC, is also compared with the traditional fuzzy C-means clustering and IFC method. The experimental results on MIPS dataset show that the new algorithm does not only get improved in terms of several commonly used evaluation criteria such as precision, recall and P-value, but also obtains a better clustering result. © 2013 IEEE.

84894584319	A dividing-and-matching algorithm to detect conserved protein complexes via local network alignment	Local network alignment is an effective way to comparatively analyze a pair of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks so as to identify the common subnetworks (conserved protein complexes) across species, which helps us better understand the structure, function and evolution of biological cells. In this work, we propose a new dividing-and-matching method named by DAMAlign to detect conserved protein complexes via local network alignment. DAMAlign firstly partitions one of PPI network into subnetworks and then these subnetworks are mapped to the other PPI network to find common connected components. In the course of finding common connected components, DAMAlign adopts a lenient criteria that is we locally extend a pair of homologous proteins if there exists at least one path of length not larger than 2 to connect one of node in the homologous protein pair in its corresponding network. We implement network alignment between S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster. The experimental results show that DAMAlign outperforms other existing methods in recovering known protein complexes. Moreover, the conserved protein complexes that are detected by DAMAlign from different PPI networks are also functional similar in terms of their GO semantic similarity. © 2013 IEEE.

Identifying them plays an important role for our attempt to reveal principles of cellular organizations and functions. In this article, we review computational algorithms for identifying protein complexes and/or functional modules from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We first describe issues and pitfalls when interpreting PPI networks. Then based on types of data used and main ideas involved, we briefly describe protein complex and/or functional module identification algorithms in four categories: (i) those based on topological structures of unweighted PPI networks; (ii) those based on characters of weighted PPI networks; (iii) those based on multiple data integrations; and (iv) those based on dynamic PPI networks. The PPI networks are modelled increasingly precise when integrating more types of data, and the study of protein complexes would benefit by shifting from static to dynamic PPI networks. © The Author 2013.

84896760571	Dynamic protein interaction network construction and applications	With more dynamic information available, researchers' attention has recently shifted from static properties to dynamic properties of protein-protein interaction networks. To compensate the limited ability of technologies of detecting dynamic protein-protein interactions, dynamic protein interaction networks (DPINs) can be constructed by involving proteomic, genomic, and transcriptome analyses. Two groups of DPIN construction methods are classified based on the different focuses on dynamic information extracted from gene expression data. The dynamics of one kind of DPINs is reflected by the changes in protein presence varying with time, while that of the other kind of DPINs is reflected by the differences of coexpression under different conditions. In this review, the applications on DPINs will be discussed, including protein complexes/functional modules and network organization analysis, biomarkers detection in the progression or prognosis of the disease, and network medicine. We also point out the challenges in DPINs construction and future directions in the research of DPINs at the end of this review. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84899149219	Detecting protein complexes basedon uncertain graph model	Advanced biological technologies are producing large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) data at an ever increasing pace, which enable us to identify protein complexes from PPI networks. Pair-wise protein interactions can be modeled as a graph, where vertices represent proteins and edges represent PPIs. However most of current algorithms detect protein complexes based on deterministic graphs, whose edges are either present or absent. Neighboring information is neglected in these methods. Based on the uncertain graph model, we propose the concept of expected density to assess the density degree of a subgraph, the concept of relative degree to describe the relationship between a protein and a subgraph in a PPI network. We develop an algorithm called DCU (detecting complex based on uncertain graph model) to detect complexes from PPI networks. In our method, the expected density combined with the relative degree is used to determine whether a subgraph represents a complex with high cohesion and low coupling. We apply our method and the existing competing algorithms to two yeast PPI networks. Experimental results indicate that our method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods and the proposed model can provide more insights for future study in PPI networks. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

84899154353	Improving protein function prediction using domain and protein complexes in PPI networks	Background: Characterization of unknown proteins through computational approaches is one of the most challenging problems in silico biology, which has attracted world-wide interests and great efforts. There have been some computational methods proposed to address this problem, which are either based on homology mapping or in the context of protein interaction networks.Results: In this paper, two algorithms are proposed by integrating the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, proteins' domain information and protein complexes. The one is domain combination similarity (DCS), which combines the domain compositions of both proteins and their neighbors. The other is domain combination similarity in context of protein complexes (DSCP), which extends the protein functional similarity definition of DCS by combining the domain compositions of both proteins and the complexes including them. The new algorithms are tested on networks of the model species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to predict functions of unknown proteins using cross validations. Comparing with other several existing algorithms, the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in protein function prediction. Furthermore, the algorithm DSCP using experimental determined complex data is robust when a large percentage of the proteins in the network is unknown, and it outperforms DCS and other several existing algorithms.Conclusions: The accuracy of predicting protein function can be improved by integrating the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, proteins' domain information and protein complexes. © 2014 Peng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84899619013	Transittability of complex networks and its applications to regulatory biomolecular networks	We have often observed unexpected state transitions of complex systems. We are thus interested in how to steer a complex system from an unexpected state to a desired state. Here we introduce the concept of transittability of complex networks, and derive a new sufficient and necessary condition for state transittability which can be efficiently verified. We define the steering kernel as a minimal set of steering nodes to which control signals must directly be applied for transition between two specific states of a network, and propose a graph-theoretic algorithm to identify the steering kernel of a network for transition between two specific states. We applied our algorithm to 27 real complex networks, finding that sizes of steering kernels required for transittability are much less than those for complete controllability. Furthermore, applications to regulatory biomolecular networks not only validated our method but also identified the steering kernel for their phenotype transitions.

84902170916	Identifying dynamic protein complexes based on gene expression profiles and PPI networks	Identification of protein complexes from protein-protein interaction networks has become a key problem for understanding cellular life in postgenomic era. Many computational methods have been proposed for identifying protein complexes. Up to now, the existing computational methods are mostly applied on static PPI networks. However, proteins and their interactions are dynamic in reality. Identifying dynamic protein complexes is more meaningful and challenging. In this paper, a novel algorithm, named DPC, is proposed to identify dynamic protein complexes by integrating PPI data and gene expression profiles. According to Core-Attachment assumption, these proteins which are always active in the molecular cycle are regarded as core proteins. The protein-complex cores are identified from these always active proteins by detecting dense subgraphs. Final protein complexes are extended from the protein-complex cores by adding attachments based on a topological character of "closeness" and dynamic meaning. The protein complexes produced by our algorithm DPC contain two parts: static core expressed in all the molecular cycle and dynamic attachments short-lived. The proposed algorithm DPC was applied on the data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the experimental results show that DPC outperforms CMC, MCL, SPICi, HC-PIN, COACH, and Core-Attachment based on the validation of matching with known complexes and hF-measures. © 2014 Min Li et al.

84902208510	State observer design for delayed genetic regulatory networks	Genetic regulatory networks are dynamic systems which describe the interactions among gene products (mRNAs and proteins). The internal states of a genetic regulatory network consist of the concentrations of mRNA and proteins involved in it, which are very helpful in understanding its dynamic behaviors. However, because of some limitations such as experiment techniques, not all internal states of genetic regulatory network can be effectively measured. Therefore it becomes an important issue to estimate the unmeasured states via the available measurements. In this study, we design a state observer to estimate the states of genetic regulatory networks with time delays from available measurements. Furthermore, based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a criterion is established to guarantee that the dynamic of estimation error is globally asymptotically stable. A gene repressillatory network is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of our design approach. © 2014 Li-Ping Tian et al.

84906331204	Searching SNP combinations related to evolutionary information of human populations on HapMap data	The International HapMap Project is a partnership of scientists and funding agencies from different countries to develop a public resource that will help researchers find genes associated with human disease and response to pharmaceuticals. The project has collected large amounts of SNP(single- nucleotide polymorphism) data of individuals of different human populations. Many researchers have revealed evolution information from the SNP data. But how to find all the SNPs related to human evolution is still a hard work. At most time, these SNPs work together which leads to the differences between different human populations. The number of SNP combinations is very large, thus it is impossible to check all the combinations. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to find the SNP combinatorial patterns whose frequencies are quite different in two different populations. The numbers of the multi-SNP combinations are regarded as the differences between each paired human populations, then a hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to construct the evolution trees for human populations. The trees from 4 chromosomes are consistent and the result can be validated by other literatures, which indicates that evolutionary information is well mined. The multi-SNP combinations found by our method can be studied further in many aspects. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

84906346911	Identification of essential proteins by using complexes and interaction network	Essential proteins are indispensable in maintaining the cellular life. Identification of essential proteins can provide basis for drug target design, disease treatment as well as synthetic biology minimal genome. However, it is still time-consuming and expensive to identify essential protein based on experimental approaches. With the development of high-throughput experimental techniques in the post-genome era, a large number of PPI data and gene expression data can be obtained, which provide an unprecedented opportunity to study essential proteins at the network level. So far, many network topological methods have been proposed to identify the essential proteins. In this paper, we propose a new method, United complex Centrality(UC), to identify essential proteins by integrating protein complexes information and topological features of PPI network. By analysis of the relationship between protein complexes and essential proteins, we find that proteins appeared in multiple complexes are more inclined to be essential compared to these only appeared in a single complex. The experiment results show that protein complex information can help identify the essential proteins more accurate. Our method UC is obviously better than traditional centrality methods(DC, IC, EC, SC, BC, CC, NC) for identifying essential proteins. In addition, even compared with Harmonic Centricity which also used protein complexes information, it still has a great advantage. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

However, for the common NMF approach of minimizing the Euclidean distance between approximate and true values, the convergence of multiplicative update algorithms has not been well resolved. This paper first discusses the convergence of existing multiplicative update algorithms.

Based on the optimization principle and the auxiliary function method, we prove that our new algorithm not only converges to a stationary point, but also does faster than existing ones. To verify our theoretical results, the experiments on three data sets have been conducted by comparing our proposed algorithm with other existing methods.

84914703025	Prediction of essential proteins based on overlapping essential modules	Many computational methods have been proposed to identify essential proteins by using the topological features of interactome networks. However, the precision of essential protein discovery still needs to be improved. Researches show that majority of hubs (essential proteins) in the yeast interactome network are essential due to their involvement in essential complex biological modules and hubs can be classified into two categories: date hubs and party hubs. In this study, combining with gene expression profiles, we propose a new method to predict essential proteins based on overlapping essential modules, named POEM. In POEM, the original protein interactome network is partitioned into many overlapping essential modules. The frequencies and weighted degrees of proteins in these modules are employed to decide which categories does a protein belong to? The comparative results show that POEM outperforms the classical centrality measures: Degree Centrality (DC), Information Centrality (IC), Eigenvector Centrality (EC), Subgraph Centrality (SC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality (CC), Edge Clustering Coefficient Centrality (NC), and two newly proposed essential proteins prediction methods: PeC and CoEWC. Experimental results indicate that the precision of predicting essential proteins can be improved by considering the modularity of proteins and integrating gene expression profiles with network topological features.

84922005241	Prioritization of orphan disease-causing genes using topological feature and GO similarity between proteins in interaction networks	Identification of disease-causing genes among a large number of candidates is a fundamental challenge in human disease studies. However, it is still time-consuming and laborious to determine the real disease-causing genes by biological experiments. With the advances of the high-throughput techniques, a large number of protein-protein interactions have been produced. Therefore, to address this issue, several methods based on protein interaction network have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a shortest path-based algorithm, named SPranker, to prioritize disease-causing genes in protein interaction networks. Considering the fact that diseases with similar phenotypes are generally caused by functionally related genes, we further propose an improved algorithm SPGOranker by integrating the semantic similarity of GO annotations. SPGOranker not only considers the topological similarity between protein pairs in a protein interaction network but also takes their functional similarity into account. The proposed algorithms SPranker and SPGOranker were applied to 1598 known orphan disease-causing genes from 172 orphan diseases and compared with three state-of-the-art approaches, ICN, VS and RWR. The experimental results show that SPranker and SPGOranker outperform ICN, VS, and RWR for the prioritization of orphan disease-causing genes. Importantly, for the case study of severe combined immunodeficiency, SPranker and SPGOranker predict several novel causal genes.

84922094426	Disease gene identification by using graph kernels and Markov random fields	Genes associated with similar diseases are often functionally related. This principle is largely supported by many biological data sources, such as disease phenotype similarities, protein complexes, protein-protein interactions, pathways and gene expression profiles. Integrating multiple types of biological data is an effective method to identify disease genes for many genetic diseases. To capture the gene-disease associations based on biological networks, a kernel-based MRF method is proposed by combining graph kernels and the Markov random field (MRF) method. In the proposed method, three kinds of kernels are employed to describe the overall relationships of vertices in five biological networks, respectively, and a novel weighted MRF method is developed to integrate those data. In addition, an improved Gibbs sampling procedure and a novel parameter estimation method are proposed to generate predictions from the kernel-based MRF method. Numerical experiments are carried out by integrating known gene-disease associations, protein complexes, protein-protein interactions, pathways and gene expression profiles. The proposed kernel-based MRF method is evaluated by the leave-one-out cross validation paradigm, achieving an AUC score of 0.771 when integrating all those biological data in our experiments, which indicates that our proposed method is very promising compared with many existing methods.

However, a limitation of MCL and its variants (e.g. regularized MCL and soft regularized MCL) is that the clustering results are mostly dependent on the parameters that user-specified. However we know that different networks with various scales need different parameters. In this article, we propose a new MCL method based on the Firefly Algorithm (FA) to optimize its parameters.

84922822280	A logistic regression based algorithm for identifying human disease genes	The identification of disease genes is the first step towards the understanding of genetic disease mechanisms. Although many computational algorithms are proposed to identify disease genes, they either have poor performance in terms of AUC scores or are very time consuming. To overcome these two problems, a logistic regression based algorithm is proposed in this study for identifying disease genes. The issue of disease gene identification is formulated as a two-class classification problem, where one class represents those disease genes, while the other class represents non-disease genes. A binary logistic regression is employed to predict the posterior probability of a gene associated with disease by taking prior labels as the categorical dependent variables and label related feature vectors as predictor variables. Numerical experiments show that the proposed logistic regression based algorithm not only have a very good performance, but also significantly reduce the computing time. The AUC score is 0.737 when no prior information is used and it increases to 0.766 when protein complex data are integrated. Averagely, the proposed algorithm only takes 1.31% and 37.35% running time of the existing MRF method and RWR algorithm, respectively, when generating one prediction in the leave-one-out cross validation method.
