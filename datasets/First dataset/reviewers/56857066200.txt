84927959008	Trends in reporting injury as a cause of death among people with epilepsy in the U.S., 1981-2010	Purpose: To examine trends in reporting injury as a cause of death among people with epilepsy in the U.S. during the past three decades. Method: We analyzed the U.S. multiple causes of death data from death certificates in 1981-2010 to compare rate and odds ratios (OR) of reporting injury as cause of death among cases with vs. without mention of epilepsy across years. Results: The trends in reporting epilepsy with and without injury were similar in most age groups but were inconsistent in most external causes of injury. The OR of reporting injury was 1.02 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.97-1.07) in 1981-1985 and decreased to 0.52 (95% CI 0.48-0.55) in 2006-2010. The decline in OR was prominent among people aged 15-24 followed by people aged 25-44. For the five external causes of injury, the OR of suffocation and drowning were 6.32 (95% CI 5.91-6.75) and 5.64 (95% CI 5.16-6.16) in 1981-1985 and decreased to 3.03 (95% CI 2.74-3.35) and 2.56 (95% CI 2.18-3.00) in 2006-2010. The OR for poisoning and traffic crashes were 0.70 (95% CI 0.57-0.85) and 0.08 (95% CI 0.07- 0.09) in 1981-1985 and 0.21 (95% CI 0.18-0.25) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.05-0.08) in 2006-2010. Conclusion: The risk of fatal injury among people with epilepsy decreased drastically during the past three decades in most age groups and for most external causes of injury except falls. People with epilepsy had lower risks of dying from injury due to poisoning or traffic crashes, had higher risks of dying from suffocation and drowning.

9344231450	Problems related to disease classification grouping schemes in the cost-of-illness tabulation and introduction of Clinical Classification Software	Cost-of-illness tabulations are commonly used information in health service researches and administration decision-making. In order to tabulate the disease-specific cost of an illness, a scheme of grouping disease categories is needed in order to cluster related 4-digit or 5-digit categories into a meaningful and manageable number for the purposes of analysis and discussion. The aim of this study was to discuss the problems of currently used grouping scheme and to find out the modified grouping schemes that intended to resolve these problems. The problems in using the 'chapter' as a grouping schemes include: (1) the titles of the groups are too general and nonspecific; (2) the number of categories within each group varies greatly; (3) diseases classified within the same ICD chapter are too heterogeneous. The problems in using the 'basic tabulation list' as a grouping scheme include: (1) categories and number of disease in other residual groups are too large, and (2) diseases with similar etiology are scattered into different bodily organ system chapters. The Clinical Classification Software (CCS) grouping scheme was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to solve the above problems. The CCS could efficiently reduce the number of Other...' residual groups and of Chapter XVI 'signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions' and generally provides more specific information. Nevertheless, we should not overlook the problems of accuracy of diagnosis and multiple diagnoses in claims data.

1642354974	Long-term secular trends in birth weight and gestational age among live births in Taiwan	Objectives: To analyze the calendar-year specific distributions of birth weight and gestational age among live births in Taiwan for the years 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997. Methods: After excluding implausible gestational age and birth weight, we calculated calendar or birth characteristics specific means and standard deviations of gestational age and birth weight. We also estimated the calendar-year specific rates of low birth infants (<2500 grams) and pre-term birth (<37 completed gestational weeks). Certain infant and maternal characteristics suspected of being associated with birth weight or gestational age were also calculated. We finally draw a gestation specific birth weight curve for the years 1982 and 1997, respectively. Results: The mean birth weight decreased by 3.2% (105 grams) between 1982 and 1997, and the rate of low birth weight of infant increased by 33.3%. The gestational weeks also reduced by 2.3% (0.9 weeks) and the rate of pre-term birth increased dramatically by 230% (2.6%-6.3%). Triplets or higher births showed the most reduction in both birth weight (16.8%) and gestational age (8.5%). Between the study period, the sex ratio and birth order distribution showed little variation whereas the proportion of mothers aged 35 or more and that of multiple births increased substantially by 3.8 and 13 times, respectively. Conclusions: The reduction of birth weight and gestation during the study period is possibly related to improvement in both health care services and completeness of birth registration. An increase in multiple births and a higher survival rate of very pre-term birth (<34 weeks) might also contribute to the reduction of birth weight in recent years.

0031696461	Association of parental characteristics with adverse outcomes of adolescent pregnancy	Background. It is well-known that pregnancy in adolescence has an increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes. It remains unclear whether this association is due mainly to the unfavourable sociodemographic status or due solely to biological immaturity of pregnant adolescents. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the association of parental sociodemographic characteristics with the adverse outcomes of adolescent pregnancy. Method. Data from certificates of live births in Taichung County, Taiwan in 1994 of 7994 singleton, first-born babies whose mothers were 15-34 years of age were analysed. The relative risk of having adverse pregnancy outcomes for adolescent subgroups was obtained as compared with that among mothers 20-34 years of age with the same characteristics. The adjusted relative risk of having adverse pregnancy outcomes for each covariate was calculated by a multiple logistic regression analysis. Results. Of 7994 babies born to mothers of 15-34 years of age, 8.3% were born to adolescent mothers. In all age groups, the younger adolescent mothers (15-17 years of age) had the highest percentage of both infants with low birth weight (10.6%) and preterm births (7.1%). Younger adolescent mothers in almost all sociodemographic categories had higher risks of having both low-birth-weight and preterm births than those of older adolescent mothers. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a younger maternal age is the only significant risk factor for having infants with low birth weight (adjusted RR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-4.5 and adjusted RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.6 for younger and older adolescent mothers, respectively) or preterm birth (adjusted RR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.4 and adjusted RR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.3 for younger and older adolescent mothers, respectively). Conclusions. Adolescent pregnancy carries an increased risk of having low-birth-weight and preterm births, and a younger maternal age is causally implicated.

0031448702	Evaluating the validity of cause-of-death statistics in Taiwan (II): Characteristics of high frequency death certificates certifiers	This study describes the characteristics of high-frequency death certificate certifiers and the quality of their cause-of-death diagnoses in order to provide information for designing a program to improve the quality of cause-of-death statistics. In Taiwan, there were 111,927 death certificates issued in 1994 and the frequency of death certificates issued by one certifier a year was highly skewed. One hundred and ten doctors issued more than 100 death certificates a year. They comprised 0.67% of all certifiers, but the death certificates issued by them accounted for 22.47% of all death certificates. These certifiers had great influence on the quality of cause-of-death statistics in Taiwan. Most of these high frequency certifiers were: older in age, not graduated from medical schools, general practitioners and served in non-teaching hospitals or clinics. The percentage of formative errors on cause-of-death diagnoses was higher for high-frequency certifiers as compared to low-frequency certifiers. The special 'administrative certification' process in Taiwan is the reason for the large number of high-frequency death certifiers. The defects of this system are discussed and some proposals for improvements are raised in this study.

0032105253	Trends in injury mortality among adolescents in Taiwan, 1965-94	Objectives - To describe trends in injury mortality among adolescents in Taiwan for prioritising preventive interventions. Methods - Adolescent injury mortality data for Taiwan were derived from official publications of vital statistics from 1965 to 1994 to determine trends by sex and cause of death. Simple linear regression was used to test the trends. Results - The number of deaths due to injury among adolescents aged 10-19 years in Taiwan increased from 983 in 1965 to 1783 in 1994, an 81% increase. The injury mortality rate increased 42%, from 32.2 per 100 000 in 1965 to 45.6 per 100 000 in 1994. The proportion of injury deaths also increased, from 45.3% in 1965 to 72.8% in 1994. The trends in mortality from motor vehicle injury (MVI) among four demographic groups were all significantly positive (p<0.001). The proportion of deaths due to MVI among injury was 14% in 1965 and increased to 63% in 1994. Conclusions - The increase in injury mortality rates among adolescents over the past three decades appears to be due largely to the increase in MVI mortality rates with males aged 15-19 years accounting for most of this increase. Priorities for adolescents in Taiwan are MVI (especially motorcyclists) and drownings.

26644436951	An international comparison study indicated physicians' habits in reporting diabetes in part I of death certificate affected reported national diabetes mortality	Background and Objective: Physicians may find it confusing to decide whether to report diagnoses in part I or part II of the death certificate. The aim of this study was to contrast differences in diabetes mortality through a comparison of physicians' habits in reporting diabetes in part I of death certification among Taiwan, Australia, and Sweden. Methods: A cross-sectional, intercountry comparison study. We calculated the proportion of deaths with mention of diabetes in which diabetes was reported in part I of the death certificate and the proportion of deaths with mention of diabetes in which diabetes was selected as underlying cause of death. Results: We found that half of the differences in reported diabetes mortality among Taiwan, Australia, and Sweden were due to differences in reporting deaths with mention of diabetes anywhere on the certificate, and half due to differences in proportion of deaths with mention of diabetes in which diabetes was reported in part I of the death certificate. Conclusion: Differences in the reporting of diabetes in part I of the death certificate among physicians in Taiwan, Australia, and Sweden was one of the factors that affected differing reported diabetes mortality in Taiwan, Australia, and Sweden. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

2542444612	Quality of death certificates in Quemoy, Taiwan	Background and Purpose: The age-adjusted mortality rate on the island of Quemoy was the lowest of any county in Taiwan in the years 2000-2001. However, the island's rate of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases fluctuates widely. This fluctuation suggests that Quemoy may be issuing inaccurate death certificates. Methods: To assess the quality of death certificates from Quemoy, 123 (15.3%) medical records for 800 deaths between 1994 and 1998 were reviewed by 3 medical specialists. The underlying cause of death from the original death certificate was compared to the underlying cause of death determined by 3 reviewers based on review of all available medical records. Results: The agreement index for all causes of death was 72.4%. Neoplasm had the highest sensitivity and positive predictive value for correct determination of underlying cause of death. Cardiovascular diseases had higher sensitivity, but lower positive predictive value than respiratory diseases. Neoplasms were under-reported by 25.5% but cardiovascular diseases were over-reported by 34.3%. Conclusions: Therefore, mortality statistic in Quemoy, which are based on death certificate data, may underestimate the frequency of neoplasms and overestimate cardiovascular diseases underlying causes of death. Our findings also suggest that researchers should exercise considerable caution when using death certificate data to determine cause of death in etiologic studies, especially in neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases.

27544473983	Aetiology of sexually transmitted disease (STD) and comparison of STD syndromes and aetiological diagnosis in Taipei, Taiwan	Between July 2002 and July 2004, all male patients (n = 307) presenting to a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic who reported unprotected sex were enrolled in the study. Of these, 63 (20.5%), 19 (6.2%) and one (0.3%) were infected with one, two and three pathogens, respectively. The prevalences of chlamydial infection, gonorrhoea, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection and trichomoniasis were 14.3%, 10.1%, 6.8%, 2.2% and 0%, respectively. The sensitivities of urethral discharge syndrome for detection of chlamydial, gonococcal, and combined forms of infection were 31.8%, 58.5% and 70.0%, respectively, with specificities of 93.5%, 97.1% and 93.9%, respectively. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were 56.0%, 68.0% and 28.0% for chlamydial and gonococcal infections and combinations of the two forms, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity of genital ulceration syndrome for syphilis detection was only 38.0%, although the specificity was 82.5%, and the PPV was 32.0%. To reduce the number of false-positive results for STD patients who practise unprotected sex, incorporation of risk assessment and rapid diagnostic tests are recommended. © 2005 Copyright by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

27744564978	The Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME) system objectively assessed the appropriateness of underlying cause-of-death certification and assignment	Background and Objectives: To assess the feasibility of using the Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME) system to objectively define the appropriateness of tuberculosis (TB) related underlying cause of death (UCD) certification and the accuracy of UCD assignment. Methods: All death certificates issued in 2002 in Taiwan in which TB was mentioned were extracted for analysis. Certification of the UCD was defined as inappropriate when ACME used Rule 1 or Rule 2 in assigning the UCD. The assignment of the UCD was defined as inaccurate when the UCD selected by coders was discordant with the UCD selected by ACME. Results: Of the 2,129 death certificates mentioned TB, half (1,067 of 2,129) were inappropriately certified by physicians and 16.5% (351 of 2129) had an inaccurately assigned UCD by coders. The discrepancy rate in UCD assignment between coders and ACME increased when the number of diagnoses increased, TB was listed in Part II, and the certification of UCD was inappropriate. Conclusions: It is feasible to use the process information in ACME to objectively define the appropriateness of UCD certification and the accuracy of UCD assignment. Inappropriate certification of the UCD and TB being listed in Part II were the two most important factors associated incorrect interpretation of the World Health Organization Selection Rules by coders. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

33645318984	Differences in the prescription patterns of anti-asthmatic medications for children by pediatricians, family physicians and physicians of other specialties	Background: Prescription patterns of anti-asthma medications in children vary among doctors in different disciplines and settings, and may reflect differences in treatment outcome. The purpose of this study was to analyze the prescribing patterns of anti-asthma drugs by pediatricians, family physicians and other practitioners. Methods: Data for a total of 225,537 anti-asthma prescriptions were collected from the National Health Insurance Research Database for the period from January 1, 2002 to March 31, 2002. These medications included inhaled and oral adrenergics, inhaled and oral corticosteroids, xanthine derivatives, and leukotriene receptor antagonists prescribed by general pediatricians, family physicians and physicians in other disciplines. Results: Oral β2-agonist was the most commonly prescribed drug used as monotherapy, with prescription rates of 70.4%, 46.9% and 58.0% by pediatricians, family physicians and other physicians, respectively. A xanthine derivative was the next most commonly prescribed monotherapy. Oral corticosteroid combined with oral β2-agonist, followed by oral β2-agonist combined with a xanthine derivative were the two most commonly prescribed dual-agent combined therapies by all three physician categories. The prescription rate for inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy was 7.8% by pediatricians, 5.6% by family physicians, and 8.0% by other physicians. The prescription rate for inhaled adrenergic was the highest in family physicians (14.9%), followed by the other physicians (7.2%), and was lowest in pediatricians (3.1%). Conclusion: Pediatricians and f amily physicians appeared to share similar opinions on the medical management of children with asthma in that both most commonly prescribed oral β2-agonists and xanthine derivatives, either alone or in combination. Family physicians were least likely to prescribe an inhaled corticosteroid and most likely to prescribe an inhaled adrenergic agent. ©2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33746966736	Changes in causes of death and associated conditions among persons with HIV/AIDS after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in Taiwan	To assess the pattern of change in the causes of death among HIV/AIDS patients in Taiwan after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), national HIV/AIDS registry data were linked with cause of death and health insurance claims data from 1994 to 2002 for analysis. Although HIV/AIDS remained the leading underlying cause of death among HIV/AIDS patients during the study period (552/752 = 73.4%), an increased proportion of deaths was due to non-HIV/AIDS causes (other infectious diseases, cancers, liver diseases, etc.) after the introduction of HAART in 1997. Deaths from suicide increased threefold, from three (1.5% of total) in 1994-1996 to 14 (4.8%) in 2000-2002. Most AIDS-related conditions associated with death (cryptococcosis, cachexia/wasting, dementia/encephalopathy, etc.) decreased in frequency from 1998-2000 to 2001-2002. Nonetheless, some AIDS-related conditions associated with death remained stable or increased in frequency, such as candidiasis, tuberculosis, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In conclusion, as the duration of survival increased, the likelihood of suicide also increased. More effort is required to address the mental health of HIV/AIDS patients as a part of therapy. © 2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33747178935	Association between the accessibility to lethal methods and method-specific suicide rates: An ecological study in Taiwan	Objective: To examine the association between availability of lethal methods of suicide and method-specific suicide rates at the city/county level in Taiwan. Method: Age-adjusted and age-specific suicide rates of 23 cities/counties in Taiwan for the years 1999 to 2003 were calculated. Partial correlation coefficients were used to examine cross-sectional associations between independent variables, i.e., proportion of agricultural population and proportion of households living on the sixth floor or above, and suicide rates by different methods (poisoning by solids/liquids, jumping, and hanging) after adjusting for unemployment rates and prevalence of depression. Results: The partial correlation coefficient was 0.77 (p < .001) for proportion of agricultural population with solids/liquids poisoning suicide rates. It was 0.73 (p < .001) for the proportion of households living on the sixth floor or above with suicide rates by jumping. Correlations between hanging suicide rates and proportion of agricultural population or between hanging suicide rates and proportion of households living on the sixth floor or above were not significant. Conclusion: The results showed strong positive associations between access to lethal methods and method-specific suicide rates. Controlling the availability of pesticides and fencing high buildings or installing window guards may be effective measures for suicide prevention.

33747228468	External cause of injury coding: A comparison of the Ninth and Tenth Revisions of International Classification of Diseases	Objective: To contrast the differences in the classification scheme of external cause of injury (ECI) coding between the Tenth and Ninth Revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10). Methods: We first reviewed the relevant references and then contrasted each code of four main ECI (i.e., land transport, falls, drowning and poisoning) and intent and mechanism matrix between ICD-9 and ICD-10. Results: The ECI was a supplement in ICD-9 and became a formal chapter in ICD-10. The number of 3-digit codes is 372 and 192 in ICD-10 and ICD-9, respectively. Two optional 4 digit codes (i.e., place of injury and activity) were added in ICD-10, which could provide more information on environmental events and circumstances. A matrix classification scheme was used for land transport coding in ICD-10, a complete code should include the road user type (e.g., pedestrian, bicycle, motorcycle or car) of both victim and counterpart. Most of the newly added codes in ICD-10 for falls are elderly-related (e.g., being carried or supported by other persons, involving wheelchair or other furniture). The 4th digit of drowning codes concerned more on activities (e.g., sports, recreations or work related) in ICD-9. Nevertheless, in ICD-10 more information was required regarding to place and circumstances (e.g., bath-tub, swimming pool or natural water). Besides, ICD-10 further classified drowning as 'while in' (e.g., swimming pool) or 'fall into' (e.g., swimming pool), which had different implication for injury prevention. Poisoning was the only main ECI of which the number of codes decreased from ICD-9 to ICD-10. Conclusions: With regard to the classification scheme, ECI in ICD-10 could provide more information on environmental events and circumstances compared with ICD-9. However, the 4th digit-related information was not available in Taiwan because only 3-digit codes were used for ICD-9. The 4-digit codes will be used in Taiwan for ICD-10, the ECI information will be increased.

33750706591	Mothers tended to overreport categorical infant birth weight of their children	Objectives: We validated infant birth weight by interview with mothers. Study Design and Setting: Infant birth weights obtained from maternal interview were compared with the data documented in birth certificates. Study subjects were mothers of 1,432 schoolchildren who participated in a diabetes mass screening program in 1992-1997, Taiwan. Data of infant birth weight obtained from telephone interview with mothers were compared with those from birth certificates to evaluate the accuracy of maternal report in eight categorized groups: <2,000, 2,000-2,499, 2,500-2,999, 3,000-3,499, 3,500-3,999, 4,000-4,499, 4,500-4,999, and ≥ 5,000 g. Results: The exact agreement was as low as 15.9% but increased substantially to 67.7% if maternal reports of weight one category higher than birth registry weight were considered to be indicative of agreement. Lower orders of birth weight were significantly associated with reports of higher category. But teen mothers and/or low-income mothers were associated with lower risks of overreport. Conclusion: Our data suggested that birth weight-associated studies in Taiwan should "round number" to an upper category rather than a lower category to avoid serious misclassification in birth weight. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33750906762	Certifying diabetes-related cause-of-death: A comparison of inappropriate certification statements in Sweden, Taiwan and the USA	Aims/hypothesis: The aim of this study was to assess differences in the certification practices of physicians in Sweden, Taiwan and the USA with regard to diabetes-related cause-of-death (COD) statements. Methods: Multiple-cause-of-death data from Sweden (2000), Taiwan (2001) and the USA (2001) were used for this study. All deaths with mention of diabetes anywhere on the death certificate were extracted for analysis. Two types of inappropriate COD statements were: (1) reporting two or more diagnoses per line; and (2) entering an incorrect causal sequence among reported diagnoses. Results: Of those deaths in which diabetes was reported in Part I of the death certificate, American physicians (19%) were less likely to report two or more diagnoses per line than physicians in Sweden (46%) and Taiwan (56%). On the other hand, Swedish physicians (5%) were less likely to report incorrect causal sequences than were their counterparts in Taiwan (21%) and the USA (28%). Conclusions/interpretation: These findings reveal substantial differences in diabetes-related COD statements among physicians in Sweden, Taiwan and the USA, implying that caution should be used when interpreting differences in mortality statistics between these countries. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

33845310310	Mind your manners: Quality of manner of death certification among medical examiners and coroners in Taiwan	To assess the quality of manner of death (MOD) certification among medical examiners/coroners (ME/Cs) in Taiwan, death certificates issued in 2002 for which the final MOD was suicide or undetermined were extracted for analysis. Indicators of the quality of MOD certification included (1) MOD not given by the ME/Cs; (2) MOD assigned by the ME/Cs was changed by the coder; (3) ratio between undetermined and suicide deaths (U/S ratio). There were 450 death certificates for which the ME/Cs did not assign the MOD in the original certificate. Three fifths (285/450) of them were issued by 4 ME/Cs. The same 4 ME/Cs also had extremely high U/S ratios (1.25-1.84) compared with the average (0.31). The overall quality of MOD certification among ME/Cs in Taiwan was fair; only a small number of ME/Cs had poor quality in MOD certification. The high U/S ratio among the 4 ME/Cs would certainly affect the suicide mortality rates of the counties the 4 ME/Cs were in charge of. Actions should be taken to improve the certification quality of these 4 ME/Cs. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

33846420190	Health-care utilization and costs in Taiwanese pediatric patients with asthma	Background: In many countries, the burden of asthma is sufficient to warrant recognition as a high-priority disorder in governmental health strategies. However, the components of the total health-care costs for pediatric patients with asthma have not been well studied, and an overall understanding of health-care utilization patterns in this population is lacking in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 33 461 patients aged 3-17 years who were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Research database from 1 January to 31 December 2002 were evaluated. Health-care utilization and costs, including those related to office, outpatient hospital, emergency department, and inpatient hospital visits were compared between pediatric patients with and without asthma. Results: In 2002, the period prevalence of treated asthma was 6.0%. Pediatric patients with asthma used substantially more services than did those without asthma in all categories. Hospital outpatient visits and overall health-care expenditure for patients with asthma were 2.2-fold higher than those of patients without asthma. Asthma care represented 20% of all health-care services that patients with asthma received, while the remaining 80% were for non-asthma care. Almost three-fourths of all asthma-related costs were attributable to office and hospital outpatient visits; one-fourth was attributable to urgent care and hospitalizations. Conclusions: These findings may serve as baseline data for future evaluation of changes in health-care utilization and expenditure among pediatric patients with asthma. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia.

34547881088	Risks and causes of mortality among low-birthweight infants in childhood and adolescence	The purpose of the study was to estimate the risks of mortality among infants with low birthweight (LBW, <2500 g) during their childhood and adolescence using a prospective cohort design. A total of 341 249 livebirths were registered in the 1985 Taiwan Birth Registry. We identified the 11 701 LBW singletons and randomly selected the same number of normal-birthweight (NBW) singletons. Study subjects of both LBW and NBW groups were linked, through the individual's unique personal identification number, to the Taiwan Death Registry to identify those who died between 1985 and 2003. Using the life-table method, we calculated the age-specific and cumulative survival rate for both LBW and NBW groups. We used Cox's proportional hazard model with adjustment for potential confounders to estimate the age-specific hazard ratio (HR) of mortality. Age-specific causes of mortality were presented for both groups. The result showed that the cumulative survival rate over an 18-year period for the LBW and NBW subjects was estimated at 95.83% and 99.37%, respectively. Significantly increased adjusted HR of mortality associated with LBW was limited to ages <1 year (boys: 8.99; girls: 8.29) and 1-4 years (boys: 2.19; girls: 2.25). Conditions originating in the perinatal period and congenital anomalies were the most prevalent cause of death among LBW and NBW, respectively. Between ages 1 and 18 years, injury and poisoning became the top ranked causes of death irrespective of birthweight and gender. Although there were small numbers of congenital anomalies, they were still a leading cause of death for LBW subjects, but not for NBW subjects, at ages 5-18 years. The LBW subjects were also likely to suffer from respiratory causes at 5-18 years. This study suggested, therefore, that LBW infants tended to have significantly elevated mortality rates under the age of 5 years, and were vulnerable to more non-injury deaths in their childhood and adolescence. © 2007 The Authors.

34547917620	Impact of SARS on healthcare utilization by disease categories: Implications for delivery of healthcare services	Objective: To assess the impact of the SARS epidemics in Taiwan on ambulatory care and inpatient utilization by disease categories and accreditation levels of hospital. Methods: The National Health Insurance claims data of Taipei were analyzed. We calculated the changes in utilization between June 2002 and June 2003 to estimate the impact that SARS had on utilization. Results: The top three disease categories with the most significant drop in utilization were gastroenteritis (-53%), acute bronchitis (-45%), and tonsillitis (-40%) in ambulatory care and acute bronchitis (-82%), gastroenteritis (-72%), and pneumonia (-64%) in inpatient care. On the other hand, the disease categories with the smallest reduction were allergic reactions (-4%), skin infections (-6%), and anxiety (-10%) in ambulatory care and respiratory failure (+40%), delivery (-2%), and fractures of lower limbs (-5%) in inpatient care. Conclusions: Disease categories could be classified into three groups according to the extent of change in utilization during the SARS outbreaks. Diseases with a prominent reduction were respiratory diseases, minor problems, and elective procedures. Diseases with a moderate reduction were mainly chronic diseases. Diseases with a limited reduction were acute conditions, difficult mental disorders, or procedures that could not be postponed. The utilization of some diseases shifted significantly from medical centers to district hospitals or clinics. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

34848840351	Proportion of injury deaths with unspecified external cause codes: A comparison of Australia, Sweden, Taiwan and the US	Background: The proportion of injury deaths with unspecified external cause codes has been used as an indicator of the level of comprehensiveness and specificity of information on death certificates provided by certifiers. Objective: To compare the proportion of unspecified external cause codes across countries. Methods: Multiple-cause-of-death mortality data for people who died in 2001 due to external causes in Australia, Sweden, Taiwan and the USA were used for this international comparison study. The proportion of injury deaths coded as due to an unspecified external cause (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, ICD-10, chapter XX) to all injury deaths in each block was calculated. Results: Sweden (33%) had the highest proportion of use of the least specific code (ICD-10 code X59 exposure to unspecified factor), followed by Australia (17%), Taiwan (13%) and the USA (7%). More than two-thirds of the deceased for whom an ICD-10 code X59 was assigned in Sweden and Australia were those aged ≥65 years, and more than half of them had femoral fractures. The percentage of use of the unspecified codes within specific groups of external causes was relatively high for falls and unintentional drowning. Conclusions: Caution should be used in examining the compensatory effects of the unspecified external event code (ICD-10 code X59) on specific external causes (especially falls) when making international comparisons. Efforts are needed to educate certifiers to report sufficient information for specific coding so as to provide more useful information for injury prevention.

0033027691	Demographic characteristics of fathers of infants born to adolescent mothers in Taiwan	It has been well accepted that effective programs for prevention of adolescent pregnancy should involve adolescent women and their partners. Using data from certificates of live births in Taichung County, Taiwan, in 1994, the demographic characteristics of fathers whose infants were born to adolescent women were compared with a matched group fathers whose infants were born to women aged ≥20 years. Most of the fathers of infants born to adolescent women were adults: 57% of the fathers of infants born to women aged ≤15 years were ≥30 years of age. Fathers of infants born to adolescent women had a lower educational level than that of matched fathers. These demographic characteristics of fathers should be carefully interpreted and taken into consideration in developing intervention programs.

0032894096	A preliminary study of the relationships between place of occurrence, place of death and pacce of residence in motor vehicle injury: Experience in the Huatung area	To assess the problems of regional mortality rates from motor vehicle injury (MVI) calculated according to place of residence, we retrospectively interviewed families of people who died from MVI during the years 1994 and 1995 in Hualien County and Taitung County. Seventeen percent (94/559) of MVI deaths occurred outside the resident county in Hualien County and 35% (113/323) in Taitung County. The characteristics of victims whose accidents occurred outside the county differed significantly in age distribution and pattern of road use. Among those in which the exact place of occurrence and place of death (recorded on death certificates) were known, in 99% (548/551) in Hualien County and 96% (301/315) in Taitung County, the place of occurrence and the place of death were in the same county. Because a high proportion of deaths occurred outside the resident county, the use of county-level regional mortality from MVIs calculated according to the place of residence should be evaluated very cautiously. At least in the Huatung area, the place of death recorded on the death certificate can be used as a proxy of the place of occurrence of the MVI. A control program targeting injuries which occur outside the resident county should be different from a program dealing with injuries which occur within the resident county.

0034036437	Accuracy of cause-of-death coding in Taiwan: Types of miscoding and effects on mortality statistics	Background. The objectives of this study were to assess the accuracy of cause-of-death coding, determine the extent to which coders follow the selection rules of coding set out in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), and the effects of miscoding on mortality statistics in Taiwan. Method. A systematic sample of 5621 death certificates was reviewed. The underlying cause of death (UCD) selected by the reviewer for each death certificate was compared with that selected by the original coder. The UCD was selected according to ACME (Automated Classification of Medical Entities) Decision Tables. Results. The overall agreement rates between the reviewer and coders according to the three-digit and two-digit categories of ICD-9 were 80.9% and 83.9%, respectively. Good agreement was found for malignant neoplasms (kappa = 0.94) and injuries and poisoning (kappa = 0.97), but there was poor agreement for nephrotic diseases (kappa = 0.74), hypertension-related diseases (kappa = 0.74), and cerebral infarction (kappa = 0.77). Reasons for disagreements included disagreement in nomenclature (42.8%), inappropriate judgement of causal relationships (41.5%), and incorrect interpretation of Selection Rule 3 and Modification Rules (15.7%). Conclusion. This study showed various levels of agreement for different diseases between the reviewer and the original coders in selection of the UCD. Owing to the 'compensatory effect of errors', the national mortality statistics were not affected significantly. The national administration should undertake routine internal studies to control the quality of UCD coding practices.

0033987346	Regional mortality from motor vehicle traffic injury: Relationships among place-of-occurrence, place-of-death, and place-of-residence	Regional mortality data, which are compiled according to place-of-residence of the decedent, are an important reference for regional health planning and resource allocation. However, it would be inappropriate to apply these data to studies of environmental risk factors if a large proportion of fatal motor vehicle traffic injuries (MVTI) in fact occur outside the resident county. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion and characteristics of residents of a rural area of Taiwan who died from MVTIs that occurred outside the county of residence. We also explored the relationships among the place-of-occurrence, place-of-death, and place-of-residence of these decedents. The families or neighbors of residents of Huatung Area (eastern Taiwan) who died from MVTIs in 1994 or 1995 were interviewed to identify the place-of-occurrence of the MVTI. Of the 882 Huatung Area residents who died as a result of an MVTI during the study period and for whom relevant data were available, the MVTI occurred outside the resident county in 207 (23%) cases. Residents whose MVTI occurred outside the county of residence were more likely to be youths (aged 15-24) or young adults (aged 25-44) and driving automobiles or trucks. Of the 866 cases in which the exact place was known, the place-of-occurrence and the place-of-death (recorded on the death certificate) were in the same county in 849 (98%). Because a high proportion of fatal MVTIs occurred outside the resident county, the mortality rate calculated according to place-of-residence does not accurately reflect the environmental risk factors in this area. The finding that the characteristics of those whose MVTI occurred outside the county differed from those decedents whose MVTI occurred within the county indicates that there are two target groups for prevention programs. In addition, at least in Huatung Area, the place-of-death recorded on the death certificate could serve as a surrogate for the place-of-occurrence in epidemiologic studies. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

39549113457	Assessing the quality of tuberculosis-related underlying cause of death assignment in Taiwan, 2001-2005	Background/Purpose: Assignment of underlying cause of death (UCOD) might be inconsistent among coders if physicians do not properly record cause of death on death certificates. This study aimed to assess the changes in the quality of tuberculosis-related UCOD assignment in Taiwan after interventions by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Methods: The reference (gold standard) we used to assess the quality of UCOD assignment by coders was the UCOD selected by the Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME) computer program. The agreement, over- and under-coding rates between coders and the reference were calculated by years before and after the CDC interventions. Results: An abrupt decrease in tuberculosis death rates according to the UCOD assigned by coders was noted from 2003 to 2004, but no such decrease was noted according to the reference. The agreement in UCOD assignments between coders and ACME decreased from 0.75 in 2001 to 0.67 in 2005. We found a significant decrease in the over-coding rate from 0.21 in 2003 to 0.11 in 2004, and a prominent increase in under-coding rates from 0.08 in 2003 to 0.24 in 2004. Conclusion: The abrupt decrease in the official published tuberculosis mortality rate from 2003 to 2004 was due to significant changes in the practice of UCOD assignment of official coders, which might have been a response to interventions initiated by the CDC. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

40149092990	Suicide mortality trends by sex, age and method in Taiwan, 1971-2005	Background. Method-specific suicide trends varied across countries, and studies of the trends in different countries can contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of suicide. The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in suicide trends by sex, age and method in the years 1971 to 2005 in Taiwan. Methods. Mortality data files of suicide and undetermined deaths for the years 1971-2005 were obtained for analyses. Age-, sex- and method-specific suicide rates were calculated by four age groups (15-24, 25-44, 45-64 and 65 and above) and five suicide methods (solids/liquids poisoning, other gases poisoning, hanging, jumping, and others). Results. Both sexes experienced downward trends from 1971 to 1993, and then an upward trend since 1993. People aged 65 years and above had the highest suicide rates throughout the study periods. However, males aged 25-64 years experienced the steepest increasing trends. As to suicide methods, an annual increase, since 1991, of people jumping from heights to commit suicide, and a marked increase, since 1998, of people completing suicide by poisoning with other gases (mainly charcoal-burning) were observed. Conclusion. Suicide by means of charcoal-burning and jumping from heights has become a serious public health problem in Taiwan. Preventive measures to curb these increasing trends are urgently needed. © 2008 Lin and Lu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

3342906192	Validation of the Taiwan Birth Registry using obstetric records	Background and Purpose: Birth certificates are a major source of population-based data often used in maternal and child health research, but their value depends upon the level of accuracy of the data. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of the birth registry data in Taiwan. Methods: Obstetric records of a total of 2779 infants born at a municipal hospital in Taipei between 1995 and 1997 were abstracted and linked to the Taiwan Birth Registry (TBR). Concordance was presented by agreement percentages for various birth characteristics including gender, birth order, birth weight, and gestational age. Concordance was further assessed using Cohen's k and sensitivity/specificity for both birth weight and gestational age, with both variables categorized according to their customary definitions. Results: Missing data for specific items in the TBR ranged from 0% (gender) to 1.6% (birth order). The birth registry accurately reported all 4 selected items, with the highest and lowest concordance percentage noted for gender (99.0%) and gestational age (88.3%), respectively. The level of agreement indicated by the Cohen's k statistic, ranged from 0.92 to 0.96 for birth weight and gestational age when both variables were treated as categorical variables. Conclusions: The TBR showed a low rate of missing information and high levels of validity for the elements frequently used in maternal and child health research in Taiwan.

41249094359	Belief in ghost month can help prevent drowning deaths: A natural experiment on the effects of cultural beliefs on risky behaviours	Studies have suggested that cultural beliefs, such as those underlying religious social occasions and superstitions, have both positive and negative effects on mortality rates. Many people in Southern China believe that there are wandering ghosts who were released from hell during the lunar month of July (ghost month: mostly August in the Gregorian calendar): people therefore avoid unnecessary risky activities during ghost month. The aim of this study was to examine whether unintentional drowning deaths decreased during ghost month, using a matched control design and mortality data of Taiwan between 1981 and 2005. Results show that overall days-adjusted monthly death rate in ghost month days in Gregorian August was 1.37 (per 1,000,000). This was significantly lower than those in non-ghost month days, which was 1.67. The mean number of deaths in ghost months was lower than that in the matched controls, which was -3.2 deaths (-2.6 to -3.5) during weekends and -4.5 deaths (-2.2 to -7.2) during weekdays. The differences were more prominent in men than in women. For other main causes of death, we did not find persistent significant differences throughout the four matched controls. In conclusion, our findings support the death-dip hypothesis. Possible mechanisms are that people who believe in the ghost month might either decrease their exposure to water-related activities or involve themselves less in risky behaviours during ghost month, as a kind of risk compensation, consequently resulting in a reduction in the number of drowning deaths. As such we conclude that cultural factors should be taken into consideration when designing injury prevention programs. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0034928489	Comparison of official coders versus physician panel in assignment of underlying cause of death	Background and purpose: In outcome analyses of clinical trials and mortality follow-up studies, the underlying cause of death (UCOD) is commonly assigned either by official coders or by a panel of physicians. We evaluated the validity of UCOD assigned by official coders by comparison with the assignments of a panel of physicians who reviewed the available medical records of the deceased. Methods: The comparisons focused on deaths occurring from October 1995 through June 1998 in a series of residents in a veterans home. Because of limited resources, only the first 104 deaths that occurred during the study period were included. Agreement rate, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa statistics were calculated to assess the consistency of coder versus physician panel assignment of UCOD by selected main causes of death. For 32 of the 104 deaths, the panel concluded that the information obtained from medical records was insufficient to determine the UCOD, and the following analyses were confined to the other 72 deaths. Results: For the 72 deaths considered by the panel to have sufficient information to determine UCOD, all four physicians agreed on a single UCOD in 50 (69%) cases, while three or four agreed in 66 (92%) cases. A consensus was reached in cases with disagreement. The two procedures completely agreed in 40 (56%) of the deaths. For general category UCOD, the kappa value was high for cancer (0.83) and cardiovascular disease (CVD, 0.73) but only moderate for pulmonary disease (PD, 0.60). When the UCOD assigned by the panel was used as the gold standard, official coders showed relatively low sensitivity for correct determination of UCOD in cases of CVD (0.76) compared with cancer (0.86) and PD (0.80). Conclusions: Given the high inter-physician consistency and the relatively low sensitivity of official coders in assigning CVD as the UCOD, we conclude that the use of clinical review panels would provide more accurate UCOD assignments for use in outcome analyses in mortality follow-up studies and clinical trials in Taiwan.

77954813270	Whether to report diabetes as the underlying cause-of-death? A survey of internists of different sub-specialties	Background: Cause-specific mortality is a commonly used endpoint of clinical trials or prospective studies. However, it is sometimes difficult for physician to determine the underlying-cause-of-death (UCD), especially for diabetic patients coexisted with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The aim of this survey was to examine whether internists with different specialties have different opinions on the reporting of diabetes as the UCD.Methods: A total of 549 physicians completed the questionnaire in Taiwan, which comprised seven hypothetical case scenarios, each indicating a different level of contribution of diabetes in initiating the chain of events leading to death.Results: As a whole, endocrinologists were more likely than cardiologists and nephrologists to report diabetes as the UCD. The differences were more prominent when the diabetic patient had a coexisting CVD. In scenario 3 (a diabetic patient with hypertension who died from acute myocardial infarction), the percentage was 56% in endocrinologists, which was significantly higher than in cardiologists (42%) and nephrologists (41%). In scenario 4 (a diabetic patient with hypertension who died from cerebrovascular infarction), the percentage was 45% in endocrinologists, and only 31% in cardiologists and 36% in nephrologists.Conclusions: Internists of different sub-specialties do have different opinions on the reporting of diabetes as the UCD, especially when the diabetic patient has a coexisting CVD. © 2010 Lu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80052512289	Are structural characteristics of programs and hospitals associated with 100-day readmission of hematopoietic SCTs in Taiwan	Hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) is one treatment modality for hematological malignancies. It is increasingly common but remains centralized in certain hospitals wherein procedures and protocols can vary. This study examined 100-day readmission for patients with hematological malignancies undergoing HSCT in Taiwan from the years 2001 to 2006. Of particular interest was an examination of how HSCT program characteristics might influence outcomes. This population-based retrospective cohort study with longitudinal follow-up used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A generalized linear model with a logistic-dependent variable representing being admitted or not admitted was used to model 100-day readmission, adjusting for the nested design. There were 718 HSCT recipients for hematological malignancies in the 5-year study period from 10 HSCT programs. In spite of the average length of stay of 43.71 days (s.d.25.75) days, 52% of recipients were readmitted within 100 days of discharge. Ownership status, the number of HSCT hematologists, and the ratio of HSCT procedures to HSCT hematologists independently predicted 100-day readmission after adjusting for clustered data and controlling for recipient characteristics. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

80052630622	Offspring birth weight and risk of mortality from diabetes in mothers	Background: Mothers with lower birth weight (LBW) offspring have been found to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity, which shares many risk factors with diabetes. Aims: To investigate the relation between offspring birth weight and maternal risk of mortality from diabetes. Methods: A total of 1 400 383 singletons of primigravida registered in Taiwan between 1978 and 1987 were followed to the end of 2006. The offspring birth weight was assessed with and without standardisation for the gestational age of offspring. Cox model was used to estimate the HR of maternal diabetes mortality in relation to offspring birth weights. Results: Altogether, 812 (5.8%) mothers died of diabetes. Mothers with LBW (<2500 g) and macrosomia (>4000 g) offspring were both at increased risks of mortality from diabetes with HR 1.76 (95% CI 1.46 to 2.19) and 2.86 (95% CI 2.32 to 3.53), respectively. Similar results were seen while birth weight was standardised for gestational age. Conclusions: This cohort study found that mothers with LBW and macrosomia offspring had an increased mortality risk of diabetes. This relationship could be attributable to the possible pathway of intergenerational effects or maternal insulin resistance due to maladaptation to pregnancy.

84861456380	Reducing regional inequality in mortality from road traffic injuries through enforcement of the mandatory motorcycle helmet law in Taiwan	Background This study was conducted to examine whether passage of the mandatory motorcycle helmet law in 1997 reduced the regional inequality in mortality from road traffic injuries (RTIs) across 22 cities/counties in Taiwan. Methods We calculated the absolute (between-group variance, BGV) and relative (rate ratio between the city/ county with the highest and lowest rate, RR) terms of inequality for the overall and motorcycle-related RTI mortality rates, the rate of helmet use and three other explanatory factors associated with RTI mortality at the city/county level from 1997 through 2008. Results The BGV of the overall and motorcycle-related RTI mortality rates across the 22 cities/counties showed persistently decreasing trends from 1997 to 2008; however, the RR of RTI mortality first increased and then levelled off from 2002. The decreasing trend in inequality was most prominent in males aged 0e24 years. The BGV and RR of the rate of motorcycle helmet use decreased after passage of the law but increased from 2002 onwards. Conclusion In Taiwan, passage of the mandatory motorcycle helmet law reduced the regional inequality in RTI mortality; however, a resurgence in regional inequality in the helmet use rate years after passage of the helmet law was noted. It is therefore necessary to monitor the helmet use rate after passage of such a law to ensure the effect of a reduction in regional inequality in RTI mortality.

44449155279	Non-referral of unnatural deaths to coroners and non-reporting of unnatural deaths on death certificates in Taiwan: Implications of using mortality data to monitor quality and safety in healthcare	Background: Mortality data has often been used to monitor the quality of cardiac care. Objective: To investigate the under-reporting of unnatural deaths in mortality data. Method: All patients with a main discharge diagnosis ofinjury (ICD-9-CM code 800-999) who died in 2003 or 2004 were identified through record linkage between hospital discharge claims data and cause of death data in Taiwan. Percentages of unnatural deaths that had been referred to the coroner and in which injury-related information was reported on the death certificate were estimated. Results: Of 4086 known or suspected unnatural deaths, only 57% (2346/ 4086) were referred to the coroner, and in 71% (2889/4086) injury-related information was reported on the death certificate. The percentages of referral and reporting were lowest for deaths related to complications in medical and surgical care. In deaths related to fracture of the femur and the effects of a foreign body, many doctors report injury-related information on the death certificate but do not refer the certification of cause of death to the coroner. Conclusions: The sensitivity of using mortality data alone to detect known or suspected unnatural deaths varied according to the types of injury and external causes. Monitoring cause of death data linked with hospital discharge record data could provide a better system for discovering these unnatural deaths. © The Author 2008.

49349110499	Low Birth Weight, Prematurity, and Paternal Social Status: Impact on the Basic Competence Test in Taiwanese Adolescents	Objective: To investigate whether birth weight and paternal education may have independent and interactive effects on the learning achievement of adolescents. Study design: We linked birth weights, gestational ages (term or preterm) and paternal education of a 4-year birth cohort to the Basic Competence Test (BCT) scores in Mandarin, mathematics and science for junior high school students age 15 to 16 years. The study groups comprised infants with term low birth weight (TLBW; n = 33 507), preterm normal birth weight (PNBW; n =19 905), and preterm low birth weight (PLBW; n = 25 840), as well as randomly selected term infants with normal birth weight (TNBW; n = 83 756). Paternal education levels were categorized. Results: Compared with the TNBW adolescents, the TLBW adolescents consistently showed larger deficits in mean scores for Mandarin (β = -2.36), mathematics (β = -2.89), and science (β = -2.11). The corresponding significant deficit scores for the PLBW adolescents were -1.93, -2.80, and -1.92. The deficit scores were very small for the PNBW adolescents. Paternal education was inversely associated with scores of all 3 groups. Lower paternal education level tended to worsen the negative impact of low birth weight on BCT scores. Conclusions: Both lower birth weight and lower paternal education exert an independent and interactive effect on adolescent learning achievement. © 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

57149142492	Differences in urban and rural accident characteristics and medical service utilization for traffic fatalities in less-motorized societies	Introduction: Fatalities from traffic accidents in less-motorized societies are an important global issue. We aimed to characterize the geographic differences of fatalities in such societies to facilitate the development of targeted interventions. Method: This study linked police reports, hospital data, and vital registration data from Taiwan with special reference to accident factors in pre-hospital deaths and medical care in hospital deaths. Results: A higher percentage of pre-hospital deaths were observed following rural as compared to urban traffic accidents. The deaths due to rural accidents can be attributed to lower use of restraints (i.e., helmets or seat belts), lower percentage of motorcyclists, and more highway accidents. A higher percentage of victims in rural accidents were transported to distant medical centers rather than to local hospitals. Conclusion: Specific interventions, such as intelligent emergency medical systems, campaigns for helmets and seat belt usage, enforcement of helmets and seat belt use, and speed control measures should be targeted to rural areas. Impact on industry: Cooperation between the vehicle industry and emergency medical providers in rural traffic accident rescue teams may decrease the numbers of deaths in these regions. © 2008 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

61649117076	Descriptive epidemiological study of sites of suicide jumps in Taipei, Taiwan	Objective: To identify locations to target for suicide preventive measures to reduce suicide by jumping in Taipei city, Taiwan. Method: A descriptive study of suicide by jumping from a height was conducted in Taipei, 2002-2005. Information on sites from which suicide jumps occurred was obtained from death certificates as well as ambulance, medical and newspaper records. Results: Of the 210 jumping suicide deaths with sufficient information on the site of the jump, private residential buildings comprised the highest proportion (67%) of all jumping sites, followed by business office buildings (13%), hospitals (8%) and shopping malls (5%). However, the number of jumping suicides per 1000 sites was highest for hospitals (307 per 1000 hospitals) and shopping malls (275 per 1000 shopping malls) compared with 2 per 1000 for residential buildings. Women and older people who died by jumping were more likely to have jumped from buildings where they lived, compared with men and other age groups. Conclusion: Although two-thirds of suicides occurred from residential buildings, the sites with the greatest number of jumps per location were hospitals and shopping malls, making them the most cost-effective focus for preventive efforts.

62249134363	Was the economic crisis 1997-1998 responsible for rising suicide rates in East/Southeast Asia? A time-trend analysis for Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand	In 1997-1998 a widespread economic crisis hit the economies of many East/Southeast Asian countries; its impact on suicide rates across the region has not been systematically documented. We investigated the impact of the Asian economic crisis (1997-1998) on suicide in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand. Suicide and population data for the period 1985-2006 were extracted from the World Health Organisation's mortality database and Taiwanese mortality statistics. Sex-specific age-standardised suicide rates for people aged 15 years or above were analysed using joinpoint regression. Trends in divorce, marriage, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and alcohol consumption were compared with trends in suicide rates graphically and using time-series analysis. Suicide mortality decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s but subsequently increased markedly in all countries except Singapore, which had steadily declining suicide rates throughout the study period. Compared to 1997, male rates in 1998 rose by 39% in Japan, 44% in Hong Kong and 45% in Korea; rises in female rates were less marked. Male rates also rose in Thailand, but accurate data were incomplete. The economic crisis was associated with 10,400 more suicides in 1998 compared to 1997 in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. Similar increases in suicide rates were not seen in Taiwan and Singapore, the two countries where the economic crisis had a smaller impact on GDP and unemployment. Time-series analyses indicated that some of the crisis's impact on male suicides was attributable to increases in unemployment. These findings suggest an association of the Asian economic crisis with a sharp increase in suicide mortality in some, but not all, East/Southeast Asian countries, and that these increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67651250992	Suicide methods used by women in Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the United States	Background/Purpose: Few studies have compared methods of suicide used by women in different countries. This study compared methods used by women in South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden and the United States. Methods: Age- and method-specific suicide rates for women in the four countries in 2002 were calculated and compared. Hanging, firearms and jumping from a height were classified as violent suicide methods. Poisoning suicides were further classified according to use of drugs, gases, pesticides and other agents. Results: Half of Taiwanese and American women used violent methods, while only one third of women in South Korea and Sweden used such methods. Poisoning was the most often used suicide method by women in all four countries. About 90% of American and Swedish women used drugs. In contrast, almost half of women from Korea and Taiwan used pesticides. Conclusion: Different countries contrast greatly in the agents used in suicide by poisoning but not in patterns of violent methods used. ©2009 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

0034754445	Diversity in death certification: A case vignette approach	Previous studies have revealed high rates of errors in death certification, but few have discussed the nature of these errors. To explore the diversity among physicians in death certification and its relationship with the complexity of the causal sequence of death, we asked 145 physicians attending a continuing medical education course to complete the cause-of-death section on dummy death certificates of four case vignettes. The difficulty in determining the causal sequence of death varied from relatively simple to complex. Variations in death certification were classified according to wording, diagnostic semantics, combinations of expressions, correctness of certification format, and concordance with the referent underlying cause of death (UCOD). Given the same case history information, physicians showed great variation in wording and diagnostic semantics in death certification. The rates of correct certification format and concordance with referent UCOD varied with the level of complexity of the causal sequence of death. The greatest source of diversity was choosing between an acute condition of a chronic disease and the chronic disease itself, and between competing prominent comorbidities. Experience in death certification was significantly associated with correct certification format but not with concordance with referent UCOD. Knowledge of death certification was not associated with correct certification format or concordance with referent UCOD. Our findings indicate that the traditional concept of UCOD tabulation and using a single standard ICD code in evaluating the quality of death certification oversimplifies a complex situation. Variations in death certification, especially the selection of UCOD, were due to differences in interpreting the information rather than differences in knowledge of death certification. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

0035134147	Factors associated with errors in death certificate completion: A national study in Taiwan	To identify characteristics of certifying physicians and the deceased that are associated with errors in death certificate completion in Taiwan, we retrospectively reviewed 4123 systematically sampled death certificates issued in 1994. Multivariate analyses were used to assess the associations of various characteristics of the certifying physicians and the deceased with four types of error. Of the 4123 death certificates reviewed, 2525 (61%) were completed correctly. In 289 (7%), only the mechanism(s) of death was given (Major Error 1); in 146 (4%), multiple causal sequences were given in part I (Major Error 2); in 800 (19%), a single causal sequence was given but was not specific enough (Minor Error 1); and in 363 (9%), a single causal sequence was given but the order was incorrect (Minor Error 2). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the probability of error in death certification increased as the age of the deceased increased, the age of the certifier decreased, and the level of the hospital decreased. These findings suggest that training in death certificate completion should focus on younger certifiers and those working at lower level teaching hospitals and nonteaching hospitals. Given the high rate of Minor Error 1, physicians should be reminded to state information as specifically as possible to render cause-of-death statistics more informative.

0035261881	Why hypertension is not the first leading cause of death? - The problems related to the selection rules for underlying cause of death	Cause-of-death statistics are the most highly used reference in public health planning and evaluation. To understand why hypertension, a highly prevalent disease in Taiwan, is not the leading cause of death, this article first introduces the concept of underlying cause-of-death (UCOD), and the selection rules that guide the tabulation of cause-of-death statistics. The linkage rule of the selection rules is the main reason that hypertension would not be selected as the UCOD. According to this rule, when a death certificate lists hypertension with mention of ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and nephritic syndrome, hypertension would not be selected as the UCOD. This article also reviews previous studies on the reliability and validity of UCOD coding processes. Reasons explaining the variation in UCOD coding among different countries include 1) differences in the procedure of collecting cause-of-death information (e.g., certifier requirements, format of cause-of-death diagnosis, percentage of deaths in hospitals, autopsy rates, criteria of query); 2) differences in customs of diagnosing cause of death; 3) differences in interpretation of disease causal relationships; and 4) vague and paradox of selection rules. Two solutions to the abovementioned problems are tabulation of multiple causes of death, and automation of UCOD selection.

0035322232	Record linkage for road traffic injury research: One-to-one deterministic linkage vs. one-to-many manual probable linkage	Background: The road traffic accident file (RTAF) and cause of death file (CODF) are relevant to road traffic injury research and control programs design, but both have merits as well as demerits. Linking the CODF with the RTAF may yield a dataset that makes full use of information from both files. Objectives: In this study we sought to establish a linked dataset which is more useful than the existing data sets and to provide information for future computerized probability record linkage (CPRL). Methods: The RTAF and CODF for the year 1995 were first linked with one-to-one deterministic record linkage (DRL), using ID as the identifier. The remaining unmatched records were then linked with one-to-many manual probable record linkage (MPRL), using year and month of birth as identifiers. The possible pairs linked by MPRL were then verified by the information recorded on the death certificates to determine the true matches. Results: The linkage process linked a total of 3,115 records; DRL and MPRL matched 853 and 2,262 records, respectively. Of the 3,097 police registered fatal cases in the RTAF, 2,692 (87%) were linked to matching CODF record. Of the 8,145 certifier registered traffic-related deaths in the CODF, only 2,712 (33%) had matching RTAF record. The linkage rate varied according to different characteristics including sex, age, place of traffic accident, number of victims involved, and type of road user. The characteristics (region of accident occurred and type of road user) of linked records obtained by MPRL differed significantly from those obtained by DRL. Most of the discrepancies between the two files in registering the same identifier information (ID or birth year and month) were due to transcription errors. Conclusions: Given the high yield of MPRL compared with DRL, and the differences in the distribution of characteristics between records linked by MPRL and DRL, MPRL is a necessary procedure for future record linkage with RTAF. The common discrepancies found in this study may serve as a useful reference in defining the weights and partial disagreement rules in future CPRL efforts.

76349120177	Adverse birth outcomes among pregnancies of teen mothers: Age-specific analysis of national data in Taiwan	Background: This study was conducted to evaluate the risks of adverse birth outcomes including low birthweight, preterm and small-for-gestational age among teen mothers. Methods: Data were collected from the Taiwan Birth Registry between 1985 and 1997. Among a total of 1 185 597 live births born to mothers aged 24 years or less, 151 259 (12.8%) were born to teen mothers aged 19 years or less. Crude odds ratios (ORs), adjusted ORs (AORs), their 95% confidence intervals and test for linear trend of maternal age-specific AOR were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results: After controlling for certain birth characteristics and socio-economic factors, the age-specific analysis showed significantly gradient variations in increased risks of adverse birth outcomes among births of teen mothers, where the elevated risk was lessened in older teen mothers. Teen mothers aged 16 years or less were observed to experience particularly high AORs for all adverse birth outcomes of interest. Conclusions: Not all teen mothers experienced the same magnitude of increased risk of adverse birth outcomes in Taiwan. Considering all teen mothers as the same group may have overlooked the particularly high risks of adverse birth outcomes among very young teen mothers (16 years or less), who are especially vulnerable to such elevated risks. © 2009 The Authors.

77949356287	'Hidden' suicides amongst deaths certified as undetermined intent, accident by pesticide poisoning and accident by suffocation in Taiwan	Objective To identify cause-of-death categories in which suicides might be misclassified in Taiwan. Methods Weplotted secular trends (1971-2007) in sex- and method-specific rates of deaths classified as suicide, undetermined intent and accident for the Taiwanese population aged 15+ and compared the sex, age and marital status profiles of deaths in these three categories by method of death. Results The demographic profiles of registered suicides generally resembled those for deaths of undetermined intent and accidents by pesticide poisoning/suffocation but differed from those for accidents from non-pesticide poisoning/drowning/falling/poisoning by non-domestic gas. For the period 1990-2007, suicide rates based on suicides alone (14.8 per 100,000) would increase by 23, 7 and 1%, respectively, when including deaths of undetermined intent, accidental pesticide poisonings and accidental suffocations. Conclusions Suicide rates may be underestimated by more than 30% in Taiwan because some suicides are 'hidden' amongst deaths certified as due to other causes. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

77952394135	Trends in frequency of reporting improper diabetes-related cause-of-death statements on death certificates, 1985-2005: An algorithm to identify incorrect causal sequences	This study aimed to examine the changes in frequency of reporting improper diabetes-related cause-of-death statements on death certificates based on Multiple-Cause Mortality Files of the United States from 1985 to 2005. An algorithm was developed to identify the causes of death with incorrect causal sequences by using decision tables developed by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 1985, 2 or more diagnoses per line were reported on 35% of death certificates with mention of diabetes in Part I of the death certificate. This percentage decreased to 19% in 2005. In contrast, the prevalence of reporting incorrect causal sequences on death certificates on which diabetes was reported in Part I increased from 22% in 1985 to 35% in 2005. The authors suggest that the most plausible explanation of increasing reporting of incorrect causal sequences was the drastic increase of reporting multiple conditions (especially cardiovascular diseases and cancers) among deaths with mention of diabetes, which made the determination of underlying cause of death much more difficult. © 2010 The Author.

77955275496	Cigarette smoking and cognitive impairment: A 10-year cohort study in Taiwan	The relationship between cigarette smoking and cognitive impairment is not a simple one. Some studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in the elderly, whereas other studies have shown cigarette smoking to be protective against dementia. This study aims to explore the relationship between cigarette smoking and cognitive impairment in elderly persons without dementia, during a 10-year period. Data were derived from a population-based cohort study of 1436 elderly Taiwanese. Cognitive function was measured by the SPMSQ both in 1993 and in 2003. A total of 1436 participants free of cognitive impairment at baseline (SPMSQ ≥ 6 in 1993) were included in these analyses. Subsequently, participants were divided into three groups: never, past, and current smokers. The effect of cigarette smoking on cognitive function was assessed using logistic regression. In the logistic regression model adjusted for age, education, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke at baseline, persons who had quit smoking (Odds ratio. =OR. =0.31; 95% CI. =0.18-0.53; p<0.001) and those who continued to smoke (OR. =0.37; 95% CI. =0.20-0.70; p<0.001) were about one-third as likely to develop cognitive impairment as were those who never smoked. However, no dose-response relationship was observed between pack-years and cognitive impairment. Past and current smokers were less likely to develop cognitive impairment during a 10-year follow-up than were those who had never smoked. The present study suggests that smoking may be protective for cognitive function. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77955416477	Using multiple-cause-of-death data as a complement of underlying-cause-of- death data in examining mortality differences in psychiatric disorders between countries	Background: Little is known about the mortality differences in psychiatric disorders (PD) between countries according to multiple-cause-of-death (MCOD) data. Objective: To compare mortality differences in PD between Taiwan and the US according to MCOD and underlying-cause-of-death (UCOD) data and factors associated with the reporting of PD and assigning PD as the UCOD. Method: MCOD data of Taiwan and the US for years 2003 through 2005 were used for analysis. Deaths per 100,000 population for various PD by age and sex were calculated for each country. Mortality rate ratios between Taiwan and the US were computed to examine the extent of mortality differences between the countries. Odds ratios in reporting PD and assigning PD as the UCOD by age and sex for each country were estimated according logistic regression model. Results: According to UCOD data, the PD mortality was 3.6 per 100,000 population in Taiwan and 21.9 per 100,000 population in the US, a sixfold difference. The mortality differences increased according to MCOD, which was 10.3 per 100,000 population in Taiwan and 115.4 per 100,000 population in the US, an 11-fold difference. Exception dementia/Alzheimer's disease, the mortality differences between the countries increased in schizophrenia, mood disorder/depression, use of alcohol and use of drug according to MCOD data compared with those according to UCOD data. The percentage in reporting PD among all deaths in the US (13.9%) was higher than those in Taiwan (1.4%); however, the percentage in assigning PD as the UCOD in Taiwan (35%) was higher than those in the US (19%). Conclusion: MCOD data could be used as a complement to UCOD data to provide more information (such as percentage of reporting PD and assigning PD as the UCOD) in interpreting mortality differences in PD between the countries. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77955477794	The leading methods of suicide in Taiwan, 2002-2008	Background. Diverse socioeconomic and cultural developments between geographic regions and cities/counties have resulted in different physical availability and socio-cultural acceptability of certain methods of suicide. This study examined the changes in distribution of the leading methods of suicide across cities/counties in Taiwan between 2002-04 and 2006-08. Methods. Mortality data for all deaths classified as suicide or as of undetermined intent from 2002 through 2008 were extracted for analysis. The number of deaths and proportion of completed suicides by four main methods were calculated in order to identify the leading lethal methods in each city/county. Results. Hanging was the leading method of suicide in 18 out of 22 cities/counties in 2002-04 but decreased to 10 out of 22 in 2006-08. On the other hand, charcoal burning was not the leading method in any city/county in 2002-04 but increased to 10 out of 22 in 2006-08. The younger the age of the deceased, the more likely the leading method of suicide changed from 2002-04 to 2006-08. Charcoal burning was the most often used method in most cities/counties among those aged 15-44; however, hanging was most frequent for those aged 45 or above. Pesticides were the leading method for the elderly in five counties with a high percentage of agricultural population in 2006-08. Conclusion. The leading method of suicide varied by age group and changed from 2002-04 to 2006-08 in Taiwan. This was due primarily to changes in socio-cultural acceptability of the use of charcoal burning as a method for suicide by younger age groups. © 2010 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77956281718	Offspring birth weight and parental cardiovascular mortality	Background: Mothers bearing small offspring are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. The cardiovascular risk for fathers of small offspring is, however, inconclusive. Very few studies with sufficiently large sample sizes have been conducted to specifically differentiate the maternal/paternal CVD risk in association with offspring birth weight in the same population. Methods:This study followed 1 400 383 primigravida and their spouses with singleton births registered in Taiwan between 1978 and 1987 to the end of 2006. By linking to the mortality registry, the hazards ratio (HR) of parental cardiovascular mortality was measured in relation to lower offspring birth weights. Results:The covariate-adjusted HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) of CVD mortality for 1 standard deviation higher offspring birth weight was reduced (HR=0.89; 95% CI: 0.85-0.94) for mothers, but less obvious for fathers (HR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-1.00). Analyses of the categorical offspring birth weights revealed that the association between bearing low-birth-weight offspring (<2500 g) and CVD mortality was also stronger in mothers (adjusted HR=1.85; 95% CI: 1.67-2.18) than in fathers (adjusted HR=1.13; 95% CI: 1.03-1.24). On standardizing the birth weight for gestational age, the observed associations persisted, although these associations were relatively weak. Conclusions:This large cohort analysis confirmed that the bearing of smaller size infants is associated with a stronger elevated risk for CVD mortality in mothers than in fathers. Women who have had a lower birthweight offspring can be targeted for CVD-prevention measures. © The Author 2010; Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.

79952488970	Geography of suicide in Taiwan: Spatial patterning and socioeconomic correlates	In industrialised Western nations suicide rates tend to be high in inner city areas and socially fragmented neighbourhoods. Few studies have investigated spatial variations in suicide in non-Western settings. We estimated smoothed standardised mortality ratios (1999-2007) for suicide for each of the 358 Taiwanese districts (median population aged 15+: 27,000) and investigated their associations with area characteristics using Bayesian hierarchical models. The geographic distribution of suicide was similar in men and women; young people showed the greatest spatial variation in rates. Rates were highest in East Taiwan, a mostly mountainous rural area. There was no evidence of above average rates in large cities. Spatial patterns of method-specific suicide rates varied markedly, with solids/liquids poisonings showing the greatest geographic variation and hangings the least. Factors most strongly associated with area suicide rates were median household income, population density and lone-parent households. Spatial patterning of suicide in Taiwan differed from that observed in Western nations. Suicide prevention strategies should take into account unique local patterns. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79953327875	Incidence and mortality of treated primary sjögren's syndrome in Taiwan: A population-based study	Objective. To estimate the incidence and mortality of treated primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) by sex and age group in Taiwan. Methods. We used claims data of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (NHI) of Taiwan from 2005 to 2007 for analysis. According to the NHI, pSS is classified as one of the financially catastrophic illnesses and patients with pSS could be exempted from copayment of all medical costs. To obtain a catastrophic illness certificate (CIC) for pSS, patients are required to meet the criteria of the American-European Consensus Group for pSS, and are reviewed by a committee. Patients approved for receipt of a CIC for pSS for the first time were defined as incident cases of treated pSS. Results. A total of 3352 incident cases occurred between 2005 and 2007. The estimated mean annual incidence was 6.0 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI 5.8-6.2) for both sexes, 11.0 (95% CI 10.6-11.4) for women and 1.1 (95% CI 1.0-1.2) for men, with a female/male ratio of 9.9 (95% CI 8.8-11.1). Incidence increased with age, peaking at age 55-64 years in women and 65-74 years in men. The mortality rate was 33.4 per 1000 case person-years for men and 11.4 for women, with a male/female rate ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-5.3). Conclusion. The incidence of treated pSS in women is 10 times that in men. Nevertheless, pSS mortality in men is 3 times that in women. The Journal of Rheumatology Copyright © 2011. All rights reserved.

0036516078	Changes in injury mortality by intent and mechanism in Taiwan, 1975-98	Background: Most official mortality publications do not present the mechanism of injury (for example, cut/pierce, drowning, fall, poisoning, or suffocation) for intentional injuries (for example, suicide or homicide). Objectives: To determine if the presentation of mechanism of injury for intentional injuries had different mechanism profiles. Methods: Age adjusted injury mortality rates by intent and mechanism of injury for Taiwan were calculated for the years 1975 to 1998. The International Classification of Disease codes for the matrix by intent and mechanism groupings were based on recommendations of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: If rates for both groups (intentional and unintentional) are combined, the importance of poisoning and suffocation increase relative to their contribution for unintentional injuries alone. Given the same mechanism of injury, different intents showed different patterns of change during the study period and given the same intent, the changes over time differed for different mechanisms of injury. Conclusions: It is important to include the mechanism of injury within intentional injuries because it provides different profiles of injury problems. Thus the simultaneous tabulation of injury mortality data by both intent and mechanism is a necessary step for identifying and prioritizing injury problems. The argument that good preventive measures could prevent both unintentional and intentional injuries was also confirmed.

80053174227	Trends in solids/liquids poisoning suicide rates in Taiwan: A test of the substitution hypothesis	Background: Several previous studies have illustrated that restricting access to lethal methods can reduce suicide rates. The most often cited example was Kreitman's study, showing a reduction not only in gas-specific suicide rates, but also in the overall suicide rates because of the lack of increase of other methods. However, method substitution is still a major concern in the application of the means restriction strategy to prevent suicide. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the reduction in the solids/liquids poisoning suicide rate in 1983-1993 after the launching of pesticide restriction interventions in Taiwan was accompanied with an increase in the suicide rate using other methods (method substitution). Methods. Data on age-, sex- and method-specific suicide rates for 1971-1993 in Taiwan were obtained. Changes in solids/liquids poisoning suicide rates were compared with suicide rates by hanging and other methods between 1983 and 1993. Results: No concomitant increase in suicide rates by hanging or other methods was noted from 1983 to 1993, during which the suicide rates by poisoning with solids/liquids (mainly pesticides) decreased markedly and steadily. The phenomenon of method substitution was also not found by sex and age groups. Conclusion: In general, no method substitution was found along with the reduction in solids/liquids suicide rates in Taiwan. Our study results have also added the evidence that restricting access to methods maybe a promising strategy in preventing suicide, particularly in those countries where the "target method" has been found to contribute greatly to the suicide rates. © 2011 Lin and Lu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80054791290	Using the diamond model to prioritize 30 causes of death by considering both the level of and inequality in mortality	Objectives: The diamond model considers two dimensions of criteria, i.e., the magnitudes of rates and the trends in rates, in order to prioritize different health issues for health policy decision-making. We aimed in this study to use the diamond model to prioritize 30 causes of death (COD) by considering both the level of and inequality in mortality for the setting of policy goals in Taiwan. Methods: In the level of mortality diamond, the mortality rates of 30 COD of 2006-2008 were classified into three groups by statistical examination to construct the magnitude dimension of the diamond. The 30 COD were then classified into three groups according to statistical examination of the slope of the mortality trend from 1991-1993 to 2006-2008 according to linear regression to construct the trend dimension of the diamond. By considering the two above-described dimensions, each COD can be classified into one of the nine (3 by 3) grid cells in the diamond model, resulting in five levels of priority. The same method was used to construct an inequality in mortality (mortality rate ratio between the city/county with the highest and the lowest rate) diamond. Results: In the level of mortality diamond, three COD were grouped in the first priority cell and seven in the second priority cell. However, only two COD were classified in the first priority cell and three in the second priority cell in the inequality in mortality diamond. Liver cirrhosis was the only COD in the first two priority cells in both diamonds. Conclusions: The diamond model is a useful tool for initial prioritization of health issues by considering two dimensions of criteria at the same time using existing data. Furthermore, by using the diamond shape to graphically present the prioritized results, the diamond model efficiently conveys prioritization information to the general public and stakeholders during policy debates. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

82955173690	Suicide method runs in families: A birth certificate cohort study of adolescent suicide in Taiwan	Suicide method used by adolescents was examined to determine if it was the same as that employed by their suicidal parents. Six hundred eighty adolescents completed suicide between 1997 and 2007, of whom 12 had parents who had previously died by suicide. The suicide method used by these adolescents was compared with that employed by their suicidal parent and that of a matched peer control adolescent with no exposure to parental suicide and living in the same area. In 10 of the 12 suicidal parent-adolescent dyads, the same suicide method was employed by parent and adolescent. Of seven adolescents whose age at parental suicide was 15 years or above, six used the same suicide method as their suicidal parent had. On the contrary, of 12 exposure-nonexposure suicidal adolescent dyads, the same method was used in only four. Adolescents exposed to parental suicide are more likely to use the suicide method employed by their suicidal parents than the method used by adolescent peers with no exposure to parental suicide. © 2011 The American Association of Suicidology.

84857913542	Incidence of cancer in a nationwide population cohort of 7852 patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome in Taiwan	Objective: Patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) are at a higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, little is known with regard to the risk of developing cancers other than NHL. The authors aimed in this study to compare the incidence of cancer in various sites among patients with pSS with the general population of Taiwan. Methods: The authors used National Health Insurance claims data to establish a nationwide population cohort of 7852 patients with pSS from 2000 to 2008 who did not have cancer prior to diagnosis of pSS. Incidence and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer in various sites were calculated. Results: Among patients with pSS, 277 (2.9%) developed cancer. The SIR for cancer was 1.04 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.18) among patients of all ages with pSS and was 2.19 (95% CI 1.43 to 3.21) for patients aged 25-44 years. Female patients with pSS had a higher risk of NHL (SIR 7.1, 95% CI 4.3 to 10.3), multiple myeloma (SIR 6.1, 95% CI 2.0 to 14.2) and thyroid gland cancer (SIR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.3) and a lower risk of colon cancer (SIR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.65). In contrast, male patients with pSS were not at a higher risk of developing cancer in particular sites. Conclusion: Patients with pSS, overall, did not have higher risk of cancer, and only patients aged 25-44 years were at an increased risk of cancer compared with their counterparts in the general population. Cancer screening for patients with pSS, especially female patients, should focus on NHL and multiple myeloma and thyroid gland cancer.

84859122938	The impact of pesticide suicide on the geographic distribution of suicide in Taiwan: A spatial analysis	Background: Pesticide self-poisoning is the most commonly used suicide method worldwide, but few studies have investigated the national epidemiology of pesticide suicide in countries where it is a major public health problem. This study aims to investigate geographic variations in pesticide suicide and their impact on the spatial distribution of suicide in Taiwan. Methods. Smoothed standardized mortality ratios for pesticide suicide (2002-2009) were mapped across Taiwan's 358 districts (median population aged 15 or above = 27 000), and their associations with the size of agricultural workforce were investigated using Bayesian hierarchical models. Results: In 2002-2009 pesticide poisoning was the third most common suicide method in Taiwan, accounting for 13.6% (4913/36 110) of all suicides. Rates were higher in agricultural East and Central Taiwan and lower in major cities. Almost half (47%) of all pesticide suicides occurred in areas where only 13% of Taiwan's population lived. The geographic distribution of overall suicides was more similar to that of pesticide suicides than non-pesticide suicides. Rural-urban differences in suicide were mostly due to pesticide suicide. Areas where a higher proportion of people worked in agriculture showed higher pesticide suicide rates (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] per standard deviation increase in the proportion of agricultural workers = 1.58, 95% Credible Interval [CrI] 1.44-1.74) and overall suicide rates (ARR = 1.06, 95% CrI 1.03-1.10) but lower non-pesticide suicide rates (ARR = 0.91, 95% CrI 0.87-0.95). Conclusion: Easy access to pesticides appears to influence the geographic distribution of suicide in Taiwan, highlighting the potential benefits of targeted prevention strategies such as restricting access to highly toxic pesticides. © 2012 Chang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84861143153	Trends in death rate from diabetes according to multiple-cause-of-death differed from that according to underlying-cause-of-death in Taiwan but not in the United States, 1987-2007	Objective: To examine whether trends in death rate from diabetes according to multiple-cause-of-death (MCOD) data differed from those according to underlying-cause-of-death (UCOD) data in Taiwan and the United States. Study Design and Setting: We used multiple cause mortality files for the years 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007 to calculate the age-adjusted death rates from diabetes according to MCOD and UCOD and the ratio between diabetes mortality according to UCOD and that according to MCOD (U/M ratio) in Taiwan and the United States. Results: In Taiwan, diabetes mortality according to MCOD increased persistently from 1987 to 2007, but no prominent changes were found according to UCOD in men. For women, the death rates according to MCOD did not change significantly between 1987 and 2007 but decreased drastically from 1992 to 2007 according to UCOD. In the United States, the patterns of change in diabetes mortality according to MCOD were similar to those according to UCOD in both sexes. The U/M ratio of diabetes mortality declined persistently between 1987 and 2007 in Taiwan, but no prominent change was found in the United States. Conclusion: Trends in death rate from diabetes according to MCOD differed from that according to UCOD in Taiwan but not in the United States. To properly interpret cause-specific mortality trends, it is important to provide both MCOD and UCOD data. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84862786786	Risk of mortality among patients with epilepsy in southern Taiwan	Objective: Previous studies suggested a higher risk of all-cause mortality in patients with epilepsy than in the general population. However, information on the age- and sex-specific risk of mortality, as well as on the cause-specific risk of mortality has been sparse. This study aims to determine sex-, age-, and cause-specific risk of mortality among patients with epilepsy from southern Taiwan. Methods: A total of 2180 patients treated in a tertiary hospital in southern Taiwan between 1989 and 2008 were compared to the general population of Taiwan for age-, sex- and cause-specific mortalities. The age-, sex-, and calendar year-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to estimate the relative risks of mortality associated with the epilepsy. Results: There are 266 (12.2%) deaths noted in the study period. The patients with epilepsy experienced a significantly increased SMR of all-cause mortality (SMR, 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.2-2.8). The most significantly elevated age-specific SMR was 51.8 (95% CI, 6.2-187.2) and 8.6 (95% CI, 4.4-14.9) for male patients aged 0-9 years and female patients aged 20-29 years, respectively. Additionally, the most increased cause-specific SMR was noted for brain tumor (SMR, 21.4; 95% CI, 9.23-23.1), followed by accidental drowning (SMR, 8.8; 95% CI, 3.5-9.6) and falls (SMR, 5.7; 95% CI, 2.2-6.1). Conclusion: Younger epilepsy should be the object of aggressive treatments. Advancement in treating brain tumors and prevention of accidental injuries may help improve the survival of patients with epilepsy. © 2012 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84863380003	Incidence of hospitalization due to child maltreatment in Taiwan, 1996-2007: A nationwide population-based study	Objectives: Little is known regarding the epidemiology of child maltreatment in Asian countries. This study aimed to examine the incidence of hospitalization coded as due to child maltreatment in Taiwan. Methods: We used inpatient claims data of the National Health Insurance for the years 1996 through 2007 for estimation. Hospitalization of children aged 0-12 years with an ICD-9-CM code 995.5 " maltreatment syndrome" or E960-E969 " assault" in the main or secondary discharge diagnosis in claims data was defined as hospitalization due to child maltreatment. Poisson regression was used to examine the trends. Results: A total of 1,726 children with 1,780 hospitalizations due to child maltreatment were identified during 1996-2007. The averaged annual incidence over 1996-2007 was 13.2/100,000 for infants, 3.5/100,000 for children aged 1-3 years, 2.1/100,000 for children aged 4-6 years and 3.3/100,000 for children aged 7-12 years. The incidence increased most among the infant group, from 4.8/100,000 in 1996-1997 to 25.4/100,000 in 2006-2007, a greater than 5-fold increase. The magnitude of the increase in incidence decreased with age, and no change in incidence was noted among children aged 7-12 years. The drastic increase in incidence in infants since 2003 corresponds with the introduction of use of ICD-9-CM code 995.55 " shaken infant syndrome" in Taiwan since 2003. Head injury was the main type of injury in all age groups. Conclusions: The incidence of hospitalization coded as due to child maltreatment in Taiwan differed by age group. Infants had the highest and the largest increase in incidence during the past decade. The increase might be due to improvement in awareness, competence and willingness to diagnose child maltreatment of medical staff in hospitals during the past decade after the revision of Child Welfare Law in 1993 and the new ICD-9-CM code for " shaken infant syndrome" being used since 2003. Practice implications: Physicians and nursing staff should be aware of and provide the detailed and specific information needed for proper discharge diagnosis coding, from which valid estimation of the incidence of hospitalization due to child maltreatment can be made. Administrative data should include both the N-code and E-code for each case of child maltreatment hospitalization to provide more complete information. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863468109	Factors associated with the decline in suicide by pesticide poisoning in Taiwan: A time trend analysis, 19872010	Objective. Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for one-third of suicides worldwide, but few studies have investigated the national epidemiology of pesticide suicide in countries where it is a commonly used method. We investigated trends in pesticide suicide, and factors associated with such trends, in Taiwan, a rapidly developing East Asian country. Methods. We conducted an ecological study using graphical approaches and Spearman's correlation coefficients to examine trends in pesticide suicide (19872010) in Taiwan in relation to pesticide sales, bans on selected pesticides, the proportion of the workforce involved in agriculture and unemployment. We compared pesticide products banned by the Taiwanese government with products that remained on the market and pesticides that accounted for the most poisoning deaths in Taiwan. Results. Age-standardised rates of pesticide suicide showed a 67% reduction from 7.7 per 100,000 (42% of all suicides) in 1987 to 2.5 per 100,000 (12% of all suicides) in 2010, in contrast to a 69% increase in suicide rates by other methods. Pesticide poisoning was the most commonly used method of suicide in 1987 but had become the third most common method by 2010. The reduction was paralleled by a 66% fall in the workforce involved in agriculture but there was no strong evidence for its association with trends in pesticide sales, bans on selected pesticide products or unemployment. The bans mostly post-dated the decline in pesticide suicides; furthermore, they did not include products (e.g. paraquat) that accounted for most deaths and were mainly restricted to selected high-strength formulated products whilst their equivalent low-strength products were not banned. Conclusions. Access to pesticides, indicated by the size of agricultural workforce, appears to influence trends in pesticide suicide in Taiwan. Targeted bans on pesticides should focus on those products that account for most deaths. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84865109622	Improper cause-of-death statements by specialty of certifying physician: A cross-sectional study in two medical centres in Taiwan	Objective: To determine the frequency of various types of improper cause-of-death (COD) statements reported on death certificates and whether the frequency differed by specialty of the certifying physician. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting: 2 medical centres in Tainan, Taiwan. Participants: A total of 2520 death certificates issued by 230 physicians. Main outcome measures: 4 types of improper COD statements based on the criteria of correctness of the COD causal sequence and the level of specificity of underlying COD selected. Results: Of 2520 death certificates analysed, 502 (19.9%) had at least one type of improper COD statement. However, only 235 (9.3%) sustained major errors, that is, 91 (3.6%) reported incorrect causal sequence and 144 (5.7%) reported only mechanism(s) of death (such as respiratory failure, heart failure, sepsis and acidosis). The improper reporting rate was highest among nephrologists (53%, 24/45), followed by infectious diseases physicians (45%, 29/65) and was lowest among oncologists (6%, 57/995). Conclusions: About one-fifth issued death certificates sustained improper COD statements and only one-tenth had noteworthy errors that would threaten the quality of COD statistics. The frequency varied by specialty of the certifying physician because physicians in different specialties manage different types of diseases and conditions with contrasting complexities in terms of determining the causal sequence and specificity of COD statements.

0036842158	High-frequency death certifiers in Taiwan: A sociocultural product	Accurate death certification is essential to high-quality mortality statistics. Physicians who certify disproportionately large numbers of deaths can significantly affect the validity of the resultant mortality data. In Taiwan in 1994, 110 death certifiers issued more than 100 death certificates each; and nine of these high-frequency certifiers issued more than 500 death certificates. We explore the cultural, political, economic, historical, and social contexts of high-frequency death certification in Taiwan. Because of the traditional belief in Taiwan that one must die at home for the soul to be incorporated into the collective ancestral tablet of the household, many families bring their loved ones home from the hospital just before death. Hospital physicians cannot legally issue a death certificate in these cases because they did not witness the dying process. Although the government introduced an administrative certification system to handle these outside-hospital deaths, the great demands of this system have attracted many 'special exam' doctors (doctors with no formal medical degree) to adopt death certification as a full-time business. In this context, it is not surprising that 'routinization' of death certification (J. Health Soc. Behav. 32 (1991) 273) has led to low-quality reporting among these certifiers. We argue that attempts to improve the quality of mortality statistics should take into account the unique sociocultural contexts of different countries. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

84870537720	Reporting of incorrect cause-of-death causal sequence on death certificates in the USA: Using hypertension and diabetes as an educational illustration	Background: Little is known about the extent of reporting an incorrect cause-of-death (COD) causal sequence on death certificates. Objective: To determine the frequency of incorrect reporting of hypertension as cause of diabetes on death certificates in the USA. Methods: Multiple-cause mortality files were used to identify death certificates which mentioned both hypertension and diabetes in the USA from 1985 to 2005. The frequency of reporting hypertension on the line below diabetes in part I of the death certificate was calculated. Results: The percentage of cases in which both hypertension and diabetes were included in part I of the death certificate, in which hypertension was reported on the line below diabetes on the death certificate-that is, suggesting that hypertension was a cause of diabetes- increased from 15.5% in 1985 to 36.1% in 2000 and 38.2% in 2005. Conclusions: The frequency of reporting of an incorrect COD causal sequence on death certificates in the USA has increased. Education, training and questioning the opinions of certifying physicians are needed to improve the quality of reporting of COD statements.

84870954794	State differences in the reporting of 'unspecified stroke' on death certificates: Implications for improvement	Background and Purpose: Little is known about the comparability of stroke subtype mortality across states. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study to examine state differences in the reporting of "unspecified stroke" on death certificates in the United States. Methods: The number of deaths from different subtypes of stroke in each state for the years 2007 to 2009 were obtained from the CDC WONDER online databases. We calculated the percentage of stroke deaths classified as unspecified stroke (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code I64) among all stroke deaths (ICD-10 codes I60-I69) for each state. Results: Of 398 942 people who died from stoke in the United States between 2007 and 2009, in 209 933 (53%) cases, the medical certifier did not specify whether the stroke was hemorrhage or infarction on the death certificate. There were 44 states in which the percentage of unspecified stroke among all strokes was ≥50% and 20 states in which the percentage was ≥55%. The percentage was lowest in the District of Columbia (46%) and highest in Oklahoma (64%). The state variation in the proportion of unspecified stroke decreased with age of the deceased. The state percentage of unspecified stroke correlated most with the state percentage of cerebral infarction and other and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease. Conclusions: Owing to the high percentage and state variation in the reporting of unspecified stroke on death certificates, the comparability of stroke subtype mortality is threatened. Querying of medical certifiers for more specific information for better coding is needed. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

84876293016	Reporting of aspiration pneumonia or choking as a cause of death in patients who died with stroke	Background and Purpose-It is not known how many stroke patients die from fatal pulmonary complications such as aspiration pneumonia (AP) and choking each year in the United States. This study aimed to determine the frequency of reporting of AP or choking as a cause of death on death certificates with mention of stroke in the United States as a proxy measure of the incidence of dying from AP or choking among patients with stroke. Methods-We used multiple-cause mortality data for the years 2001 to 2010 to identify death certificates with mention of stroke (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code I60-I69), AP (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code J69), and choking (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code W78-W80) for analysis. Results-Of 2 424 379 death certificates with mention of stroke in the United States between 2001 and 2010, 5.1% (n=124 503) reported AP as a cause of death, and 1.5% (n=36 997) reported choking as a cause of death. However, if we confined the analysis to autopsy-confirmed cases, the frequency decreased to 1.3% (555/42 732) and 1.3% (541/42 732), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios of reporting AP or choking as a cause of death were higher among men, increased with age, and were higher among decedents who died in a nursing home/long-term care. Conclusions-The estimated incidence of dying from AP and choking among patients who died with stroke was 5% (̃12 000 deaths per year) and 1% (̃3700 deaths per year) according to information reported on death certificates. Efforts are needed to reduce the number of deaths from these 2 preventable complications. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84886397814	Perinatal risk factors for suicide in young adults in taiwan	Background We investigated the association of early life social factors-maternal age, single motherhood, socioeconomic position, birth order and family size-with future risk of suicide in Taiwan. Methods Using a nested case-control design, we used linked data from Taiwan's Birth Registry (1978-93) and Taiwan's Death Registry (1993-2008) and identified 3984 suicides aged 15-30 years. For each suicide, 30 controls matched by age and sex were randomly selected, using incidence density sampling. Conditional logistic regression models were estimated to assess the association of early life risk factors with suicide. Results Younger maternal age (<25 years), single motherhood, lower paternal educational level and higher birth order were independently associated with increased risk of suicide. Stratified analyses suggest that lower paternal educational level was associated with male, but not female suicide risk (Pinteraction1/40.02). Single motherhood was a stronger risk factor for suicide in female than in male offspring [odds ratios(95% confidence interval)= 2.30 (1.47, 3.58) vs. 1.50 (1.01, 2.20), Pinteraction1/40.12]. There was a suggestion that in families with large sibship size (54 siblings), the excess in suicide risk was greater among later born daughters compared with later born sons (Pinteraction 1/4 0.05). Conclusions Our findings provide support for the results of European studies, suggesting that early life social circumstances influence future risk of suicide. Factors specific to Taiwanese culture, such as a preference for male offspring, may have influenced gender-specific patterns of risk. © The Author 2013; all rights reserved.

0141539494	Demographic characteristics and trends in the prevalence of low birth weight from singleton pregnancies in Taiwan, 1978-1997	Background and Purpose: Low birth weight (LBW) has adverse influences on lifetime health. This study examined trends in LBW in Taiwan between 1978 and 1997, and assessed the risk of LBW associated with gender, birth order of infant, and parental age at delivery. Methods: Information of live born singletons for the study period was retrieved from the Taiwan birth registry. We calculated biannual trends for overall LBW rates and for specific demographic factors. Log-linear models with a Poisson assumption were used to assess the linear trend of the LBW rates and the interaction between time and selected demographic factors. Log-linear models were also used to estimate the independent effect of individual demographic factors on the risk of LBW. Results: The LBW prevalence declined from 6.78% (55,694/820,364) in 1978-79 to 4.95% (30,907/623,971) in 1996-97, representing a 27.10% reduction. The prevalence of LBW showed a noticeable reduction between the late 1970s and mid-1980s, and appeared homogeneous after the mid-1980s. This declining trend was evident for almost all of the selected demographic factors. The only exception was in infants born to teenage fathers, which showed a 10.59% increase in prevalence of LBW during the 20-year study period. Infants born to mothers or fathers aged 35 and above had the greatest reduction (47.58% and 41.44%, respectively) in the rate of LBW, whereas teenage mothers had the lowest reduction (11.75%) in the rate of LBW. Conclusions: Parental age at an infant birth has a strong association with reduction of LBW risk. Education programs focusing on the problem of teenage pregnancy may accelerate the reduction of LBW.

84890922613	Changes in geographic variation in the uptake of cervical cancer screening in Taiwan: Possible effects of "leadership style factor"α	Objectives: Wennberg proposed the "practice style factor" to explain the large variations in the use of medical care. As a corollary, we propose the "leadership style factor" of the director of the city/county bureau of public health to explain changes in geographic variation in the uptake of cervical cancer screening. Methods: We first calculated the triennial Pap smear rates for women aged 30-69 years from 1997 through 2010 for each city/county in Taiwan and the rate difference and rate ratio between the highest and the lowest city/county to illustrate the geographic variation in the uptake of cervical cancer screening. We then created an expert panel to conduct a hypothesis generation process to examine the possible effects of "leadership style factors" in explaining the changes. Results: The Pap smear rate in Taiwan as a whole was 35% in 1997 and increased to 56% in 2001, and was then stable until 2010 (55%). In 2002, the geographic variation in the Pap smear rate was the smallest, ranging from 49% in Penghu County to 63% in I-lan County, with a rate ratio of 1.28. Unfortunately, the rate ratio increased to 1.49 in 2010, the rate being lowest in Penghu County (42%) and highest in Tainan City (63%). We identified four cities/counties with unique patterns of change in Pap smear rates, which were highly associated with the leadership style of the director of the city/county bureau of public health. Conclusions: Despite the launch of an organized cancer screening program in Taiwan, geographic variation in the uptake of cervical cancer screening still exists and has increased during the past decade. The "leadership style factor" of the director of the city/county bureau of public health might play a plausible role in explaining the pattern of change in geographic variation in the use of cervical cancer screening in Taiwan. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84892154409	Changes in the magnitude of social inequality in the uptake of cervical cancer screening in Taiwan, a country implementing a population-based organized screening program	Introduction. We sought to examine changes in the magnitude of social inequality in the uptake of cervical cancer screening between 2001 and 2009 in Taiwan. Methods. We used data from the 2001 and 2009 Taiwan National Health Interview Surveys to calculate the absolute (slope of index of inequality, SII) and relative (relative index of inequality, RII) summary measures of social inequality in the uptake of Pap smear tests to indicate the magnitude of social inequality. Results: The prevalence of having had a Pap smear during the previous 3 years increased in each age and socioeconomic group from 2001 to 2009. The SII and RII by urbanization and education level decreased significantly, while the SII and RII by income level increased significantly between the two study years. The largest increase in inequality of prevalence from 2001 to 2009 was between women living in suburban and rural areas with highest income level and women live in metropolitan areas with lowest income level. Conclusions: The changes in magnitude of social inequality in the uptake of cervical cancer screening differed by indicators of socioeconomic position. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms that result in social inequality by different indicators of socioeconomic position. © 2014 Chiou et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84894675375	Possible effect of implementing a national query program on site-specific cancer mortality rates in Taiwan	Background: This study aimed to examine possible effects of implementing a national query program on site-specific cancer mortality rates. Materials and Methods: A total of 2,874 query letters were sent out by the Department of Statistics, Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan between January 2009 and December 2011 to medical certifiers who reported "neoplasm with uncertain nature" on the death certificate asking for more detailed information for coding. Results: Of the 2,571 responses, in 1,398 cases (54%) medical certifiers were still unable to determine the nature of the neoplasm. There were four neoplasm sites for which more than 50% of the responses changed the category to malignant, the gastrointestinal system (73%), urinary system (60%), stomach (55%) and rectum (53%). The liver was the cancer site that showed the largest absolute increase in the number of deaths after the query; however, the brain showed the largest relative increase, at 12%. Conclusions: Different neoplasm sites showed different magnitudes of change in nature after the query. Brain cancer mortality rates exhibited the largest increase.

84901913977	Social inequality in motorcycle helmet use: When a reduction in inequality is not necessarily good news	Background: We sought to examine changes in the magnitude of social inequality in motorcycle helmet use in Taiwan between 2001 and 2009. Methods: Using data from the 2001 and 2009 Taiwan National Health Interview Surveys, we calculated absolute (the slope index of inequality, SII) and relative (relative index of inequality, RII) measures of inequality in helmet use by three indicators of socioeconomic position. Results: The rate of motorcycle helmet use was 92% (14 801/16 100) in 2001 and decreased to 89% (15 748/17 948) in 2009. We noted a significant decrease in social inequality in helmet use in RII according to urbanisation level, a significant decrease in SII and RII according to income level, and a significant increase in SII according to education level. The reduction in RII according to urbanisation level was more prominent than that based on income level, from 1.73 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.84) in 2001 to 1.33 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.39) in 2009. The decline in helmet use was most prominent for motorcycle users who live in suburban areas, from 94% in 2001 to 88% in 2009. Conclusions: The significant reduction of social inequality in helmet use according to urbanisation level and income is not a public health success story. Rather, it is a warning sign of slackening law enforcement in Taiwan.

10644254601	Evaluating the comparability of different grouping schemes for mortality and morbidity	Comparison of mortality and morbidity is a commonly used method in health related studies. The International Classification of Disease (ICD) consists of thousands of codes for classifying cause of death and disease categories. A grouping scheme is needed to cluster related categories into a meaningful and manageable number for comparative purposes. Different kinds of grouping schemes have been used; nevertheless, little is known about the comparability among different grouping schemes. In this study, we compared seven grouping schemes; five for mortality and two for morbidity. We found poor comparability between different grouping schemes. Different schemes covered different ranges of codes. Some schemes used the same title, but included different ranges of codes. Features of newly developed grouping schemes were to group disease categories of similar characteristics across traditional ICD chapters and to group disease categories based on health care needs, instead of those based merely on etiology or organ system. Different grouping schemes were developed to reveal the unique mortality and morbidity pattern of different geographical areas. Different grouping logic was used by different grouping schemes. Therefore, it is difficult to make a good comparison between different schemes. An investigator tabulating the mortality or morbidity figures based on a given grouping scheme should explicitly define the exact ICD codes included. Any user of data derived from different grouping schemes, especially for comparisons between countries, should be cautious about the comparability problems. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

0347417897	Modification effects of GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP2E1 polymorphisms on associations between raw salted food and incomplete intestinal metaplasia in a high-risk area of stomach cancer	Incomplete intestinal metaplasia (IM) is a precursor of stomach cancer. To identify risk factors of incomplete IM, a 2-stage survey was carried out in 1995 among 1,485 residents in Matzu, an area with highest mortality from stomach cancer in Taiwan. There were 312 study subjects including 174 men and 138 women sampled for the gastroendoscopic examination of IM. Information on personal and familial history of stomach cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and intake frequency of various salted food items were obtained by personal interview based on a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected from each participant. Four biopsies per subject were taken from all subjects at gastroendoscopic examination to diagnose the status of IM pathologically. The Helicobacter pylori in biopsies was detected by the histomorphological or immunochemistry method, and antibodies against H. pylori in serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma level of selenium was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, plasma level of retinol, α-tocopherol, α-carotene, and β-carotene by high performance liquid chromatography, genotypes of glutathione s-transferase (GST) M1 and T1 and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 by polymerase chain reaction. The significant association between history of stomach cancer among first-degree relatives and incomplete IM was found (odds ratio [OR] = 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-5.43). There was no association between H. pylori infection and incomplete IM. Alcohol drinkers for >20 years had an elevated risk compared to non-drinkers (OR = 3.34; 95% CI = 1.19-9.39). No associations between incomplete IM and plasma levels of selenium, retinol, α-tocopherol, α-carotene and β-carotene were found. Salted food including salted meat, dehydrated salted vegetables and raw salted seafood consumed at ages of ≤15 and 16-30 years old was associated with an increased IM risk with OR ranging from 2-3. More striking associations between incomplete IM and salted food intake were observed among subjects with genotypes of GSTM1 null, GSTT1 non-null and CYP2E1 cl/cl. Our study suggests the importance of gene-environment interaction on the development of incomplete IM. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

11844264861	Tuberculosis mortality trends in Taiwan: A resurgence of non-respiratory tuberculosis	SETTING: Population-based study in Taiwan. OBJECTIVE: To determine the tuberculosis (TB) mortality trends in Taiwan by site and age. DESIGN: Mortality data for the years 1972 to 2001 were used to calculate the age/site-specific mortality rate (deaths per 100 000 population). The year of change in the slope of mortality trends was estimated by iterative piecewise regression analysis. RESULTS: A levelling off in mortality trends was noted in the late 1980s for all age groups except those aged 75 and above. Except in the age group 25-44 years, the trends in respiratory TB mortality showed a smooth decline. However, for non-respiratory TB mortality, a reversal of the decline was noted for all age groups since 1994-1995. A twofold increase in the number of deaths from central nervous system (CNS) and 'other' TB was noted. A marked increase in the number of deaths from old TB was noted since 1992-1996. CONCLUSION: TB mortality trends in Taiwan have not declined as expected over the past decade. The slowing down of the decline in TB mortality was mainly attributable to a levelling off of respiratory TB mortality in the age group 25-44 and a reversal of non-respiratory TB mortality trends, especially in the 25-44 and ≥65 years age groups.
