84933045209	The dynamic influence of emotional words on sentence processing	In the present study, we aimed to examine how the emotionality of words influences online sentence processing—specifically, the influence of emotional words on the processing of following words in sentences. We manipulated the emotionality of verbs as well as the orthographic correctness of their following (neutral) object nouns, so that the orthographic violation of the (neutral) nouns occurred in either emotional or neutral sentences. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to both the nouns and the verbs. We found that the orthographic violation of the nouns elicited a P2 and an N400 effect in the emotionally neutral sentences, but an LPC effect in the emotionally charged sentences. We also found that the emotional verbs elicited a larger N1, a larger P2, and a larger N400 than did the neutral verbs. The ERP results suggest that emotional words capture more attention than neutral words, which further affects early orthographic analysis of the following words. Our findings demonstrate a dynamic influence of emotional words on sentence processing.

84938574735	Grammatical planning scope in sentence production: Further evidence for the functional phrase hypothesis	While there is a consensus that speakers plan their utterances before they start producing them, the scope of the initial planning unit remains controversial. In subject-initial utterances, is the planning unit the whole subject phrase or a smaller functional phrase within the subject phrase? Allum and Wheeldon (2007) reported that speakers show faster onset latencies in producing utterances like The flower above the house is red, where the subject consists of two functional phrases (the flower and above the house) than in producing The flower and the house are red, where there is a single, longer functional phrase (The flower and the house), both in head-initial languages like English and head-final languages like Japanese. This has been taken to suggest that the functional phrase is a preferred unit of planning, rather than the whole subject. Experiment 1 in the present study replicates Allum and Wheeldon's study with speakers of another head-final language (Mandarin Chinese) and finds similar results. Experiments 2 and 3 investigate whether syntactic processing or visual grouping could potentially explain the pattern of responses, and find that they cannot. Together, these results provide further empirical support for the claim that the functional phrase is a primary unit of grammatical planning for speech production.

84939886488	MMN responses during implicit processing of changes in emotional prosody: an ERP study using Chinese pseudo-syllables	In this study, we tested the underlying mechanisms of early emotional prosody perception, especially examined whether change detection in oddball paradigm was caused by emotional category and physical properties. Using implicit oddball paradigms, the current study manipulated the cues for detecting deviant stimuli from standards in three conditions: the simultaneous changes in emotional category and physical properties (EP condition), change in emotional category alone (E condition), and change in physical properties alone (P condition). ERP results revealed that physical property change increased brain responses to deviant stimuli in the EP than in the E condition at early stage 90–160 ms, suggesting that physical property change of emotional sounds can also be detected at the early stage. At the later stage 160–260 ms, the simultaneous and respective changes in emotional category and physical properties were reliably detected, and the sum of the brain responses to the corresponding changes in E and P conditions was equal to the brain responses to the simultaneous changes in EP condition. Source analysis further revealed that stimuli-driven regions (inferior parietal lobule), temporal and frontal cortices were activated at early stage, while only frontal cortices for higher cognitive processing were activated at later stage. These findings suggest that emotional prosody changes in physical properties and emotion category are perceived as domain-general change information in emotional prosody perception.

84939893981	A review on the cognitive function of information structure during language comprehension	During communication, information structure can be used to highlight the most relevant piece of information, so that sufficient amount of attention can be allocated to the most important information. This paper aims to review the cognitive function of information structure during language comprehension from a neurocognitve perspective. First, we gave a brief introduction to the concept of information structure that has been studied mostly in linguistic field. Then we introduced recent studies on information structure using electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. After that, we discussed the relationship between attention and language processing more generally. Finally, we discussed potential directions for future studies.

15944403984	Acoustic characteristics of large information units' boundaries in monologue discourse	The acoustic characteristics and the perceived boundary strength of information unit boundaries in monologues are studied. The studied information units were clauses, sentences and paragraphs. The acoustic analysis was based on a prosodically labeled corpus of ten monologues. The main results were as follows: (a) There is a significant difference in the perceived degree of boundary strength for clauses (corresponding to intonational phrase), sentences (including simple sentences and complex sentences) and paragraphs. There is no significant difference in the perceived degree of the boundary strength at the edges of simple and complex sentences, nor is there significant difference in the acoustic variables measured (e.g. pitch reset and silence), suggesting that simple and complex sentences constitute a single type of prosodic constituent, (b) The pitch-based cue used to distinguish between different information units appears to be the difference between pre- and post-boundary syllables, but not simply the pitch of either syllable alone, (c) Declination occurs within intonational phrases, but not across or between larger units, (d) Silent pauses are longer and more varied between larger units. Moreover, there is a significant positive correlation between silent pause duration and the degree of pitch reset at clause boundary.

21144455311	Letter recognition of Germans and Chinese - Similarities in attention allocation and differences in encoding	Germans and Chinese participated in letter recognition experiments based on the Sperling paradigm. They were instructed to report as many items as possible from a briefly exposed two-row matrix of letters from the Latin alphabet. In Experiment 1, the Germans performed better than the Chinese. In addition, a position effect was found in that participants correctly reported more letters from the first row than from the second row. In Experiment 2, the position effect was replicated even though the response mode prompted participants to report items from the bottom row first. In Experiment 3, the instruction as to how to allocate attention influenced the position effect. The performance lead of the Germans, as compared to the Chinese, was independent of these instructions. It is hypothesized that reading habits have influenced the allocation of attention and that language-specific encoding of the letters caused the differences in performance. © Hogrefe-Verlag Göttingen 2003.

0031220995	Prosodic cues to syntactic boundaries	The systematic differences of temporal and frequency parameters of syllable sets at the word, word group, phrase, clause and sentence boundaries were investigated. It was found that (1) temporal parameters of the syllable immediate before the boundaries change significantly, but do not for syllables in other positions, (2) for syllables before boundaries the sum of duration and following pause increase linearly with the level of boundaries, (3) the duration of the syllable increases at first before word group and phrase boundaries, and then decreases before clause and sentence boundaries, (4) the pause duration increases dramatically as the level of boundary is higher, (5) the average values of fundamental frequencies decrease as boundary level is higher.

2942608170	Acoustic analysis on prosodic hierarchical boundaries of Chinese	Based on large corpus with both low and fast speed, we investigated acoustic correlations to prosodic hierarchical boundaries in Chinese. The main results are as follows. (1) The declination of intonation in Chinese is realized by the bottom line which is composed of low points of the pitch. (2) The acoustics correlations of prosodic word boundary are pre-boundary lengthening and discontinuation of the bottom line of intonation. (3) The acoustics correlations of prosodic phrase and intonation phrase are pitch reset of bottom line of intonation and insertion of silence. Moreover, the higher the prosodic boundary is, the higher the extent of pitch reset is and the longer the silence is. There is no significant difference on pre-boundary lengthening between syllables on these two prosodic boundaries. (4) There are logarithm correlations between perceived boundary strength and length of silence.

33846508777	Experimental studies on downstep in Chinese intonation	Downstep in pitch contour of Mandarin Chinese is examined using subtly designed sentences, by controlling tone combinations. The results show both automatic and non-automatic downstep exist in Putonghua. In non-automatic downstep, the low tone will compress downwards the pitch range of following syllables, and the main influence of downstep is on topline. Low tone will not only lower the topline behind it, but also raise the high tone before it, both effect can be compatible with each other in Chinese. In automatic downstep, the topline of intonational phrase pitch contour is presented as a linear downtrend. But there are different results among speakers because of the effect of stress. In addition to these, by comparing with the downstep in other tone or non-tone languages, in Chinese, the ratio of downstep is not constant, and the domain of downstep is not limited within the adjacent tones.

34547127147	Electrophysiological estimates of the time course of semantic and metrical encoding in Chinese speech production	Previous research has shown that conceptual/semantic information precedes segmental information in stress language production (such as English or Dutch). The present study investigated the relative time course of semantic and metrical encoding during Chinese (a tone language) production. Participants were shown pictures and carried out a dual-choice go/nogo decision based on semantic information (whether the depicted item was of a living or non-living object) and metrical information (whether the tone of picture's name was one type, tone 1 or tone 2, or the other type, tone 3 or tone 4). The behavior data, the N200 (related to response inhibition) and the lateralized readiness potentials (LRP, related to response preparation) indicated that semantic encoding was prior to metrical encoding. It provided evidence for early semantic encoding and later metrical encoding of speech production, and supported the serial model or the cascading model, rather than the parallel model of language production. This conclusion relating to the time course of semantic versus segmental encoding in stress languages might be generalized to semantic versus metrical encoding in tone languages such as Chinese. © 2007 IBRO.

36348990275	Electrophysiological estimates of the time course of tonal and orthographic encoding in Chinese speech production	Recent electrophysiological studies have investigated the time course of semantic, syntactic, and phonological encoding in European language spoken production, such as English or Dutch. The present study investigated the time course of tonal and orthographic encoding during Chinese word production. Participants were shown pictures and carried out a dual-choice Go/noGo decision based on tonal information (whether a picture name was tone 1 or 2, or tone 3 or 4) or orthographic information (whether or not the picture name was written with a left-right structure character). Analyses of N200 effects and LRPs (lateralized readiness potentials) indicated that tonal information was retrieved prior to orthographic information. These results imply that orthographic codes are unlikely to contribute to phonological encoding in spoken word production. Furthermore, a late effect for the N200 in the Go/noGo = tone condition was observed, which may be related to internal self-monitoring of suprasegmental information. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

32044471062	Recognition of briefly exposed digits, Latin letters, and Chinese characters: Evidence for language-specific differences in encoding and rehearsal	German and Chinese students took part in four experiments. In Experiment 1, which was based on the Sperling paradigm, the participants were asked to report as many digits as possible from a briefly presented matrix. In contrast to previous experiments which had made use of Latin letters, the Chinese clearly outperformed the Germans this time. In Experiment 2, memory span for digits and Latin letters was measured. With Latin letters, the Germans achieved higher scores than the Chinese. The opposite was true for digit memory span. Taken together, the results indicate that performance in the Sperling task is not solely determined by encoding efficiency but also by rehearsal speed. In Experiment 3, the participants had to recognize only one item from briefly exposed stimulus displays. Besides Latin letters, language-specific stimuli were used consisting of combinations of letters for Germans and components of Chinese characters for Chinese. Based on the data from Experiment 3, two language-specific item sets comperable in terms of task difficulty, were chosen for use in the Sperling task in Experiment 4. Under these conditions, there was no significant difference in the overall level of performance between the two language groups. Performance was influenced, however, by the position of the items to be reported and this in a slightly different way in each language group. We discuss to what extent reading habits influenced the allocation of attention and adaptive processes caused differences in item recognition. © Hogrefe Verlag Göttingen 2006.

79952317177	Event-related potential correlates of the expectancy violation effect during emotional prosody processing	The present study investigated the expectancy violation effects evoked by deviation in sentential emotional prosody (EP), and their association with the deviation patterns. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded for mismatching EPs with different patterns of deviation and for matching control EPs while subjects performed emotional congruousness judgment in Experiment 1 and visual probe detection tasks in Experiment 2. In the control experiment, EPs and acoustically matched non-emotional materials were presented and ERPs were recorded while participants judged the sound intensity congruousness. It was found that an early negativity, whose peak latency varied with deviation pattern, was elicited by mismatching EPs relative to matching ones, irrespective of task-relevance. A late positivity was specifically induced by mismatching EPs, and was modulated by both deviation pattern and task-relevance. Moreover, these effects cannot be simply attributed to the change in non-emotional acoustic properties. These findings suggest that the brain detects the EP deviation rapidly, and then integrates it with context for comprehension, during which the emotionality plays a role of speeding up the perception and enhancing vigilance. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

84887583367	Individuals with congenital amusia imitate pitches more accurately in singing than in speaking: Implications for music and language processing	In this study, we investigated the impact of congenital amusia, a disorder of musical processing, on speech and song imitation in speakers of a tone language, Mandarin. A group of 13 Mandarin-speaking individuals with congenital amusia and 13 matched controls were recorded while imitating a set of speech and two sets of song stimuli with varying pitch and rhythm patterns. The results indicated that individuals with congenital amusia were worse than controls in both speech and song imitation, in terms of both pitch matching (absolute and relative) and rhythm matching (relative time and number of time errors). Like the controls, individuals with congenital amusia achieved better absolute and relative pitch matching and made fewer pitch interval and contour errors in song than in speech imitation. These findings point toward domain-general pitch (and time) production deficits in congenital amusia, suggesting the presence of shared pitch production mechanisms but distinct requirements for pitch-matching accuracy in language and music processing. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

43249103458	Event-related potential evidence on the influence of accentuation in spoken discourse comprehension in Chinese	In an event-related potential experiment with Chinese discourses as material, we investigated how and when accentuation influences spoken discourse comprehension in relation to the different information states of the critical words. These words could either provide new or old information. It was shown that variation of accentuation influenced the amplitude of the N400, with a larger amplitude for accented than for deaccented words. In addition, there was an interaction between accentuation and information state. The N400 amplitude difference between accented and deaccented new information was smaller than that between accented and de-accented old information. The results demonstrate that, during spoken discourse comprehension, listeners rapidly extract the semantic consequences of accentuation in relation to the previous discourse context. Moreover, our results show that the N400 amplitude can be larger for correct (new, accented words) than incorrect (new, deaccented words) information. This, we argue, proves that the N400 does not react to semantic anomaly per se, but rather to semantic integration load, which is higher for new information. © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

46749130792	Pitch accent and lexical tone processing in Chinese discourse comprehension: An ERP study	In the present study, event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded to investigate the role of pitch accent and lexical tone in spoken discourse comprehension. Chinese was used as material to explore the potential difference in the nature and time course of brain responses to sentence meaning as indicated by pitch accent and to lexical meaning as indicated by tone. In both cases, the pitch contour of critical words was varied. The results showed that both inconsistent pitch accent and inconsistent lexical tone yielded N400 effects, and there was no interaction between them. The negativity evoked by inconsistent pitch accent had the some topography as that evoked by inconsistent lexical tone violation, with a maximum over central-parietal electrodes. Furthermore, the effect for the combined violations was the sum of effects for pure pitch accent and pure lexical tone violation. However, the effect for the lexical tone violation appeared approximately 90 ms earlier than the effect of the pitch accent violation. It is suggested that there might be a correspondence between the neural mechanism underlying pitch accent and lexical meaning processing in context. They both reflect the integration of the current information into a discourse context, independent of whether the current information was sentence meaning indicated by accentuation, or lexical meaning indicated by tone. In addition, lexical meaning was processed earlier than sentence meaning conveyed by pitch accent during spoken language processing. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

60149109685	Perception of prosodic hierarchical boundaries in Mandarin Chinese sentences	The current study aimed at investigating the processing of prosodic hierarchical boundaries in Mandarin Chinese sentences using electroencephalography, mainly focused on the following questions: (1) whether prosodic boundaries at different levels could evoke the closure positive shift reflecting prosodic boundary perception; (2) what were the differences between them at latency, amplitude and topography; (3) whether this positive component was modified by the variations of acoustic cues (e.g. pause). Main results were: (1) As the previous studies indicated, intonational phrases elicited the closure positive shift as a marker of online speech structuring; (2) phonological phrases evoked the same positive effect with shorter onset latency and somewhat lower amplitude; (3) when the pauses in the vicinity of prosodic boundaries were entirely removed, the original latency difference between the two conditions disappeared, which clearly demonstrated the influence of pause on prosodic boundary processing; (4) prosodic word boundaries only induced amplitude variation waving around the baseline, which was more positive compared with the one elicited by syllable boundaries. The present results indicated that listeners were very sensitive to both intonational phrase boundaries and phonological phrase boundaries. © 2009 IBRO.

62749172379	Experimental study on declination in Chinese intonation	The aim of designing sentences with special tone combinations is to investigate the declination tendency of intonation in Mandarin Chinese. The result shows that baselines of Prosodic Phrases (PP), as the basic declination units, show the phenomena of declination clearly, and the declination slope is in inverse proportion to the length of PP. Different tone combinations of PP have different declination slopes. The primary conclusions are as follows: (1) If low points are at the beginning of prosodic word, the absolute value of baseline slope is larger than those at the end; (2) The declination of PP is larger if it is at the beginning of sentences than that at the end. (3) The start-points of baselines of PPs fall in order when there are more than two PPs in one sentence, the declination pattern is relevant to syntactic-semantic relations between prosodic phrases.

67349149653	Early cortical processing of linguistic pitch patterns as revealed by the mismatch negativity	Previous brain imaging studies have shown the left hemispheric dominance for processing of lexical tone in native speakers. However, the low temporal resolution related to neuroimaging techniques might not explicitly detect the brain activities that occur at a relatively small or a determined time frame. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) and a source estimation technique (low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA]) to probe the brain activities underlying the early pre-attentive processing of Mandarin lexical tone and intonation. A passive oddball paradigm was applied to present tone and intonation contrast in a speech and nonspeech context. The results showed that no difference of the MMN amplitudes existed between speech and nonspeech conditions, although a larger MMN was found for tone than intonation condition. Source localization of the MMNs for all of the conditions showed the right hemispheric dominance, regardless of their linguistic functions (tone vs. intonation) or speech context (speech vs. nonspeech). Interestingly, the MMN generator for normal tone and hummed tone originated from the same cortical area (right parietal lobe, BA 19). These findings suggest that the pre-attentive cortical processing can be modulated not only by speech stimuli, but also by their nonspeech hums. Our data are compatible with the acoustic hypothesis of speech processing. Crown Copyright © 2009.

67349177477	Speech perception deficits by Chinese children with phonological dyslexia	Findings concerning the relation between dyslexia and speech perception deficits are inconsistent in the literature. This study examined the relation in Chinese children using a more homogeneous sample-children with phonological dyslexia. Two experimental tasks were administered to a group of Chinese children with phonological dyslexia, a group of age-matched control children, and a group of adults. In addition to a categorical perception task, a selective adaptation task was carried out. The results indicated that Chinese children with phonological dyslexia were less consistent than both the child and adult control groups in identifying stimuli within a given phonetic category. Furthermore, they did not show any significant adaptation effects in the selective adaptation task even when the adapting stimulus was identical to an endpoint stimulus in the test continuum. It seems that children with phonological dyslexia have a general deficiency in representing and processing speech stimuli. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

67349213645	Immediate integration of prosodic information from speech and visual information from pictures in the absence of focused attention: A mismatch negativity study	Language is often perceived together with visual information. Recent experimental evidences indicated that, during spoken language comprehension, the brain can immediately integrate visual information with semantic or syntactic information from speech. Here we used the mismatch negativity to further investigate whether prosodic information from speech could be immediately integrated into a visual scene context or not, and especially the time course and automaticity of this integration process. Sixteen Chinese native speakers participated in the study. The materials included Chinese spoken sentences and picture pairs. In the audiovisual situation, relative to the concomitant pictures, the spoken sentence was appropriately accented in the standard stimuli, but inappropriately accented in the two kinds of deviant stimuli. In the purely auditory situation, the speech sentences were presented without pictures. It was found that the deviants evoked mismatch responses in both audiovisual and purely auditory situations; the mismatch negativity in the purely auditory situation peaked at the same time as, but was weaker than that evoked by the same deviant speech sounds in the audiovisual situation. This pattern of results suggested immediate integration of prosodic information from speech and visual information from pictures in the absence of focused attention. © 2009 IBRO.

67649654101	Semantic illusion depends on information structure: ERP evidence	Next to propositional content, speakers distribute information in their utterances in such a way that listeners can make a distinction between new (focused) and given (non-focused) information. This is referred to as information structure. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the role of information structure in semantic processing. Following different questions in wh-question-answer pairs (e.g. What kind of vegetable did Ming buy for cooking today? / Who bought the vegetables for cooking today?), the answer sentences (e.g., Ming bought eggplant/beef to cook today.) contained a critical word, which was either semantically appropriate (eggplant) or inappropriate (beef), and either focus or non-focus. The results showed a full N400 effect only when the critical words were in focus position. In non-focus position a strongly reduced N400 effect was observed, in line with the well-known semantic illusion effect. The results suggest that information structure facilitates semantic processing by devoting more resources to focused information. © 2009.

68749105793	Horizontal flow of semantic and phonological information in chinese spoken sentence production	A variant of the picture-word interference paradigm was used in three experiments to investigate the horizontal information flow of semantic and phonological information between nouns in spoken Mandarin Chinese sentences. Experiment 1 demonstrated that there is a semantic interference effect when the word in the second phrase (N3) and the first noun in the initial phrase (N1) are semantically related, while there is no effect when N3 and the second noun in the initial phrase (N2) are semantically related. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that there is a phonological facilitation effect only when the two phonologically related words are both in the initial phrase, and there is no effect when they are in different phrases. Reinforcing the findings of an earlier study of horizontal information flow by Smith and Wheeldon (2004), our results indicate that there is a temporal overlap in the access of the nouns in spoken Mandarin Chinese sentences and a flow of semantic and phonological information between these nouns. Moreover, our results are incompatible with a wholly parallel view of horizontal information flow and instead provide support for a view which is partly serial and partly parallel in nature.

67949100337	Independent effects of orthographic and phonological facilitation on spoken word production in mandarin	A picture-word interference paradigm with visually presented distractors was used to investigate the independent effects of orthographic and phonological facilitation on Mandarin monosyllabic word production. Both the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) and the picture-word relationship along different lexical dimensions were varied. We observed a pure orthographic facilitation effect and a pure phonological facilitation effect, and found that the patterns of orthographic and phonological facilitation were different. Of most interest, the additive effects of orthographic and phonological facilitation at 150-ms and 0-ms SOAs indicated that the orthographic effect was largely independent of the phonological effect on spoken picture naming. We argue that the present findings are useful for constraining theoretical models of language production and contend that theoretical models of word production need to consider independent effects of orthography and phonology on picture naming, at least in Chinese.

68049083639	Acoustic character modification of clauses from discourse stress in Putonghua	The bringing changes of pitch and syllable duration marking stresses in clauses that are put in discourses were observed in the recitation of Chinese News broadcasting text. As compared isolated clauses with them in a discourse, the results show that the pitch changes of intonational nucleus in clauses are most prominent, i.e. top lines of pitch move downwards as a whole. The weakened degree is different to different kind of stress. The stress of clause in a discourse will be obviously weakened, if it wasn't assigned discourse stress; The weakness is presented by to reduce the pitch and syllable duration in same time. The speakers could to use the modification of the clause stress in a discourse which consists of some clauses, in order to control the discourse prosody, and then to glibly express the meaning of text. It introduced the experimental phonetics to broadcasting speech education; and provided a prosodic control for the new Chinese TTS system.

77349115115	How and when prosodic boundaries influence syntactic parsing under different discourse contexts: An ERP study	In the present study, the ERP (event-related brain potentials) technique was used to investigate how and when prosodic boundaries interact with ongoing discourse context during on-line syntactic processing and especially the precise time characteristics of this prosodic boundaries effect. Chinese question-answer dialogues were used as stimuli. The answers were syntactically ambiguous phrases, the meaning of which could be biased via changing the preceding question context or the prosodic boundaries in the carrier sentence. The results revealed that, first, presence of prosodic boundaries, relative to absence of these boundaries, evoked a P2 effect. Second and importantly, there was an immediate interaction between discourse context and prosodic boundaries. When the prosodic boundaries were inconsistent with the syntactic interpretation built upon the ongoing discourse context, a left-anterior distributed LAN effect or a combined LAN and N400 effect was elicited (time-locked to the critical words at the immediate right side of prosodic boundaries). The results indicated that prosodic boundaries can be used to guide syntactic parsing and can be immediately integrated with the ongoing discourse context during spoken discourse comprehension. In addition, the LAN effect elicited by prosodic boundaries violation indicated that prosodic information may affect the initial incorporation of a word into the syntactic structure in speech processing. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77951952946	Syntactic boundaries and comma placement during silent reading of Chinese text: Evidence from eye movements	In an eye-tracking experiment, we investigated whether and how a comma influences the reading of Chinese sentences comprised of different types of syntactic constituent such as word, phrase and clause. Participants read Chinese sentences that did or did not insert a comma at the end of a syntactic constituent. The results showed that the fixation times were shorter for the target word followed by a comma than for that followed by no comma, which suggests that a comma facilitated word identification during the reading of Chinese sentences. Furthermore, the insertion of commas shortened the total fixation times in the post-target region only for the clause condition. The data are consistent with previous findings concerning the role of segmentation cues in reading, and compatible with the implicit prosody hypothesis. © United Kingdom Literacy Association 2009.

77953121525	Perception of Chinese poem and its electrophysiological effects	A neural correlate for phrase boundary perception in language has recently been identified as a reliable and replicable brain effect. It is called the closure positive shift (CPS) and has an equivalent in the perception of music (music CPS). Nevertheless, either in language or in music, this component is elicited by phrase boundary embedded in sentence or melody. Poetry, as the interlude of language and music, is a special kind of discourse and promising material to explore prosodic boundary processing beyond sentence level. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cognitive processing of hierarchical prosodic boundaries in Chinese Tang poem using rhythm matching task. There are generally four hierarchical levels in each poem, including foot boundary, phonological phrase boundary, intonational phrase boundary, and couplet boundary. The electrophysiological results indicated that all the prosodic boundaries of different levels in poems could give rise to the CPS reflecting prosodic phrasing. Furthermore, as the prosodic hierarchical level became higher, the onset latency of the CPS got longer, suggesting the influence of retrospective processing of former information. With regard to the amplitude, we analyzed the CPS amplitude in every 100 ms time window. It was showed that phonological phrase boundary elicited higher CPS amplitude as compared to that evoked by couplet boundary in an earlier time window, whereas in a later time window both of them were lower than the CPS correlated to intonational phrase boundary. The present results further shape our understanding of the CPS component and its relation to the processes involved in prosodic phrasing. © 2010 IBRO.

77954458592	Processing melodic contour and speech intonation in congenital amusics with Mandarin Chinese	Congenital amusia is a disorder in the perception and production of musical pitch. It has been suggested that early exposure to a tonal language may compensate for the pitch disorder (Peretz, 2008). If so, it is reasonable to expect that there would be different characterizations of pitch perception in music and speech in congenital amusics who speak a tonal language, such as Mandarin. In this study, a group of 11 adults with amusia whose first language was Mandarin were tested with melodic contour and speech intonation discrimination and identification tasks. The participants with amusia were impaired in discriminating and identifying melodic contour. These abnormalities were also detected in identifying both speech and non-linguistic analogue derived patterns for the Mandarin intonation tasks. In addition, there was an overall trend for the participants with amusia to show deficits with respect to controls in the intonation discrimination tasks for both speech and non-linguistic analogues. These findings suggest that the amusics' melodic pitch deficits may extend to the perception of speech, and could potentially result in some language deficits in those who speak a tonal language. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77955828035	Prosodic features of rhetorical structural boundaries in mandarin Chinese text	This paper investigates the prosodic reflection of rhetorical structures in Chinese texts. A corpus of twenty oral texts that had been read aloud was annotated based on the rhetorical structure theory (RST) and was then acoustically analyzed. The prosodic features included pause duration, pitch reset and pre-boundary lengthening. The results show that both pause duration and top line reset are reliable indicators of the rhetorical structure of texts. Their values increase as the position of the segment climbs up the rhetorical hierarchy, with some limitations. Bottom line reset and pre-boundary lengthening are found to not be valid indicators of the rhetorical structure of texts.

78650283255	Research progress on system-generated language: From the psycholinguistic perspective	As the development of computer technology and Internet use, system utterance producing gains more and more attention. Research on utterance producing systems has been approached from two angles. In one research tradition, the analysis of corpus led to templates of system utterance generation. In another tradition, a natural language generation (NLG) system corresponding to human language production theories was founded. The NLG system was marked as flexible and trainable. In this paper, we introduce the progress on system-generated language from a psycholinguistic perspective and take an example to explain the function of human language production theories for the development of NLG systems. As more and more progress was made by psycholinguists on language production, there will be abundant room for NLG systems to improve in the future. © 2010 IEEE.

The result indicated that listeners are more accurate and faster at determining the changes of emotional feature than intensity, and the changes of emotional feature can be detected and integrated irrespective of attention allocation while the changes of intensity can only be detected with focus attention. These findings suggest that low level acoustic decoding is more interfered by high level emotional feature in emotional prosody processing, implying that emotional feature has precedence over single acoustic cue in vocal emotion perception. © 2010 IEEE.

79953836149	Immediate integration of different types of prosodic information during on-line spoken language comprehension: An ERP study	An event-related brain potentials (ERP) experiment was carried out to investigate the role of prosodic prominence and prosodic boundary as well as their interaction in spoken discourse comprehension. Chinese question-answer dialogues were used as stimuli. The answer sentence is a syntactically ambiguous phrase, with a prosodic phrase boundary at the immediate left side of the critical word in the carrier sentence. Meanwhile, the critical word was accented. We manipulated the question context while keeping the speech signal of the answer sentence constant, which gives rise to congruent and in-congruent question-answer pairs with violations of prosodic prominence, prosodic boundary, or both. Results showed that prosodic prominence violation evoked a frontal-central negative effect (270-510 ms), while prosodic boundary violation elicited a broadly distributed negative effect (270-510 ms and 510-660 ms). The effect of combined prominence-boundary violation was similar to that of the single prosodic prominence violation. Furthermore, there was an interaction between the effect of prosodic prominence violation and the effect of prosodic boundary violation in the window latency of 270-510 ms, which suggests an immediate interaction between the semantic processing of prosodic prominence and the syntactic processing of prosodic boundary during spoken language comprehension. In addition, a detailed analysis of the obtained negativity effects showed that the size of the negative effect to the prosodic boundary violation was increased by an additional prosodic prominence violation, but the size of the negative effect to the prosodic prominence violation was not affected by an additional prosodic boundary violation, which suggests an asymmetry between the effects of prosodic prominence and prosodic boundary. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79954415218	The influence of information structure on the depth of semantic processing: How focus and pitch accent determine the size of the N400 effect	To highlight relevant information in dialogues, both wh-question context and pitch accent in answers can be used, such that focused information gains more attention and is processed more elaborately. To evaluate the relative influence of context and pitch accent on the depth of semantic processing, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) to auditorily presented wh-question-answer pairs. A semantically incongruent word in the answer occurred either in focus or in non-focus position as determined by the context, and this word was either accented or unaccented.Semantic incongruency elicited different N400 effects in different conditions. The largest N400 effect was found when the question-marked focus was accented, while the other three conditions elicited smaller N400 effects. The results suggest that context and accentuation interact. Thus accented focused words were processed more deeply compared to conditions where focus and accentuation mismatched, or when the new information had no marking. In addition, there seems to be sex differences in the depth of semantic processing. For males, a significant N400 effect was observed only when the question-marked focus was accented, reduced N400 effects were found in the other dialogues. In contrast, females produced similar N400 effects in all the conditions. These results suggest that regardless of external cues, females tend to engage in more elaborate semantic processing compared to males. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

0036587164	Pitch movement of stressed syllable in Chinese sentences	The pitch movement of stressed syllable in Chinese sentences was studied on three aspects, that is, perceptual experiment, matched question and statement experiment and prosodic labeled corpus analysis. The pitch cues to stressed word perception were studied in the perceptual experiment. To get the pitch movement of stressed syllable in sentences, we investigated not only multi-speaker's data but also a large database of one professional speaker. In the matched question and statement experiment, /DAO4/ was selected as the target syllable. The locations of /DAO4/ in sentences was systematically arranged at initial, medial and final position. Whether /DAO4/was stressed or not depended on accordingly question. In the prosodic labeled corpus analysis, all syllables were labeled with relevant stress degree and break degree through psychological perception experiment. The results of the stressed syllable perception experiment show that though both the shifting of pitch contour and the rising of the high point of pitch are the stressed syllable perception cues, the later is more important. From the matched question and statement experiment and prosodic labeled corpus analysis, we can draw the conclusion that the pitch movement of stressed word is on the basis of top-and bottom-line declination intonation pattern. The rising of high point of the pitch is the main cue to stressed syllable while the movement of low point of the pitch is not that much and is limited by the intonational bottom-line declination. While the syllable of tone 3 is stressed, sometimes the low point of the pitch is lower. In the top and bottom-line Chinese intonational model, the variation of top line, and the comparison of the high point of the pitch between former and later syllables are the cues to the stress degree of syllables.

79958735970	Fine-grained pitch discrimination in congenital amusics with mandarin Chinese	a group of 11 amusic individuals with mandarin as their first language were tested on a two-tone discrimination task. In addition, a four-tone sequence task with an additional initial reference note and a final return to the reference note (i.e., AABA) was employed to assess if repeating the reference note resulted in an improvement of pitch discrimination for amusic individuals. The findings showed that the amusic participants had difficulty discriminating two-tone pairs and four-tone sequences relative to 11 control participants. The performance of the amusic group on the four-tone sequence was not better than that predicted based upon their performance during the two-tone task, indicating that repetition of the reference note did not aid performance. The findings suggest that tonal language experience may not facilitate fine-grained pitch discrimination for amusics who speak Mandarin Chinese as their first language. © 2011 by the regents of the university of california.

79960041656	The roles of pitch and duration in sentence accent of discourse	Relying on a corpus of thirty narrative texts and taking prosodic words as the basic unit of analysis, the present study explores the roles of pitch and duration in sentence accent in discourse context. The results show that the relative pitch range of prosodic words contributes dominantly to sentence accent. Furthermore, the roles of pitch and duration in sentence accent are affected interactively by sentence pitch range and the rank of prosodic words. In normal prosodic words, first-level sentence accents are realized by the mutual performance of pitch and duration while second-level sentence accents mainly depend on the variation of pitch. In strengthened prosodic words, the role of duration in sentence accent is more significant when sentence pitch range is more compressed. Finally, it has been found that the correlation between pitch and duration is influenced primarily by the strength of prosodic words. In weakened, normal and strengthened prosodic words, the correlations between pitch and duration are positive, null, and negative respectively.

80052807964	The influence of discourse hierarchy on the acoustic manifestation of focus in Mandarin Chinese	Phonetic experiments were carried out to investigate whether the acoustic features of discourse focus were subjected to the influence of discourse hierarchy. Six speakers were instructed to read aloud 32 groups of experimental material. The duration, pitch range, f0 maximum, and f0 minimum of foci in different discourse hierarchy were extracted for statistical analysis. The results revealed that foci embedded higher in the discourse hierarchy had relatively longer duration and more expanded pitch range; moreover, with the variation of tone combination, foci of different discourse hierarchy differed remarkably in their manifestation of f0 maximum and f0 minimum features. Specifically speaking, for non-low tone combinations, foci in higher discourse hierarchy were notably characterized by higher f0 maximum, while for low-tone combinations, foci in higher discourse hierarchy were signaled by lower f0 minimum.

84856098076	The contribution of sound intensity in vocal emotion perception: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence	Although its role is frequently stressed in acoustic profile for vocal emotion, sound intensity is frequently regarded as a control parameter in neurocognitive studies of vocal emotion, leaving its role and neural underpinnings unclear. To investigate these issues, we asked participants to rate the angry level of neutral and angry prosodies before and after sound intensity modification in Experiment 1, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) for mismatching emotional prosodies with and without sound intensity modification and for matching emotional prosodies while participants performed emotional feature or sound intensity congruity judgment in Experiment 2. It was found that sound intensity modification had significant effect on the rating of angry level for angry prosodies, but not for neutral ones. Moreover, mismatching emotional prosodies, relative to matching ones, induced enhanced N2/P3 complex and theta band synchronization irrespective of sound intensity modification and task demands. However, mismatching emotional prosodies with reduced sound intensity showed prolonged peak latency and decreased amplitude in N2/P3 complex and smaller theta band synchronization. These findings suggest that though it cannot categorically affect emotionality conveyed in emotional prosodies, sound intensity contributes to emotional significance quantitatively, implying that sound intensity should not simply be taken as a control parameter and its unique role needs to be specified in vocal emotion studies. © 2012 Chen et al.

84863062042	The mechanism of speech processing in congenital amusia: Evidence from Mandarin speakers	Congenital amusia is a neuro-developmental disorder of pitch perception that causes severe problems with music processing but only subtle difficulties in speech processing. This study investigated speech processing in a group of Mandarin speakers with congenital amusia. Thirteen Mandarin amusics and thirteen matched controls participated in a set of tone and intonation perception tasks and two pitch threshold tasks. Compared with controls, amusics showed impaired performance on word discrimination in natural speech and their gliding tone analogs. They also performed worse than controls on discriminating gliding tone sequences derived from statements and questions, and showed elevated thresholds for pitch change detection and pitch direction discrimination. However, they performed as well as controls on word identification, and on statement-question identification and discrimination in natural speech. Overall, tasks that involved multiple acoustic cues to communicative meaning were not impacted by amusia. Only when the tasks relied mainly on pitch sensitivity did amusics show impaired performance compared to controls. These findings help explain why amusia only affects speech processing in subtle ways. Further studies on a larger sample of Mandarin amusics and on amusics of other language backgrounds are needed to consolidate these results. © 2012 Liu et al.

84863160212	Prosodic realization of rhetorical structure in Chinese discourse	The research reported in this paper is an acoustic experiment attempting to elucidate the relationship between prosodic variation and rhetorical structure in discourse. Based on Rhetorical Structure Theory, facets of discourse structure such as hierarchy, relation, and the relative importance of discourse segment were identified. Five speakers of standard Chinese were recorded reading ten paragraphs with two repetitions. Boundary pause duration, f0 max, f0 min, and pitch range of the segments were measured. It was found that speakers realized longer pauses at boundaries of higher hierarchy. Furthermore, compared with segments linked by nucleus-satellite relation, segments linked by multinuclear relation were found to have wider pre-boundary pitch range. Additionally, important segments were found to be articulated with wider pitch range than unimportant segments. These results suggest that rhetorical structure is reliably conveyed by prosodic parameters in standard Chinese. © 2011 IEEE.

84865063654	Focus, newness and their combination: Processing of information structure in discourse	The relationship between focus and new information has been unclear despite being the subject of several information structure studies. Here, we report an eye-tracking experiment that explored the relationship between them in on-line discourse processing in Chinese reading. Focus was marked by the Chinese focus-particle "shi", which is equivalent to the cleft structure "it was... who..." in English. New information was defined as the target word that was not present in previous contexts. Our results show that, in the target region, focused information was processed more quickly than non-focused information, while new information was processed more slowly than given information. These results reveal differences in processing patterns between focus and newness, and suggest that they are different concepts that relate to different aspects of cognitive processing. In addition, the effect of new/given information occurred in the post-target region for the focus condition, but not for the non-focus condition, suggesting a complex relationship between focus and newness in the discourse integration stage. © 2012 Chen et al.

84864402750	Amusia results in abnormal brain activity following inappropriate intonation during speech comprehension	Pitch processing is a critical ability on which humans' tonal musical experience depends, and which is also of paramount importance for decoding prosody in speech. Congenital amusia refers to deficits in the ability to properly process musical pitch, and recent evidence has suggested that this musical pitch disorder may impact upon the processing of speech sounds. Here we present the first electrophysiological evidence demonstrating that individuals with amusia who speak Mandarin Chinese are impaired in classifying prosody as appropriate or inappropriate during a speech comprehension task. When presented with inappropriate prosody stimuli, control participants elicited a larger P600 and smaller N100 relative to the appropriate condition. In contrast, amusics did not show significant differences between the appropriate and inappropriate conditions in either the N100 or the P600 component. This provides further evidence that the pitch perception deficits associated with amusia may also affect intonation processing during speech comprehension in those who speak a tonal language such as Mandarin, and suggests music and language share some cognitive and neural resources. © 2012 Jiang et al.

84866862364	Impaired categorical perception of lexical tones in Mandarin-speaking congenital amusics	The degree to which cognitive resources are shared in the processing of musical pitch and lexical tones remains uncertain. Testing Mandarin amusics on their categorical perception of Mandarin lexical tones may provide insight into this issue. In the present study, a group of 15 amusic Mandarin speakers identified and discriminated Mandarin tones presented as continua in separate blocks. The tonal continua employed were from a high-level tone to a mid-rising tone and from a high-level tone to a high-falling tone. The two tonal continua were made in the contexts of natural speech and of nonlinguistic analogues. In contrast to the controls, the participants with amusia showed no improvement for discrimination pairs that crossed the classification boundary for either speech or nonlinguistic analogues, indicating a lack of categorical perception. The lack of categorical perception of Mandarin tones in the amusic group shows that the pitch deficits in amusics may be domain-general, and this suggests that the processing of musical pitch and lexical tones may share certain cognitive resources and/or processes (Patel 2003, 2008, 2012). © 2012 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

84868140089	Information Structure Influences Depth of Syntactic Processing: Event-Related Potential Evidence for the Chomsky Illusion	Information structure facilitates communication between interlocutors by highlighting relevant information. It has previously been shown that information structure modulates the depth of semantic processing. Here we used event-related potentials to investigate whether information structure can modulate the depth of syntactic processing. In question-answer pairs, subtle (number agreement) or salient (phrase structure) syntactic violations were placed either in focus or out of focus through information structure marking. P600 effects to these violations reflect the depth of syntactic processing. For subtle violations, a P600 effect was observed in the focus condition, but not in the non-focus condition. For salient violations, comparable P600 effects were found in both conditions. These results indicate that information structure can modulate the depth of syntactic processing, but that this effect depends on the salience of the information. When subtle violations are not in focus, they are processed less elaborately. We label this phenomenon the Chomsky illusion. © 2012 Wang et al.

84874416642	Recognizing the emotional valence of names: An ERP study	Unlike common nouns, person names refer to unique entities and generally have a referring function. We used event-related potentials to investigate the time course of identifying the emotional meaning of nouns and names. The emotional valence of names and nouns were manipulated separately. The results show early N1 effects in response to emotional valence only for nouns. This might reflect automatic attention directed towards emotional stimuli. The absence of such an effect for names supports the notion that the emotional meaning carried by names is accessed after word recognition and person identification. In addition, both names with negative valence and emotional nouns elicited late positive effects, which have been associated with evaluation of emotional significance. This positive effect started earlier for nouns than for names, but with similar durations. Our results suggest that distinct neural systems are involved in the retrieval of names' and nouns' emotional meaning. © 2013.

84875551005	How long-term memory and accentuation interact during spoken language comprehension	Spoken language comprehension requires immediate integration of different information types, such as semantics, syntax, and prosody. Meanwhile, both the information derived from speech signals and the information retrieved from long-term memory exert their influence on language comprehension immediately. Using EEG (electroencephalogram), the present study investigated how the information retrieved from long-term memory interacts with accentuation during spoken language comprehension. Mini Chinese discourses were used as stimuli, with an interrogative or assertive context sentence preceding the target sentence. The target sentence included one critical word conveying new information. The critical word was either highly expected or lowly expected given the information retrieved from long-term memory. Moreover, the critical word was either consistently accented or inconsistently de-accented. The results revealed that for lowly expected new information, inconsistently de-accented words elicited a larger N400 and larger theta power increases (4-6. Hz) than consistently accented words. In contrast, for the highly expected new information, consistently accented words elicited a larger N400 and larger alpha power decreases (8-14. Hz) than inconsistently de-accented words. The results suggest that, during spoken language comprehension, the effect of accentuation interacted with the information retrieved from long-term memory immediately. Moreover, our results also have important consequences for our understanding of the processing nature of the N400. The N400 amplitude is not only enhanced for incorrect information (new and de-accented word) but also enhanced for correct information (new and accented words). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880302851	General change detection explains the early emotion effect in implicit speech perception	Emotional prosody differentiates neutral sound at emotional category and acoustic features. To investigate the neural mechanism of early emotion perception in speech, one approach is using spectrally rotated sound of emotional sound as a neutral stimulus to match acoustic features. However, rotating sound involves the change of intelligence of the sound. Here the current event-related potential (ERP) study tested whether the mismatch negativity (MMN) invoked by the emotion stimuli reflects the emotion perception or change salience in oddball paradigm. Results revealed both emotion and rotation of the sound invoked MMNs, and larger negativity was found for rotated than emotional sounds. It suggested the perceived salience of change may determine the mismatch effects in implicit speech perception, and revealed that MMN effect in the early stage of emotion prosody perception can be explained in the domain-general change detection. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Participants read short narratives in which the amount of emotional cues and the location of emotional cues varied across conditions: a) the context contained two emotional cues, b) the context contained one emotional cue in the second sentence, c) the context contained one emotional cue in the first sentence, and d) the context contained no emotional cue. Our results showed that compared with contexts including one or no emotional cue, contexts including two emotional cues elicited a higher level of emotional arousal, as reflected by a larger anterior distributed LPP effect. However, the location of the emotional cue was found to have no effect on emotional arousal. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Simple discourses containing three sentences in Standard Chinese were constructed and the boundary between the first sentence and the second sentence of each discourse varied along the following parameters: (a) topic internal, clause, (b) topic shift, clause, (c) topic internal, sentence, (d) topic shift, sentence. The results showed that relative to topic internal condition, topic shift condition induced higher pitch register following the boundary. Syntactic structure as index by clause or sentence had no effect on boundary pitch parameters.

This study used event related potentials to investigate the time course of integrating the newly constructed meaning of person names into discourse context. The meaning of person names was built by two-sentence descriptions of the names. Then we manipulated the congruence of person names relative to discourse context in a way that the meaning of person names either matched or did not match the previous context. ERPs elicited by the names were compared between the congruent and the incongruent conditions. We found that the incongruent names elicited a larger N400 as well as a larger P600 compared to the congruent names. The results suggest that the meaning of unknown names can be effectively constructed from short linguistic descriptions and that the established meaning can be rapidly retrieved and integrated into contexts. © 2013 Wang, Yang.

84891594152	Topic structure affects semantic integration: Evidence from event-related potentials	This study investigated whether semantic integration in discourse context could be influenced by topic structure using event-related brain potentials. Participants read discourses in which the last sentence contained a critical word that was either congruent or incongruent with the topic established in the first sentence. The intervening sentences between the first and the last sentence of the discourse either maintained or shifted the original topic. Results showed that incongruent words in topic-maintained discourses elicited an N400 effect that was broadly distributed over the scalp while those in topic-shifted discourses elicited an N400 effect that was lateralized to the right hemisphere and localized over central and posterior areas. Moreover, a late positivity effect was only elicited by incongruent words in topic-shifted discourses, but not in topic-maintained discourses. This suggests an important role for discourse structure in semantic integration, such that compared with topic-maintained discourses, the complexity of discourse structure in topic-shifted condition reduces the initial stage of semantic integration and enhances the later stage in which a mental representation is updated. © 2013 Yang et al.

84893534213	The effect of discourse structure on depth of semantic integration in reading	A coherent discourse exhibits certain structures in that subunits of discourses are related to one another in various ways and in that subunits that contribute to the same discourse purpose are joined to create a larger unit so as to produce an effect on the reader. To date, this crucial aspect of discourse has been largely neglected in the psycholinguistic literature. In two experiments, we examined whether semantic integration in discourse context was influenced by the difference of discourse structure. Readers read discourses in which the last sentence was locally congruent but either semantically congruent or incongruent when interpreted with the preceding sentence. Furthermore, the last sentence was either in the same discourse unit or not in the same discourse unit as the preceding sentence, depending on whether they shared the same discourse purpose. Results from self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and eye tracking (Experiment 2) showed that discourse-incongruous words were read longer than discourse-congruous words only when the critical sentence and the preceding sentence were in the same discourse unit, but not when they belonged to different discourse units. These results establish discourse structure as a new factor in semantic integration and suggest that discourse effects depend both on the content of what is being said and on the way that the contents are organized. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

84894092920	Acquiring concepts and features of novel words by two types of learning: Direct mapping and inference	This study examined the semantic representation of novel words learnt in two conditions: directly mapping a novel word to a concept (Direct mapping: DM) and inferring the concept from provided features (Inferred learning: IF). A condition where no definite concept could be inferred (No basic-level meaning: NM) served as a baseline. The semantic representation of the novel word was assessed via a semantic-relatedness judgment task. In this task, the learned novel word served as a prime, while the corresponding concept, an unlearned feature of the concept, and an unrelated word served as targets. ERP responses to the targets, primed by the novel words in the three learning conditions, were compared. For the corresponding concept, smaller N400s were elicited in the DM and IF conditions than in the NM condition, indicating that the concept could be obtained in both learning conditions. However, for the unlearned feature, the targets in the IF condition produced an N400 effect while in the DM condition elicited an LPC effect relative to the NM learning condition. No ERP difference was observed among the three learning conditions for the unrelated words. The results indicate that conditions of learning affect the semantic representation of novel word, and that the unlearned feature was only activated by the novel word in the IF learning condition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84897424625	Chinese tone and vowel processing exhibits distinctive temporal characteristics: An electrophysiological perspective from classical chinese poem processing	Classical Chinese poems have strict regulations on the acoustic pattern of each syllable and are semantically meaningless. Using such poems, this study characterized the temporal order of tone and vowel processing using event-related potentials (ERPs). The target syllable of the poem was either correct or deviated from the correct syllable at tone, vowel or both levels. Vowel violation elicited a negative effect between 300 and 500 ms regardless of the tone correctness, while tone violation elicited a positive effect between 600 and 1000 ms. The results suggest that the vowel information was available earlier than the tone information. Moreover, there was an interaction between the effect of vowel and tone violations between 600 and 1000 ms, showing that the vowel violation produced a positive effect only when the tone was correct. This indicates that vowel and tone processing interacts in the later processing stage, which involves both error detection and reanalysis of the spoken input. Implications of the present results for models of speech perception are discussed. © 2014 Li et al.

84898952300	The semantic blocking effect in word naming task: Evidence from chinese classifier-noun phrase production	The semantic blocking effect in the blocked-cyclic naming paradigm has been widely investigated and provides implications for the models of lexical access. However, it is not clear why this effect in word naming task was not quite stable as in picture naming task. One reason is that the target words may be directly spoken out without semantic retrieval in the single word naming tasks. To avoid this possibility, some previous studies used the "determiner + noun" phrases instead of bare noun naming. This study was trying to provide another kind of materials for the word naming studies - the Chinese classifiers. In this study, two "one-classifier-noun" phrase naming experiments were conducted and the semantic blocking effect was observed in both experiments. These results confirmed the semantic blocking effect observed in word naming task and the corresponding implications for the models of lexical access. © 2013 IEEE.

84898979958	Working memory capacity predicts human emotion evaluation: Evidence from event-related potentials	Working memory is widely considered to be a necessary component of various cognitive operations. Many human cognitive abilities can be predicted by working memory capacity. However, it is still unclear whether it can predict the ability of evaluating emotional information. Here we investigated the relationship between working memory capacity and emotion evaluation using the measurement of event-related potentials. Two groups of college students with high and low working memory capacity were picked out using a 2-back task. They were asked to evaluate negative pictures preceded by negative or neutral meanings. We found that high working memory capacity group was more successful in adopting a neutral meaning to evaluate negative picture and showed decreased amplitude of electrocortical response. The finding supported that working memory capacity can predict the ability of emotion evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.

However, how conceptual representations can be activated in music still needs to be specified. We investigated the activation of iconic meaningful representations in music by using a cross-modal semantic priming paradigm with an implicit task. Pictures of spatial scenes were semantically congruent or incongruent to preceding music in three stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) conditions. The results revealed that the semantically incongruent target pictures elicited larger N400 amplitude than the congruent target pictures. Moreover, the semantic priming effect was modulated by the SOAs. The N400 effect was observed in the 200-ms and 800-ms SOA conditions, but not in the 1,200-ms SOA condition. These results suggest that extramusical meaning purely due to iconic sign quality can be activated, and that the conceptual activation in music can be rapid and automatic. © 2014 Society for Psychophysiological Research.

84901755942	Predictors of pause duration in read-aloud discourse	The research reported in this paper is an attempt to elucidate the predictors of pause duration in read-aloud discourse. Through simple linear regression analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression, we examined how different factors (namely, syntactic structure, discourse hierarchy, topic structure, preboundary length, and postboundary length) influenced pause duration both separately and jointly. Results from simple regression analysis showed that discourse hierarchy, syntactic structure, topic structure, and postboundary length had significant impacts on boundary pause duration. However, when these factors were tested in a stepwise regression analysis, only discourse hierarchy, syntactic structure, and postboundary length were found to have significant impacts on boundary pause duration. The regression model that best predicted boundary pause duration in discourse context was the one that first included syntactic structure, and then included discourse hierarchy and postboundary length. This model could account for about 80% of the variance of pause duration. Tests of mediation models showed that the effects of topic structure and discourse hierarchy were significantly mediated by syntactic structure, which was most closely correlated with pause duration. These results support an integrated model combining the influence of several factors and can be applied to text-to-speech systems.,.

We therefore investigated 16 healthy participants with emotion and sound decision on neutral and happy voice which varied continuously in intensity. The result found that neutral and happy voice can be differentiated on P2 component under both explicit and implicit condition. Moreover, the P2 parameters were linear correlated with the rate of happiness, suggesting a graded processing of vocal emotion in early stage. However, the brain distinguished neutral from happy in P3 interval when performing explicit task but exhibit a categorical feature.

Focus was manipulated by whether or not placing a Chinese focus-particle "shi" in front of the critical words, while newness was manipulated by whether or not introducing the critical words in the preceding context. The focused words elicited a larger P2 as well as a larger positivity than the non-focused words, possibly reflecting attention allocation and immediate integration of focused information respectively. In contrast, the new words elicited a larger N400 and a smaller LPC than the given words, which may reflect difficult integration or memory retrieval of new information. These results suggest that the processing of focus and newness may involve different cognitive processes. Therefore, focus should be distinguished from newness from the perspective of cognitive processing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84904250988	How listeners weight acoustic cues to intonational phrase boundaries	The presence of an intonational phrase boundary is often marked by three major acoustic cues: pause, final lengthening, and pitch reset. The present study investigates how these three acoustic cues are weighted in the perception of intonational phrase boundaries in two experiments. Sentences that contained two intonational phrases with a critical boundary between them were used as the experimental stimuli. The roles of the three acoustic cues at the critical boundary were manipulated in five conditions. The first condition featured none of the acoustic cues. The following three conditions featured only one cue each: pause, final lengthening, and pitch reset, respectively. The fifth condition featured both pause duration and pre-final lengthening. A baseline condition was also included in which all three acoustic cues were preserved intact. Listeners were asked to detect the presence of the critical boundaries in Experiment 1 and judge the strength of the critical boundaries in Experiment 2. The results of both experiments showed that listeners used all three acoustic cues in the perception of prosodic boundaries. More importantly, these acoustic cues were weighted differently across the two experiments: Pause was a more powerful perceptual cue than both final lengthening and pitch reset, with the latter two cues perceptually equivalent; the effect of pause and the effects of the other two acoustic cues were not additive. These results suggest that the weighting of acoustic cues contributes significantly to the perceptual differences of intonational phrase boundary. © 2014 Yang et al.
