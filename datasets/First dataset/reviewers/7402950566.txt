1542379969	30-60-day oscillations of convection and circulation associated with the thermal state of the western Pacific warm pool during boreal summer	This study focuses on the characteristics of the 30-60-day oscillation (MJO) associated with the interannual variability of the thermal state in the western Pacific warm pool. The composite results show that the amplitude of MJO convection over the tropical western Pacific tends to intensify (reduce) in the WARM (COLD) case. The negative correlations between MJO convection in the WARM and in the COLD cases are examined to be significant over most of the Asian-Pacific region. The evolutions of MJO convection and lower circulation, on the one hand, exhibit larger differences between the WARM and COLD cases, but on the other hand, display a unique feature in that a well-developed MJO cyclone (anticyclone) is anchored over the Asian-Western Pacific domain at the peak enhanced (suppressed) MJO convection phase over the western Pacific warm pool, either in the WARM or in the COLD case. This unique feature of MJO shows a Gill-type response of lower circulation to the convection and is inferred to be an inherent appearance of MJO. The context in the paper suggests there may exist interactions between MJO and the interannual variability of the thermal state in the western Pacific warm pool.

0029768316	The role of-tropical convection in variation of intraseasonal teleconnections of tropical and extratropical circulations	Based on ECMWF objective analysis data, the relationships between tropical convective activities and extratropical circulation, as well as the low frequency kinetic energy, have been investigated by making use of diagnostic analysis methods on the intraseasonal time scale in winters of 1983/ 1984 and 1986/1987. From this study, it is found that the different intensities of the tropical convective activities may bring about both the different intraseasonal teleconnection wave trains between the tropics and the extratropics and the different dispersions of the low frequency wave energy. Moreover, the tropical convection can be an important junction factor for the teleconnection effect of the tropical and extratropical circulations on the intraseasonal time scale.

0002677811	The Interannual Variability of East Asian Winter Monsoon and Its Relation to the Summer Monsoon	Based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data the interannual variability of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) is studied with a newly defined EAWM intensity index. The marked features for a strong (weak) winter monsoon include strong (weak) northerly winds along coastal East Asia, cold (warm) East Asian continent and surrounding sea and warm (cold) ocean from the subtropical central Pacific to the tropical western Pacific, high (low) pressure in East Asian continent and low (high) pressure in the adjacent ocean and deep (weak) East Asian trough at 500 hPa. These interannual variations are shown to be closely connected to the SST anomaly in the tropical Pacific, both in the western and eastern Pacific. The results suggest that the strength of the EAWM is mainly influenced by the processes associated with the SST anomaly over the tropical Pacific. The EAWM generally becomes weak when there is a positive SST anomaly in the tropical eastern Pacific (El Niño), and it becomes strong when there is a negative SST anomaly (La Niña). Moreover, the SST anomaly in the South China Sea is found to be closely related to the EAWM and may persist to the following summer. Both the circulation at 850 hPa and the rainfall in China confirm the connection between the EAWM and the following East Asian summer monsoon. The possible reason for the recent 1998 summer flood in China is briefly discussed too.

0003123028	Interannual Variability of the Convective Activities Associated with the East Asian Summer Monsoon Obtained from TBB Variability	In this paper, the interannual variability of the corrective activities associated with the East Asian summer monsoon and its association with the thermal distribution of SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific are analyzed by using the daily TBB (Temperature of Black Body at Cloud Top) dataset from 1980 to 1991. The results of composite and individual analyses of TBB anomalies show that the interannual variability of the convective activities associated with the summer monsoon in East Asia is large and has a close relation to the thermal distribution of SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, especially in the western Pacific warm pool. In the summer with ENSO-like distribution of SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, the convective activities are weak around the Philippines, then the convective activities are intensified and the summer monsoon rainfall is strong in the area from the Yangtze River basin and the Huaihe River basin in China to Republic of Korea and Japan. On the contrary, in the summer with anti-ENSO-like distribution of SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, the convective activities are strong around the Philippines, then the convective activities are weakened and the summer monsoon rainfall is weak in the area from the Yangtze River basin and the Huaihe River basin to Republic of Korea and Japan. It may be also found either from the composite analysis or from the individual analysis of TBB anomalies that the convective activities associated with the summer monsoon in East Asia have a good negative relation to that around the Philippines and a positive relation to that over the equatorial central Pacific.

0030921965	The forcing of anomalous divergent wind and transient vorticity fluxes to the anomaly of stationary waves	The forcing of anomalous divergent wind and transient vorticity fluxes to the anomaly of stationary waves of DJF (December-January-February) 1982/1983 is studied. The results show that the anomaly of the transient vorticity flux convergence tends to cancel or dissipate the anomaly of the vorticity sources generated by divergent wind. The stationary wave anomalies are maintained by both of these forcings. It is also found that, for the DJF 1982/1983 case, both of the vorticity source anomaly over the tropical and equatorial eastern Pacific and that over the midlatitude North Pacific are important to maintain the atmospheric circulation anomaly over the Pacific/North America region.

24944454074	Relationship between stationary planetary wave activity and the East Asian winter monsoon	The variability of both the stationary planetary wave activity and the East Asian winter monsoon is strongly associated with the thermal contrast between oceans and landmasses. In this study, we explore the interannual relationship between the monsoon and the wave activity defined by an index of the difference in the divergence of Eliassen-Palm flux between 50°N at 500 hPa and 40°N at 300 hPa. It is found that, compared to the winters of low wave activity, the equatorward propagation of planetary waves in the middle and upper troposphere is stronger in the high wave activity winters. During these high activity winters, the upward wave propagation from the troposphere into the stratosphere becomes weaker. This is accompanied by a smaller perturbation in the polar vortex, which tends to be colder and stronger. In the meantime, the East Asian westerly jet stream, the East Asian trough, the Siberian high, and the Aleutian low all become weaker apparently. In particular, the weakening of the Siberian high and the Aleutian low decreases the northeasterly wind over East Asia, leading to a warming condition in the region especially in northeastern Asia. A further analysis reveals that the zonal wavenumber-2 pattern of planetary waves contributes dominantly to the variability of the East Asian winter monsoon.

2742559863	Seasonal Prediction Experiments of the Summer Droughts and Floods during the Early 1990's in East Asia with Numerical Models	It has been shown by the observed data that during the early 1990's, the severe disastrous climate occurred in East Asia. In the summer of 1991, severe flood occurred in the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin of China and in South Korea, and it also appeared in South Korea in the summer of 1993. However, in the summer of 1994, a dry and hot summer was caused in the Huaihe River basin of China and in R. O. K.. In order to investigate the seasonal predictability of the summer droughts and floods during the early 1990's in East Asia, the seasonal prediction experiments of the summer droughts and floods in the summers of 1991-1994 in East Asia have been made by using the Institute of Atmopsheric Physics-Two-Level General Circulation Model (IAP-L2 AGCM), the IAP-Atmosphere / Ocean Coupled Model (IAP-CGCM) and the IAP-L2 AGCM including a filtering scheme, respectively. Compared with the observational facts, it is shown that the IAP-L2 AGCM or IAP-CGCM has some predictability for the summer droughts and floods during the early 1990's in East Asia, especially for the severe droughts and floods in China and R. O. K.. In this study, a filtering scheme is used to improve the seasonal prediction experiments of the summer droughts and floods during the early 1990's in East Asia. The predicted results show that the filtering scheme to remain the planetary-scale disturbances is an effective method for the improvement of the seasonal prediction of the summer droughts and floods in East Asia.

3042599442	Recent advances in studies of the interaction between the East Asian winter and summer monsoons and ENSO cycle	Recent advances in studies on the interaction between the East Asian monsoon and the ENSO cycle are reviewed in this paper. Through the recent studies, not only have the responding features and processes of the East Asian winter and summer monsoon circulation anomalies and summer rainfall anomalies in East Asia to the ENSO cycle during its different stages been understood further, but also have the thermal and dynamic effects of the tropical western Pacific on the ENSO cycle been deeply analyzed from the observational facts and dynamic theories. The results of observational and theoretical studies showed that the dynamical effect of the atmospheric circulation and zonal wind anomalies in the lower troposphere over the tropical western Pacific on the ENSO cycle may be through the excitation of the equatorial oceanic Kelvin wave and Rossby waves in the equatorial Pacific. These studies demonstrated further that the ENSO cycle originates from the tropical western Pacific. Moreover, these recent studies also showed that the atmospheric circulation and zonal wind anomalies over the tropical western Pacific not only result from the air-sea interaction over the tropical western Pacific, but are also greatly influenced by the East Asian winter and summer monsoons. Additionally, the scientific problems in the interaction between the Asian monsoon and the ENSO cycle which should be studied further in the near future are also pointed out in this paper.

33744951432	A mechanism for interannual variations of Northeast Asian Blocking High in summer	By inversion of spatial spectral functions describing the atmospheric circulation variation with observational data, we study the mechanism for interannual variations of summer Northeast Asian Blocking High with an improved high truncated spectral model. The results showed that when the external thermal forcing distributed as an El Niño pattern, there were wave-wave interaction of wave 2 and wave-mean flow interactions between wave 2 and wave 3 in meridianal direction and mean flow of wave 1 in meridianal direction. Under such a case, there were positive anomalies over Northeast Asia on the 500 hPa geopotential height field, which provided favorable atmospheric circulation background for the frequent occurrence of Northeast Asia Blocking High during summer. When the external thermal forcing distributed as a La Niña pattern, there were wave-wave interaction of wave 1 and wave-mean flow interactions between wave 2 and wave 4 in meridianal direction and mean flow of wave 2 in meridianal direction. In this case, there were negative anomalies over Northeast Asia on the 500 hPa geopotential height field, which retained the occurrence of Northeast Asia Blocking High during summer.

33750496032	Climate impacts of anthropogenic land use changes on the Tibetan Plateau	A general atmospheric circulation model (ECHAM5) has been applied to investigate the impact of land use changes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) on local and global climate. The "control" simulation with current land cover reasonably represents the large-scale circulation and state of the atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding region. Modifying the land cover to a hypothetical non-anthropogenically-influenced vegetation cover shows significant modifications to the local and remote climate. Compared to this scenario, the TP is warmer and drier under present conditions. The Indian summer monsoon is intensified and the East China summer monsoon is weakened due to human-induced land cover change on the TP. The mean global temperature has almost no variation, whereas precipitation slightly increases. Our study indicates that human-induced land use changes on the Tibetan Plateau have had a significant impact on local to regional, and to a lesser extent global, climate. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33750742791	Long-term changes of the ultraviolet radiation in China and its relationship with total ozone and precipitation	The new version (version 8) TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) ozone and noontime erythemal ultraviolet (UV) irradiance products are used to analyze their long-term changes in this paper. It is shown that the summer UV irradiance has increased significantly from Central China to the northern and western parts of China, especially in Central China near Chongqing, Shaanxi, and Hubei provinces; whereas the UV irradiance has decreased significantly in the southern part of China, especially in South China. In July, when UV irradiance is at its maximum and hence when the most serious potential damage may happen, the results indicate an increase in the UV irradiance in Central China and the Yangtze River-Huaihe River valley and a decrease in South China and the eastern part of North China. At the same time, the total ozone amount is lower over China in summer with the most serious depletion occurring in Northeast China and Northwest China. It is found that the thinning of the ozone layer is not the main reason for the UV irradiance trend in the eastern and southern parts of China, but that the rainfall and the related cloud variations may dominate the long-term changes of the UV irradiance there. In addition, the future UV irradiance trend in China is also estimated.

34249716228	Interannual variability of the normalized difference vegetation index on the Tibetan plateau and its relationship with climate change	The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, or Tibetan Plateau, is a sensitive region for climate change, where the manifestation of global warming is particularly noticeable. The wide climate variability in this region significantly affects the local land ecosystem and could consequently lead to notable vegetation changes. In this paper, the interannual variations of the plateau vegetation are investigated using a 21-year normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset to quantify the consequences of climate warming for the regional ecosystem and its interactions. The results show that vegetation coverage is best in the eastern and southern plateau regions and deteriorates toward the west and north. On the whole, vegetation activity demonstrates a gradual enhancement in an oscillatory manner during 1982-2002. The temporal variation also exhibits striking regional differences: an increasing trend is most apparent in the west, south, north and southeast, whereas a decreasing trend is present along the southern plateau boundary and in the central-east region. Covariance analysis between the NDVI and surface temperature/precipitation suggests that vegetation change is closely related to climate change. However, the controlling physical processes vary geographically. In the west and east, vegetation variability is found to be driven predominantly by temperature, with the impact of precipitation being of secondary importance. In the central plateau, however, temperature and precipitation factors are equally important in modulating the interannual vegetation variability.

34548063557	Changes in the variability of North Pacific Oscillation around 1975/1976 and its relationship with East Asian winter climate	The variability of North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) and the associated atmospheric circulation in the boreal winter are studied with the HadSLP2, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR), and the ECMWF 40-year reanalysis (ERA-40) data. The results show that the variability of NPO is not stationary with a typical period around 3 years during 1957-1975 and shifting to around 5-6 years after that. Linear correlation and regression analysis indicates that in the winters before 1975 the geopotential height field related to the NPO is characterized by a barotropic north-south dipole around the Pacific sector, which is the traditional NPO mode. In this subperiod, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a dominant influence on the NPO. There is anomalous stationary wave propagation associated with the NPO from the subtropical-central Pacific to the northern Pacific. And the NPO has no significant relations to the East Asian climate. In the winters after 1975, however, the atmospheric circulation related to the NPO exhibits a circum-global wave train pattern over the extratropical regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Particularly, the northward wave activity propagation is enhanced over the extratropics of East Asia. The remote forcing from the tropical eastern Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies becomes small. Hence the NPO has a close relationship with the circulation over East Asia during this period.

34548763241	Dynamical diagnosis of the breakup of the stratospheric polar vortex in the Northern Hemisphere	The research on climate change in polar regions, especially on the role of polar in the global climate system, has gain unprecedented level of interest. It has been the key scientific issue of the International Polar Year program (IPY, 2007-2008). In this paper, we dealt with the debate upon the breakup time of the stratospheric polar vortex in boreal spring. An observational study of the relation between stratospheric polar vortex breakup and the extra-tropical circulation was performed. The mean breakup date - when the winter westerly at the core of polar jet turns to summer easterly - is about April 10. The breakup time has large interannual variation with a time span of about 2 months. It also has a long-term trend with the 1990s and 2000s witnessing more and more late breakups of polar vortex. Composite of wind speed at the core of polar jet for the extremely early and late breakup years shows that late years have two periods of westerly weakening while early breakup years have only one. The first weakening in the late years happens in middle January with wind speed dropping sharply from more than 40 m s

35948996151	Association of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures with the stratospheric Holton-Tan Oscillation in the Northern Hemisphere winter	Based on 45 years of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting ERA-40 reanalysis dataset and the NOAA Extended Reconstructed sea surface temperature (SST) data, the associated anomalies in the stratospheric Holton-Tan Oscillation (HTO) with the tropical eastern Pacific SST in the Northern Hemisphere winter are investigated. It is found that the HTO, which is induced by equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), is significant in the cold SST phase, but the HTO becomes much weaker in the warm SST phase. The conventional QBO modulation on the planetary wave propagation in the stratosphere is only significant when the SST anomaly is cold in the tropical eastern Pacific. However, the modulation tends to be weak when the SST anomaly is warm. It is suggested that this difference may arise from the interaction between the tropical eastern Pacific SST- and the QBO-associated planetary wave propagation.

0032783582	Effects of variation of winter sea-ice area in Kara and Barents Seas on East Asia winter monsoon	By analyzing the observation data and performing the numerical simulation tests, it is shown that the Kara and the Barents Sea area is a key region to influence climate variation over the Northern Hemisphere. The variation of winter sea-ice area in the key region is closely associated with that of the EU teleconnection pattern at 500 hPa and East Asia winter monsoon (EAWM) intensity. When a heavy sea-ice prevails in the key region, the EU teleconnection pattern at 500 hPa is excited easily (there are positive 500 hPa height anomalies over around Japan and West Europe), and winter Siberia high is weakened, meanwhile, sea level pressure (SLP) has positive anomalies over the Northern Pacific. Therefore, EAWM will be weakened, winter temperature over East Asia is above normal and the frequency of cold-air activity in February in China will be decreased. When the light sea-ice occurs in the key region, the results will be opposite.

0032884322	The modulation of planetary wave propagation by the tropical QBO zonal winds and the associated effects in the residual meridional circulation	The planetary wave-mean flow interactions during the different stage of the QBO are studied with the quasi-geostrophic zonally-averaged mean flow equations and the linearized primitive equations for planetary waves. In the linear case of steady flows, there is no feedback between the mean flow and the planetary waves. The differences of dissipating planetary wave propagation between easterly and westerly phases of the QBO is confined chiefly to low latitudes. The results also show that the differences of planetary wave amplitudes with easterly phase minus westerly phase display dipole pattern in the northern hemisphere with increasing values at high latitudes. The residual circulation indicates that there is a slightly stronger poleward and downward transport at high latitudes caused by planetary wave propagation during easterly than westerly phases of the QBO. In the case of coupling between the planetary waves and the mean flow, a noticeable difference of planetary wave propagation emerges clearly at middle and high latitudes with obviously larger upward and equatorward EP fluxes in the easterly phase winter than in the westerly phase winter. By modulating the propagation of planetary waves, the tropical QBO introduces significant variabilities of the planetary wave amplitudes and the residual circulation in the northern hemisphere. The amplitudes of planetary waves are shown to be greater during the easterly phase winter than during the westerly phase winter; the advective transport due to planetary waves is enhanced and the difference between these two winters becomes more evident at middle and high latitudes comparing with the linear result. The modulation of planetary wave propagation by the equatorial QBO winds may also explain interannual variability of ozone in the stratosphere at high latitudes. Our study provides a illustrative support for the mechanism of the QBO modulation of planetary wave propagation and the associated effects in the residual meridional circulation.

38349001059	The distribution features and patterns of regional durative rainstorm during pre-rainy season over South China	The regional durative rainstorm during pre-rainy season over South China is defined and its climatic distribution features before and after the onset of South China Sea summer monsoon are studied using daily rainfall data of 175 stations in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The results show that the frequency of regional durative rainstorm before the onset of South China Sea summer monsoon behaves with decadal variation of normal distribution from 1960s to now, and nearly opposite behavior exists in the frequency of that after the onset of South China Sea summer monsoon. The rainfall intensity of regional durative rainstorm during pre-rainy season over Guangdong province is obviously greater than that over Guangxi province. In addition, four rainfall patterns with higher frequency of occurrence before and after the onset of South China Sea summer monsoon are obtained using EOF and correlation methods. They can figure the distribution features of rainfall after and before the onset of South China Sea summer monsoon over south China.

38349074392	Characteristics and variations of the East Asian monsoon system and its impacts on climate disasters in China	Recent advances in studies of the structural characteristics and temporal-spatial variations of the East Asian monsoon (EAM) system and the impact of this system on severe climate disasters in China are reviewed. Previous studies have improved our understanding of the basic characteristics of horizontal and vertical structures and the annual cycle of the EAM system and the water vapor transports in the EAM region. Many studies have shown that the EAM system is a relatively independent subsystem of the Asian-Australian monsoon system, and that there exists an obvious quasi-biennial oscillation with a meridional tripole pattern distribution in the interannual variations of the EAM system. Further analyses of the basic physical processes, both internal and external, that influence the variability of the EAM system indicate that the EAM system may be viewed as an atmosphere-ocean-land coupled system, referred to the EAM climate system in this paper. Further, the paper discusses how the interaction and relationships among various components of this system can be described through the East Asia Pacific (EAP) teleconnection pattern and the teleconnection pattern of meridional upper-tropospheric wind anomalies along the westerly jet over East Asia. Such reasoning suggests that the occurrence of severe floods in the Yangtze and Huaihe River valleys and prolonged droughts in North China are linked, respectively, to the background interannual and interdecadal variability of the EAM climate system. Besides, outstanding scientific issues related to the EAM system and its impact on climate disasters in China are also discussed. © Science Press 2007.

58249094009	Interdecadal modulation of PDO on the impact of ENSO on the east Asian winter monsoon	The interdecadal modulation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) upon the impact of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the east Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) is investigated. When the PDO is in its high phase, there is no robust relationship between ENSO and EAWM on the interannual timescale. When the PDO is in its low phase, ENSO exerts strong impact on the EAWM, with robust and significant low-level temperature changes occurring over east Asia. The contrast in ENSO's influence between the two phases of the PDO is quite remarkable, which urges that the phase of the PDO should be taken into account in the ENSO-based prediction of wintertime climate over east Asia. This modulation may be accounted for by the change in the low-latitude Pacific-east Asian teleconnection and in the response of midlatitude geopotential height to ENSO over Northwest Pacific.

0034912436	Arctic sea ice bordering on the North Atlantic and interannual climate variations	Variations of winter Arctic sea ice bordering on the North Atlantic are closely related to climate variations in the same region. When winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index is positive (negative) anomaly phase, Icelandic Low is obviously deepened and shifts northwards (southwards). Simultaneously, the Subtropical High over the North Atlantic is also intensified, and moves northwards (southwards). Those anomalies strengthen (weaken) westerly between Icelandic Low and the Subtropical High, and further result in positive (negative) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the mid-latitude of the North Atlantic, and increase (decrease) the warm water transportation from the mid-latitude to the Barents Sea, which causes positive (negative) mixed-layer water temperature anomalies in the south part of the Barents Sea. Moreover, the distribution of anomaly air temperature clearly demonstrates warming (cooling) in northern Europe and the subarctic regions (including the Barents Sea) and cooling (warming) in Baffin Bay/Davis Strait. Both of distributions of SST and air temperature anomalies directly result in sea ice decrease (increase) in the Barents/Kara Seas, and sea ice increase (decrease) in Baffin Bay/Davis Strait.

0034989414	Lag influences of winter circulation conditions in the tropical western Pacific on South Asian summer monsoon	By means of monthly mean NCEP/NCAR data analyses, this note investigates the lag influences of winter circulation conditions in the tropical western Pacific on South Asian summer monsoon through the methods of composite, correlation and statistical confident test. The results indicate clearly that winter climate variations in the equatorial western Pacific would produce significant influences on the following South Asian summer monsoon, and with the lapse of time the lag influences show clearly moving northward and extending westward features. When winter positive (negative) sea level pressure anomalies occupy the equatorial western Pacific, there is an anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly appearing in the northwestern Pacific. With the lapse of time, the anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly gradually moves to northeast, and its axis in the west-east directions also stretches, therefore, easterly (westerly) anomalies in the south part of the anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly continuously expand westward to the peninsula of India. Undoubtedly, the South Asian summer monsoon is weak (strong).

80052627027	Climatology and interannual variability of convectively coupled equatorial waves activity	Climatology and interannual variability of convectively coupled equatorial wave (CCEW) activity, including the mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG), tropical-depression-type (TD-type), equatorial Rossby (ER), and Kelvin waves, are investigated using the satellite-observed brightness temperature data from the Cloud Archive User Service. The monthly activity of CCEWs is represented by the root mean square of the daily filtered convections in each month based on the Wheeler-Kiladis filtering method. More precise seasonal cycles of CCEW activity are obtained from the meridional and zonal mean climatology. Interannual variance of CCEW activity is further investigated. Kelvin wave activity has maximum interannual variance over the eastern Pacific, while the other three waves are most variable in the intertropical convergence zone. The four active CCEWs all have significant correlation with the background convection and local sea surface temperature (SST) over the central and eastern Pacific, but they are not significantly correlated over other regions. The El Niño events may induce more trapped and active CCEWs over the central and eastern Pacific but weakerMRGand TD-type waves over the warm pool. In contrast, the El Niño Modoki has much weaker correlation with CCEW activity. CCEW activity over the southeastern Indian Ocean is negatively correlated with the Indian Ocean dipole, while that over the western and northern Indian Ocean may be determined by atmospheric internal disturbances. The tropical southern Atlantic mode is the strongest Atlantic SST anomaly mode correlated with the Atlantic CCEW activity. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.

84861880206	Response of water budget to recent climatic changes in the source region of the Yellow River	Discharge in the source region of the Yellow River significantly declined after 1990. China Meteorological Administration (CMA) data show that precipitation in this region was low in the 1990s but returned to above normal after 2002; in recent decades there has been rapid warming of surface air, moistening and wind speed decrease. To investigate the influences of recent climatic changes on the water budget, this study simulates the surface water budget at CMA stations within and surrounding the source region during 1960-2006, using an improved land surface model. Results indicate that the spatial pattern of precipitation change is an important factor (except for precipitation amount and intensity) in determining the response of runoff to precipitation changes. Low runoff in the 1990s was consistent with precipitation amount and intensity. The recovery of precipitation after 2002 is mainly from increased precipitation in the dry area of the source region. Evaporation was mainly limited by water availability in this dry area, and thus most of the precipitation increase was evaporated. By contrast, energy availability was a more important influence on evaporation in the wet area. There was more evaporation in the wet area because of rapid warming, although precipitation amount partly decreased and partly increased, contributing to the reduction of runoff after 2002. This control on evaporation and its response, together with the modified spatial pattern of precipitation, produced a water budget unfavorable for runoff generation in the source region during recent years. © 2012 The Author(s).

84876838940	Patterns of the seasonal response of tropical rainfall to global warming	Tropical convection is an important factor in regional climate variability and change around the globe. The response of regional precipitation to global warming is spatially variable, and state-of-the-art model projections suffer large uncertainties in the geographic distribution of precipitation changes. Two views exist regarding tropical rainfall change: one predicts increased rainfall in presently rainy regions (wet-get-wetter), and the other suggests increased rainfall where the rise in sea surface temperature exceeds the mean surface warming in the tropics (warmer-get-wetter). Here we analyse simulations with 18 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and present a unifying view for seasonal rainfall change. We find that the pattern of ocean warming induces ascending atmospheric flow at the Equator and subsidence on the flanks, anchoring a band of annual mean rainfall increase near the Equator that reflects the warmer-get-wetter view. However, this climatological ascending motion marches back and forth across the Equator with the Sun, pumping moisture upwards from the boundary layer and causing seasonal rainfall anomalies to follow a wet-get-wetter pattern. The seasonal mean rainfall, which is the sum of the annual mean and seasonal anomalies, thus combines the wet-get-wetter and warmer-get-wetter trends. Given that precipitation climatology is well observed whereas the pattern of ocean surface warming is poorly constrained, our results suggest that projections of tropical seasonal mean rainfall are more reliable than the annual mean.

44249103272	Interannual and interdecadal variations of moisture transport by Asian summer monsoon and their association with droughts or floods in China	The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (NCEP-R1) and the ECMWF reanalysis data (ERA-40) for the period of 1958 - 2002 are used to estimate interannual and interdecadal variations of vertically integrated moisture transport (VIMT) by Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and investigate their association with summer rainfall anomalies based on monthly precipitation at 160 stations in China. The results show that both VIMT by ASM and summer rainfall in China exhibit obvious biennial rhythms as revealed by time coefficient of the leading EOF mode. When summer VIMT is strong (weak) in the south Asia monsoon region, a dipole VIMT anomaly in the East Asia - western North Pacific is propitious to negative (positive) VIMT convergence anomalies in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yangtze-Huaihe valley but positive (negative) VIMT convergence anomalies in South China and North China, which result in a meridional tripole structure of rainfall anomalies in eastern China, i.e., droughts (floods) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yangtze-Huaihe valley but floods (droughts) in South China and North China. On interdecadal scale, persistent floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River but persistent droughts in South China and North China are mainly linked with weakening of VIMT by ASM and a dipole VIMT anomaly in the western North Pacific after the end of 1970s. In view of the in-phase relationship between summer rainfall anomalies and VIMT convergence anomalies in China, the analysed results also show interannual and interdecadal variations of VIMT by ASM can be better described by the ERA-40 reanalysis than the NCEP-R1 reanalysis.

The results show that meridional flows in the Asian-Australian monsoon region display a seasonal reverse of the baroclinic structure in vertical direction, characterized by transition from low-level northerlies and high-level southerlies in boreal winter to low-level southerlies and high-level northerlies in boreal summer. The meridional flows with seasonal reverse mainly distribute over the Asian monsoon region and equatorial neighborhood, which exhibit significant regionality in the middle and lower troposphere. Consistent with three channels of meridional flows in the middle and lower troposphere over the Asian tropical monsoon region, three branches of meridional circulation are relatively independed, which are approximately divided by 75°E and 100°E and arranged from west to east in the Asian-Australian monsoon region. There are obvious differences among them in both winter and summer, such as eastward lowering of the meridional circulation center in boreal winter and eastward rising of the meridional circulation range in boreal summer.

55349142878	Influence of monsoon over the warm pool on interannual variation on tropical cyclone activity over the western North Pacific	The relationship between the interannual variation in tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the western North Pacific (WNP) and the thermal state over the warm pool (WP) is examined in this paper. The results show that the subsurface temperature in the WP is well correlated with TC geographical distribution and track type. Their relation is linked by the East Asian monsoon trough. During the warm years, the westward-retreating monsoon trough creates convergence and vorticity fields that are favorable for tropical cyclogenesis in the northwest of the WNP, whereas more TCs concentrating in the southeast result from eastward penetration of the monsoon trough during the cold years. The steering flows at 500 hPa lead to a westward displacement track in the warm years and recurving prevailing track in the cold years. The two types of distinct processes in the monsoon environment triggering tropical cyclogenesis are hypothesized by composites centered for TC genesis location corresponding to two kinds of thermal states of the WP. During the warm years, low-frequency intraseasonal oscillation is active in the west of the WNP such that eastward-propagating westerlies cluster TC genesis in that region. In contrast, during the cold years, the increased cyclogenesis in the southeast of the WNP is mainly associated with tropical depression type disturbances transiting from equatorially trapped mixed Rossby gravity waves. Both of the processes may be fundamental mechanisms for the inherent interannual variation in TC activity over the WNP. © Science Press 2008.

64049113807	Interannual variations in mixed Rossby - Gravity waves and their impacts on tropical cyclogenesis over the Western North Pacific	The present study investigates the transition from mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) waves to tropical depression (TD)-type disturbances and its interannual variations over the western North Pacific (WNP), using ECMWF high-resolution data for the years of 1980-2001. As the equatorially trapped MRG waves propagate westward into the WNP, the MRG waves transit to TD-type disturbances because of background flow change. Interannual variations in the transition of MRG waves are related to monsoon circulation change in response to tropical convective heating over the warm pool (WP) region. When the WP is in a warm state, convective heating is enhanced in the western part of the WNP and the monsoon trough retreats westward, which induces a westward shift of the wave transition zone. In contrast, when the WP is in a relatively cold state, the eastward penetration of convection and monsoon trough shifts the wave transition to the eastern part of the WNP. The zonal wind convergence and shear in the monsoon trough region provide a favorable condition for MRG waves to asymptote to Rossby waves. The asymmetric basic flow contributes to MRG waves moving off the equator toward the northwest. The northeast-southwest-oriented axis of TD-type disturbances in collaboration with the monsoonal environment is favorable for the conversion of eddy kinetic energy from the mean flow. The intensification of the amplitude and shortening of the wavelength during wave transition, to a certain extent, is associated with tropical cyclogenesis over the WNP. Therefore, interannual variations in the longitudinal location of tropical cyclone formation may be interpreted partly by displacement of the wave transition zone. Moreover, this phenomenon of cyclogenesis induced by the wave transition is more common during the cold years in which the monsoon trough penetrates eastward and equatorward. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.

64049116669	Interannual variations of East Asian trough axis at 500 hPa and its association with the East Asian winter monsoon pathway	Interannual variations of the East Asian trough (EAT) axis at 500 hPa are studied with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 40-yr reanalysis data. The associated circulation pattern and pathway of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) with the EAT axis tilt are specially investigated with a trough axis index, which is closely related to the midlatitude baroclinic process and mainly represents the intensity of the eddy-driven jet over the East Asia-North Pacific sector. When the tilt of EAT is smaller than normal, the EAWM prefers to take the southern pathway and less cold air moves to the central North Pacific. However, the EAWM prefers the eastern pathway and brings more cold air to the North Pacific when the tilt of EAT is larger than normal. These differences induce pronounced changes in both the precipitation and the surface air temperature over East and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the tilt status of the EAT has a significant modulation effect on the regional climate anomalies related to the intensity of the EAWM. The findings suggest an increase in the temperature anomaly associated with the EAWM intensity and a clear northward-southward shift in its pattern in anomalous tilt phase of the EAT. In addition, the modulation tends to be confined mainly to East Asia and expanded to a larger area during the weak and the strong EAWM winters, respectively. The possible reasons for interannual variations of the EAT tilt are discussed, and it is speculated that the midlatitude air-sea interaction in the North Pacific plays a dominant role. This study on the EAT tilt may enrich knowledge of the East Asian winter monsoon beyond the conventional intensity index and may be helpful to improve regional climate prediction in East Asia. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.

67349257733	Hydrological impacts of deforestation on the southeast Tibetan Plateau	The hydrological impact of forest removal on the southeast Tibetan Plateau during the second half of the last century is investigated in this study using an atmospheric general circulation model. The effects of deforestation are investigated by examining the differences between the forest replacement and control experiments. Model results demonstrate that deforestation of the southeast Tibetan Plateau would influence the local and the remote climate as well. It would lead to decreased transpiration and increased summer precipitation in the deforested area and a wetter and warmer climate on the Tibetan Plateau in summer. This may produce more runoff into the rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau and worsen flooding disasters in the downstream areas. The numerical experiments also show that deforestation would remotely impact Asian climate, and even global climate, although the statistical significance is small. A strong drought is found at middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, where livelihoods and economics have suffered from recent droughts. Ecosystem research on the Tibetan Plateau is a relatively new topic and needs further interdisciplinary investigation.

70350029655	Interdecadal variations of the East Asain winter monsoon and their association with Quasi-stationary planetary wave activity	Interdecadal variations of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and their association with the quasi-stationary planetary wave activity are analyzed by using the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis dataset and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset. It is found that the EAWM experienced a significant weakening around the late 1980s; that is, the EAWM was strong during 1976-87 and became weak after 1988. This leads to an obvious increase in the wintertime surface air temperature as well as a decrease in the frequency of occurrence of cold waves over East Asia. The dynamical process through which the EAWM is weakened is investigated from the perspective of quasi-stationary planetary waves. It is found that both the propagation and amplitude of quasi-stationary planetary waves have experienced obvious interdecadal variations, which are well related to those of the EAWM. Compared to the period 1976-87, the horizontal propagation of quasi-stationary planetary waves after 1988 is enhanced along the low-latitude waveguide in the troposphere, and the upward propagation of waves into the stratosphere is reduced along the polar waveguide. This results in a weakened subtropical jet around 40°N due to the convergence of the Eliassen-Palm flux. The East Asian jet stream is then weakened, leading to the weakening of the EAWM since 1988. In addition, the amplitude of quasi-stationary planetary waves is significantly weakened around 45°N, which is related to the reduced upward propagation of waves from the lower boundary after 1988. This reduced amplitude may weaken both the Siberian high and the Aleutian low, reduce the pressure gradient in between, and then weaken the EAWM. Further analyses indicate that zonal wavenumber 2 plays the dominant role in this process. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.

70849116885	Delayed atmospheric temperature response to ENSO SST: Role of high SST and the western Pacific	Tropical zonally symmetric atmospheric warming occurs during ENSO's warm phase, and lags the equatorial east Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) by 3-4 months. The role of the Indian and Atlantic oceans on the atmospheric delayed response has been pointed out by earlier studies. For 1951-2004, a regression analysis based on the observed SST data shows the western Pacific has a similarly important role as the Indian and Atlantic. Nevertheless, there is time mismatch of around 1-2 months between the zonally averaged tropical SST anomalies and the atmospheric temperature anomalies. It is expected that the tropospheric temperature should be controlled by diabatic heating forcing, which is sensitive primarily to SST anomalies over regions of high climatological SST, rather than to the tropical mean SST anomalies. To describe this mechanism, we propose a parameterization scheme of diabatic heating anomalies dependant on SST anomalies and climatological SST. The 1-2 month mismatch between tropical mean SST anomalies and air temperature anomalies is reconciled by the fact that the tropical mean heating anomalies are dominated by the SST anomalies over regions of high climatological SST, and lag the tropical mean SST anomalies by 1 month. The mechanism described by this parameterization scheme joins several physical processes of ENSO with reasonable time intervals. And the parameterized heating anomalies work better than the tropical mean SST anomalies for capturing the atmospheric temperature signal relative to ENSO. © 2009 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

72649093941	Effect of the climate shift around mid 1970s on the relationship between wintertime Ural blocking circulation and East Asian climate	Blocking variability over the Ural Mountain region in the boreal winter and its relationship with the East Asian winter climate is investigated. The climate shift around mid 1970s has been shown to exert a significant influence on the blocking pattern. In contrast with the years before 1976/1977, the Ural blocking signal after 1976/1977 is found to propagate less into the stratosphere and more eastward in the troposphere to East Asia, which therefore exerts more influence on the East Asian winter climate. This enhanced Ural blocking-East Asian climate relationship amplifies the impact of Ural blocking on East Asia and, with the background of decreasing Ural blocking, contributes to the higher frequency of warm winters in this region. Further analyses suggest that the NAM-related stratospheric polar vortex strength and its modulation on the propagation of atmospheric stationary waves can account for this change, with the key area being located in the North Atlantic region. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.

77950133458	Interdecadal variability of summer rainfall in Northwest China and its possible causes	The present study investigates interdecadal variability of summer rainfall in Northwest China using station observations for the period 1951-2000 and the ERA-40 reanalysis for the period 1958-2000. It is found that Northwest China summer rainfall experienced an obvious interdecadal increase around 1978. Analyses show that summer circulation, temperature and potential vorticity anomalies over Asia vary vastly before and after 1978. During the period 1978-2000, cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulation anomalies dominate over Northwest and North China, respectively. These are associated with the anomalous ascending motion over Northwest China, and their anomalous descending motion over North China. The temperature over Northwest China shows an obvious decrease at 300 hPa, but increase near the surface after 1978. This enhances convective instability, which contributes to the strengthening of ascent and the increase of summer rainfall in Northwest China during 1978-2000. © Royal Meteorological Society.

79551678954	The interannual variability of summer rainfall in the arid and semiarid regions of Northern China and its association with the northern hemisphere circumglobal teleconnection	Using the latest daily observational rainfall datasets for the period 1961-2008, the present study investigates the interannual variability of June-September (JJAS) mean rainfall in northern China. The regional characteristics of JJAS mean rainfall are revealed by a rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analysis. The analysis identifies three regions of large interannual variability of JJAS rainfall: North China (NC), Northeast China (NEC), and the Taklimakan Desert in Northwest China (TDNWC). Summer rainfall over NC is shown to have displayed a remarkable dry period from the late 1990s; while over NEC, decadal-scale variation with a significant decreasing trend in the last two decades is found, and over TDNWC, evidence of large interannual variability is revealed. Results also show that the interannual variability of JJAS rainfall in northern China is closely associated with the Northern Hemisphere circumglobal teleconnection (CGT). Correlation coefficients between the CGT index and regional-averaged JJAS mean rainfall over NC and NEC were calculated, revealing values of up to 0.50 and 0.53, respectively, both of which exceeded the 99% confidence level. © 2011 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79955050786	Characterization of turbulent flux transfer over a Gobi surface with quality-controlled observations	This study evaluates the spatial distributions in the quality of momentum and sensible heat fluxes, and determines the turbulent transfer characteristics with quality-controlled observations. The research is based on raw turbulence data collected over a Gobi surface in the Dunhuang area in June 2004. The results indicate that part of the momentum fluxes are of poor quality in the daytime and nighttime. The poor quality of the momentum fluxes in the daytime is mainly attributed to the development of turbulence. The footprint reveals that, in general, the momentum fluxes and sensible heat fluxes can be measured well in the east and west upwind sectors under unstable conditions. The relationship between the non-dimensional standard deviation of the wind components and atmospheric stability follow the "1/3 power law", which supports the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Moreover, this study identifies a clear disturbance in the measurements surrounding the Gobi surface. The momentum roughness length of z

0036090302	Numerical simulations on influences of variation of sea ice thickness and extent on atmospheric circulation	By using a 2-layer AGCM designed by Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, this paper investigates influences of thickness and extent variations in Arctic sea ice on the atmosphere circulation, particularly on climate variations in East Asia. The simulation results have indicated that sea ice thickness variation in the Arctic exhibits significant influences on simulation results, particularly on East Asian monsoon. A nearly reasonable distribution of sea ice thickness in the model leads directly to stronger winter and summer monsoon over East Asia, and improves the model's simulation results for Siberia high and Icelandic low in winter. On the other hand, sea ice thickness variation can excite a teleconnection wave train across Asian Continent, and in low latitudes, the wave propagates from the western Pacific across the equator to the eastern Pacific. In addition, the variation of sea ice thickness also influences summer convective activities over the low latitudes including South China Sea and around the Philippines. Effects of winter sea ice extents in the Barents Sea on atmospheric circulation in the following spring and summer are also significant. The simulation result shows that when winter sea ice extent in the target region is larger (smaller) than normal, (1) in the following spring (averaged from April to June), positive (negative) SLP anomalies occupy the northern central Pacific, which leads directly to weakened (deepened) Aleutian low, and further favors the light (heavy) sea ice condition in the Bering Sea: (2) in the following summer, thermal depression in Asian Continent is deepened (weakened), and the subtropical high in the northwestern Pacific shifts northward (southward) from its normal position and to be strengthened (weakened).

0035576731	Dynamical effect of the zonal wind anomalies over the tropical western Pacific on ENSO cycles	The circulation and zonal wind anomalies in the lower troposphere over the equatorial western Pacific and their roles in the developing and decaying processes of the 1982-1983, 1986 -1987, 1991-1992 and 1997-1998 El Nino events and the occurrence of La Nina events are analyzed by using the observed data in this paper. The results show that before the developing stage of these El Nino events, there were cyclonic circulation anomalies in the lower troposphere over the tropical western Pacific, and the anomalies brought the westerly anomalies over the Indonesia and the tropical western Pacific. However, when the El Nino events developed to their mature phase, there were anticyclonic circulation anomalies in the lower troposphere over the tropical western Pacific, and the anomalies made the easterly anomalies appear over the tropical western Pacific. A simple, dynamical model of tropical ocean is used to calculate the response of the equatorial oceanic waves to the observed anomalies of wind stress near the sea surface of the equatorial Pacific during the 1997/98 ENSO cycle, which was the strongest one in the 20th century. It is shown that the zonal wind stress anomalies have an important dynamical effect on the development and decay of this El Nino event and the occurrence of the following La Nina event.

80053471487	Seasonal modulation of tropical intraseasonal oscillations on tropical cyclone geneses in the western North Pacific	The seasonal modulation of tropical intraseasonal oscillation (TISO) on tropical cyclone (TC) geneses over the western North Pacific Ocean (WNP) is investigated in three periods of the WNP TC season: May-June (MJ), July-September (JAS), and October-December (OND). The modulation of the TISO-TC geneses over the WNP is strong in MJ, while it appears weaker in JAS and OND. In MJ, TISO propagates northward via two routes, the west route through the South China Sea and the east route through the WNP monsoon trough region, which are two clustering locations of TC geneses. TISO can synchronously influence most TC geneses over these two regions. In JAS, however, the modulation is out of phase between the monsoon trough region and the East Asian summer monsoon region, as well as the WNP subtropical high region, as a result of further northward propagation of TISO and scattered TC geneses. The TISO-TC genesis modulation in each individual region is comparable to that in MJ, although the modulation over the entire WNP in JAS appears weaker. In OND, TISO has a stronger influence on TC geneses west than east of 1508E because TISO decays and its convection center located at the equator is out of the TC genesis region when propagating eastward into east of 1508E. Midlevel relative humidity is the primary contribution to the modulations of TISO on the genesis environment, while vorticity could contribute to the modulation over the subtropics in JAS. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.

80053526514	An abrupt increase of intense typhoons over the western North Pacific in early summer	The frequency and intensity of typhoons have been a focus in studying typhoon-related climate changes. In this study, we focus on a seasonal cycle of intense typhoons (category 4 and 5) over the western North Pacific, particularly changes in the number of intense typhoons in early summer. In general, 81% of intense typhoons occur in July-November (JASON), with maxima in September and October. Our analysis shows that intense typhoons have tended to occur more frequently in May since the year 2000. Before 2000, intense typhoons seldom occurred in May, with a frequency of around once per decade. After 2000, however, the frequency of intense typhoons has become much higher in May - almost once per year. We have also examined changes in the large-scale environment in the past few decades. The results show that the large-scale environment did become more favorable for intense typhoons in the 2000s, which is consistent with a larger tropical cyclone genesis index. The changes include warmer sea surface temperature, higher sea surface height, larger upper-ocean heat content, weaker vertical wind shear, increased tropospheric water vapor, and greater water vapor in the mid-troposphere. The last two might be more important than the others. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The two traditional methods moving t-test and Mann-Kendall test are also performed on the rainfall data as a comparison. Results indicate four inter-decadal abrupt changes of summer rainfall that occurred near 1979, 1983, 1993, and 1999, and each of them is characterized by remarkable regional features. The abrupt change of summer rainfall around 1979 is accompanied by significant rainfall increase in Yangtze-Huai River Valley and a decrease in its flank. The one near 1983 shows similar structures of the rainfall changes to that near 1979, but with more significant changes in the South China and Northeast China (NEC). The inter-decadal change around 1993 brings a notable increase of summer rainfall to the South China; and the abrupt shift near 1999 exhibits significant decrease in summer rainfall over a large part of North China and NEC. The spatial-temporal features of the inter-decadal changes in summer rainfall are also investigated. Consistent results are observed. Moreover, results indicate that, on the inter-decadal scale, the rainfall variability mode changes from typical tripole to dipole structure since the early 1990s. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80755130527	The impact of tropical indian ocean variability on summer surface air temperature in China	Evidence is presented that the boreal summer surface air temperature over south China and northeast China is remotely influenced by the Indian Ocean Basin mode (IOBM) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Above-normal temperature in south China and below-normal temperature in northeast China correspond to a simultaneous Indian Ocean Basin warming. The teleconnection from Indian Ocean SST anomalies to China summer surface air temperature is investigated using observations and an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). The results herein indicate that the tropical Indian Ocean Basin warming can trigger a low-level anomalous anticyclone circulation in the subtropical northwest Pacific and an anomalous cyclone circulation in midlatitude East Asia through emanating a baroclinic Kelvin wave. In south China, the reduced rainfall and downward vertical motion associated with the anomalous low-level anticyclone circulation lead to above-normal summer surface air temperature. In northeast China, by contrast, upward vertical motion associated with the anomalous cyclone leads to below-normal summer surface air temperature. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.

The results indicate that the frequency of HTEs across the southern YRV in August is remotely influenced by the Indian Ocean basin mode (IOBM) SSTAs. Corresponding to June-July-August (JJA) IOBM warming condition, the number of HTEs was above normal, and corresponding to IOBM cooling conditions, the number of HTEs was below normal across the southern YRV in August. The results of this study indicate that the tropical IOBM warming triggered low-level anomalous anticyclonic circulation in the subtropical northwestern Pacific Ocean and southern China by emanating a warm Kelvin wave in August. In the southern YRV, the reduced rainfall and downward vertical motion associated with the anomalous low-level anticyclonic circulation led to the increase of HTE frequency in August. © 2012 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84855774167	Possible linkage between the monsoon trough variability and the tropical cyclone activity over the western North Pacific	The present study investigates the influence of the monsoon trough (MT) on the interannual variability of tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the western North Pacific during July-November for the period 1979-2007. It is shown that the TC activity is closely related to the MT location. During the years when the MT extends eastward (retreats westward), more (less) TCs form within the southeastern quadrant of the western North Pacific. Such a relationship can be explained by the changes in large-scale environmental factors associated with the movement of the MT. An eastward extension of the MT coincides with warmed ocean surface, enhanced convection, increased relative humidity in the lower and midtroposphere, reduced vertical shear of zonal wind, intensified upper-level divergence, and low-level anomalous cyclonic vorticity over the southeast quadrant of the western North Pacific. These conditions associated with the eastern extension of the MT are favorable for TC genesis, while those associated with the westward retreat of theMTare not. Diagnosis of the barotropic energy conversion indicates that synoptic-scale disturbances moving westward from tropical eastern Pacific will gain the energy from the mean flow when they meet with the eastward-extending MT. This is an important reason for the linkage between MT variability and TC genesis over the western North Pacific. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.

84865650844	Characteristics, processes, and causes of the spatio-temporal variabilities of the East Asian monsoon system	Recent advances in the study of the characteristics, processes, and causes of spatio-temporal variabilities of the East Asian monsoon (EAM) system are reviewed in this paper. The understanding of the EAM system has improved in many aspects: the basic characteristics of horizontal and vertical structures, the annual cycle of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) system, the characteristics of the spatio-temporal variabilities of the EASM system and the EAWM system, and especially the multiple modes of the EAM system and their spatio-temporal variabilities. Some new results have also been achieved in understanding the atmosphere-ocean interaction and atmosphere-land interaction processes that affect the variability of the EAM system. Based on recent studies, the EAM system can be seen as more than a circulation system, it can be viewed as an atmosphere-ocean-land coupled system, namely, the EAM climate system. In addition, further progress has been made in diagnosing the internal physical mechanisms of EAM climate system variability, especially regarding the characteristics and properties of the East Asia-Pacific (EAP) teleconnection over East Asia and the North Pacific, the "Silk Road" teleconnection along the westerly jet stream in the upper troposphere over the Asian continent, and the dynamical effects of quasi-stationary planetary wave activity on EAM system variability.

84869767929	Excitation mechanisms of the teleconnection patterns affecting the July precipitation in Northwest China	Using observational rainfall data and atmospheric reanalysis data, the precipitation variations in Northwest China during July and the corresponding atmospheric teleconnection patterns are studied. The results indicate that the leading modes of July precipitation variations in Northwest China are affected by the Silk Road pattern and the Europe-China (EC) pattern. The analysis suggests that the circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) could be considered as the interannual component of the Silk Road pattern. To investigate the excitation mechanisms for the CGT pattern and EC pattern on interannual time scales the singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis is performed between 200-hPa meridional wind velocity over the region of (30°-60°N, 30°-130°E) and tropical rainfall between (15°S and 30°N). The results suggest that the tropical heating anomalies most responsible for the CGT pattern are located over the North Indian Ocean, and the tropical heating anomalies most responsible for ECpattern are located over equatorial central Pacific, Indonesia, and tropical Atlantic. The tropical heating anomalies excite the CGT pattern and EC pattern by inducing divergent flow at the upper troposphere, and the advections of vorticity by the divergent component of the flow act as effective Rossby wave sources. Further analysis indicates that the tropical rainfall anomalies responsible for the CGT pattern and EC pattern are the leading modes of tropical rainfall variations, and these modes of tropical rainfall variations are related to the SST anomalies. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.

84873646962	Water budgets of tropical cyclones: Three case studies	In this study, three tropical cyclones (TCs) that passed through the Taiwan Strait were analyzed; our results show that precipitation is not directly related to the intensity of TCs. From the perspective of water budget, moisture flux convergence was dominant and contributed ~70% of the moisture for TC precipitation over the ocean and almost all over the land, especially inside the TC circulation. Their spatial distributions were also similar. Evaporation contributed ~30% of the moisture for precipitation over the ocean but changed little with the time. Moisture flux convergence can be divided into two parts: wind convergence and moisture advection. Moisture flux convergence was mostly due to wind convergence, which was dominant in the southwestern quadrants of the TCs. Moisture advection was located in the northern area, and becomes relatively important when the TCs approached the land. The moisture flux convergence and its two parts varied during TC movement, with strengthening and contraction of moisture convergence present near landfall. The vertical structure of the three TC cases all indicated that the moisture convergence was mainly confined to the lower atmosphere under 800 hPa and a weak divergence region was present in the middle troposphere around 550 hPa. © 2013 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84876438808	The activity of convectively coupled equatorial waves in CMIP3 global climate models	This study evaluates the convectively coupled equatorial waves in ten coupled general circulation models (GCMs) in the twentieth century experiment from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 of the World Climate Research Programme. The antisymmetric bands in all GCMs are weaker than in observations, and the mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) wave seems to be a mixture of the equatorial Rossby (ER) and tropical depression-type (TD-type) waves rather than a mixture of the ER and inertiogravity waves found in observations. The simulated TD-type wave is more organized than in observations with a quasilinear wavenumber-frequency relationship. In most GCMs, the two observed activity centers of the MRG and TD-type waves over the southern Indian Ocean and the southwestern Pacific cannot be separated; only one wave activity center is found over the Maritime Continent. The observed northwestward propagation of the TD-type wave over the western North Pacific is also not well simulated in the GCMs. The simulated active season of the MRG and TD-type waves over the northern hemisphere during the boreal summer and fall is much shorter than in observations. The models from CCSR utilizing the Pan and Randall scheme with the convection suppression simulate the realistic Kelvin wave activity with the maximum activity near the equator, while the wave activities filtered for the Kelvin wave in the other GCMs are similar to the extratropical Rossby wave with the maximum activity at higher latitudes. Likewise, only these two models produce a realistic seasonal cycle of the Kelvin wave activity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84878188164	Interdecadal variability in tropical cyclone frequency over the South China Sea and its association with the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature	During the period 1958-2001, the frequency of tropical cyclone (TC) genesis over the South China Sea (SCS) experienced an obvious interdecadal change around the mid-1970s. Compared to the period from late 1950s to early 1970s, the number of TCs is significantly reduced during mid-1970s through late 1990s. This interdecadal change in the TC frequency appears to relate to the increase in sea surface temperature (SST) of the tropical Indian Ocean. The difference of the circulation between the warm phase and the cold phase of the tropical Indian Ocean SST provides support for the influence of the tropical Indian Ocean warming on the variability of the TC frequency over the SCS. In the warm phase, lower-level convergent and ascending flows over the tropical Indian Ocean are accompanied by upper-level divergent flows, part of which go toward the SCS, leading to upper-level convergence and descent there. Consequently, two lower-level anticyclones develop and the TC genesis is suppressed over the SCS. Key Points A new possible process of the impact of the IO on TC over the SCS is presented The circulation anomaly leads to the interdecadel variability of the TC TCs genesis over the SCS is different during the different phase of the IO SST ©2013.

84884965319	Baroclinic instability of the silk road pattern induced by thermal damping	In this paper, the internal dynamics of the Silk Road pattern has been studied. Since observation indicates that the Silk Road pattern could be considered as stationary external Rossby waves, the quasigeostrophic three-layer model has been used to study the dynamics of external Rossby waves. The three-layer model well captures the essential dynamical features of stationary external Rossby waves in accordance with the observations. Theoretical analysis indicates that the quasi-stationary external modes could be destabilized by the weak thermal damping. For destabilization to occur, the vertical structures of the external modes must have a warm ridge and a cold trough from the lower to middle layers. The effect of thermal damping could be considered as modifying the eddy streamfunction in such way that the eddy streamfunction has a vertical phase tilt, so the eddy could feed on the basic zonal flow by extracting the potential energy. The implications for this baroclinic instability on the self-maintenance of the Silk Road pattern are discussed. The observations imply that this dissipative destabilization mechanism could explain the self-maintenance of the Silk Road pattern. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.

84886088613	Interdecadal change of summer precipitation over Eastern China around the late-1990s and associated circulation anomalies, internal dynamical causes	Observational study indicated that the summer precipitation over Eastern China experienced a notable interdecadal change around the late-1990s. Accompanying this interdecadal change, the dominant mode of anomalous precipitation switched from a meridional triple pattern to a dipole pattern, showing a "south-flood-north-drought" structure (with the exception of the Yangtze River Valley). This interdecadal change of summer precipitation over Eastern China was associated with circulation anomalies in the middle/upper troposphere over East Asia, such as changes in winds and corresponding divergence, vertical motion and moisture transportation (divergence), which all exhibit remarkable meridional dipole structures. Furthermore, on the internal dynamic and thermodynamic aspects, the present study investigated the influence of the midtroposphere zonal and meridional flow changes over East Asia on the interdecadal change around the late-1990s. Results suggested that, during 1999-2010, the East Asia subtropical westerly jet weakened and shifted poleward, forming a meridional dipole feature in anomalous zonal flow. This anomalous zonal flow, on one hand, induced changes in three teleconnection patterns over the Eurasian continent, namely the "Silk Road" pattern along the subtropical upper troposphere westerly jet, the East Asia/Pacific (EAP) pattern along the East Asian coast, and the Eurasia (EU) pattern along the polar jet; on the other hand, it brought about cold advection over Northern China, and warm advection over Southern China in the mid-troposphere. Through these two ways, the changes in the zonal flow induced descent over Northern China and ascent over Southern China, which resulted in the anomalous "south-flood-north-drought" feature of the summer precipitation over Eastern China during 1999-2010. © 2012 The Author(s).

0041971529	Evolution mechanism of the western Pacific subtropical high	To surmount the deficiency in studying the multiple equilibrium states in the atmosphere motion with highly truncated spectral method, the trigonometric functions for describing the prototypical 500 hPa height fields and the outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) fields are retrieved respectively for the northward bias and the southward bias years of the western Pacific subtropical high with corresponding observational data and the optimum subset retrieval method for four factors. Then the evolution mechanism of the western Pacific subtropical high is studied by means of multiple equilibrium state theory. The results show that the cause of inducing the abnormal location of the western Pacific subtropical high is differences in the early external thermal forcing, which evoke different waveforms in atmosphere. If the early meridional and zonal external thermal forcing differences are stronger, there are wave-mean flow and wave-wave interactions between the response waveforms in atmosphere. In such a case, the western Pacific subtropical high shifts northward obviously. On the contrary, when the early meridional and zonal external thermal forcing differences are weaker, there is no wave-mean flow interaction between the response waveforms in atmosphere, and accordingly the position of the western Pacific subtropical high oscillates with the external thermal forcing oscillation, and is on the south of normal.

0142137675	A parameterization scheme of surface turbulent momentum and sensible heat over the Gobi underlying surface	The parameterization of surface turbulent fluxes over the Gobi Desert in arid regions is studied by using rationally screened observational data. First, the characteristics of Monin-Obukhov similarity functions are analyzed and their empirical formulae are fitted. The results show that fitted curves of changes of similarity functions of wind speed and temperature with stability parameter differ little from the typical empirical curves and are within the ranges of scatter of the empirical curves, but their values in the neutral condition are different from the typical values to some extent. Furthermore, average values of momentum and scalar (sensible heat) roughness lengths as well as changes of scalar roughness length with friction velocity are determined by utilizing the data. It is found that the average values of scalar roughness length are about one order smaller than that of the momentum roughness length and decrease with increasing friction velocity, but they are evidently larger than their theoretically forecasted values.

Using the relative reflection as weighting factor, the weighted mean of the surface albedo over Dunhuang Gobi in typical arid region is calculated and its values are 0.255 ± 0.021. After canceling the interference of the buildings, the mean values of the roughness length averaged with logarithm is 0.0019 ± 0.00071 m. After removing the influence of the oasis, the soil wetness factor computed with data under condition of no precipitation is 0.0045. After removing the influence of the precipitation, the mean values of the soil heat capacity over Dunhuang Gobi in typical arid region is 1.12 × 10

0142187298	Characteristics of hydrologic transfer between soil and atmosphere over Gobi near Oasis at the end of summer	By utilizing the data observed at Dunhuang during August and September 2000 in the "Field Experiment on Interaction between Land and Atmosphere in the Arid Region of Northwest China (FEILARNC)", the characteristics of the soil moisture, temperature, and atmospheric humidity are analyzed. It is found that the thickness of the soil temperature active layer is about, 5 cm and much thinner than is typical, that not only the atmospheric humidity gradient is often inverted but also the soil moisture gradient in the shallow layer in the Gobi near oasis, that the diurnal variation of soil moisture can be divided into the four stages that are called the wet stage, the losing-water stage, the dry stage, and the attaining-water stage. It is shown that in soil moisture profiles, the depth of the soil moisture active layer is about 10 cm and soil moisture inversion is the main feature in the shallow layer during the wet stage. Such a feature as soil moisture inversion indicates that soil in the shallow layer can inhale moisture from the air through condensation in the nighttime and exhale moisture to the air through evaporation in the daytime. The condensation and evaporation constitute together the full respiration process of moisture on the ground. The formation of soil moisture inversion is related with the state of soil temperature and moisture, the intensity of atmospheric humidity inversion, and the atmospheric thermodynamic stability.

0142187314	Remote sensing parameterization of land surface heat fluxes over arid and semi-arid areas	Dealing with the regional land surfaces heat fluxes over inhomogeneous land surfaces in arid and semi-arid areas is an important but not an easy issue. In this study, one parameterization method based on satellite remote sensing and field observations is proposed and tested for deriving the regional land surface heat fluxes over inhomogeneous landscapes. As a case study, the method is applied to the Dunhuang experimental area and the HEIFE (Heihe River Field Experiment, 1988-1994) area. The Dunhuang area is selected as a basic experimental area for the Chinese National Key Programme for Developing Basic Sciences: Research on the Formation Mechanism and Prediction Theory of Severe Climate Disaster in China (G1998040900, 1999-2003). The four scenes of Landsat TM data used in this study are 3 June 2000, 22 August 2000, and 29 January 2001 for the Dunhuang area and 9 July 1991 for the HEIFE area. The regional distributions of land surface variables, vegetation variables, and heat fluxes over inhomogeneous landscapes in arid and semi-arid areas are obtained in this study.

0142187315	Relationship between sea level pressures of the winter tropical Western Pacific and the subsequent Asian summer monsoon	Using monthly mean National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data for the period 1958-1996, based on a new circulation index in the tropical western Pacific region, this paper investigates extreme winter circulation conditions in the northwestern Pacific and their evolution. The results show that the extreme winter circulation anomaly in the northwestern Pacific exhibits a strong association with those appearing in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere including the northern Asian continent, part of the Barents Sea, and the northeastern Pacific. As the season progresses, an anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly appearing in the northwestern Pacific gradually moves northeastwards and extends westwards. Its axis in the west-east direction is also stretched. Therefore, easterly (westerly) anomalies in the southern part of the anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly continuously expand westwards to the peninsula of India. Therefore, the South Asian summer monsoon would be weaker (stronger). Simultaneously, another interesting phenomenon is the evolution of SLP anomalies. As the season progresses (from winter to the following summer), SLP anomalies originating from the tropical western Pacific gradually move towards, and finally occupy the Asian continent, and further influence the thermal depression over the Asian continent in the following summer.

0346044098	10-25-Day Intraseasonal Variations of Convection and Circulation Associated with Thermal State of the Western Pacific Warm Pool during Boreal Summer	This study focuses on the characteristics of 10-25-day oscillation associated with the interannual variability of the thermal state in the western Pacific warm pool. The time series of 10-25-day oscillation shows a distinct feature between warm (WARM case) and cold (COLD case) summers over the western Pacific warm pool. The significant negative relationship between the time series of 10-25-day convection anomalies in Warm and Cold cases appears over most of Asian-Pacific region manifesting the interactions between the convection on interannual and 10-25-day intraseasonal time scales. At the peak and trough stages of 10-25-day convection oscillation, a Gill-type low-level atmospheric circulation anomaly, cyclonic or anticyclonic, appears northwest of the convection anomaly. This relationship between the convection and circulation exists both in Warm case and in Cold case. However, at other stages rather than the peak and trough stages, there is no Gill-type circulation response, and the circulation anomaly shows a distinct feature between the Warm and Cold cases, although the convection oscillation exhibits a roughly similar feature.

84891665918	Large-scale circulation patterns favourable to tropical cyclogenesis over the western North Pacific and associated barotropic energy conversions	Using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy (NCEP-DOE) reanalysis and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) best track data for the period 1991-2010, this study classifies five large-scale circulation patterns in association with the tropical cyclone (TC) formation over the western North Pacific (WNP): the monsoon shear (MS), the monsoon confluence (MC), the reverse-oriented monsoon trough (RMT), the monsoon gyre (MG), and the trade wind easterlies (TE). The first three patterns account for about 80% of tropical cyclogeneses. Through a diagnosis of energetics, it is found that the tropical cyclogenesis in the MS, MC, and RMT patterns is highly associated with the barotropic energy conversion. Analysis shows that the horizontal shear of basic zonal flow provides a favourable condition for the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) growth in the MS pattern. When a TC forms in the MC pattern, the horizontal shear and convergence of basic zonal flow are both important for the EKE growth. When the basic flow is the RMT pattern, in addition to the horizontal shear of basic flow, zonal and meridional wind convergence play an important role for tropical cyclogenesis over the WNP and the South China Sea, respectively. However, the barotropic energy conversion appears not to be a main mechanism for the EKE growth in the MG and TE patterns. © 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.

84894297137	ENSO-phase dependent TD and MRG wave activity in the western North Pacific	The three-dimensional structure and evolution characteristics of tropical depression (TD) and mixed Rossby-gravity wave (MRG) type disturbances in the tropical western North Pacific during El Niño and La Niña summers are investigated based on observational and reanalysis data. A clear MRG-to-TD transition was observed during El Niño summers while such a transition is unclear during La Niña summers. The vertical structure of the TD-MRG waves appears equivalent barotropic during El Niño but becomes tilted eastward with height during La Niña. The diagnosis of barotropic energy conversion shows that both the rotational and divergent components of the background flow change associated with E1 Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are responsible for energy conversion from the mean flow to the TD-MRG perturbations. A further examination of the pure MRG mode shows that its intensity does not vary between El Niño and La Niña while its phase speed does. A faster (slower) westward propagation speed during La Niña (El Niña) is attributed to enhanced (reduced) mean easterlies in the western equatorial Pacific. The heating associated with the MRG wave appears more anti-symmetric during La Niña than during El Niño. In contrast to the MRG waves, the amplitude of the TD waves depends greatly on the ENSO phase. The enhanced (suppressed) TD disturbances during El Niño (La Niña) is attributed to greater (less) barotropic energy conversion associated with the background flow change. The vertical structure of the TD waves appears quasi-barotropic in the geopotential height field but baroclinic in the divergence field. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84899065813	Simulations of the present and late-twenty-first-century western north pacific tropical cyclone activity using a regional model	Ahigh-resolution regional atmospheric model is used to simulate present-day western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclone (TC) activity and to investigate the projected changes for the late twenty-first century. Compared to observations, the model can realistically simulate many basic features of the WNP TC activity climatology, such as the TC genesis location, track, and lifetime.Anumber of spatial and temporal features of observed TC interannual variability are captured, although observed variations in basinwide TC number are not. A relatively well-simulated feature is the contrast of years when the Asian summer monsoon trough extends eastward (retreats westward), more (fewer) TCs form within the southeastern quadrant of the WNP, and the corresponding TC activity is above (below) normal over most parts of the WNP east of 125°E. Future projections with the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) A1B scenario show a weak tendency for decreases in the number ofWNPTCs, and for increases in the more intense TCs; these simulated changes are significant at the 80% level. The present-day simulation of intensity is limited to storms of intensity less than about 55ms

84899899137	Regional differences in surface sensible and latent heat fluxes in China	This study documents the variability of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes in five regions of China (Northwest China, the Tibetan Plateau, Northeast China, North China, and Southeast China) using the ERA-40 reanalysis for the years 1960-2000. The surface sensible and latent heat flux variations are remarkably different in Northwest and Southeast China. The seasonal variation of the surface sensible heat fluxes is largest in Northwest China and smallest in Southeast China. In contrast, the seasonal variation in latent heat flux is largest in Southeast China and smallest in Northwest China. The interdecadal variation of surface sensible and surface latent heat fluxes strongly depends on both the region and season. The trends in surface sensible and latent heat fluxes in all four seasons are mainly caused by variations in both the land-air temperature difference and in the specific humidity. There is also a limited contribution of wind speed in some regions, depending on the season. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

84904321704	Sensitivity of ENSO variability to Pacific freshwater flux adjustment in the Community Earth System Model	The effects of freshwater flux (FWF) on modulating ENSO have been of great interest in recent years. Large FWF bias is evident in Coupled General Circulation Models (CGCMs), especially over the tropical Pacific where large precipitation bias exists due to the so-called "double ITCZ" problem. By applying an empirical correction to FWF over the tropical Pacific, the sensitivity of ENSO variability is investigated using the new version (version 1.0) of the NCAR's Community Earth System Model (CESM1.0), which tends to overestimate the interannual variability of ENSO accompanied by large FWF into the ocean. In response to a small adjustment of FWF, interannual variability in CESM1.0 is reduced significantly, with the amplitude of FWF being reduced due to the applied adjustment part whose sign is always opposite to that of the original FWF field. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the interannual variability of precipitation weakens as a response to the reduced interannual variability of SST. Process analysis indicates that the interannual variability of SST is damped through a reduced FWF-salt-density-mixing-SST feedback, and also through a reduced SST-wind-thermocline feedback. These results highlight the importance of FWF in modulating ENSO, and thus should be adequately taken into account to improve the simulation of FWF in order to reduce the bias of ENSO simulations by CESM. © 2014 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0346830774	Numerical Simulation of the Effect of the SST Anomalies in the Tropical Western Pacific on the Blocking Highs over the Northeastern Asia	The effects of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical western Pacific on the atmospheric circulation anomalies over East Asia are simulated by the IAP-GCM with an observed and idealized distributions of the SST anomalies in the tropical western Pacific, respectively. Firstly, the atmospheric circulation anomalies during July and August, 1980 are simulated by three anomalous experiments including the global SST anomaly experiment, the tropical SST anomaly experiment and the extratropical SST anomaly experiment, using the observed SST anomalies in 1980. It is shown that the SST anomalies in the tropical ocean greatly influence the formation and maintenance of the blocking high over the northeastern Asia, and may play a more important role than the SST anomalies in the extratropical ocean in the influence on the atmospheric circulation anomalies. Secondly, the effects of the SST anomalies in the tropical western Pacific on the atmospheric circulation anomalies over East Asia are also simulated with an idealized distribution of the SST anomalies in the tropical western Pacific. The simulated results show that the negative anomalies of SST in the tropical western Pacific have a significant effect on the formation and maintenance of the blocking high over the northeastern Asia.

0347305662	Sensitivity of Numerical Simulations of the East Asian Summer Monsoon Rainfall and Circulation to Different Cumulus Parameterization Schemes	A 5-level spectral AGCM (ImPKU-5LAGCM) is used to examine the sensitivity of the simulated results of the summer monsoon rainfall and circulation in East Asia to different cumulus parameterization schemes in the climatological-mean case and in the cases of weak and strong Asian summer monsoons, respectively. The results simulated with the Arakawa-Schubert's(hereafter A-S's), Kuo's and Manabe's cumulus parameterization schemes show that these simulated distributions of the summer monsoon rainfall and circulation in East Asia depend strongly on the cumulus parameterization schemes either in the climatological-mean case or in the cases of weak and strong Asian summer monsoons. From the simulated results, it might be shown that the Kuo scheme appears to be more suitable for the simulation of the summer monsoon rainfall and circulation in East Asia than the A-S scheme or the Manabe scheme, although the A-S scheme is somewhat better in the simulations of the tropical rainfall. This might be due to that the Kuo's cumulus parameterization scheme is able to reflect well the characteristics of rainfall cloud system in the East Asian summer monsoon region, where the rainfall system used to be a mixing of cumulus and stratus.

0347608320	Associations with the Interannual Variations of Onset and Withdrawal of the Changma	The associations of onset and withdrawal of the rainy season in South Korea (called Changma) have been examined. Composite studies showed that there are significant differences in circulations between extremely early and late onset (or withdrawals) not only over East Asia, but also over remote areas. The in situ significant differences include the upper-level jet over East Asia and the subtropical anticyclone over the western North Pacific at lower levels. The significant remote associations include the Indian monsoon and ENSO. The Indian summer monsoon is related to both onset and withdrawal of the Changma, while ENSO has a significant relation only to onset, but not to withdrawal.

11344278769	The influence of 30-60 d oscillation on the development of the South China Sea summer monsoon	Using the National Center for Enviromental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data and NOAA satellite-observed outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) data, the development of the South China Sea (SCS) summer monsoon and intraseasonal (30-60 d) oscillation (ISO) have been examined. The results show that there exists obvious interannual variability of intraseasonal oscillaiton. Using the 16 a time series of filtered OLR averaged over the SCS, an index is defined to define "onset events" over the SCS on the ISO time scales. Of the 16 a examined here, 10 shows a strong ISO signal in the onset of monsoon convection over the SCS. In these cases, the ISO initially suppresses the seasonal development of southwesterly and cyclonic circulation over the SCS before the ISO onset. As the ISO propagates northeastward, the low frequency cyclonic circulation anomaly occurs in the SCS and the low frequency southwesterly wind and convection over here dramatically intensify. The northeast progression of the ISO anomaleis plays a role in the initial suppression and then acceleration of the seasonal cycle of the SCS summer monsoon.

13244284906	Water vapor exchange between soil and atmosphere over a Gobi surface near an oasis in the summer	Using data observed at Dunhuang, in the Gansu, in the arid region of northwest China in the summer, the characteristics of the soil water content, temperature, and atmospheric humidity were analyzed. It was found that the depth of the active soil temperature layer is about 5 cm, which is much thinner than that of typical soils. In addition, not only is the atmospheric humidity gradient in the surface layer often inverted, but so too is the soil water content gradient in the shallow layer. The diurnal variation of soil water content can be divided into four stages, including wet, water loss, dry, and water gain. It is shown that in soil water content profiles the depth of the active soil layer is about 10 cm, and soil water content inversion is the primary feature in the shallow layer during the "wet" stage. The presence of soil water content inversion indicates that soil in the shallow layer can absorb water from the air through condensation in the nighttime and emit water vapor to the air through evaporation in the daytime. The formation of a soil water content inversion is mainly related to the state of the soil surface temperature. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.
