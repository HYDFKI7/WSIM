84940298421	2,6-Anthracenyl(anthraquinonyl)-substituted difluoroboron dipyrromethenes: Synthesis, spectroscopy, electrochemistry and quantum chemical calculations	A series of anthracenyl(anthraquinonyl)-substituted difluoroboron dipyrromethene dyes were synthesized through a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. The crystal structure combined with geometric optimization reveals a moderate dihedral angle between the anthracenyl(anthraquinonyl) plane and the connected pyrrolyl plane. Photophysical characterization shows that the introduction of anthracenyl(anthraquinonyl) moiety to the BODIPY core effectively tunes the emission properties of BODIPY while retaining the separate absorption properties of BODIPY and anthracene(anthraquinone). High fluorescent quantum yields of up to 0.70 and a large Stokes shift (ca. 1707 cm<sup>-1</sup>) were noted. Electrochemical characterization suggests that the anthracenyl(anthraquinonyl) linkage and BODIPY unit lead to rich and tunable potentials. TD-DFT calculation proved a moderate intramolecular charge-transfer process between the BODIPY core and anthracenyl(anthraquinonyl) moiety. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33749834058	Effect of gene transfer using nanoparticles as gene vector in different animal models	Objective: To evaluate the effect of antisense monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (A-MCP-1) nanoparticles (NPs) as gene carrier on gene transfer in two kinds of animal models. Methods: Poly (lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was used to make the NPs loaded with A-MCP-1 through a double-emulsion/solvent evaporation technique. NPs size was assessed by dynamic laser defractometer. The particle morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy. DNA content in the NPs was measured by dissolving known amounts of NPs in chloroform and extracting DNA with water. In vitro release was performed in tris-EDTA buffer at 37°C using double-chamber diffusion cells. The receiver buffer was replaced daily. The A-MCP-1 NPs was transfected into the cultured smooth muscle cells. PCR was used to evaluate the transfection of A-MCP-1. Cationic lipid (Lipofectamine) was used to transfect A-MCP-1 as control. After 48 hours incubation, cells were digested and examined by polymerase chain reaction. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits under jugular vein to artery bypass grafting procedure were divided into four groups: the first group received grafts treated with A-MCP-1 NPs, the second group received grafts treated with cationic liposome (dioleoyl trimethyl ammonium propane)-A-MCP-1, the third group received grafts treated with plasmid DNA, and the fourth group received grafts without transfection as control. Fourteen days after surgery the grafts were harvested. The expression of A-MCP-1 and its effect on MCP-1 in vein grafts were detected by dot blotting. The morphology of the grafts was investigated. To establish abdominal aortic aneurysms rats model, rats were randomly divided into three groups: A-MCP-1 NPs injection group, shame NPs injection group and control groups (without injection). Two weeks after surgery, diameter of abdominal aorta was measured and aortic tissue was obtained for PCR analysis to evaluate the A-MCP-1 expression. Western blot were applied to detect the inhibitory effect to the expression of MCP-1 mRNA and CD68 protein by A-MCP-1 NPs. Results: NPs size ranged 198nm to 205nm with average around 201.4 nm. DNA content in the NPs was 4.14 %. NPs showed steady release rate in vitro in Tris-EDTA solution. It released faster in the first week then maintained a slowly sustained release up to 16 days. In cell culture A-MCP-1 gene successfully transfected into smooth muscle cells by NPs vector. In vein grafting animal model, A-MCP-1 expression was detected in the vascular walls of NPs and cationic lipid treated groups. The degree of vascular hyperplasia in the gene NPs treated group was significantly lower than that in control group. There was no significant difference in the inhibition of intimal hyperplasia between NPs and cationic lipid treated groups. Two weeks after transfection in abdominal aortic aneurysm rats models, the abdominal aortic diameter of A-MCP-1 NPs injection group was (1.79 ± 0.12) mm, significantly smaller than that of control groups [shame NPs group was (2.58 ± 0.21) mm, and saline group was (2.63 ± 0.29) mm] (P < 0.01). The expressions of MCP-1 mRNA and CD68 protein in A-MCP-1 NPs injection group were 12.5 ± 1.5 and 17.6 ± 2.1, which were much lower than those in control group [in shame NPs group, which were 35.7 ± 4.5, 42.3 ± 5.7 (P < 0.01), and saline group which is 32.4 ± 3.9, 39.8 ± 4.8 (P< 0.01)]. Specific band of A-MCP-1 was detected only in the A-MCP-1 NPs injection group by PCR. Conclusion: A-MCP-1 gene NPs can be successfully used in rabbit vein grafting model and abdominal aortic aneurysm rats models, and may be potentially applied in clinical practice.

33947238770	Safety and efficiency of non-permanent inferior vena cava filters in preventing pulmonary embolism	Objective: To assess the effectiveness and safety of non-permanent filter in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) caused by deep venous thrombolism (DVT). Methods: The clinical data of 12 patients who were implanted with non-permanent filter for documented deep venous thrombolism in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from September 2003 to June 2006 were retrospectively analized. Results: Among these 12 patients, 10 were implanted with temporary filters, and 2 with retrievable filters. All the 12 operations were successful without major complications. In the 10 patients who received temporary filters, filters were smoothly removed after 4 weeks in 9 patients, while one patient was further treated with anticoagulation therapy for 12 weeks because large emboluses were entrapped by filter. In the 2 patients who received retrievable filters, filter were smoothly removed 2 weeks later in one patient; however, in another patient, the filter was left inside because large emboluses were entrapped by filter. In all the 12 patients, emboluses were entrapped in 6 filters (50%), in which the emboluses were larger than 2 cm in 2 patients, larger than 1 cm but less than 2 cm in 1 patient, and less than 1 cm in 3 patients. PE scanning was performed in 10 patients before primary implantation, and PE was found in 5 patients. PE scanning was performed in 8 patients 6 months after implantation, and minor PE was found in 4 patients, whose symptoms and affected pulmonary artery were obviously improved. All patients received regular follow-up (ranged from 3 months to 2 years), 1 patient died of malignant tumor 4 months after operation, 1 patient suffered inferior vena cava occlusion due to large embolus entrapped by the temporary filter, and 1 patient experienced the recurrence of symptomatic DVT. Symptoms were improved in all the 5 patients with PE. Conclusions: Non-permanent filter can safely and effectively protect patients from PE. More standardized criteria for placement and protocols to ensure timely removal should be developed and implemented.

34447323336	Prevalence and risk factors of peripheral arterial disease in diabetic patients over 50 years old in China	Objective: To investigate the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in China type 2 diabetic patients and to demonstrate the relationships between putative risk factors and PAD. Methods: In total 1 397 type 2 diabetic patients aged 50 years and older were enrolled and determined ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in 15 Class III Grade A hospitals in 7 major cities of China Results: Mean patient age was 63.7 ± 8.2 years and mean duration of diabetes mellitus was 9.39 ± 7.4 years. Two hundreds and seventy-two (19. 47%) patients were diagnosed as PAD by ABI <0.9, 122 (18.37%) in male and 150 (20.46%) in female. PAD patients had a significandy longer duration of diabetes mellitus, higher hemoglobin Alc, and a significantly lower mean body mass index than non-PAD ones. Aging, smoking, and systolic blood pressure were found to be positively related with the prevalence of PAD. In terms of lipid profiles, no variable was found to relate with PAD. Notably, baPWV showed as the same significant guiding index for PAD, almost matched with ABI. Conclusions: PAD is a common complication in China type 2 diabetic patients. Therefore, PAD screening and treatment should be emphasized for diabetic patients with high risk factors.

34848875686	Effect of plant species on shrub fertile island at an oasis-desert ecotone in the South Junggar Basin, China	Shrub fertile islands are a common feature in arid ecosystems. To examine the effect of plant species on the spatial patterns of soil chemical and physical properties surrounding individual shrubs, two deciduous shrub species with different morphologies (Tamarix spp. and Haloxylon ammodendron Bge.) were studied at an oasis-desert ecotone in South Junggar Basin. Soil samples were collected under the shrub crown (canopy), at the vertically projected limit of shrub crown margin (periphery), and in the space between shrub crowns (interspace) at two depths, 0-10 and 10-20 cm, to analyze their physical and chemical properties. The results show that the fertile islands of Tamarix spp. are enriched with more soil nutrients (significantly higher, P<0.05; soil organic matter (SOM); total nitrogen (TN) and available nitrogen (AN); to a deeper depth (>20 cm) and in a larger area (beyond the canopied area) compared to that of H. ammodendron (significantly higher, P<0.05, soil nutrients detected only for AN; <20 cm in depth; smaller than the canopied area). Soil texture patterns surrounding the shrubs of the two species are even more different, with more coarse particles under the Tamarix spp. canopies compared to the interspace between shrubs but fewer under the H. ammodendron canopies compared to the interspaces. These variations are attributed to the difference in morphology of the two studied species: the Y-shaped crowns of H. ammodendron are less capable of capturing and maintaining litter under them than the hemispheroidal crowns of Tamarix spp., which leads to the less well developed fertile islands surrounding H. ammodendron shrubs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

38749111849	Impaired angiogenesis following hind-limb ischemia in diabetes mellitus mice	Objective: To investigate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its signaling pathway spontaneous response in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice to surgery-induced hind-limb ischemia Methods: Sixty mice were randomly divided into two groups, one was fed with normal chow as control, and another was fed with high fat diet to induce T2DM. Fourteen weeks later, mice were surgically induced to hind-limb ischemia. Blood flow restoration was monitored with laser Doppler perfusion imaging. Tibialis anterior muscle was collected after 3 days of hind-limb ischemia. VEGF mRNA and protein expressions were analyzed using real-time PCR and ELISA; expressions of VEGF downstream signal molecules and receptors were analyzed using Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Results: Perfusion recovery 10, 20, 30 days after ischemia was significantly attenuated in T2DM compared with control group (P < 0.05). T2DM impaired VEGF signaling pathway although VEGF levels increased in T2DM group. After ischemia, T2DM group had a comparable increase in VEGF expression compared with control group, but still had an impaired VEGF signaling pathway. Conclusion: VEGF signaling pathway is abnormal in T2DM mice, although VEGF had a response to the ischemic stimulation.

38849120656	Mechanisms of impaired perfusion recovery in type 1 diabetic mouse	Objective: To investigate the perfusion restoration of type 1 diabetic mouse under the setting of surgically induced hind limb ischemia and the number and function of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Methods: Forty mice were randomly divided into two groups: one group was injected with alloxan through tail vein to induce type 1 diabetes mellitus, and another group was set as control group. All mice were surgically induced to hind limb ischemia. Blood flow was monitored with Laser Doppler perfusion imaging for 4 weeks after artery ligation. Ten mice in each group were sacrificed and muscle tissues were harvested for histological detection. The remaining mice were sacrificed 7 days after surgery, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were harvested and EPCs were analyzed by flow cytometry and then were collected to culture for functional detection. Results: All mice received alloxan injection showed typical symptoms of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Restoration of blood flow was significantly slower in type 1 diabetic mice with lower level of vascular density in ischemic muscles than control group (P < 0.001, P < 0.05). The number and function of EPCs (CD34 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 double positive cells) in type 1 diabetic mice were significantly lower than that in control mice (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The spontaneous angiogenesis is attenuated with a decreased number and function of EPCs in the setting of type 1 diabetes mellitus. This may partly explain why diabetic patients with peripheral artery diseases have more aggressive disease and poorer outcome.

84861720348	Rho Kinase inhibitors: Potential treatments for diabetes and diabetic complications	The small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector, Rho kinase (ROCK), appear to mediate numerous pathophysiological signals, including smooth muscle cell contraction, actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion and motility, proliferation, differentiation and the expression of several genes. Clinical interest in the RhoA/ROCK pathway has increased, due to emerging evidence that this signaling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including hypertension, coronary vasospasm, stroke, atherosclerosis, heart failure and diabetes; ROCK is considered an important future therapeutic target. Several pharmaceutical companies are already actively engaged in the development of ROCK inhibitors as the next generation of therapeutic agents for these diseases. This review discusses the relationship between diabetes and hyperglycemia-induced RhoA/ROCK activation, highlights recent findings on the roles of ROCK inhibitors from experimental models of diabetes and clinical studies in cardiovascular patients, and elucidates major challenges for developing more selective ROCK inhibitors. Accumulating evidence suggests the potential of ROCK inhibitors as therapeutic agents for diabetes and its complications. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

84867035484	Thermoresponsive graphene oxide-PNIPAM nanocomposites with controllable grafting polymer chains via moderate in situ SET-LRP	In this study, we report a mild and efficient strategy for growing thermosensitive polymers directly from the surface of exfoliated graphene oxide (GO). Exfoliated GO sheets were sequentially subject to the epoxide ring-opening reaction with tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) to increase the amount of reactive sites, the esterification with 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide to introduce the Br-containing initiating groups, and the surface-initiated single electron transfer-living radical polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) to tune the molecular weights of grafted polymers. All these reactions were performed at ambient temperature without losing any other oxygen-containing functionality on GO. The resulting TRIS-GO-PNIPAM nanocomposites still maintain the separated single layers in dispersion, and the dispersibilities in organic solvents are significantly improved. Meanwhile, the aqueous dispersion of TRIS-GO-PNIPAM shows reversible temperature switching self-assembly and disassembly behavior at about 40°C. Such smart graphene-based hybrid materials are promising for applications in nanoelectronics, sensors, and microfluidic switches. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84877331064	Functionalized graphene oxide as a nanocarrier for loading and delivering of oridonin	Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by modified Hummers method firstly. In order to improve its water solubility and biocompatibility, 6-armed PEG was grafted onto GO via an amidation process. The size of GO-PEG was less than 250 nm and stability test indicated excellent dispersibility of GO-PEG in water and PBS buffer. Furthermore, oridonin, a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug, is adsorbed onto GO-PEG via blending. The drug loading ratio was determined to be as high as 105%, which was much higher than other common drug carriers. A549 lung cancer cell and MCF-7 breast cancer cell were chosen to study the cytotoxicity of GO-PEG/oridonin, GO-PEG, and free oridonin. The results demonstrated that GO-PEG did not show obvious toxicity (relative cell viability≥85%), even cultivated for 48 h at a relatively high concentration of 100 mg/L. Compared to oridonin, the GO-PEG/oridonin nanocarrier shows higher cytotoxicity in A549 and MCF-7 cells. © 2013 Chinese Chemical Society and SIOC, CAS.

In the present work, 6-armed poly(ethylene glycol) was covalently introduced into the surface of GO sheets via a facile amidation process under mild conditions, making the modified GO, GO-PEG (PEG: 65 wt %, size: 50-200 nm), stable and biocompatible in physiological solution. This nanosized GO-PEG was found to be nontoxic to human lung cancer A549 and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells via cell viability assay. Furthermore, paclitaxel (PTX), a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug, was conjugated onto GO-PEG via Ï-Ï stacking and hydrophobic interactions to afford a nanocomplex of GO-PEG/PTX with a relatively high loading capacity for PTX (11.2 wt %). This complex could quickly enter into A549 and MCF-7 cells evidenced by inverted fluorescence microscopy using Fluorescein isothiocyanate as a probe, and it also showed remarkably high cytotoxicity to A549 and MCF-7 cells in a broad range of concentration of PTX and time compared to free PTX. This kind of nanoscale drug delivery system on the basis of PEGylated GO may find potential application in biomedicine.

52749098009	Use of an amorphous diamond film as dental material	The biocompatibility and surface characteristics of dental materials surface-modified by an amorphous diamond film were investigated. The dental materials are poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and pure titanium and the amorphous diamond film surface was produced by a plasma assisted cathode arc discharge under vacuum. The biocompatibility was evaluated by cell cultivation and animal implants and the wearability of the PMMA tooth after modification was analyzed by a scratching test. The surface characteristics of the film were characterized by SEM. The corrosion resistance of the surface of pure titanium dental material after the surface modification was investigated by the electrochemical analysis of a simulated oral cavity filled with artificial saliva. Results show that the toxicity of the amorphous diamond film modified dental materials is zero, and the hemolysis ratio is 3.08%. After polarization pre-treatment, the PMMA artificial tooth coated with an amorphous diamond film has a maximium adhesion force of 10.86±0.79N. The self-corrosive potential and the over-passivation potential of the pure titanium after the surface modification were increased. These results demonstrate that coating the surface of dental materials with a diamond film meets the requirements of biocompatibility, anticorrosion and adhesion strength.

PNIPAM-b-PEA backbone was first prepared by sequential SET-LRP of N-isopropylacrylamide and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate at 25 °C using CuCl/tris(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl) amine as catalytic system followed by the transformation into the macroinitiator by treating the pendant hydroxyls with 2-chloropropionyl chloride. The final graft copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions were synthesized by ATRP of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate initiated by the macroinitiator at 40 °C using CuCl/tris(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)- amine as catalytic system via the grafting-from strategy. These copolymers were employed to prepare stable colloidal gold nanoparticles with controlled size in aqueous solution without any external reducing agent.

67749135582	Dipole-promoted and size-dependent cooperativity between pyridyl-containing triazolophanes and halides leads to persistent sandwich complexes with iodide	Triazolophanes that incorporate pyridyl subunits in place of phenylenes show a heightened propensity to form 2:1 sandwich complexes with halides. Persistent iodide-based sandwiches are observed. Binding constants confirm that the inward-facing electron pairs on the pyridyls destabilize the 1:1 complexes with halides. The 1H NMR spectra verify that the sandwich complexes have two %-stacked triazolophanes rotated to allow registration between opposite dipoles on the pyridyls (directed inward) and triazoles (directed outward). These dipolar interactions cooperate to lower the pyridyl-based repulsions, therefore, increasing K2. Modest cooperative effects are observed for the snugly fitting F-, Cl-, and Br- halides while the toolarge I- shows highly positive cooperativity. Copyright © 2008 American Chemical Society.

68149182735	Myoglobin over-expression attenuates angiogenic response in hindlimb ischemia in mice	Background: Myoglobin is expressed exclusively in striated skeletal muscles and has been implicated in nitric oxide scavenging. Accumulating data suggest a critical role for nitric oxide in both the endogenous and therapeutic angiogenic response to ischemia. A clear role for myoglobin in ischemic skeletal muscle is uncertain. We hypothesized that myoglobin overexpression has an adverse impact on the angiogenic response to ischemia. Methods: Muscle-specific myoglobin over-expressing transgenic mice (MbTG, n=11), wild type littermates (WT, n=23) underwent unilateral femoral artery ligation and excision. Laser doppler perfusion imaging was used to monitor changes in hindlimb perfusion before surgery and weekly after surgery up to 28 days. Tissue ischemia was assessed by a necrosis incidence. Upon termination of the experiment (28 days after surgery), skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior) were harvested, the distal part of the muscle was frozen and embedded for histology study, the proximal part was used either to detect vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or to determine the proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)) and apoptosis (Bax, and Bcl-2) condition in ischemic muscle by Western blotting. Capillaries were stained with endothelial phosphate alkaline staining and vascular density was expressed in capillaries/fiber. Results: The recovery of perfusion in MbTG mice was similar to that of WT mice on day 7 (0.485±0.095 vs 0.500±0.084) but was significantly less on day 14 (0.536±0.086 vs 0.623±0.077, P <0.05), day 21 (0.588±0.082 vs 0.684±0.068, P <0.01) and day 28 (0.606±0.079 vs 0.733±0.093, P <0.01). The necrosis incidence was higher in MbTG than in WT (54.5% vs 21.6%). Vascular density was less in MbTG compared with that in WT (gastrocnemius 0.19±0.08 vs 0.30±0.08, P <0.05; tibialis anterior 0.22±0.11 vs 0.33±0.04, P <0.05). With ischemic injury, the VEGF level was increased in both MbTG and WT (45.2% and 20.4%, respectively). Western blotting showed that after hindlimb ischemia the proliferation was similar in both MbTG and WT, however, apoptosis was increased in MbTG relative to WT, shown as more expression of Bax and less expression of Bcl-2. Conclusion: An increase in expression of myoglobin protein in skeletal muscle reduces the endogenous perfusion recovery following surgically induced hind-limb ischemia.

70149102916	Impact of resveratrol on the expression of apoptosis related gene survivin and bax in human cancer cells	Objective: We explored the mechanism of apoptosis in human esophageal cancer Eca109 cells by resveratrol. Methods: The suppressive ratio of resveratrol on Eca109 cells proliferation was evaluated by MTT colorimetric assay and morphology was observed by transmission electron microscope. The expression of survivin and bax was analyzed by RT-PCR and Flow Cytometry (FCM). Results: Resveratrol inhibited the growth of Eca109 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and the suppressive ratio arrived at 76.42%. Morphological apoptosis could be observed after treated with resveratrol. The bulk of some drug-treated cells turned small and the nuclear chromatin became condensed and marginated. The results determined by RT-PCR and FCM showed that resveratrol could down-regulate surviving, while up-regulate bax. Conclusion: Resveratrol could induce the apoptosis of human esophageal cancer Eca109 cells, and its possible molecular mechanisms might be related to modulation the expression of survivin and bax. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.

69349090315	Electrochromism based on the charge transfer process in a ferrocene-BODIPY molecule	A new type of donor-acceptor molecule DiFc-B combined ferrocene and BODIPY unit has been synthesized, and the NMR spectra, photophysical property, and electrochemical property were studied. The in situ spectro-electrochemical experiment was carried out, a notable absorption change had been observed under oxidative potential, and a recovery could happen under reductive potential and this process could repeat for several times. Such a phenomenon also happened when oxidative metal ion was added into the solution of DiFc-B. In order to study the mechanism of the electrochromism, the theoretical calculation was performed, and the result shows a D (ferrocene)-π-A (BODIPY) system. The energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO had a good consistence with the electrochemical experiment and UV-vis data. The calculation of the frontier orbital belonging to the cation state of DiFc-B shows the directional change of the D-π-A system, which supplied a theoretical basis of the electrochromism.

70349311103	Intravenous leiomyomatosis with inferior vena cava and heart extension	Background: Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) is a rare tumor that is histologically benign but biologically malignant. Less than 200 cases of IVL have been reported, most of them were individual reports. Methods: Six patients with IVL involving the inferior vena cava were analyzed. Results: Three patients received one-stage operations and two received two-stage operations. All operations were successful. No perioperative death or other complications were observed. Primary tumors and intravenous tumorous emboli were completely resected from four patients. Residual tumor remained in one patient who had serious adhesions due to multiple previous surgeries; however, with antiestrogen therapy, the residual tumor significantly regressed. All patients had tumor relapse after the operation. Conclusions: IVL should be given more attention by vascular surgeons, although it is extremely rare. Many therapeutic methods are available for uterine leiomyomatosis involving inferior vena cava, among which operation is the best choice. © 2009 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Methods: Clinical information of 9 cases suffering from lower extremity arterial occlusion and CD was investigated retrospectively. Results: All the cases were less than 50 years old and the most were females (8/9). Arterial occlusions occurred in either active (5/9) or inactive (4/9) stage of CD. Besides the arteries of lower extremities, other arteries could also be involved such as aorta, iliac artery, renal artery or mesentery artery. Seven cases had atherosclerotic imaging findings (4 had aortic plaques and 6 had iliac artery stenoses). Embolectomy or thromboendarterectomy were mostly performed. Four (44.4%) cases had recurrent lower limb ischemia. Conclusions: Arterial occlusive disease is a rare extraintestinal manifestation of CD. A thorough inspection of aorta is necessary. Embolectomy is mostly preferred. Anticoagulation treatment is highly recommended after the operation.

70350292585	Reinstate the damaged VEGF signaling pathway with VEGF-activating transcription factor	Objective: To investigate the role of vascular endothelial growth factor-activating transcriptional factor (VEGF-ATF) on the VEGF signaling pathway in diabetes mellitus. Methods: Totally, 20 C57BL/6 mice fed with high fat diet was induced into diabetes mellitus. Ten diabetes mellitus mice received a lower limb muscle injection with VEGF-ATF plasmid, and another ten were as control. VEGF-ATF is an engineered transcription factor designed to increase VEGF expression. Three days later, mice were sacrificed and the injected gastrocnemius was used for analysis. VEGF mRNA and protein expressions were examined by real-time PCR and ELISA respectively. VEGF receptor 2 mRNA expression was tested with RT-PCR. Phosphorylated Akt, Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and phosphorylated eNOS were assessed by western blot. Results: At 3 days post-injection, in mice with diabetes mellitus, VEGF gene transfer increased VEGF mRNA copies and VEGF protein expression in injected muscles compared with control; and reinstated the impaired VEGF signaling pathway with increasing the ratios of phosphorylated Akt/Akt and phosphorylated eNOS/eNOS. However, it did not affect the expression of VEGF receptor 2 mRNA. Conclusion: Gene transfer with VEGF-ATF is able to reinstate the impaired VEGF downstream pathway, and potentially promote therapeutic angiogenesis in mice with diabetes mellitus.

73949132075	Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilized and activated by neurotrophic factors may contribute to pathologic neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy	Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by pathological retinal neovascularization. Accumulating evidence has indicated that high levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are an important risk factor for neovascularization. Paradoxically, the reduction and dysfunction of circulating EPCs has been extensively reported in diabetic patients. We hypothesized that EPCs are differentially altered in the various vasculopathic complications of diabetes mellitus, exhibiting distinct behaviors in terms of angiogenic response to ischemia and growth factors and potentially playing a potent role in motivating vascular precursors to induce pathological neovascularization. Circulating levels of EPCs from diabetic retinopathy patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and by counting EPC colony-forming units, and serum levels of neurotrophic factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found increased levels of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the blood of diabetic retinopathy patients; this increase was correlated with the levels of circulating EPCs. In addition, we demonstrated that retinal cells released neurotrophic factors under hypoxic conditions to enhance EPC activity in vitro and to increase angiogenesis in a mouse ischemic hindlimb model. These results suggest that neurotrophic factors may induce neoangiogenesis through EPC activation, leading to the pathological retinal neovascularization. Thus, we propose that neovascularization in the ischemic retina might be regulated by overexpression of neurotrophic factors. Copyright © American Society for Investigative Pathology.

In this aper, a fluorene-bridged intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) compound (bis(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-fluoren-9-ylidene)malononitrile (DMPFM) has been synthesized and fabricated into 1-D microrods and 3-D microflowers in dioxane and THF, respectively. A stepwise growth method has been developed for constructing crystal micro/nanohierarchical superarchitectures by using the single-crystal 1-D microrods as precursor crystal seeds. The morphological controllability in both growth stages offers opportunities of rational tuning of the size, shapes, and dimensions of hierarchical self-assembled products. This stepwise growing method of hierarchical architectures and the exhibited semiconducting character of the material endows the superstructures with potential applications in the field of electronic devices. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

These molecules are designed with a preorganized cavity that interacts through hydrogen bonding with spherical anions, such as chloride and bromide. We have explored the use of one such triazolophane as a halide-selective ionophore in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane electrodes. Different membrane compositions were evaluated to identify concentrations of the ionophore, plasticizer, and lipophilic additive that give rise to the best chloride and bromide selectivity. The lipophilicity of the plasticizer was found to have a great impact on the electrode response. Additionally, the concentration of the lipophilic additive was found to be critical for optimal response. The utility of a triazolophane-based electrode was demonstrated by quantification of bromide in horse serum samples. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

A microprocessor inside the defibrillation automatically analyzes the patient's heart rhythm and advises the operator whether a shock is needed. Audible and visual prompts will guide the user through the process. AED would advise a shock only to ventricular fibrillation. In this paper, we will present a framework of AED system. There are two crucial components should be elaborately designed, the hardware system and the algorithm of detecting ventricular fibrillation. In this paper, we will present the design of hardware system and a new algorithm which could discriminate ventricular fibrillation (VF) from other unshockable rhythm through the measurement of Sample Entropy (SampEn). We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction, accuracy of the new algorithm with several earlier VF detection algorithms.

77957860273	An active disturbance rejection control technique for the turntable system with motor moment fluctuation	Motor moment fluctuation is one of the major factors that can deteriorate the low-velocity stability of a turntable system, so as to decrease the control accuracy of the turntable motion. The turntable system is controlled by a current loop and a velocity loop, so we propose a new method to use the PI control strategy in the current loop and the active disturbance rejection controller in the velocity loop to restrain the motor moment fluctuation. This active disturbance rejection controller is composed of a tracking differentiator, an extended state observer, a nonlinear state error feedback controller, and etc. The parameters of the controller are optimally designed, and the simulation results show that this control strategy can effectively restrain the turntable fluctuation from the motor moment fluctuation and better improve the system's low velocity performance than the typical PID control strategy. © 2010 IEEE.

FcEB exhibits a molecular rotor property with a significant enhancement of quantum yield in viscous solvent. The result shows that the emission of FcEB increased dramatically as the viscosity of solution increased and also confirms that the structure-optical properties can be tuned by the structure design of molecule and introduction of different functional group.

78650474226	Aggregate nanostructures of organic molecular materials	Conjugated organic molecules are interesting materials because of their structures and their electronic, electrical, magnetic, optical, biological, and chemical properties. However, researchers continue to face great challenges in the construction of well-defined organic compounds that aggregate into larger molecular materials such as nanowires, tubes, rods, particles, walls, films, and other structural arrays. Such nanoscale materials could serve as direct device components. In this Account, we describe our recent progress in the construction of nanostructures formed through the aggregation of organic conjugated molecules and in the investigation of the optical, electrical, and electronic properties that depend on the size or morphology of these nanostructures. We have designed and synthesized functional conjugated organic molecules with structural features that favor assembly into aggregate nanostructures via weak intermolecular interactions. These large-area ordered molecular aggregate nanostructures are based on a variety of simpler structures such as fullerenes, perylenes, anthracenes, porphyrins, polydiacetylenes, and their derivatives. We have developed new methods to construct these larger structures including organic vapor-solid phase reaction, natural growth, association via self-polymerization and self-organization, and a combination of self-assembly and electrochemical growth. These methods are both facile and reliable, allowing us to produce ordered and aligned aggregate nanostructures, such as large-area arrays of nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes. In addition, we can synthesize nanoscale materials with controlled properties. Large-area ordered aggregate nanostructures exhibit interesting electrical, optical, and optoelectronic properties. We also describe the preparation of large-area aggregate nanostructures of charge transfer (CT) complexes using an organic solid-phase reaction technique. By this process, we can finely control the morphologies and sizes of the organic nanostructures on wires, tubes, and rods. Through field emission studies, we demonstrate that the films made from arrays of CT complexes are a new kind of cathode materials, and we systematically investigate the effects of size and morphology on electrical properties. Low-dimension organic/inorganic hybrid nanostructures can be used to produce new classes of organic/inorganic solid materials with properties that are not observed in either the individual nanosize components or the larger bulk materials. We developed the combined self-assembly and templating technique to construct various nanostructured arrays of organic and inorganic semiconductors. The combination of hybrid aggregate nanostructures displays distinct optical and electrical properties compared with their individual components. Such hybrid structures show promise for applications in electronics, optics, photovoltaic cells, and biology. In this Account, we aim to provide an intuition for understanding the structure-function relationships in organic molecular materials. Such principles could lead to new design concepts for the development of new nonhazardous, high-performance molecular materials on aggregate nanostructures. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

A rotaxane containing a disulfide linkage in the macrocycle was also synthesized by the thiol-ene click reaction. It has been demonstrated that the formation of the [2]rotaxane with the disulfide bond in the macrocycle occurs by a mechanism that is different to the threading-followed-by-stoppering process. The successful construction of a rotaxane directly from its constituent components, the macrocycle containing a disulfide linkage and the dibenzylammonium hexafluorophosphate salt, suggests that the space within the macrocycle incorporating the disulfide linkage is smaller than the phenyl unit and a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed as follows: A small amount of the initiator forms two radicals upon the absorption of UV irradiation; the radicals act as a "key" to "unlock" the disulfide bond in the macrocycle. The resulting crown ether like moiety in the macrocycle is clipped around the ammonium ion center in the dumb-bell-shaped compound. The [2]rotaxane is generated upon recombination of the disulfide linkage. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

A radical scavenger species, 2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), was firstly anchored onto -COOH groups on graphene oxide (GO) to afford TEMPO-functionalized graphene sheets (GS-TEMPO), meanwhile, the GO sheets were thermally reduced. Next, GS-TEMPO reacted with Br-terminated well-defined poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) homopolymer, which was presynthesized by SET-LRP, in the presence of CuBr/N,N,N′, N′,Na″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine to form PNIPAM-graphene sheets (GS-PNIPAM) nanocomposite in which the polymers were covalently linked onto the graphene via the alkoxyamine conjunction points. The PNIPAM-modified graphene sheets are easily dispersible in organic solvents and water, and a temperature-induced phase transition was founded in the water suspension of GS-PNIPAM. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79955521072	Angiotensin II upregulation of cardiomyocyte adiponectin production is nitric oxide/cyclic GMP dependent	Adiponectin is a circulating cytokine that is now known to be synthesized by cardiomyocytes. Accumulating evidence has shown that adiponectin production is upregulated in patients with heart failure, with activation of the renin-angiotensin system and increased formation of angiotensin (Ang) II playing a critical role in left ventricular remodeling and heart failure. To determine whether Ang II upregulates adiponectin in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, the authors need to explore the underlying mechanisms that could be involved. Methods: To test this hypothesis, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were treated with various concentrations of Ang II, and adiponectin expression was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western immunoblotting. Results: Adiponectin mRNA expression was significantly increased by Ang II at concentrations from 10

79955707557	Long-term diabetic complications may be ameliorated by targeting Rho kinase	This review addresses the roles of Rho/Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. Diabetes can cause many serious complications and can result in physical disability or even increased mortality. However, there are not many effective ways to treat these complications. The small guanosine-5'-triphosphate-binding protein Rho and its downstream target Rho-kinase mediate important cellular functions, such as cell morphology, motility, secretion, proliferation, and gene expression. Recently, the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway has attracted a great deal of attention in diabetes-related research. These studies have provided evidence that the activity and gene expression of Rho-kinase are upregulated in some tissues in animal models of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and in cell lines cultured with high concentrations of glucose. Inhibitors of Rho-kinase could prevent or ameliorate the pathological changes in diabetic complications. The inhibitory effects of statins on the Rho/Rho-kinase signalling pathway may also play a role in the prevention of diabetic complications. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which the Rho/Roh-kinase pathway participates in the development or progression of diabetic complications has not been extensively investigated. This article evaluates the relationship between Rho/Roh-kinase tivation and diabetic complications, as well as the roles of Roh-kinase inhibitors and statins in the complications of diabetes, with the objective of providing a novel target for the treatment of long-term diabetic complications.

To apply fractionated-clamping for repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA), and evaluate its effects in decreasing surgical mortality and severe complications, such as renal failure and paraplegia, a modified crawford procedure were prospectively evaluated. Methods. Using modified shunting and cross-clamping techniques, modified Crawford repair in 13 thoracoabdominal aorta patients were performed in the Vascular Division at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. TAA Crawford classification: 1 type I, 2 type II, 2 type III and 3 type IV TAA. Debakey classification: 1 type I, 4 type III (including 2 ruptured aneurysms), and 1 aortic coarctation. Results. Thirteen procedures were performed successfully. One died of ventricular fibrillation just before completing the operation. Surgical mortality rate was 7.7% (1/13). Postoperative complications included 1 acute necrotic pancreatitis, 1 ARDS, 1 paraplegia, 1 acute renal failure, and 2 thoracic cavity bleeding. Total complication rate was 53.8% (7/13). Conclusions. Fractionated-clamping in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair is our modified Crawford procedure and aortic bypass. Clinical results demonstrate that our procedure decreased surgical mortality and major complication rate, and also alleviated viscera ischemic injury. Fractionated-clamping in aorta replacement is a practical procedure for TAA repair under general anesthesia at normal temperature.

79956331656	Fasudil hydrochloride hydrate, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, suppresses high glucose-induced proliferation and collagen synthesis in rat cardiac fibroblasts	Hyperglycaemia promotes the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and collagen synthesis in CFs. The objectives of the present study were to determine the effects of fasudil hydrochloride hydrate, a Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, on high glucose (HG)-induced proliferation of CFs and collagen production in rat CFs and to investigate the molecular mechanism of action of fasudil. Rat CFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5.5 or 25mmol/L d-glucose or 5.5mmol/L d-glucose+19.5mmol/L mannose, in the presence of absence of fasudil (50 or 100μmol/L). Proliferation was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, whereas the production of Type I collagen was evaluated using ELISA and the expression of ROCK1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Type I procollagen mRNA was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Intracellular Type I procollagen protein levels were evaluated using immunocytochemistry. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), JNK and Smad2/3, as well as c-jun protein levels. Both concentrations of fasudil effectively inhibited HG (25mmol/L d-glucose)-induced increases in the proliferation of CFs and collagen synthesis, concomitant with suppression of HG-induced upregulation of ROCK1 and JNK mRNA expression and c-jun protein levels, as well as the phosphorylation of MYPT1, JNK and Smad2/3. These data suggest that ROCK activation is essential for the proliferation of CFs and collagen synthesis induced by HG. Fasudil suppressed HG-induced increases in the proliferation of CFs and collagen synthesis, which may be associated with inhibition of the JNK and transforming growth factor β/Smad pathways. The results of the present study indicate that inhibition of ROCK may be a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of diabetic cardiac fibrosis. © 2011 The Authors.

79957556768	Diagnosis of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome with multidetector row spiral computed tomography	Objective: To evaluate the role of multidetector row spiral computed tomography in the diagnosis of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). Method: Ten patients (13 limbs) were diagnosed as PAES through open surgery in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2006 to December 2009, among whom three (30. 0%) had both limbs involved. Results: Eleven limbs (84.6%) had occlusions in popliteal artery at admission. While only 15.4% of the patients were diagnosed as PAES by positional stress test, Doppler ultrasound, and arterial angiography, the disease was confirmed in all 10 patients by spiral computed tomography. As shown by inter-operative exploration, the PAES types included type I (n = 2, 15.4%), II (n = 5, 38.5%), III (n = 4, 30.8%), and V (n = 2, 15.4%). Two limbs underwent popliteal artery release only, 8 limbs underwent politeal artery release, thromboendarterectomy, and angioplasty with a venous or prosthetic patch, and 3 patients underwent catheter-based thrombolysis and popliteal artery release subsequently. During the follow-up (mean: 22 months; range: 4-33 months), the primary patency rate was 92.3% (12/13), the total patency rate was 100% (13/13), and the limb salvage rate was 100%. Conclusion: Positional stress test, Doppler ultrasound, and arterial angiography play limited roles in the diagnosis of PAES with popliteal artery occlusion, while multidetector row spiral computed tomography is much helpful in diagnosing and typing PAES.

79961200827	From atomic to molecular anions: A neutral receptor captures cyanide using strong C-H hydrogen bonds	The multifaceted character of cyanide as an acceptor of hydrogen bonds from a receptor has been examined for the first time using electronic-structure theory and spectroscopic measurements (UV/Vis and NMR titrations). Motivated by the similar size and charge of the cyanide pseudohalide and the monoatomic chloride ion, strong interactions of cyanide with a rigid macrocyclic triazolophane receptor have been predicted by theory and confirmed by experimental findings. It was found that both anions bind with similar strength in the gas phase (computed) and in the solution phase (experimental) via C-H hydrogen bonds. Theoretical calculations predict that the heterodiatomic cyanide prefers to bind in the plane of the macrocycle along the north-south axis. Examination of the possible binding modes reveal low computed barriers for in-plane rotation. The predicted model is consistent with the experimental data. Overall, the binding of a molecular anion within the cavity of a triazolophane receptor has been characterized where the computed and experimental binding energies are consistent with the classification of cyanide as a pseudohalide in the context of supramolecular chemistry. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

RAFT homopolymerization of p-(2-(p-tolyloxy)perfluorocyclobutoxy)phenyl methacrylate was first initiated by 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile using cumyl dithiobenzoate as chain transfer agent, and the results show that the procedure was conducted in a controlled way as confirmed by the fact that the number-average molecular weights increased linearly with the conversions of the monomer while the polydispersity indices kept below 1.30.

The supramolecular self-assembly property of the copolymers was investigated in the methanol atmosphere. By changing the assembly condition, well-defined vesicles and porous films were produced, respectively. Pores with different size dispersions were obtained by tuning the methanol atmosphere. Moreover, porous films were also decorated on diverse substrates with nonplanar structures. The investigation on self-assembly properties of this rod-coil copolymer is the complementarity to the self-assembly of rod-coil copolymers. This is a very useful self-assembly method that can be used to prepare the self-assembly nanostructures with donor-acceptor alternating copolymers. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

In this functional supermolecular system, the combined hydrogen-bond and π-donor/π-acceptor interactions led production of the [2]catenanes which exhibit reversible moving of the crown ether macrocycle on the big ring between two stations via de/reprotonation. This movement on the big ring can change the electron interaction, resulting in strong quenching of the emission of naphthalene diimide. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

Strong interactions between the organic and inorganic units can lead to novel or improved physical or chemical performance relative to that of the individual components, thereby realizing synergistic ("1 + 1 > 2") performance. In this tutorial review, we discuss the synthetic methods available for preparing heterostructures incorporating diverse components; the functionality of the heterostructure materials; and their potential applications in the fields of electronics, optics, biology, and catalysis. The future development of such heterostructure materials will require deeper understanding of organic-inorganic or organic-organic interfaces on the nanoscale, collective phenomena, and interparticle coupling. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

80054044689	Functionalization of graphene oxide towards thermo-sensitive nanocomposites via moderate in situ SET-LRP	A mild and efficient strategy is presented for growing thermo-sensitive polymers directly from the surface of exfoliated graphene oxide (GO). This method involves the covalent attachment of Br-containing initiating groups onto the surface of GO sheets followed by in situ growing poly[poly(ethylene glycol) ethyl ether methacrylate] (PPEGEEMA) via single-electron-transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP). Considering the lack of reactive functional groups on the surface of GO, exfoliated GO sheets were subjected to an epoxide ring opening reaction with tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) at room temperature.

84857648398	Angiotensin II type-1 receptor-JAK/STAT pathway mediates the induction of visfatin in angiotensin ii-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy	Introduction: The new adipocytokine visfatin is closely associated with the cardiovascular diseases, and expression of visfatin is elevated in the heart failure patients. However, at the cellular level, little work has been done on visfatin expression in the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Here, the authors investigated the expression and mechanisms of visfatin in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro by means of the cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Methods: After primary culture of 2- to 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with Ang II. Ang II type-1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonist telmisartan and Ang II type-2 receptor antagonist PD123319 were used to block effects of Ang II. These inhibitors used for the AT1-R pathway determination included SP600125, AG490 and U0126. Cell viability was examined using the 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The expression of visfatin was examined by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The expression of brain natriuretic peptide was examined through western-blot analysis. Results: Visfatin was found expressed in cardiomyocytes as well as cardiac fibroblasts, and there was no significant difference at the mRNA and protein levels of visfatin. Ang II treatment induced the increased expression of visfatin and brain natriuretic peptide in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cardiomyocytes, and pretreatment with AT1-R antagonist telmisartan completely blocked Ang II-induced visfatin expression increasement. The increased visfatin expression was also blocked by the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway inhibitor AG490. CONCLUSION: Visfatin expression was increased mainly through the AT1-R-JAK/STAT pathway in the process of Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84859317888	The interactions of spore-coat morphogenetic proteins studied by single-molecule recognition force spectroscopy	Bacillus subtilis can form a spore, which is a dormant type of cell, when its external environment becomes unsuitable for vegetative growth. The spore is surrounded by a multilayered proteinaceous shell called a spore coat, which plays a crucial role in dormancy and germination. Of the over 70 proteins that form the spore coat, only a small subset of them affect its morphogenesis; they are referred to as morphogenetic proteins. How these morphogenetic proteins interact, and furthermore, how they build the ordered, functional coat layers is not well understood. Elucidating the self-assembly mechanism of individual proteins into such a complex structure may contribute to its potential use in nano-biotechnology applications for preparing highly organized, robust, and resistant proteinaceous layers. Herein, direct, noncovalent, low-affinity interactions between the spore-coat morphogenetic proteins SpoIVA, SpoVID, and SafA were studied by using single-molecule recognition force spectroscopy in vitro for the first time. Based on the real-time examination of interactions between these three proteins, a series of dynamic kinetic data were obtained. It was also observed that the SafA-SpoVID interaction was stronger than that of SafA-SpoIVA. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH&Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84862942449	Pulse-spray catheter directed thrombolysis in patients with recent onset or deterioration of lower extremity ischemia	Background The recent onset or deterioration of lower extremity ischemia is highly associated with intravascular thrombus. Treatment of these thrombotic occlusions is challenging. Pulse-spray catheter directed thrombolysis (PS-CDT) refers to the technique of intermittent forcefully injecting the thrombolytic agent into the thrombus to fragment it and increase the surface area available for enzymatic action. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PS-CDT in patients with recent onset or deterioration of lower extremity ischemia. Methods From August 2008 to March 2009, 44 patients with acute or chronic lower extremity ischemia were recruited in this prospective study, which included 37 men and 7 women ranging from 15 to 83 years old (mean age (51.1±17.4) years). PS-CDT through a multi-side-hole thrombolytic catheter by using urokinase was conducted in all patients. The progression of thrombolysis was assessed and graded by angiography. Adjunctive therapies were used to correct underlying lesions. The follow-up period was 12 months. Results In the 44 patients, the average total dose of urokinase for each patient was (2 120 000±1 100 000) IU (median 2 000 000 IU), with a median duration of lysis of 48 hours. The rate of initial technical success was 97.7%. The rate of clinically successful lysis was 81.8%. Early (≤30 days) and late (from 30 days to 12 months) amputation rates were both 4.5% (2/44). The overall amputation rate was 9.1% (4/44). No mortality was recorded during thrombolysis and follow-up period (12 months). No major bleeding or allergic reaction was seen during thrombolytic therapy. 11.4% had symptoms of distal embolization. The primary patency rate for the arteries that were clinically successfully thrombolyzed as compared with those that failed to lysis was 83.3% vs. 57.1%, respectively, at 1 year. Conclusions PS-CDT, combined with adjunctive therapies, is associated with good safety and efficacy in recent-onset or deterioration of lower extremity ischemia. Successful thrombolysis may be accompanied by better outcomes.

To evaluate the possibility and efficacy of the nanoparticle encapsulating heparin as a novel delivery system to treat ischemic disease. Methods. Firstly, to synthesize the PLGA heparin and test the surface morphology, the average diameter, the loading efficiency, and the release time in vitro, then inject the PLGA heparin into mouse ischemic limbs to observe the perfusion recovery with LDPI at the time of postischemic 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, and, finally, test the expression of VEGF and HGF, the number of the neovessels and record the necrotic score of ischemic limbs. Results. The surface morphology of the PLGA heparin was smooth, the average diameter was 297nm, the loading efficiency was 5.35, and the release period maintained for 14 days. In animal experiment, the perfusion recovery, HGF expression level, and capillary density in PLGA-heparin group were significantly higher than that in control group, and this was consistent with less ischemic limb necrosis. Conclusion. Nanoparticle encapsulating heparin could be successful and efficient in ischemic disease. The therapeutic angiogenesis of PLGA heparin might be due to the prolongation of its biological effects with stimulating growth factor expression. Copyright © 2012 Lishan Lian et al.

84863852398	Synthesis and self-assembly of dihydroxyperylene bisimides for the tuning of photophysical properties	The synthesis of 1,10-dihydroxyperylene bisimides by nucleophilic substitution of brominated perylene bisimide is described. 1,10- Dihydroxyperylene bisimides formed J aggregates in nonpolar solvents and showed a clearly redshifted absorption band. The solvent polarity also influenced the hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group, and thus, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide. The photophysical properties of these dihydroxyperylene perylene bisimides can also be tuned by changing charge transfer from the hydroxyl groups to the perylene core through the introduction of metal ions. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84863668592	Tuning growth of low-dimensional organic nanostructures for efficient optical waveguide applications	A novel amphiphilic porphyrin derivative DOCP-Zn has been synthesized and utilized to construct tunable nanostructures from 0D to 1D by controlling the axial coordination of zinc porphyrin with 4,4́-bipyridine. SEM images indicated that patterns between 0D nanospheres and 1D nanorods or nanoslices can be reversibly converted by the construction or destroy of the axial coordination interaction. This facile approach provided a new method for controlling the nanostructure morphologies and dimension by patterns conversion.

84866867520	Fractal self-assembly of single-stranded DNA on hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers	The self-assembled structures possess superior stability, biocompatibility and mechanical strength, and their study can provide insight into the use of creating novel biomaterials. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nanostructures show that well-ordered organization, high homogeneity, and molecular dimensions fractal-shaped fibers formed on a gold substrate covered with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 1-hexadecanethiol (HDT). The nanoscaled architectures of ssDNA on HDT/Au changed remarkably following the process of diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLA) over time. The ssDNA fibers prefer to form on hydrophobic SAMs instead of hydrophilic SAMs, and the ssDNA has to have complementary regions in their sequences. This method might not be used only for the construction of fractal patterns, but also for the design and fabrication of functional DNA-based, self-assembled materials that exhibit self-similarity at multiple length scales. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

The supramolecular interaction (anion-π and charge/electron transfer) between fluoride ion and π-electron deficient tetrazines receptor could facilitate the F<sup>-</sup>-tetrazines electron transfer (ET) event that generates tetrazine<sup>-</sup> radical anion. Accordingly, the color of its solution changed from red to green. Furthermore, the recognition of F<sup>-</sup> in DMSO is tolerant to water (DMSO-H <inf>2</inf>O = 9:1, v/v) and shows excellent selectivity towards other anions, especially H<inf>2</inf>PO<inf>4</inf><sup>-</sup> and OAc<sup>-</sup>. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84867550198	Unprecedented diverse nanostructures formed by amphiphilic graft copolymer bearing PEO side chains synthesized by ATNRC	A series of well-defined amphiphilic graft copolymers bearing hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) side chains with tunable grafting densities were synthesized by atom transfer nitroxide radical coupling (ATNRC) reaction using CuBr/PMDETA as catalytic system via the grafting-onto strategy. PEO side chains were linked to α-C of carbonyl of polyacrylate-based backbone, not to the ester side groups as usual, so that every repeating unit of the backbone possessed a pendant steric bulky tert-butyl group. The critical micelle concentrations of the obtained amphiphilic graft copolymers in aqueous media determined by fluorescence probe technique using pyrene as probe increased with the raising of molecular weights. These amphiphilic graft copolymers with novel chemical structure showed unprecedented diverse nanostructures visualized by transmission electron microscopy in aqueous media and micellar morphologies varied with the changing of experiment parameters.

84869193684	Single molecular recognition force spectroscopy study of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue as a carcinoma target drug	The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin 40 (LHRH-PE40), is a candidate target drug associated with elevated LHRH receptor (LHRH-R) expression in malignant tumor tissue. The capability of LHRH-PE40 to recognize LHRH-Rs on a living cell membrane was studied with single molecular recognition force spectroscopy (SMFS) based on atomic force microscopy (AFM). The recognition force of LHRH-PE40/LHRH-R was compared with that of LHRH/LHRH-R by dynamic force spectroscopy. Meanwhile, cell growth inhibition assay and fluorescence imaging were presented as complementary characterization. The results show that LHRH moiety keeps its capability to recognize LHRH-R specifically, which implies that recombinant protein LHRH-PE40 can be a promising target drug. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84870230702	Management of intravenous leiomyomatosis with intracaval and intracardiac extension	OBJECTIVE: To report the results of management of intravenous leiomyomatosis with intracaval and intracardiac extension at Peking Union Medial College Hospital. METHODS: We reviewed a cohort of 20 patients with intravenous leiomyomatosis extending to the inferior vena cava and heart, focusing on the clinical characteristics, the results of surgical management, and prognosis. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 42.4±7.0 years. The clinical manifestations of intravenous leiomyomatosis are various and nonspecific, including pelvic mass, chest tightness and shortness of breath, swelling in the lower extremity, abdominal distension, palpitation, syncope, hypermenorrhea, and skelalgia. All the patients had history of uterine leiomyoma and 16 patients (80%) had undergone uterine leiomyoma operation. After careful preoperative evaluation, nine patients underwent one-stage operations (cardiac surgery, vascular and gynecologic surgery together) and 11 patients underwent two-stage operations (cardiac surgery first, then vascular and gynecologic surgery). There was no significant difference in the postoperative complication rate (33.3% compared with 27.3%; P>.99) between one-stage and two-stage operations. All operations were performed without severe surgical-related complications or death. Approximately 78% of patients had complete resection of tumor and 22.2% of the patients experienced incomplete resection. Eleven (55%) patients received hormone therapy postoperatively. During mean follow-up time of 20.5 months, recurrence occurred in five patients (27.8%) but all the patients survived. CONCLUSIONS: Precise and full-scale preoperative evaluation, complete tumor resection, and multidisciplinary cooperation are crucial for successful treatment. © 2012 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

84870778944	The prevention of restenosis in vivo with a VEGF gene and paclitaxel co-eluting stent	Long-term clinical studies of drug-eluting stents (DES) have reported high incidence of late thrombosis. Given the growing concern over the clinical application of this technology, we have developed a stent coated with bi-layered PLGA nanoparticles (BL-PLGA NPs) containing VEGF plasmid in the outer layer and paclitaxel (PTX) in the inner core (VEGF/PTX NPs). We hypothesized that early release of VEGF gene would promote re-endothelialization, while slow release of PTX would suppress smooth muscle cell proliferation. Using Fc plasmid as a reporter gene, we observed that Fc/PTX NPs successfully expressed Fc protein, but did not show cytotoxicity or anti-proliferative effect during the first 7 days in cell culture. In contrast, PTX NPs showed strong anti-proliferative effect staring from day 1 in culture, suggesting sequential release of gene and PTX from the BL-PLGA NPs. In vivo effects of the treated stent were assessed in mini-swines. Implantation of GFP/PTX NP-coated stents revealed efficient local GFP gene transfection at day 7. VEGF/PTX NP-coated stents showed complete re-endothelialization and significantly suppressed in-stent restenosis after 1 month compared to commercial DES. In conclusion, the VEGF/PTX NP-coated stents promote early endothelium healing while inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation through sequential release of the VEGF gene and paclitaxel. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84871305504	Combined three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and surgical intervention for portal vein tumor thrombus in patients with hepatocelular carcinoma	Objective: To explore the clinical therapeutic efficacies of combined three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 145 HCC patients with tumor thrombus in portal vein were divided randomly into 2 groups. Group A (n = 64) was treated with surgical intervention alone while group B (n = 81) underwent 3DCRT plus TACE. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as PVTT only. Results: Survival rates of group A at year 1 and 2 were 40.3% and 21.9% with a mean survival time (MST) of 15.2 months while that of group B were 41.2% and 22.5% with a MST of 15.8 months. The total effective rates of groups A and B was 40.6% (28/64) and 44.4% (36/81) respectively.

84871337654	Surgical treatment of spontaneous isolated middle aortic dissection	Objective: To explore the diagnosis and treatment of spontaneous isolated middle aortic dissection (SIMAD). Methods: The clinical data of 7 SIMAD patients admitted into our hospital between January 2007 and June 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: There were 3 males and 4 females with an average age of 53 years old. Five patients had an acute onset. According to the original tear location and flow of celiac artery, 6 patients received endovascular repair and another patient underwent abdominal aorta-bilateral-femoral artery bypass with artificial graft. All cases were successfully treated. Six patients recovered well from the procedures. One patient suffered acute coronary artery syndrome at Day 2 after endovascular treatment. After transferal into cardiology unit, emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed with a satisfactory outcome. The postoperative examinations of CTA (computed tomography angiography) of all patients demonstrated that the false lumen of dissection was basically thrombolized without endoleak or stent migration. Conclusion: Vascular surgeons should pay more attention to SIMAD with the potentials of rupture and aneurysm. Endovascular graft exclusion may be a first-line therapy as long as the anatomical conditions allow. However, longer follow-up and further evaluations should be performed to determine the long-term benefits. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84873160345	Hydrogen-rich saline attenuates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting reactive oxygen species production and inactivating the Ras-ERK1/2-MEK1/2 and Akt pathways	Hydrogen-rich saline has been reported to prevent neointimal hyperplasia induced by carotid balloon injury. The purpose of the present study was to further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Daily injection of a hydrogen-rich saline solution (HRSS) in rats was employed to study the effect of hydrogen on balloon injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia and the neointima/media ratio was assessed. HRSS significantly decreased the neointima area and neointima/media ratio in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro effects of hydrogen on fetal bovine serum (FBS)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proli-feration were also investigated. Hydrogen-rich medium (HRM) inhibited rat VSMC proliferation and migration induced by 10% FBS. FBS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of intracellular Ras, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Akt were significantly inhibited by HRM. In addition, HRM blocked FBS-induced progression from the G0/G1 to the S-phase and increased the apoptosis rate of VSMCs. These results showed that hydrogen-rich saline was able to attenuate FBS-induced VSMC proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting ROS production and inactivating the Ras-ERK1/2-MEK1/2 and Akt pathways. Thus, HRSS may have potential therapeutic relevance for the prevention of human restenosis.

84874037667	Hexagonal boron nitride intercalated multi-layer graphene: A possible ultimate solution to ultra-scaled interconnect technology	We proposed intercalation of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in multilayer graphene to improve its performance in ultra-scaled interconnects for integrated circuit. The effect of intercalated hBN layer in bilayer graphene is investigated using non-equilibrium Greens functions. We find the hBN intercalated bilayer graphene exhibit enhanced transport properties compared with pristine bilayer ones, and the improvement is attributed to suppression of interlayer scattering and good planar bonding condition of inbetween hBN layer. Based on these results, we proposed a via structure that not only benefits from suppressed interlayer scattering between multilayer graphene, but also sustains the unique electrical properties of graphene when many graphene layers are stacking together. The ideal current density across the structure can be as high as 4.6109 A/cm2 at 1V, which is very promising for the future high-performance interconnect. © 2012 Author(s).

84875272481	Self-assembly of low dimensional nanostructures and materials via supramolecular interactions at interfaces	Low dimensional inorganic-organic heterostructure nanomaterials with multiple different functional components attaching at interface have drawn considerable attention over the last decades, due to their excellent optical and electronic properties in comparison with their individual components. Supramolecular self-assembly of disordered building blocks has played an essential role in constructing well-defined functionalized structures. Solid-liquid interfaces are known as ideal platforms in the self-assembly process, thus providing a series of novel and attractive strategies to construct low dimensional inorganic-organic heterostructure nanomaterials with different sizes and shapes. In this review, we summarized low dimensional inorganic-organic heterostructure nanomaterials on the basis of self-assembly that is driven by synergistically metal-ligand coordination and other intermolecular interactions. Both stepwise self-assembly on the inorganic (or organic) solid surface and self-assembly of inorganic-organic building block through hydrogen bond, metal-ligand coordination interaction, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction, and covalently bonding were discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84875851943	TBHBMA: A novel trifunctional acrylic monomer for the convenient synthesis of PAA-g-PCL well-defined amphiphilic graft copolymer	A series of well-defined amphiphilic graft copolymers, consisting of a hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) backbone and hydrophobic poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) side chains, was synthesized by the combination of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and ring-opening polymerization (ROP). A new acrylate monomer containing a ROP initiation group, tert-butyl(2-((4-hydroxybutanoyloxy)methyl)acrylate), was first prepared using tert-butyl acrylate as the starting material, and it was homopolymerized by RAFT in a controlled way to give a well-defined homopolymer bearing ROP initiation group in every repeating unit. This homopolymer directly initiated ROP of ε-caprolactone to provide well-defined poly(tert-butyl acrylate)-g-poly(ε-caprolactone) graft copolymers via the grafting-from strategy without post-polymerization functionality transformation. Finally, the hydrophobic poly(tert-butyl acrylate) backbone was selectively hydrolyzed in an acidic environment without affecting the PCL side chains to afford poly(acrylic acid)-g-poly(ε-caprolactone) amphiphilic graft copolymers possessing the hydrophilic PAA backbone and equally distributed hydrophobic PCL side chains. The self-assembly behavior of the obtained amphiphilic graft copolymers and pH-sensitivity of the resultant micelles were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, DLS, and TEM. DSC and XRD analysis showed the crystallization behavior of poly(acrylic acid)-g-poly(ε-caprolactone) graft copolymers. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The brush-like main chain was firstly constructed by SET-LRP of PEGMEA macromonomer in THF/H<inf>2</inf>O followed by post-polymerization modification to PPEGMEA-NH<inf>2</inf> macroinitiator. The target well-defined PPEGMEA-g-PBLG graft copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions (M <inf>w</inf>/M<inf>n</inf> = 1.06-1.21) were obtained via ROP of BLG-NCA monomer initiated by PPEGMEA-NH<inf>2</inf> macroinitiator in 1,4-dioxane and the molecular weights of the backbone and side chains were both controllable. PBLG side chains were found to adopt α-helix conformation with a maximum helix content up to 99%. Critical micelle concentrations (cmc) of PPEGMEA-g-PBLG amphiphilic graft copolymers were determined using fluorescence probe technology and their diverse self-assembled nanoscale morphologies were visualized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Micellar morphologies formed by PPEGMEA-g-PBLG amphiphilic graft copolymers were found to be dependant on the initial water content, composition of the organic cosolvent, and length of the PBLG side chains. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Methods: The clinical data were collected and analyzed for the patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy at Department of Vascular Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital from October 2009 to October 2012. According to two different surgical procedures, they were divided into 2 groups of eCEA and pCEA. Results: A total of 248 patients received a follow-up.Among 274 cases of endarterectomy, 101 cases of eCEA and 173 cases of pCEA were performed. No significant difference (P ≤ 0.05) existed between two groups in gender, age, risk factors, stenotic degree of carotid artery or ratio of bilateral lesions. The ratio of shunt (15.8%) and antibiotics (26.7%) application, the duration of operation (88 ± 20) min, intraoperative blood loss (45 ± 16) ml and the length of stay (16 ± 4) days in the group eCEA were significantly lower than those of group pCEA (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference (P ≤ 0.05) between two groups in the ratio of complications, surgery-related mortality, restenosis and ipsilateral stroke. Conclusion: Both surgical procedures are both safe and effective in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis.However eCEA offers potential advantages. The choice of a particular surgical procedure depends on the surgeon experience and specific circumstances of carotid artery lesions. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84898838289	Self-assembly of intramolecular charge-transfer compounds into functional molecular systems	ConspectusHighly polarized compounds exhibiting intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) are used widely as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials and red emitters and in organic light emitting diodes. Low-molecular-weight donor/acceptor (D/A)-substituted ICT compounds are ideal candidates for use as the building blocks of hierarchically structured, multifunctional self-assembled supramolecular systems. This Account describes our recent studies into the development of functional molecular systems with well-defined self-assembled structures based on charge-transfer (CT) interactions. From solution (sensors) to the solid state (assembled structures), we have fully utilized intrinsic and stimulus-induced CT interactions to construct these functional molecular systems.We have designed some organic molecules capable of ICT, with diversity and tailorability, that can be used to develop novel self-assembled materials. These ICT organic molecules are based on a variety of simple structures such as perylene bisimide, benzothiadiazole, tetracyanobutadiene, fluorenone, isoxazolone, BODIPY, and their derivatives. The degree of ICT is influenced by the nature of both the bridge and the substituents. We have developed new methods to synthesize ICT compounds through the introduction of heterocycles or heteroatoms to the π-conjugated systems or through extending the conjugation of diverse aromatic systems via another aromatic ring.Combining these ICT compounds featuring different D/A units and different degrees of conjugation with phase transfer methodologies and solvent-vapor techniques, we have self-assembled various organic nanostructures, including hollow nanospheres, wires, tubes, and ribbonlike architectures, with controllable morphologies and sizes. For example, we obtained a noncentrosymmetric microfiber structure that possessed a permanent dipole along its fibers' long axis and a transition dipole perpendicular to it; the independent NLO responses of this material can be separated and tuned spectroscopically and spatially. The ready processability and intrinsically high NLO efficiency of these microfibers offer great opportunities for applications in photonic devices. We have also designed molecular sensors based on changes in the efficiency of the ICT process upon complexation of an analyte with the D or A moieties in the ICT compounds. Such sensors, which display evident Stokes shifts or changes in quantum yields or fluorescence lifetimes, have promise for applications in chemical and biological recognition and sensing.In this Account, we shed light on the structure-function relationships of these functional molecular systems with well-defined self-assembled structures based on ICT interactions. The encouraging results that we have obtained suggest that such self-assembled ICT molecular materials can guide the design of new nanostructures and materials from organic systems, and that these materials, across a range of compositions, sizes, shapes, and functionalities, can potentially be applied in the fields of electronics, optics, and optoelectronics. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84898925598	Preparation and application of supramolecular functional materials based on π system	Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of the preparation methods for aggregation structures and have witnessed a continuous expansion of the application areas, which afford the opportunity to construct molecular devices with smaller size, stronger function and better performance. The organic conjugated molecules based on π system have attracted an increasing attention as a novel unit for the building of nanostructures. In this paper, beginning with the introduction of the concept and characteristic of nanomaterials, we discuss the construction methods for supramolecular functional materials based on organic π- conjugated and inorganic/organic hybrid systems. For organic π- conjugated system, the methods include vapor deposition, template and classic self-assembly. For inorganic/organic hybrid system, the methods include sol-gel, intercalation, blending, template and supramolecular self-assembly. Among these methods, we focus on the classic self-assembly one for organic system. In the process of self-assembly, several driving forces have important influence on the aggregation morphologies, including π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, metal coordination, hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Although in this process, one or two driving force predominate, several driving forces are involved actually. On the basis of the preparation of nanomaterials, we discuss the construction of functional molecular devices and their wide applications in the fields of field emission, photoelectric detection, solar cells, sensors, nonlinear optical and optical waveguide materials.

Methods: Patients with carotid artery stenosis who underwent the carotid endarterectomy in the vascular surgery department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from October 2009 to October 2012 were enrolled in this study. According to the two different surgical procedures, the patients were divided into eCEA group and pCEA group. Results: The two groups were not significantly different in terms of gender, age, risk factors, stenosis degree of carotid artery, and the ratio of bilateral lesions (all P > 0.05). The ratio of shunt and antibiotics application, operative time, hospitalization cost, and length of hospital stay in the eCEA group were significantly lower than those in pCEA group (P < 0.05). The therapeutic effectiveness, complications, surgery-related death, restenosis, and ipsilateral stroke were not significantly different between these two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Both surgical procedures are safe and effective in treating the carotid artery stenosis; however, eCEA has lower cost when compared with pCEA and therefore can be used as the first choice.

84908701352	Fluorinated poly(meth)acrylate: Synthesis and properties	Due to good reactivity of fluorinated (meth)acrylates with other monomers or polymer segments, fluorinated poly(meth)acrylates possess more economical and convenient synthesis routes than other fluoropolymers. This feature article initially summarizes different types of fluorinated (meth)acrylates, which can be divided into fluorinated alkyl (meth)acrylates and fluorinated aryl (meth)acrylates. Subsequently, various approaches for synthesizing fluorinated poly(meth)acrylates including random, block, graft or star copolymers are described. Conventional free radical polymerization can be used in synthesizing random copolymers, while controlled/"living" radical polymerization can provide well-defined copolymers with accurate control over molecular weight and special structures as expected. In particular, introduction of fluorinated components into as-prepared copolymers offers an alternative route to synthesize fluorinated poly(meth)acrylates which are difficult to be obtained directly via polymerization. The incorporation of fluorine can confer unique and highly desirable properties to poly(meth)acrylates such as low surface energy, thermal stability, chemical and weather resistance, low refractive index, and self-organization characteristics. Such properties are described in great details based on many recent articles.

84920372286	Designed synthesis of a highly conjugated hexaethynylbenzene-based host for supramolecular architectures	The construction of efficient synthetic functional receptors with tunable cavities, and the self-organization of guest molecules within these cavities through noncovalent interactions can be challenging. Here we have prepared a double-cavity molecular cup based on hexaethynylbenzene that possesses a highly p-conjugated interior for the binding of electron-rich guests. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, fluorescent spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and SEM were used to investigate the structures and the binding behaviors. The results indicated that the binding of a guest in one cavity would affect the binding of the same or another guest in the other cavity. The effect of electron transfer in this system suggests ample opportunities for tuning the optical and electronic properties of the molecular cup and the encapsulated guest. The encapsulation of different guests would also lead to different aggregate nanostructures, which is a new way to tune their supramolecular architectures.

84924219701	High glucose induces Rho/ROCK-dependent visfatin and type I procollagen expression in rat primary cardiac fibroblasts	Myocardial fibrosis and excessive proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the underlying mechanism is still not completely clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between high-glucose treatment and the expression of visfatin and type I procollagen in rat CFs, and examine the regulatory effects of high-glucose treatment on the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. CFs from newborn Sprague Dawley rats were treated with high concentrations of glucose (10, 30 and 50 mmol/l D-glucose), a baseline concentration of glucose (5.5 mmol/l) as a control, and mannitol (5.5 mmol/l D-glucose + 44.5 mmol/l mannitol) as an osmotic control. CFs were also treated with 30 mmol/l D-glucose for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. The proliferation of CFs was determined by the MTT assay. The mRNA and protein expression of visfatin and type I procollagen were quantified by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Cardiac fibroblast proliferation reached a peak at 30 mmol/l D-glucose, and visfatin and type I procollagen expression were significantly increased upon treatment with high concentrations of glucose (10 and 30 mmol/l) compared to baseline glucose treatment. Treatment with 30 mmol/l D-glucose time-dependently promoted cardiac fibroblast proliferation. The mRNA and protein expression of visfatin and type I procollagen were significantly increased compared to the control at 24 h after 30 mmol/l D-glucose treatment. Y27632, a Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of visfatin and type I procollagen, induced by 30 mmol/l D-glucose (all P<0.05). In conclusion, a high level of glucose promotes cardiac fibroblast proliferation, and induces visfatin and type I procollagen expression in CFs, at least partially via the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. These results may be helpful in developing an appropriate therapeutic strategy for DCM.
