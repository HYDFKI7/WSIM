84941651435	Diagnostic studies in sufficient dimension reduction	Sufficient dimension reduction in regression aims to reduce the predictor dimension by replacing the original predictors with some set of linear combinations of them without loss of information. Numerous dimension reduction methods have been developed based on this paradigm. However, little effort has been devoted to diagnostic studies within the context of dimension reduction. In this paper we introduce methods to check goodness-of-fit for a given dimension reduction subspace. The key idea is to extend the so-called distance correlation to measure the conditional dependence relationship between the covariates and the response given a reduction subspace. Our methods require minimal assumptions, which are usually much less restrictive than the conditions needed to justify the original methods. Asymptotic properties of the test statistic are studied. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

33750108055	A control chart based on a change-point model for monitoring linear profiles	A control chart based on the change-point model is proposed that is able to monitor linear profiles whose parameters are unknown but can be estimated from historical data. This chart can detect a shift in either the intercept, slope or standard deviation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach performs well across a range of possible shifts, and that it can be used during the start-up stages of a process. Simple diagnostic aids are also given to estimate the location of the change and to determine which of the parameters has changed.

Because of the good properties of the plot statistics, the proposed chart can be easily designed to match any desired in-control average run length.

36849064218	Monitoring general linear profiles using multivariate exponentially weighted moving average schemes	We propose a statistical process control scheme that can be implemented in industrial practice, in which the quality of a process can be characterized by a general linear profile. We start by reviewing the general linear profile model and the existing monitoring methods. Based on this, we propose a novel multivariate exponentially weighted moving average monitoring scheme for such a profile. We introduce two other enhancement features, the variable sampling interval and the parametric diagnostic approach, to further improve the performance of the proposed scheme. Throughout the article, we use a deep reactive ion etching example from semiconductor manufacturing, which has a profile that fits a quadratic polynomial regression model well, to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach. © 2007 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality.

40549133828	Monitoring autocorrelated processes using variable sampling schemes at fixed-times	Traditional control charts for process monitoring are based on taking samples of fixed size from the process using a fixed sampling interval. A recent development in control charts is the use of adaptive control charts, i.e. the variable sampling interval (VSI) and variable sampling size charts. This paper extends this idea to the autocorrelated process. We consider a time series model which is a first-order autoregressive process plus a random error. With variable intervals, the sampling time may be inconvenient, so using only two intervals, referred to as 'variable sampling interval at fix times' makes the method easier to use in practice. The sampling rate can also be adjusted by the number of samples collected, VSRFT, for 'variable sampling rate at fixed times'. We study what we call 'variable sampling at fixed times', VSFT, which includes both VSIFT and VSRFT schemes, using a Markov chain model and integral equations. We show that our methods detect process shifts faster, on average, than fixed sampling X-bar charts, and at least comparable detection ability with the less practical VSI charts.

This control chart is a nonparametric chart based on the Mann-Whitney statistic for a change in mean and adapted for repeated sequential use. We do not require any knowledge of the underlying distribution such as the normal assumption. Particularly, this distribution robustness could be a significant advantage in start-up or short-run situations where we usually do not have knowledge of the underlying distribution.

Most existing approachesin the literature are for monitoring location parameters. They may not be effective with a change of distribution over time in many applications. This paper develops a new distribution-free control chart based on the integration of a powerful nonparametric goodness-of-fit test and the exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA)control scheme. Benefiting from certain desirable properties of the test and the proposed charting statistic,our proposed control chart is computationally fast, convenient to use, and efficient in detecting potential shifts in location, scale, and shap Thus, it offers robust protection against variation in various underlying distributions. Numericalstudies and a real-data example show that the proposed approaches are quite effective in industrialapplications, particularly in start-up and short-run situations.

84887857013	Outlier detection in general profiles using penalized regression method	Profile monitoring is a technique for checking the stability of functional relationships between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables over time. The presence of outliers has seriously adverse effects on the modeling, monitoring, and diagnosis of profile data. This article proposes a new outlier detection procedure from the viewpoint of penalized regression, aiming at identifying any abnormal profile observations from a baseline dataset. Profiles are treated as high-dimension vectors and the model is reformulated into a specific regression model. A group-type regularization is then applied that favors a sparse vector of mean shift parameters. Using the classic hard penalty yields a computationally efficient algorithm that is essentially equivalent to an iterative approach. Appropriately choosing a sole tuning parameter in the proposed procedure enables Type-I error to be controlled and robust detection ability to be delivered. Simulation results show that the proposed method has an outstanding performance in identifying outliers in various situations compared with other existing approaches. This methodology is also extended to the case where within-profile correlations exist. ©"IIE".

Empirical likelihood, as a classical nonparametric method of statistical inference, has proved to possess many good features. In this paper, our focus is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of empirical likelihood for regression coefficients in high-dimensional linear models. We give regularity conditions under which the standard normal calibration of empirical likelihood is valid in high dimensions. Both random and fixed designs are considered.

48949109127	A change point approach for phase I analysis in multistage processes	We study the phase I analysis of a multistage process where the input of the current process stage may be closely related to the output(s) of the earlier stage(s). We frame univariate observations from each of the stages in a multistage process as a single vector and recognize that the directions in which these vectors can shift are limited when attention is restricted to a single step shift in the mean of one stage. This allows us to focus detection power on a limited subspace with improved sensitivity. Taking advantage of this particular characteristic, we propose a change point approach that integrates the classical binary segmentation test with the directional information based on the state-space model for testing the stability of a batch of historical data. We give an accurate approximation for the significance level of the proposed test. Our simulation results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms existing methods for multistage processes. © 2008 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality.

54249122670	Directional MEWMA schemes for multistage process monitoring and diagnosis	Statistical process control, monitoring, and diagnosis of a multistage process remain challenging problems in both the manufacturing and service industries. This paper proposes a directional multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (directional MEWMA) scheme integrating the EWMA scheme with the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) scheme that can incorporate directional information based on the multistage state-space model and effectively monitor the process mean shift. The proposed directional MEWMA scheme not only provides a statistical process control (SPC) solution that incorporates both interstage and intrastage correlations but also resolves the confounding issue in monitoring and diagnosis due to the cumulative effects from stage to stage. In addition, a systematic diagnostic approach is provided to isolate and identify an out-of-control stage and to locate its change point. Our simulation results show that the proposed monitoring and diagnostic scheme consistently outperforms almost all existing approaches to multistage processes. A sensitivity analysis and discussion on performance indicators for multistage process monitoring are also presented.

63849196692	Monitoring profiles based on nonparametric regression methods	The use of statistical process control (SPC) in monitoring and diagnosis of process and product quality profiles remains an important problem in various manufacturing industries. The SPC problem with a nonlinear profile is particularly challenging. This article proposes a novel scheme to monitor changes in both the regression relationship and the variation of the profile online. It integrates the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average procedure with the generalized likelihood ratio test based on nonparametric regression. The proposed scheme not only provides an effective SPC solution to handle nonlinear profiles, which are common in industrial practice, but it also resolves the latent problem in popular parametric monitoring methods of being unable to detect certain types of changes due to a misspecified, out-of-control model. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed monitoring scheme. In addition, a systematic diagnostic approach is provided to locate the change point of the process and identify the type of change in the profile. Finally, a deep reactive ion-etching example from semiconductor manufacturing is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed monitoring and diagnostic approach. © 2008 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality.

67650983226	Comparisons of control schemes for monitoring the means of processes subject to drifts	Although statistical process control (SPC) techniques have been focused mostly on detecting step (constant) mean shift, drift which is a time-varying change frequently occurs in industrial applications. In this research, for monitoring drift change, the following five control schemes are compared: the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart and the cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts which are recommended detecting drift change in the literature; the generalized EWMA (GEWMA) chart proposed by Han and Tsung (2004) and two generalized likelihood ratio based schemes, GLR-S and GLR-L charts which are respectively under the assumption of step and linear trend shifts. Both the asymptotic estimation and the numerical simulation of the average run length (ARL) are presented. We show that when the in-control (IC) ARL is large (goes to infinity), the GLR-L chart has the best overall performance among the considered charts in detecting linear trend shift. From the viewpoint of practical IC ARL, based on the simulation results, we show that besides the GLR-L chart, the GEWMA chart offers a good balanced protection against drifts of different size. Some computational issues are also addressed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

70349237109	Nonparametric control chart for monitoring profiles using change point formulation and adaptive smoothing	In many applications, quality of a process is best characterized by a functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Profile monitoring is used for checking the stability of this relationship over time. Control charts based on nonparametric regression are particularly useful when the in-control (IC) or out-of-control (OC) relationship is too complicated to be specified parametrically. This paper proposes a novel nonparametric control chart, using a sequential change-point formulation with generalized likelihood ratio tests. Its control limits are determined by a bootstrap procedure. This chart can be implemented without any knowledge about the error distributions, as long as a few IC profiles axe available beforehand. Moreover, benefiting from certain good properties of the dynamic change-point approach and of the proposed charting statistic, the proposed control chart not only offers a balanced protection against shifts of different magnitudes, but also adapts to the smoothness of the difference between IC and OC regression functions. Consequently, it has a nearly optimal performance for various OC conditions.

73449096098	A new variable sampling control schemeat fixed times for monitoring the process dispersion	The variable sampling rate (VSR) schemes for detecting the shift in process mean have been extensively analyzed; however, adding the VSR feature to the control charts for monitoring process dispersion has not been thoroughly investigated. In this research, a novel VSR control scheme, sequential exponentially weighted moving average inverse normal transformation (EWMA INT) at fixed times chart (called (SEIFT) chart), which integrates the sequential EWMA scheme at fix times with the INT statistic, is proposed to detect both the increase and decrease in process dispersion. Moreover, the sample size at each sampling time is also allowed to vary. The Markov chain method is used to evaluate the performance of this new control chart. Numerical analysis reveals that this SEIFT chart gives significant improvement on detection ability than the fixed sampling rate schemes. Compared with other control schemes, the good properties of the INT statistic makes this SEIFT chart easy to design and convenient to implement. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

74049132241	Multivariate statistical process control using LASSO	This article develops a new multivariate statistical process control (SPC) methodology based on adapting the LASSO variable selection method to the SPC problem. The LASSO method has the sparsity property of being able to select exactly the set of nonzero regression coefficients in multivariate regression modeling, which is especially useful in cases where the number of nonzero coefficients is small. In multivariate SPC applications, process mean vectors often shift in a small number of components. Our primary goals are to detect such a shift as soon as it occurs and to identify the shifted mean components. Using this connection between the two problems, we propose a LASSO- based multivariate test statistic, and then integrate this statistic into the multivariate EWMA charting scheme for Phase II multivariate process monitoring. We show that this approach balances protection against various shift levels and shift directions, and thus provides an effective tool for multivariate SPC applications.

The local linear nonparametric estimator is used to construct the GLR statistic. We prove that the corresponding test statistic is asymptotically normal and free of nuisance parameters and covariate designs under the null hypothesis.

77955386922	Nonparametric profile monitoring by mixed effects modeling	In some applications, the quality of a process is characterized by the functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables. Profile monitoring is for checking the stability of this relationship over time. Control charts for monitoring nonparametric profiles are useful when the relationship is too complicated to be described parametrically.Most existing control charts in the literature are for monitoring parametric profiles. They require the assumption that within-profile measurements are independent of each other, which is often invalid in practice. This article focuses on nonparametric profile monitoring when within-profile data are correlated. A novel control chart is suggested, which incorporates local linear kernel smoothing into the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control scheme. In this method, within-profile correlation is described by a nonparametric mixed-effects model. Our proposed control chart is fast to compute and convenient to use. Numerical examples show that it works well in various cases.

78349234492	Coordinate-independent sparse sufficient dimension reduction and variable selection	Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) in regression, which reduces the dimension by replacing original predictors with a minimal set of their linear combinations without loss of information, is very helpful when the number of predictors is large. The standard SDR methods suffer because the estimated linear combinations usually consist of all original predictors, making it difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a unified method-coordinate- independent sparse estimation (CISE)-that can simultaneously achieve sparse sufficient dimension reduction and screen out irrelevant and redundant variables efficiently. CISE is subspace oriented in the sense that it incorporates a coordinate-independent penalty term with a broad series of model-based and model-free SDR approaches. This results in a Grassmann manifold optimization problem and a fast algorithm is suggested. Under mild conditions, based on manifold theories and techniques, it can be shown that CISE would perform asymptotically as well as if the true irrelevant predictors were known, which is referred to as the oracle property. Simulation studies and a real-data example demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2010.

78349236171	Control chart for monitoring nonparametric profiles with arbitrary design	Nonparametric profile monitoring (NPM) is for monitoring, over time, a functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables when the relationship is too complicated to be specified parametrically. It is widely used in industry for the purpose of quality control of a process. Existing NPM approaches require the assumption that design points within a profile are deterministic, and are unchanged from one profile to another. In practice, however, different profiles can have different design points and, in some cases, they are random. NPM is particularly challenging in such cases because it is difficult to properly combine data in different profiles purposes of data smoothing and process monitoring. In this paper, we propose an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart for handling this problem based on local linear kernel smoothing. In the proposed chart, the exponential weights used in the EWMA scheme at different time points are integrated into a nonparametric procedure for smoothing individual profiles. Because of certain properties of the charting statistic, this control chart is fast to compute, easy to implement, and efficient in the detection of profile shifts. Some numerical results show that it works well.

79251557796	A multivariate sign EWMA control chart	Nonparametric control charts are useful in statistical process control (SPC) when there is a lack of or limited knowledge about the underlying process distribution, especially when the process measurement is multivariate. This article develops a new multivariate SPC methodology for monitoring location parameters. It is based on adapting a powerful multivariate sign test to online sequential monitoring. The weighted version of the sign test is used to formulate the charting statistic by incorporating the exponentially weighted moving average control (EWMA) scheme, which results in a nonparametric counterpart of the classical multivariate EWMA (MEWMA). It is affine-invariant and has a strictly distribution-free property over a broad class of population models. That is, the in-control (IC) run length distribution can attain (or is always very close to) the nominal one when using the same control limit designed for a mul- tivariate normal distribution. Moreover, when the process distribution comes from the elliptical direction class, the IC average run length can be calculated via a one-dimensional Markov chain model. This control chart possesses some other favorable features: it is fast to compute with a similar computational effort to the MEWMA chart; it is easy to implement because only the multivariate median and the associated transformation matrix need to be specified (estimated) from the historical data before monitoring; it is also very efficient in detecting process shifts, particularly small or moderate shifts when the process distribution is heavy tailed or skewed. Two real-data examples from manufacturing show that it performs quite well in applications.

79952903192	A new chart for detecting the process mean and variability	Since the earliest days of statistical process control, it has been recognized that it is essential to monitor both mean and variability and to trigger an alarm if either characteristic shows sign of a special cause. It is, however, possible to monitor both mean and variance in a single chart responsive to shifts in either. Traditionally, this has been done by using separate X̄ and S or R charts. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new single chart with the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure to monitor both mean and variance. It is shown that, in addition to the simplicity of a single chart rather than two, the new chart has some advantages over many other charts in detecting process changes.

80054958822	An adaptive Shiryaev-Roberts procedure for monitoring dispersion	In this paper, the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure is examined and compared with the change point CUSUM (CPC) procedure for monitoring the dispersion of a normal process. It will be shown that the SR chart performs better than the CPC chart for the pre-specified dispersion shift. In practice, when the magnitude of a future dispersion shift is unknown, it is always desired to design a control chart to perform reasonably well over a range of shifts rather than to optimize the performance at detecting a particular level of shifts. Compared with SR based on a pre-specified dispersion shift, an adaptive SR (ASR) chart that continually adjusts its form to be efficient for signaling a smoothing exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) statistic in deviation from its target value is proposed in this paper. It can be easily implemented and numerical results show that it balances protection against a broad range of shift sizes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84857601526	Profile monitoring with binary data and random predictors	The purpose of profile monitoring is to check the stability over time of relationships between response variables and one or more explanatory variables. In many applications, categorical response variables are common and a generalized linear model is usually utilized to model this kind of profile for quality improvement. In practice, different profiles often have random explanatory variables and these variables require careful monitoring as well. Statistical process control is important and challenging for monitoring profiles in such situations. A novel control chart is proposed by integrating an exponentially weighted moving-average scheme and a likelihood-ratio test for the parameters of a logistic regression model. This new scheme not only monitors the functional relationship of the profile but also the mean of the explanatory variables. The proposed chart has reasonable computational and implementation complexity and is efficient in detecting shifts. The simulation results show that it performs better than the standard benchmarks in the literatures for the array of simulation examples that we consider. A real example from the electronic industries is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach.

Some methods exist in the literature which could be used for monitoring multiple linear regression profiles. However, the performance of most of these methods deteriorates as the number of regression parameters increases. In this paper, we specifically concentrate on phase II monitoring of multiple linear regression profiles and propose a new dimension reduction method to overcome the dimensionality problem of some of the existing methods. The robustness, effectiveness, and limitations of the proposed method are also discussed.

To overcome this problem, we propose to incorporate a natural and well-explained restriction into likelihood function and obtain a restricted empirical likelihood ratio statistic (RELR).

The weighted version of the rank-based test is used to formulate the charting statistic by incorporating the exponentially weighted moving average control scheme. It is robust to non-normally distributed data, easy to construct, fast to compute and also very efficient in detecting multivariate process shifts, especially small or moderate shifts which occur when the process distribution is heavy-tailed or skewed. As it avoids the need for a lengthy data-gathering step before charting and it does not require knowledge of the underlying distribution, the proposed control chart is particularly useful in start-up or short-run situations.

84862803199	Local Walsh-average regression	Local polynomial regression is widely used for nonparametric regression. However, the efficiency of least squares (LS) based methods is adversely affected by outlying observations and heavy tailed distributions. On the other hand, the least absolute deviation (LAD) estimator is more robust, but may be inefficient for many distributions of interest. Kai et al. (2010) [13] propose a nonparametric regression technique called local composite quantile regression (LCQR) smoothing to improve local polynomial regression further. However, the performance of LCQR depends on the choice of the number of quantiles to combine, a meta parameter which plays a vital role in balancing the performance of LS and LAD based methods. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method termed the local Walsh-average regression (LWAR) estimator by minimizing a locally Walsh-average based loss function. Under the same assumptions in Kai et al. (2010) [13], we theoretically show that the proposed estimator is highly efficient across a wide spectrum of distributions. Its asymptotic relative efficiency with respect to the LS based method is closely related to that of the signed-rank Wilcoxon test in comparison with the t-test. Both of the theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the performance of the new approach and LCQR is at least comparable in estimating the nonparametric regression function or its derivatives and in some cases the new approach performs better than the LCQR with commonly recommended number of quantiles, especially for estimating the regression function. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, outlier detection, aiming at identifying abnormal functional curves from a dataset, is quite important. This article proposes a new testing procedure based on functional principal component analysis. Under mild conditions, the null distribution of the test statistic is shown to be asymptotically pivotal with a well-known asymptotic distribution. Simulation results demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the asymptotic test and detection procedure. Finally, by illustrating the connection between profile monitoring in statistical process control and outlier detection in functional data, we apply the proposed approach to a real-data example from a manufacturing process and show that it performs quite well in detecting outlying profiles.

84865835725	A distribution-free robust method for monitoring linear profiles using rank-based regression	Profile monitoring is a technique for checking the stability of the functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables over time. Linear profile monitoring is particularly useful in practice due to its simplicity and flexibility. The existing monitoring methods suffer from a drawback in that they all assume the error distribution to be normal. When the underlying distribution is misspecified, the efficiency of the commonly used Least Squares Estimation (LSE) is likely to be low and as a consequence the detection ability of procedures based on LSE is reduced. To overcome this drawback, this article develops a non-parametric methodology for monitoring the linear profile, including the regression coefficients and profile variations. The Multivariate Sign Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MSEWMA) control scheme is applied to the estimated profile parameters obtained using a rank-based regression approach. Benefiting from certain favorable properties of MSEWMA and the efficiency of rank-based regression estimators, the proposed chart is robust from the point of view of the in-control and out-of-control average run length, particularly when the process distribution is heavily tailed. An example with real data from a manufacturing facility shows that it performs well in application. © 2012 "IIE".

84870655152	Likelihood-based EWMA charts for monitoring poisson count data with time-varying sample sizes	Many applications involve monitoring incidence rates of the Poisson distribution when the sample size varies over time. Recently, a couple of cumulative sum and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts have been proposed to tackle this problem by taking the varying sample size into consideration. However, we argue that some of these charts, which perform quite well in terms of average run length (ARL), may not be appealing in practice because they have rather unsatisfactory run length distributions. With some charts, the specified in-control (IC) ARL is attained with elevated probabilities of very short and very long runs, as compared with a geometric distribution. This is reflected in a larger run length standard deviation than that of a geometric distribution and an elevated probability of false alarms with short runs, which, in turn, hurt an operator's confidence in valid alarms. Furthermore, with many charts, the IC ARL exhibits considerable variations with different patterns of sample sizes. Under the framework of weighted likelihood ratio test, this article suggests a new EWMA control chart which automatically integrates the varying sample sizes with the EWMA scheme. It is fast to compute, easy to construct, and quite efficient in detecting changes of Poisson rates. Two important features of the proposed method are that the IC run length distribution is similar to that of a geometric distribution and the IC ARL is robust to various patterns of sample size variation. Our simulation results show that the proposed chart is generally more effective and robust compared with existing EWMA charts. A health surveillance example based on mortality data from New Mexico is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed method.

We study Phase I analysis of multivariate categorical processes (MCPs) to identify the presence of change-points in the reference dataset. A directional change-point detection method based on log-linear models is proposed. The method exploits directional shift information and integrates MCPs into the unified framework of multivariate binomial and multivariate multinomial distributions. A diagnostic scheme for identifying the change-point location and the shift direction is also suggested. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the detection effectiveness and the diagnostic accuracy.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84878532847	Calibration of the empirical likelihood for high-dimensional data	This article is concerned with the calibration of the empirical likelihood (EL) for high-dimensional data where the data dimension may increase as the sample size increases. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the EL under a general multivariate model and provide weak conditions under which the best rate for the asymptotic normality of the empirical likelihood ratio (ELR) is achieved. In addition, there is usually substantial lack-of-fit when the ELR is calibrated by the usual normal in high dimensions, producing tests with type I errors much larger than nominal levels. We find that this is mainly due to the underestimation of the centralized and normalized quantities of the ELR. By examining the connection between the ELR and the classical Hotelling's T-square statistic, we propose an effective calibration method which works much better in most situations. © 2012 The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo.

84878715752	Statistical process control for multistage processes with binary outputs	Statistical Process Control (SPC) including monitoring and diagnosis is very important and challenging for multistage processes with categorical data. This article proposes a Binary State Space Model (BSSM) for modeling multistage processes with binomial (binary) data and develops corresponding monitoring and diagnosis schemes by utilizing a hierarchical likelihood approach and directional information based on the BSSM. The proposed schemes not only provide an SPC solution that incorporates both interstage and intrastage correlations, but they also resolve the confounding issue in monitoring and diagnosis due to the cumulative effects from stage to stage. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes consistently outperform the existing χ

84878984870	A multivariate sign chart for monitoring process shape parameters	This paper develops a new multivariate nonparametric statistical process control (SPC) control chart for monitoring shape parameters, which is based on integrating a powerful multivariate spatial-sign test and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control scheme to on-line sequential monitoring. It has a strictly distribution-free property over a broad class of population models, which implies the incontrol run-length distribution can attain or is always very close to the nominal one when using the same control limit designed for the multivariate normal distribution. This proposed control chart possesses some other positive features: its computation speed is fast with a similar computation e?ort to the parametric multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) counterpart; it is easy to implement because only the multivariate median and the associated transformation matrix need to be estimated from the historical data before monitoring; it is efficient in detecting small or moderate shifts, when the process distribution is heavy tailed or skewed; it is also able to handle the case when the sample size is one and is effective in downward shifts. Simulation comparisons and a real-data example from a white-wine production process show that it performs quite well in applications.

84880294030	A directional multivariate sign EWMA control chart	In many applications the shift directions of observation vectors are limited, which allows focusing detection power on a limited subspace with improved sensitivity. This paper develops a new multivariate nonparametric statistical process control chart for monitoring location parameters, which is based on integrating a directional multivariate spatial-sign test and exponentially weighted moving average control scheme to on-line sequential monitoring. The computation speed of the proposed scheme is fast with a similar computation effort to its parametric counterpart, regression-adjusted control charts. It has a distribution-free property over a broad class of population models, which implies the in-control run length distribution can attain or is always very close to the nominal one when using the same control limit designed for a multivariate normal distribution. This proposed control chart possesses some other appealing features. Simulation studies show that it is efficient in detecting small or moderate shifts, when the process distribution is heavy-tailed or skewed. Finally, a specific SPC example, multistage process control, is also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © ICAQM 2013.

84884912600	Rank-based score tests for high-dimensional regression coefficients	This article is concerned with simultaneous tests on linear regression coefficients in high-dimensional settings. When the dimensionality is larger than the sample size, the classic F-test is not applicable since the sample covariance matrix is not invertible. Recently, [5] and [17] proposed testing procedures by excluding the inverse term in F-statistics. However, the efficiency of such F-statistic-based methods is adversely affected by outlying observations and heavy tailed distributions. To overcome this issue, we propose a robust score test based on rank regression. The asymptotic distributions of the proposed test statistic under the high-dimensional null and alternative hypotheses are established. Its asymptotic relative efficiency with respect to [17]'s test is closely related to that of the Wilcoxon test in comparison with the t-test. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the proposed procedure with other existing testing procedures and show that our procedure is generally more robust in both sizes and powers.

84888433381	Monitoring poisson count data with probability control limits when sample sizes are time varying	This article considers the problem of monitoring Poisson count data when sample sizes are time varying without assuming a priori knowledge of sample sizes. Traditional control charts, whose control limits are often determined before the control charts are activated, are constructed based on perfect knowledge of sample sizes. In practice, however, future sample sizes are often unknown. Making an inappropriate assumption of the distribution function could lead to unexpected performance of the control charts, for example, excessive false alarms in the early runs of the control charts, which would in turn hurt an operator's confidence in valid alarms. To overcome this problem, we propose the use of probability control limits, which are determined based on the realization of sample sizes online. The conditional probability that the charting statistic exceeds the control limit at present given that there has not been a single alarm before can be guaranteed to meet a specified false alarm rate. Simulation studies show that our proposed control chart is able to deliver satisfactory run length performance for any time-varying sample sizes. The idea presented in this article can be applied to any effective control charts such as the exponentially weighted moving average or cumulative sum chart. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84891310205	Monitoring general linear profiles using simultaneous confidence sets schemes	In this article we consider the quality of a process which can be characterized by a general linear profile. For monitoring the general linear profile, we mimic the charting scheme for the distribution of a univariate quality characteristic by using two individual charts for the mean and variance of the profile, respectively. For monitoring the mean of the profile, based on the concept of simultaneous confidence set we propose a novel exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart, which takes the features of the entire profile into account. Then this chart is used together with an EWMA chart for the variance of the profile to monitor the whole profile. Simulation studies show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed monitoring scheme. Furthermore, a systematic diagnostic method in the literature is utilized to find the change point location and to identify the parameters of change in the process. Finally, we use an example from semiconductor manufacturing industry to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed monitoring scheme and diagnostic method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84892366121	A self-starting control chart for high-dimensional short-run processes	A key challenge in using a traditional Hotellings chart with high-dimensionality measurements is that monitoring cannot begin until after the number of observations exceeds the dimensionality of the measurements, and the detection sensitivity to early shifts is reduced after that point until a substantial amount of observations has been accumulated. This is especially important with short-run processes where the measurements have high dimensionality. This article proposes a chart that allows monitoring with the second observation regardless of the dimensionality and reduces the average run length in detecting early shifts in high-dimensionality measurements. The proposed control chart can start monitoring quite early before considerable reference data are collected during the initial stage of production. A change point estimate is also available from our procedure, which is shown consistent for locating the correct change point. Both simulation results and an industry example show the effectiveness of the proposed control chart for monitoring short-run processes with high dimensionality. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

84892369814	A simple categorical chart for detecting location shifts with ordinal information	Traditional control charts for monitoring attribute data usually neglect the order among the attribute levels, such as good, marginal and bad, of a categorical factor. Such order may be reflected by an underlying continuous variable, which determines the level of the categorical factor by classifying it according to some thresholds in the latent continuous scale. This paper exploits this ordinal information and proposes a control chart for detecting location shifts in the latent variable based on merely the attribute level counts, regardless of the continuous values of the latent variable. The proposed ordinal chart is very simple to construct and enjoys the same setting as conventional categorical charts. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of this simple ordinal categorical chart. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.

84893709080	Monitoring correlated profile and multivariate quality characteristics	Monitoring multivariate quality characteristics is very common in production and service environment. Therefore, many control charts have been suggested by authors for monitoring multivariate processes. In another side, profile monitoring is a new approach in the area of statistical process control. In this approach, the quality of a product or a process is characterized by a relation between one response variable and one or more independent variables. In practice, sometimes the quality of a product or a process is represented by a correlated profile and multivariate quality characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, there is no method for monitoring this type of quality characteristics. Note that monitoring correlated profile and multivariate quality characteristics separately leads to misleading results. In this article, we specifically focus on correlated simple linear profile and multivariate normal quality characteristics and propose a method using multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart to monitor the correlated profile and multivariate quality characteristics simultaneously. The performance of the proposed control chart is evaluated by simulation studies in terms of average run length criterion. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a real case in the electronics industry. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84893943056	Multivariate binomial/multinomial control chart	This article considers statistical process control for multivariate categorical processes. In particular, there is a focus on multivariate binomial and multivariate multinomial processes. More and more real applications involve categorical quality characteristics, which cannot be measured on a continuous scale. These characteristic factors usually correlate with each other, indicating a need for multivariate charting techniques. However, there is a scarcity of research on monitoring multivariate categorical data, and most existing methods lack robustness for some deficiencies. This article reports the use of log-linear models for characterizing the relationship among categorical factors that are adapted into a framework of multivariate binomial and multivariate multinomial distributions. A Phase II control chart is proposed that is robust in efficiently detecting various shifts, especially those in interaction effects representing the dependence among factors. Numerical simulations and a real data example demonstrate the effectiveness of the chart. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84897115273	A new multivariate EWMA scheme for monitoring covariance matrices	To monitor covariance matrices, most of the existing control charts are based on some omnibus test and thus usually are not powerful when one is interested in detecting shifts that occur in a small number of elements of the covariance matrix. A new multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart is developed for the monitor of the covariance matrices by integrating the classical -norm-based test with a maximum-norm-based test. Numerical studies show that the new control chart affords more balanced performance under various shift directions than the existing ones and is thus an effective tool for multivariate SPC applications. The implementation of the proposed control chart is demonstrated with an example from the health care industry. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

84897767591	Multivariate sign-based high-dimensional tests for sphericity	This article concerns tests for sphericity in cases where the data dimension is larger than the sample size. The existing multivariate sign-based procedure (Hallin & Paindaveine, 2006) for sphericity is not robust with respect to high dimensionality, producing tests with Type I error rates that are much larger than the nominal levels. This is mainly due to bias from estimating the location parameter. We develop a correction that makes the existing test statistic robust with respect to high dimensionality, and show that the proposed test statistic is asymptotically normal under elliptical distributions. The proposed method allows the dimensionality to increase as the square of the sample size. Simulations demonstrate that it has good size and power in a wide range of settings. © 2013 Biometrika Trust.

Evaluation of the average run length (ARL) or average time to signal (ATS) plays an important role in the design of control charts and performance comparison. In this paper, we review several basic and popular procedures, including the Markov chain and integral equation methods for computing ARL, ATS and associated run length distributions for cumulative sum charts, exponentially weighted moving average charts and combined control charts, respectively. Some important references and key formulations are provided for practitioners. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

84902489652	Nonparametric maximum likelihood approach to multiple change-point problems	In multiple change-point problems, different data segments often follow different distributions, for which the changes may occur in the mean, scale or the entire distribution from one segment to another.Without the need to know the number of change-points in advance, we propose a nonparametric maximum likelihood approach to detecting multiple change-points. Our method does not impose any parametric assumption on the underlying distributions of the data sequence, which is thus suitable for detection of any changes in the distributions. The number of change-points is determined by the Bayesian information criterion and the locations of the change-points can be estimated via the dynamic programming algorithm and the use of the intrinsic order structure of the likelihood function. Under some mild conditions, we show that the new method provides consistent estimation with an optimal rate. We also suggest a prescreening procedure to exclude most of the irrelevant points prior to the implementation of the nonparametric likelihood method. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance of identifying multiple change-points in terms of estimation accuracy and computation time. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.
