84937896215	Hypervelocity impact characteristics of basalt fiber woven/al-mesh combination bumper stuffed in whipple shield	Basalt fiber woven is a new type of material for shield of spacecrafts when subjected to hypervelocity impact of space debris because of its high specific strength, high specific modulus and other favorable characteristics. Four shield structures stuffed by basalt fiber woven/al-mesh combination bumpers were presented under the concept of light-weight shield structure. Their shield performances were compared through hypervelocity impact experiments using two-stage light gas gun. The projectile launched was 2017 aluminum spheres with their diameters being 3.97mm and 4.76mm respectively. And the impact velocity was chosen to be 2km/s with a 0 degree incident angle. The damage of the bumpers included and the rear wall were examined thoroughly after impact and compared to each other to evaluate the shield performance of different configurations. The experimental results indicated that at the impact velocity tested, the "6/3 shield" has the best shield performance among the four shield structures.

1842781807	Crater forming process by liquid drop impacting liquid multi-layer target	In this article, the experiment of the impacting by liquid drops against liquid multi-layer target was carried out. From the results, a theoretical analysis was made to study the principle of the crater forming process. The crater was formed only in the first layer of the liquid target within certain impacting energy. The interface energy was one of the important parameter of crater forming process if there were dissolution phenomena between the liquid multi-layers. According to energy conversation and the analysis of the impacting energy transformation, the equation of the cavity diameters was obtained. It was found that the results of experiment agreed with that of theoretical analysis very well. The results of simulating experiments predicted that using the metal multi-layers construction would enhance the protection capability, which can be used as the reference for protection design of aircrafts.

30544441499	Numerical simulation investigation in behavior of AL-foams structure under hypervelocity impact	The existing Equation of State and Strength Model, which regard foams as homogeneous medium, can't exactly describe the characterizations of metallic foams because the pore is big enough not to be ignored compared with projectile or bumper. In the article, Foams were regarded as discontinuous medium and pores of different size and position, fitted to some distribution and filled with void, were created in the metal to model the real geometry. Naturally material parameters needed for metallic foams are just those of original metal material, which have been developed extensively and successfully. A 3-dimansional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) program with the foam model was developed. Simulations of normal impact on double bumpers, consisting of aluminum bumper and open-cell aluminum foam bumper, and aluminum rear wall were carried out and compared with test data. Good agreement was obtained. Then, the behavior of different Al-foams was investigated by numerical simulations.

Two different Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors were used to detect the arrival time and signals of the hits. Hypervelocity Impacts were generated with a two-stage light-gas gun firing small Aluminum ball projectiles (4mm, 6.4mm). In the impact studies, the signal was dominated by a large extensional mode with little flexural mode component detected by the conventional crossing threshold signal method with Wideband sensors. The results make clears that the location obtained by the resonant R15 sensors are superior to these obtained by wideband sensors. All impacts generated very large amplitude AE signals, which propagated as plate modes. The signals also consisted of much higher Frequency. The multi-source impact simultaneously was observed during the impacts in that it is difficult for the current conventional localized-algorithm to locate the sources.

Basalt fiber is one of the high strength, lightweight, and flexibility materials. The aim of this study was to study the damage of lightweight Whipple shield composed of basalt-glass fibers woven and Al plat. High velocity impact tests were carried out by the non-powder two-stage light gas gun facilities at Hypervelocity Impact Research Center in Harbin Institute of Technology.

34547210677	Investigation into damage of aluminum gas-filled pressure vessels under hypervelocity impact	Impacts of meteoroids and space debris on pressure vessels can have detrimental consequences for any mission. Depending on the parameters of the impacting particle and the characteristic of the vessel, the damages can range from relatively uncritical craters in the vessel's surface to the catastrophic bursting of vessels, which besides the loss of vessel may result in severe secondary damages to surrounding components. In order to investigate failure mechanisms of thin-walled aluminum pressure vessels under hypervelocity impact of space debris, a non-powder two-stage light gas gun was used to launch Al-sphere projectiles impacting on unshielded and shielded vessels. Damage patterns and mechanisms leading to catastrophic rupture are discussed. Experimental results indicate that the impact kinetic energy of the projectile and the gas pressure in the vessel have an important effect on the damage modes of the vessel. On the one hand, high pressure gas can lead to a vessel blast. On the other hand, high pressure gas can mitigate the impact of the debris cloud on the rear wall of the vessel. Catastrophic rupture of unshielded gas-filled vessels can be avoided when the impact energy is less than a certain limit value. When the bumper is perforated, damage of shielded pressure vessel might be fatal for vessels with high gas pressure.

Experiments of hypervelocity impact on single-sheet plate were performed to obtain the AE waves with supersonic sensors, and the spectrum was analyzed with wavelet transform. The results indicated that in the range of impact velocity of 1-4 km/s, the AE waves from hypervelocity impact mainly contains the plate waves with the modes of A0, S0 and S2. The waves of A0 mode weakens with the increase of velocity while the waves of other two modes strengthen. The waves from impact induced cavatition contain more A0 mode while the waves from impact induced penetration contain more S0 and S2 modes. With the concept of normal impact and radial expanding effects, the results above were illustrated.

The penetration hole characteristics of single-wall shields and the ricochet characteristics of projectiles were analyzed. The equations for the hole size of oblique hypervelocity impact penetration into thin aluminum alloy sheets were derived. Impact velocities were 2.58 km/s, 3.56 km/s and 4.31 km/s respectively.

When an aluminum alloy sphere of 3.97 mm diameter impacted at hypervelocity on the thin aluminum alloy sheet of 1 mm thickness at different angles, the critical impact angle was between 30Â° and 40Â° in which projectile leaped away from the target partially. As impact angle increased, the maximum ricochet angle decreased, and the distributing area of ricochet debris cloud reduced.

As the bumper thickness increased, the penetration hole diameter of bumper increased, the impact damage at central area of the rear wall mitigated, and the larger crater moved from centre to circumference. When impact velocity exceeds the velocity of projectile fragmentation, two crater dense areas will be brought in rear wall of AL-Whipple shield.

The stress-strain curves for the composites along transverse direction were obtained at strain rates ranging from 900/s to 1500/s, and compared with the quasi-static compression test results. The effect of strain rate on compressive strength and modulus was discussed. Based on the SHPB hypothesis as well as pulse shaping technique, the specimen was made in equivalent stress and constant strain rate over the course of experiment. The results show that the compressive strength and modulus are sensitive to strain rate. The dynamic strength and modulus of the composites exhibit considerable increase as compared with the quasi-static values. The effect of strain rate on the failure mode was also analyzed.

57449110149	Experimental investigation of space effect on damage of aluminum dual-wall structure by hypervelocity impact	In order to study the damage characteristics of spacecraft protection structure by hypervelocity impact of space debris, a non-powder two-stage light gas gun was used to launch Al-sphere projectiles to impact the aluminum dual-wall structure. The sphere diameter was 3.97 mm, the impact velocities were (2.58 Â± 0.08) km/s, (3.54 Â± 0.25) km/s and (4.35 Â± 0.11) km/s respectively. The spaces between bumper and rear wall were in the range of 10 mm to 100 mm. Damage modes on the rear wall of aluminum dual-wall structure in different impact velocity ranges were obtained by experiments. The results show that the crater distribution on the rear wall varies with different spaces between bumper and rear wall when the impact velocity is a constant. With the increasing space between bumper and rear wall, the spray area on the back of bumper and the cratered area on the rear wall increase, and the diffusivity of crater distribution on the rear wall decrease.

56949102758	Analysis of debris clouds produced by impact of aluminum spheres with aluminum sheets	Results of two-stage light gas gun testing of two diameters of aluminum spheres impacting 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm thickness aluminum plates were described in this paper. Impact velocities for these tests were between 3.16 km/s and 5.17 km/s. The components of debris cloud and damage patterns in the witness plate were described. The morphologic features of debris clouds such as shape, axial velocity, and diametral velocity were discussed. The size and number of fragments in the internal structure of debris cloud were not evaluated quantitatively, but described qualitatively. As a result, the shape of the leading face of the internal structure of debris cloud appeared to be sensitive to impact velocity, but not t/D ratio (bumper-thickness-to-projectile diameter ratio). The point at which the maximum diameter of the external bubble of debris cloud occurred had a same half spray angle of 30 degree and the last fragments ejected from bumper had a same half spray angle of 42 degree for each test. Fragments after the point mentioned above in the external bubble of debris cloud were ejected as several chains, the number of which is sensitive to impact velocity, but not t/D ratio. The changes in normalized velocity of the measurement points at debris cloud appeared the same trend as conclusions presented by Piekutowski except for the normalized internal structure expanding velocity. A certain value of t/D ratio, at two sides of which, the normalized internal structure expanding velocity appeared different variety trend existed. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

56949107609	Ballistic limit equations in ballistic and shatter regions	Ballistic limit equations are used to predict the damage of spacecraft subjected to impacts by space debris and meteoroids. This paper presents two new ballistic limit equations for impact velocities in the ballistic and shatter regions, respectively. The methodology used to develop the two ballistic limit equations involves the energy balance law and Cohen's debris cratering model. A very often form for ballistic limit equations based on the crater depth in a semi-infinite target was used for the both equations. The limit velocity between the ballistic and shatter regions was expressed as a non-dimensional equation in this paper.

The projectile diameters range from 2.00 mm to 6.35 mm and impact velocities range from 1.50 km/s to 6.98 km/s. The impact angle is 0Â°for all the tests. Crater distribution modes on the rear wall of aluminum dual-sheet structure by hypervelocity impact of AL-spheres in different impact velocity ranges are obtained. Crater distribution characteristics on the rear wall are analyzed. The forecast equations for crater distribution on the rear wall of aluminum dual-sheet structure by hypervelocity normal impact are derived. The results show that crater distribution on the rear wall is a circle area under hypervelocity normal impact. As projectile diameter, impact velocity and shielding space increases, crater distribution area increases. The critical fragmentation velocity of impact projectile is an important factor affecting the crater distribution modes on the rear wall.

The momentum of debris clouds and ejecta are necessary to create the debris clouds and ejecta theoretical models. 54 numerical simulations were performed using the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) technique in AUTODYN-2D, in which 6.35 mm diameter of 1100-O aluminum spheres impacted six thicknesses of 6061-T6 aluminum sheets at velocities ranging from 1.0 km/s to 5.0 km/s. Using the data from the numerical simulations, two respective regression models are developed for characterizing the momentum of debris clouds and ejecta produced by impacts with 1.0 km/s â¤ v â¤ 5.0 km/s, 0.5 mm â¤ Î´ â¤ 3.0 mm. In the two models, the independent variables are the impact velocity, v, and the thickness of the sphere, t, while the dependent variables are the momentum ratios (ratios of debris clouds momentum and ejecta momentum to sphere momentum). The effects of v and Î´ on the momentum of debris clouds and ejecta are investigated. Seven additional numerical simulations in the same way as above were carried out and values obtained are compared with the experimental data of NASA to evaluate the performance of the simulation.

Dynamic stress-strain curves at the strain rates ranging from 1250/s to 2500/s were obtained, compared to the quasi-static results. Based on the SHPB hypothesis, pulse shaping technique was employed to maintain the specimen in the equilibrium and uniform deformation state over the testing course.

The flash radiographs of the impact-induced debris clouds were presented and analyzed to describe the features of deformation and fragmentation of the aluminum spheres. The propagation of the stress waves in the aluminum spheres was qualitatively explained, and the three statuses of spheres were observed under the different impact conditions. In the plastic deformation stage, the deformation of the aluminum spheres gets more distinct as the impact velocity and the sheet thickness increase. The critical impact velocity at which the principle part of the aluminum sphere began to shatter decreases with the increase of the sheet thickness, and this velocity is independent of the sheet thickness more than a certain value. In the complete fragmentation stage, with the increase of the impact velocity, the radial velocities and the fragment number for the principle part of sphere increase, and the fragment sizes decrease.

The results of experiment showed strain rate sensitivity at low strain rate portion (0-800/s) while by increasing the strain rate (3400/s-6500/s); the samples no longer showed noticeable rate sensitivity. Dynamic strain-stress curves showed clearly initial peak strength, flat flow potion and totally compressed ascending part process while a littler peak was appeared during the flat flow portion. Different folding process can be found during dynamic compression for one and two layered honeycomb cells by high speed camera. A numerical model was developed using LS-DYNA software, for investigating the different deformation modes under various strain rates. A bi-linear elastic-plastic constitutive model was utilized to simulate plastic deformation and in-stability status of multi-layered nickel based honeycomb under dynamic compression. In this work, different finite element models were used to investigate dynamic crushing strength as a function of cell wall thickness and the number of sandwich layers.

77953485584	Distribution of debris cloud caused by hypervelocity impact on AL-foam shield	It's important to improve and optimize the shields used to protect the manned elements against impacts of micro-meteoroids and orbital debris. Tests have identified that metallic foams have a good shielding performance against M/OD hypervelocity impact, so metallic foams may play a key role in the structural design of manned spacecraft and satellite in the future. To investigate the distribution of debris clouds caused by impact on Al-foam shields compared to solid aluminum, numerical simulations were carried out in the velocity range of 3-9km/s at normal incidence angle. The distributions of mass and kinetic energy of debris cloud were obtained at different angles. The mass distribution of debris cloud caused by impact on Al-foam bumper shows two peaks at different velocities within 0-45 degrees. While the kinetic energy distribution of debris cloud shows only one peak within 0-15 degrees. The mass and kinetic energy of debris cloud caused by impact on Al-foam bumper are more dispersive at higher velocities than those of solid aluminum bumper. This feature will help to decrease the risk of spacecrafts against space debris with high speed.

In this article a meso-structure geometric model for metallic foams is set up simulating their manufacturing process, and hypervelocity impact numerical simulations are conducted by self-programmed smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The impact is studied of the mean pore diameter and porosity ratio of the Al-foam stuffed structure on the shield performance. The results indicate that the mean pore diameter has greater effect on the shield performance of a foam-stuffed structure. Generally, shield performance is better with smaller pore diameters. The porosity ratio has greater effect only at ultrahigh speeds, and there exists an optimum value for it. Comparative analysis of the characteristics of the debris clouds yielded by the Al-foam of different geometrical parameters demonstrates that if the perpendicular momentum of the debris cloud is spread more effectively, then the structure has better shield performance.

From SEM analysis: the inner part of RPC will have a series of physical chemistry changing, such as: micro-crack generation, C-S-H gel damage.

Under the assumption that the viscosity coefficient is a power law function of the rate of effective plastic strain, it was obtained through dimension match that the crack tip field possesses power law singularity. And the singularity exponent is uniquely determined by the power law exponent in the supposed viscosity coefficient. The elasticity, plasticity and viscosity of material at crack-tip only can be matched reasonably under linear-hardening condition. Variations of crack tip field characters according to each material parameter were discussed by means of numerical computation. The stress intensity is dominated by the material viscosity whereas the hardening coefficient has less significant influence on tip field. Furthermore, the solution can be transformed to the elastic-nonlinear-viscous one of Hui and Riedel if the limit case of zero hardening coefficient is considered.

79956219878	Elastic-viscoplastic analysis of the tip field of a mode I quasi-static propagating crack under plane stress condition	The analysis of crack tip field is more complex in creeping materials because of the influence of rate-sensitivity. An elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model is adopted and a rate-sensitive constitutive relationship is derived for elastic-perfectly-plastic materials, under the assumption that the viscosity coefficient is a power function of the rate of effective plastic strain. It is obtained through dimension match that the crack tip field possesses power singularity, and the singularity exponent is uniquely determined by the power exponent in the supposed viscosity coefficient. The governing equation of quasi-static propagating crack tip field under plane stress condition is derived, and the boundary conditions are given for mode I crack. Numerical solution of governing equation is conducted by using two-parameter shooting method in combination with possible value range for each material parameter, and variations of crack tip field characters according to each material parameter are discussed. The results indicate that the stress field at crack tip is continuous when the material complies with the perfect-plastic rule, without the irrational discontinuity line that exists in some non-viscosity solutions. The stress intensity is dominated by the material viscosity and the Poisson's ratio has no influence on tip field. Moreover, there exists no elastic unloading zone within the tip field.

The aluminum matrix syntactic foam was fabricated by pressure infiltration technique, which had a porosity ratio of 45%. The energy absorption capability of syntactic foam exceeded 70% under dynamic loading versus under quasi-static loading. During the deformation process, the syntactic foam exhibited a well energy absorption capability due to the reduction of original pores in syntactic foam accused by cenospheres rupture.

For a given stable T-S fuzzy system, our attention is focused on the construction of a reduced-order model which not only approximates the original system well with a Hankel norm performance but is also translated into a lower-dimensional system. By employing the modified delay partitioning method, a delay-dependent sufficient condition is developed for the asymptotic stability with a Hankel norm error performance for the error system. Then, the Hankel norm approximation problem is solved by employing the convex linearization approach, which casts the reduced-order model construction into a convex optimization problem subject to linear matrix inequality constraints. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Â© 2013 The Franklin Institute.

The dynamic compression behavior of the composites was investigated by using split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The microstructure of the specimen after compression was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and the damage patterns of the hollow microsphere was primarily studied. A single-cell model of the composites was established, and the dynamic compression process of the single-cell was simulated by using the LS-DYNA explicit finite element software. With dynamic loading, mechanical behavior of hollow microsphere/aluminum alloy composites showed three typical stages: elastic deformation, plastic collapse and densification. With the increasing of the decrement, the hollow microsphere appeared cracks along the meridians, gradually transitioned into the fragmentation of the equator, and eventually collapsed.

84886314347	Numerical simulation of debris cloud characteristics of the mesh shields	The hypervelocity impact interaction of the sphere projectile with continuous shield and mesh shield, which were of the same thickness or area density, was investigated numerically. The study was aimed at mastering the hypervelocity impact characteristics of the mesh shield and applying effectively it in development of lightweight shields. The study involved the differences in the morphology and the distribution of momentum, velocity and mass of the debris clouds generated by impacting two kinds of shields. The calculations show that the morphologies of the debris cloud vary with the impact locations when a projectile impact the mesh shield, and there is the linear distribution of debris in the front of debris cloud. Comparison between the continuous shield and the mesh shield with the same thickness, the maximum of momentum density in the mesh shield is higher than that in the continuous shield, while the maximums of momentum density are almost near in the two kinds of shields with the same area density. The mesh shield does not effectively slow the penetration velocity of projectile, but can break it up. The dynamical response of the projectile varies with the shields. Impacting the mesh shield, the main part of debris is at the rear end of the debris cloud, which is different from the case of continuous shield.

84888104573	Continuum damage mechanics model of glass/epoxy composite laminate under in-plane shear loading	In order to investigate the in-plane shear behaviour of S2-glass/epoxy composite laminate, continum damage mechanics (CDM) model involving elasticity and plasticity for S2-glass/epoxy laminate under in-plane shear loading was studied in this paper. Typical in-plane tensile shear tests of the composite were conducted, two types of CDM models were established based on the plane stress assumption and the parameters were identified. The former CDM model considered no plasticity while the later one did. Both two CDM models were coded to VUMAT through ABAQUS/Explicit, finite element analysis (FEA) for in-plane shear behaviour of the composite was conducted by them following experimental tests. The results of FEA were compared with experiments and the influence of plasticity on the in-plane shear behaviour of the composite was discussed. Element types on the results of FEA were also analyzed. The results show that the CDM model considering no plasticity can exactly predict the failure strength of S2-glass/epoxy composite under in-plane shear loading, but it can not well predict the nonlinear mechanical behaviour. However, when coupled with isotropic plasticity criteria, the CDM model can perfectly predict the nonlinear mechanical behavior, and the result of failure strength is also acceptable compared with the experimental results. The CDM models can also be used for FEA simulation by shell elements, but the results of load-deflection curve are a little lower than that using plane stress elements because of the transverse shear behaviour of shell elements. Moreover, reduced integration method is found to be beneficial for FEA simulation.

84889039553	Experimental investigation on normal and oblique ballistic impact behavior of fiber metal laminates	In this work, the normal (0 ) and oblique (30 and 45 ) ballistic impact behavior of glass fiber-reinforced aluminum laminates (fiber metal laminate, FMLs) impacted by a rigid cylindrical projectile (with a flat nose) has been investigated from an experimental point of view. The ballistic impact tests were conducted on the FMLs using a one-stage gas gun at different impact angels, i.e. 0 , 30 and 45. A high-speed camera was used to capture and record the experimental images and data during the impacting process. Different failure patterns were observed in the FMLs under oblique and normal impact, with the differences concentrated on the initial crack (in the back surface) and plugging damage (in both the front and back surface). The angular change in direction of the projectile during perforation was only observed during oblique impact tests while the maximum value of the angular change was observed when the impact velocity was close to its ballistic limit velocity. In addition, the angular change decreases with increasing impact velocity and is almost constant when the value of vi/v50 reaches a critical value. It can also be observed from the impact test results (both normal and oblique impacts) that FMLs exhibited the lowest ballistic limit velocity when the impact angle was close to 30. In particular, normal impact shows a higher ballistic limit velocity than that of oblique impact while the ballistic limit velocity at impact angle 45 is slightly higher than that at 30.

84890829579	Experimental investigation of protection performance about aluminum mesh bumper by high-velocity normal impact	The high-velocity normal impacts of space debris on bumper of spacecrafts were studied through a two-stage light gas gun launching 2017-T4 aluminum spheres to impact on 5052 aluminum mesh shield structure. The resist capability of aluminum mesh shield against high-velocity impact was discussed. For the same areal density, the size effect and arrangement effect on the protection performance of the filled layer were analyzed. Impact velocities of Al-spheres were varied between 2.90 and 4.95 km/s in this study. The diameters of projectiles were 3.97 and 6.35 mm respectively. The impact angle was 0Â°. The results indicated that the primary capability of the 2A12 aluminum plate comminuting projectile is better than that of 5052 aluminum mesh when the areal density is constant, but as the filled medium, the 5052 aluminum mesh layer provides better protection for the rear wall than 2A12 aluminum plate. In a certain wire diameter range, the 5052 aluminum mesh with smaller wire diameter has better protection performance. Al mesh-Al plate filled layer can break up the projectile to a more uniform size than Al plate-Al mesh filled layer.

84891329497	Rate-dependent constitutive model coupled with temperature softening for open-cell aluminum foam	Both quasi-static compressive tests and dynamic loading tests on the open-cell aluminum foam made of 6061 aluminum alloy were firstly conducted. The Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar(SHPB) apparatus was used to perform the dynamic loading tests. The rate-dependent constitutive model for the open-cell aluminum foam was then studied. Based on the empirical constitutive model proposed by Sherwood for polyurethane foam, a new function was found to analyze the three-stage characteristic of quasi-static stress-strain curve of the aluminum foam. Moreover, the temperature softening was also modified. Thus a new strain rate hardening constitutive model coupled with temperature softening for the open-cell aluminum foam was obtained. Finally, both Taylor impact tests and finite element analysis (FEA) were conducted to verify the new constitutive model and the results show that the model was reliable.

84892548116	Numerical simulation of al sphere fragmentation under high-velocity normal impacting aluminum mesh bumper	Numerical simulation of aluminum sphere projectile high-velocity impacting aluminum mesh bumper was conducted with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) arithmetic of LS-DYNA. The relationship between the debris clouds characteristic of projectile and the impact position on aluminum mesh bumper was studied. The effect on fragmentation of projectile from different combination mode of aluminum mesh bumper was analyzed. The results indicated that the debris clouds configuration from aluminum sphere projectile impacting aluminum mesh bumper was different with the different impact position on aluminum mesh bumper. The debris clouds as palpus was found in the front of projectile debris clouds. Some local kinetic energy concentrated appeared in the debris clouds. When a wire across point position was impacted, projectile debris clouds expand to form film configuration, and debris clouds distribution was more uniform. When aluminum mesh bumper was combined with interleaving mode, projectile debris clouds had more diffuse area and less residual kinetic energy. Aluminum mesh bumper combined with interleaving mode was helpful in enhancing the protection performance of shields.

84904046728	Tests and numerical simulation on low velocity impact performance of fiber metal laminates	In order to investigate the low velocity impact performance of fiber metal laminates (FML) using the finite element numerical simulation method, a modified continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model was established and the numerical simulation of low velocity drop weight impact test on FML was conducted, the numerical simulation results were compared with the experimental results. The drop weight tests were performed with impact energies of 5.11 J and 10.33 J, respectively. The impact load, displacement and energy history for each test were obtained, thus the dynamic response and the damage pattern of FML were studied. Based on a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model, the plastic deformation and compression stiffness attenuation of S2-glass/epoxy composite were supplemented as well as fiber tensile failure property, thus a new CDM model was established. The new CDM model was used to describe the constitutive and damage model of the S2-glass/epoxy composite in the FML, and was coded in user material subroutine (VUMAT). The numerical simulation of FML under drop weight impact test was then conducted through ABAQUS/Explicit solver. The results show that the main damage patterns on the rear surface of FML are bulging and cracking when impacted by low energy, and the peak displacement increases with increasing impact energy, while peak impact load increases with increasing impact energy before perforation. The dynamic response of FML is predicted well using finite element analysis when the S2-glass/epoxy composite layers are described by the modified CDM model. It is also found that the fiber tensile failure of the second composite layer is more serious than the first layer's through the finite element numerical simulation results.

84904683529	Damage investigation of woven of basalt ceramics fibers and Al-projectile in hypervelocity impact	Basalt ceramics fiber is one of the high strength materials to be noticed in recent years. The perforation property of woven of basalt ceramics fibers and micro-damage of basalt filament and aluminum projectile in hypervelocity impact were studied. The perforation equation for hypervelocity impact on woven of basalt ceramics fibers were developed from experimental data. The damage reasons of basalt filaments were researched according to the damage form of the cross section of the filament. The molten materials of basalt filaments and aluminum projectiles caused by hypervelocity impact were observed from the digital microscope. The initial melting velocities of basalt fibers and aluminum projectiles were affirmed. The study is beneficial to the application of woven of basalt ceramics fibers to the space debris shielding.

84907095022	A brief introduction on NASA's two stage light gas guns	With the increasing frequency of human spaceflight activities, space debris population is increasing year after year. Nowadays space debris impacts are more and more dangerous to astronauts doing extravehicular maneuvers and to high-pressure vessels and toxic aerospace materials carried aboard spacecraft. The protection strategy against the impact of millimeter space debris is mainly by shielding. In order to design effective shielding for spacecraft and to evaluate the risk posed by debris and meteoroids, we must be able to perform tests in the laboratory. Hypervelocity impact testing has some extreme requirements. The core of the problem is to find a way to launch projectiles at speeds more than seven times faster than the fastest bullet, to measure how fast the projectile is traveling before impact, and to take pictures of impact event that lasts only a few microseconds. Launching projectiles at velocities high enough to simulate orbital debris impacts requires some remarkable equipment called â two stage light gas gunâ. The technology is one of the most important factors in the improvement of experimental ability, and therefore it is considered as a significant indicator to evaluate the experimental level of a laboratory, or even a country. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the leading agency in the aerospace area in America as well as in the world, is supported by several laboratories with the ability of performing hypervelocity impact tests, where the two stage light gas guns play a critical role. The White Sands Test Facility (WSTF), located at remote desert foothills of New Mexico, works in close partnership with NASA Johnson Space Center Hypervelocity Impact Technology Facility (HITF). HITF determines the risk of spacecraft posed by space debris, and then designs spacecraft shields based on probability of impact and spacecraft geometry. HITF also builds and sends target shields to WSTF for ballistic-limit, verification testing and accordingly analyzes the results. Other spacecraft materials and components are targeted too, as well as toxic and explosive cargo, including fuel. The WSTF Hypervelocity Impact Testing Program assesses candidate shield materials with the help of two stage light gas guns. These guns shoot projectiles at hypervelocities up to roughly six times faster than the fastest rifle bullet, and mimic the impact of real space debris traveling at even higher speeds. Some other laboratories in America also present a remarkable performance in improving the ability of two stage light gas guns, such as NASA Ames Research Center, McDonnell-Douglas Corporation, General Motor Corporation, Naval Ordnance Laboratory, and United States Naval Research Laboratory.

10044235277	Investigation into debris cloud characterizations for oblique hypervelocity impact of projectiles on bumper	All long-duration spacecraft in low-earth-orbit are subject to high velocity impacts by meteoroids and space debris. Such impacts are expected to occur at non-normal incidence angles and can cause severe damage to the spacecraft and its external flight-critical systems and possibly lead to catastrophic failure of the spacecraft. In order to ensure crew safety and proper function of internal and external spacecraft systems, the characteristics of a debris cloud generated by such impacts must be known. An analytical model is therefore developed for the characterization of the penetration and ricochet debris clouds created by the hypervelocity impact of an aluminum spherical projectile on an aluminum plate. This model employs normal and oblique shock wave theory to characterize the penetration and ricochet processes. The prediction results of center-of-mass trajectory and leading velocity of penetration and ricochet debris clouds are obtained and compared with numerical and experimental results in figures.

84921458051	Characteristic analysis of acoustic emission signals caused by debris cloud impact	In order to understand the characteristics of acoustic emission signals caused by hypervelocity space debris impacting spacecraft with shields, a two-stage light gas gun was used to launch sphere projectiles to impact an aluminum-alloy Whipple shield, the induced acoustic emission signals were acquired, and analyzed by wavelet packet technology and energy entropy theory. The experimental results indicate that, the initial velocity of projectile, bumper thickness and projectile diameter are important factors to decide the form of debris cloud and characteristics of acoustic emission signals. The wavelet packet energy entropy could be used to describe the frequency complexity of debris cloud impact signals. When the initial velocity of projectile increases in the broken section (3-7 km/s), along with which the projectile breaks more completely and the energy entropy of acoustic emission signals increases. Under the experimental conditions, the bumper thickness has greater influence on energy entropy values than the projectile diameter. The wavelet packet energy entropy is helpful to estimate the initial velocity of projectile and the maximum impact damage region, combined with the predicted curve from the Christiansen ballistic limit equation, the damage pattern recognition of the bulkhead could be assessed.
