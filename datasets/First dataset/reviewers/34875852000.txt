19944429154	The expression of VEGF and VEGF receptor (Flk-1) in hydatidiform mole and its significance	Objective: To inspect the expression of VEGF and its receptor (Flk-1) in the normal villous and hydatidiform mole tissue, and to discuss its significance in the development, transformation and malignancy of hydatidiform mole. Methods: The expression of VEGF and VEGF receptor (Flk-1) in hydatidiform mole was investigated using immunohistological staining method. Results: There was no significant correlation between the expression of VEGF and Flk-1 in hydatidiform mole specimen and its clinical parameters, such as gestational week, times of parturition and pathological classification. However, VEGF and Flk-1 could both promote the development of blood vessel and enhanced the invasive capability of trophoblatic cells in the mole. Conclusion: VEGF and Flk-1 can be a new index which could reflect the biological activities of trophoblatic cells and help us judge the progression and prognosis of this disease.

33644808802	The expression of E-cadherin and Laminin in gestational trophoblastic diseases and their significance	Objective: To explore the expressions of E-cadherin (E-cad) and Laminin (LN) in gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD) and their significance. Methods: The expression of E-cadherin and LN in 74 cases gestational diseases was detected by immunohistochemical (SP) method. Results: The normal expression rates of E-cad and the strong expression rates of LN in GTD were 37.8% (28/74) and 64.86% (48/74), respectively, and were significantly lower than those in normal villus tissue. In HM (hydatidiform mole), IM (invasive mode) and CC (choriocarcinoma), the normal expression rates of E-cad were 53.3%, 31.25% and 16.67%, respectively; the strong expression rates of LN were 80%, 56.25% and 50%, respectively. With the development of GTD malignancy, the normal expression rates of E-cad and the strong expression rates of LN declined gradually and were significantly different from those of normal villus. The decreasing expression of the both were associated with the development, malignance and invasiveness of GTD. In GTD, there were no significant relationship between the normal expression of Å-cad and the strong expression of LN. Conclusion: The expression of the E-cad and LN are associated with the development, malignance and invasiveness of GTD. The combination of them is helpful for the diagnosis of GTD, and it's valuable to predict the progress trend and prognosis of GTD.

84887244193	No association of the LRRK2 genetic variants with Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese individuals	The leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 ( LRRK2) gene has been regarded as 1 of the most common genetic causes of Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesized that LRRK2-susceptible allele(s) for PD might pose a risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we screened 12 LRRK2 gene variants in 2 independent cohorts from southwestern China (341 AD patients and 435 normal individuals) and eastern China (297 AD patients and 384 normal individuals), to discern the potential association between this gene and AD. No variant was identified to be associated with AD in either case-control sample. As both of the cohorts were of Han Chinese origin, we combined the LRRK2 variant data for the 2 sample sets together (a total of 638 AD patients and 819 normal individuals) and still found no association between the LRRK2 gene and AD, suggesting that LRRK2 gene variants may not affect the development of AD in Han Chinese individuals. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84898775514	MiRNA-206 and BDNF genes interacted in bipolar i disorder	Background Several lines of evidence have suggested that has-mir-206 (miRNA-206) may regulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein synthesis. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether miRNA-206 gene (MIR206) may confer susceptibility to bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) and treatment response to mood stabilizers. Also, we intended to verify the hypothesis that a potential interplay of MIR206 and BDNF may influence the genetic risk for BD-I and treatment response. Methods The MIR206 rs16882131 and BDNF rs6265 polymorphisms were genotyped in 280 BD-I patients and 288 healthy controls. Treatment response to lithium and valproate was retrospectively determined. Results No association was observed in the individual polymorphism with regards to risk of BD-I and treatment response. Our results showed a significant gene to gene interaction between the MIR206 rs16882131 and BDNF rs6265 polymorphisms that contribute to BD-I susceptibility and treatment response. Further analysis showed a significant interaction between MIR206 and BDNF on treatment score (F

54049142101	Proliferation of Mel-CAM defined IT in first-trimester villi and hydatidiform mole	Objective: To explore the relationship between Mel-CAM and adherence and invasion of trophoblastic cells and proliferation of Mel-CAM defined intermediate trophoblast. Methods: Double immunohistochemical staining technique was used to detect the expression of Ki-67 in Mel-CAM defined intermediate trophoblast in human villi during the first trimester and hydatidiform mole. Results: In this study there was a significantly stronger expression of Mel-CAM in hydatidiform mole than that in first-trimester villi (P<0.05). The expression of Mel-CAM in hydatidiform mole was observed on the surface of villi, but not in human villi. The Ki-67 index of hydatidiform mole was higher than that it of human villi with a significant difference (P < 0.05). Conclusion Mel-CAM might play an important role in the invasion of trophoblastic cells. The different differentiation type of villous trophoblast in hydatidiform mole and the first-trimester villi may be correlated with pathogenesis. The Ki-67 index of intermediate trophoblast has a potential value in predicting prognosis of hydatidiform mole.

67849086549	DNA methyltransferase 3B gene increases risk of early onset schizophrenia	Objective: Consistent evidence indicated that aberrant DNA methylation may be involved in the development of schizophrenia. DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is the key methyltransferase in DNA methylation regulations. In this study, we investigated the association between DNMT3B polymorphisms and the susceptibility of early onset schizophrenia in Chinese Han population. Methods: Case-control (patients = 381 and controls = 472) and family based (trios = 103) study was performed through genotyping two tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2424908 and rs6119954) covering the whole DNMT3B gene. Single nucleotide polymorphism association and haplotype analysis were performed. Results: The frequency of G allele of rs6119954 was significantly higher in patients than that in controls (P = 0.017). Genotype distribution of rs6119954 was significantly different between patients and controls (P = 0.046). A haplotype-wise analysis revealed a higher frequency of the T-G (rs2424908-rs6119954) haplotype in patients than that in controls (P = 0.033). In the transmission disequilibrium test analysis, G allele of rs6119954 was preferentially transmitted in the trios (P = 0.030). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that DNMT3B may be a candidate gene for susceptibility to early onset schizophrenia. Crown Copyright © 2009.

74549148317	A follow-up study on features of sensory gating P50 in treatment-resistant depression patients	Background: Depressive disorder is a well-known chronic, recurrent and disabling mental disease with high direct and indirect costs to society in both western and eastern cultures. Approximately 40% of depressed patients show only partial or no response to initial or even multiple antidepressant medications and are usually called treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients. The present work was to measure the features of sensory gating (SG) P50 in TRD patients with the intent of understanding the characteristics of this disease. Methods: In 50 TRD patients, 39 non-treatment-resistant depression (NTRD) patients and 51 healthy controls (HC), auditory evoked potential P50 was measured using the conditioning/testing paradigm presented with auditory double clicks stimuli, and 36 TRD patients had repeated measurements after an 8-week venlafaxine treatment course. Results: All the depressive disorder patients, including the TRD and NTRD groups, showed an increased testing stimulus wave (S2-P50) amplitude compared to controls (P <0.01 and P <0.05), but there was no significant difference between the TRD and NTRD groups (P >0.05). There were significant differences in the ratio of testing stimulus (S2) and conditioning stimulus (S1) (S2/S1) and in the value of 100 × (1-S2/S1) among the three groups. Compared to the baseline, TRD patients had no significant changes of features and different expression of P50 after acute treatment (P >0.05). Meanwhile, a statistically significant positive correlation of S2/S1 with the scores of the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) (P <0.01), and a significantly negative correlation of S1-S2, 100 × (1-S2/S1) with the scores of HAMD-17 (P <0.01) were observed in the TRD patients' baseline measurement, but there was no correlation after venlafaxine treatment (P >0.05). Conclusions: Both the TRD and NTRD patients had obvious SG deficits, with a more severe deficit in TRD patients. Although, with a correlated relationship to the severity of depressive symptoms, SG P50 deficit might be suggested as a trait marker for TRD, and a combination of S2/S1 ratio, S1-S2 and 100 × (1-S2/S1), was recommended for electrophysiological measurement in TRD patients.

76749133096	Influence of maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism on the risk in offspring of schizophrenia	Several lines of evidence have suggested that two functional methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C, may be implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. We examined these MTHFR polymorphisms in 111 families, composed of a patient and their parents, as well as 143 mothers of patients with schizophrenia and 235 age-matched mothers who had healthy children. The maternal MTHFR 1298C allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia (OR = 1.63, 95%CI: 1.11-2.39, P = 0.01). The haplotype analysis showed a weak association for the 1298C-677C haplotype (OR = 1.54, 95%CI = 1.03-2.29, P = 0.04). Analysis of Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) showed no preferential transmission of 1298C and 677T alleles from parents to probands (P = 0.64 and P = 0.71, respectively). Our results suggest that deficient MTHFR enzyme activity in pregnant women, related to the A1298C variant, is associated with a higher risk of having offspring affected with schizophrenia. Given the low sample size in this study, the present results seem tentative and need further studies to replicate. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77749298743	Panax notoginseng saponins protect rabbit bone marrow stromal cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis	Objective: To investigate the effects of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNSs) on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in rabbit bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Methods: BMSCs were isolated from 2-month-old New Zealand rabbits and cultured with different doses of PNSs to determine the most effective dose of PNSs by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and alkaline phosphafase (ALP) assay. The most effective dose of PNSs was used in subsequent experiments. Apoptosis of BMSCs was induced by hydrogen peroxide (100 μmol/L). BMSCs in PNSs group were also pretreated with PNSs before hydrogen peroxide exposure. Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) levels were measured by using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Apoptosis rate of BMSCs was observed by flow cytometry after staining with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide. The protein expression of Bax in BMSCs was analyzed by Western blotting. Activity of caspase-3 was measured by spectrofluorometry. Results: The most effective dose of PNSs was 0.1 g/L. PNSs at dose of 0.1 g/L markedly reversed the augmentation of ROS level, decreased the apoptosis rate of, and the Bax expression and activity of caspase-3 in BMSCs treated with hydrogen peroxide (P<0.01). Conclusion: PNSs can protect cultured rabbit BMSCs from hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis by decreasing oxidative stress, Bax expression and caspase-3 activity.

Methods: BMSCs were isolated and purified by density gradient centrifugation combined with attachment culture method. The biological characteristics of BMSCs were observed under an inverted microscope. The BMSCs were identified with HE staining and CD34/CD44 immunohistochemical staining. The biological activity of BMSCs was detected by osteogenic induction and steatogenic induction. Results: BMSCs were isolated successfully in vitro and had good homogenicity. Immunohistochemical staining of CD34/CD44 showed strong positive expression of CD44 and negative expression of CD34. Fortis osteogenic ability and positive staining of ALP could be detected by osteogenic induction, and fortis steatogenic ability and positive staining of axungia could be detected by steatogenic induction. Conclusion: BMSCs have the capability of multi-directional differentiation in vitro.

77952671344	No genetic association between dopamine D1 receptor gene and [early onset] schizophrenia	Decreased dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been consistently reported in schizophrenia patients. The dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) plays an important role in mediating dopaminergic transmission in the PFC. Controversy about this topic still exists despite ample evidence suggesting that the DRD1 gene is associated with performance on neuropsychological tests probing the function of the PFC in schizophrenia, as well as positive and negative symptoms and therapeutic response to antipsychotics. To determine whether this gene is involved in the etiology of schizophrenia, we undertook a case-control study to look for an association. We genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4532, rs5326, rs2168631, rs6882300 and rs267418 within the DRD1 involving 373 schizophrenia patients with early age of onset and 379 healthy subjects. No significant differences of genotype, allele or haplotype distribution were identified between patients and controls. Our results do not preclude a possible role of DRD1 in the etiology of schizophrenia. As an important dopaminergic gene, DRD1 may contribute to schizophrenia by interacting with other genes. Further relevant studies are warranted. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77953433217	Effects of PUVA on apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential in HL-60 cells	Objective: To study the effects of psoralen(PSO) and long wave ultraviolet light(PUVA) on apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential in HL-60 cells. Methods: HL-60 cells were incubated with PSO in different concentrations irradiated with or without UVA. The changes of ultrastructure of cells were observed under the electron microscope. The apoptosis ratios and the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected through the flow cytometry. The factorial design and analysis of variance were used to analyze the interaction among the factors. Results: There were obvious ultra-structure changes about apoptosis in HL-60 cells after treated with PUVA. PSO, UVA and PUVA all increased the apoptosis ratios and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. The apoptosis ratios of control group, 80 μg/mL PSO group, 5 min UVA group and PUVA (80 μg/mL PSO + 5 min UVA) group were (10.60 ±0.31) %, (26.94 ±0.26) %, (28.53 ±0.05) % and (37.72 ± 0.09) % respectively. The level of mitochondrial membrane potential of the four groups were 388.47 ±6.35, 173.17 ±10.89, 200.00 ± 2.91 and 71.83 ± 9.47 respectively (P <0.01)and the effects of PUVA were stronger than the other two. Conclusions: PUVA can induce the apoptosis of HL-60 cells and one of the pathway to induce apoptosis is to downregulate the mitochondrial membrane potential.

In this study, the genetic association between the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and schizophrenia was investigated in 379 patients with schizophrenia and 380 age- and sex-matched controls subjects. The results showed an association between the 1298C allele and the disorder (OR 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.79). This provides further evidence that the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism may play a role in conferring risk for schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77955933819	Association between MEK gene polymorphisms and depression	Objective: To investigate the association between mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) gene polymorphisms and depression. Methods: Peripheral whole blood samples of 425 patients with maj'or depressive disorder (depression group) and 404 healthy controls (control group) were collected, and DNA was extracted. Tagging SNPs rs1549854 and rs4255740 in MEK1 gene, rs7258366 and rs12459484 in MEK2 gene were selected and genotyped through TaqMan SNP genotyping assay to detect the genotypes of 4 SNPs in depression group and control group, and the association between MEK gene polymorphisms and depression was analysed. Results: There were significant differences in genotype and allelic distribution of rs1549854 between depression group and control group (P < 0.05). There also existed significant differences between females of two groups (P < 0.01). The combinative genotype analysis of rs1549854 and rs4255740 and that of rs7258366 and rs12459484 revealed that the combinative genotype distribution of rs1549854 AA-rs4255740 CC and rs7258366 AA-rs12459484 GG was significantly higher in depression group than that in control group, with the highest risk of the latter (OR = 2.175, P < 0.01), while the combinative genotype distribution of rs1549854 CC-rs4255740 CT and rs7258366 GG-rs12459484 GG was significantly lower in depression group than that in control group, with the lowest risk of the latter (OR =0.132, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Polymorphism of rs1549854 in MEK1 gene may relate to major depressive disorder, especially for female patients. The combinative genotype of rs1549854 AA-rs4255740 CC and rs7258366 AA-rs12459484 GG may be risk factors for depression, while that of rs1549854 CC-rs4255740 CT and rs7258366 GG-rs12459484 GG may be associated with lower risk for major depressive disorder.

77955944415	Comparison study of cognitive function between treatment resistant depression and fist episode depression	Objective: To investigate and compare the characteristics of cognitive function between treatment resistant depression (TRD) and first episode depression (FED). Methods: Fifty-three patients with TRD (TRD group) and 21 patients with FED (FED group) were enrolled, and another 20 healthy volunteers were served as normal controls (control group). The disease severity was evaluated with Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD-17), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity Index (CGI-SI), the cognitive function was assessed with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Schedule (WAIS), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Number Cancellation Test (NCT), and comparison was conducted among groups. Results: The evaluation of disease severity revealed that the score of somatic anxiety factor of HAMD-17 in TRD group was significantly higher than that in FED group, while there was no significant difference in the scores of the other factors between these two groups. The assessment of cognitive function demonstrated that performance intelligence quotient, WMS memory quotient, long and short term memory, WCST number of categories completed, response administered, percent conceptual level responses, NCT correct number and score in TRD group and FED group were significantly lower than those in control group. However, WCST total time, error response time, number of perseverative errors and percent of perseverative errors in TRD group and FED group were significantly higher than those in control group. The scores of picture puzzle, space orientation, number order and vision regeneration in TRD group were significantly lower than those in FED group. Compared with the differences between FED group and control group, the differences between TRD group and control group in WCST error response time, number of perseverative errors, percent of perseverative errors, percent conceptual level responses, NCT correct number and score were more significant. Conclusion: Clinical evaluation of disease severity can not reflect the characteristics of TRD. The impairment of imagination, ability to grasp the clues and hand-eye coordination, and working impairment on memory and attention are characterised in TRD.

Methods: A total of 346 Chinese Han patients with MDD (case group) and 347 healthy Chinese Han people (control group) were enrolled, and patients in case group were subdivided into treatment-resistant depression (TRD) group (n = 72) and non-TRD (NTRD) group (n = 274) according to treatment response. SNPs of rs4570625 and rs7305115 were selected for the genomic region of TPH-2 gene and genotyped through TaqMan SNP genotyping assay, and the distribution of gene type and allele in groups was analysed. Results: There were significant differences in distribution of rs4570625 gene type and allele between case group and control group (P < 0.05). There were significant differences in distribution of SNPs rs4570625 and rs7305115 gene type and allele between males of TRD group and males of NTRD group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: TPH-2 gene rs4570625 may be associated with depression disorder in Chinese Han populations, and SNPs of rs4570625 and rs7305115 may predict the antidepressant treatment response in male patients.

78651362868	Olanzapine and risperidone disrupt conditioned avoidance responding by selectively weakening motivational salience of conditioned stimulus: Further evidence	Suppression of conditioned avoidance response is a preclinical behavioral index of antipsychotic activity. Previous work shows that olanzapine and risperidone disrupt avoidance response elicited by a less salient conditioned stimulus (CS2) to a greater extent than avoidance elicited by a more salient stimulus (CS1), suggesting that antipsychotic drugs may have a weakening action on motivational salience of stimuli. In the present study, we further examined this mechanism of antipsychotic action, focusing on the possible impact of baseline difference of CS1 and CS2 response rates on the avoidance-disruptive effect of olanzapine and risperidone. Rats were first trained to acquire avoidance responding in a procedure in which the number of CS2 trials (i.e. 20) was twice the number of CS1 trials (i.e. 10), but the percentage of CS2-shock pairing was set at 25% lower (15 trials out of 20) than the percentage of CS1-shock pairing (20 trials out of 20). They were then tested daily under olanzapine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, sc) or risperidone (0.33 and 1.0 mg/kg, sc) for 5 consecutive days. Repeated olanzapine and risperidone treatment dose-dependently disrupted avoidance responding to both CS1 and CS2. Both drugs at the high dose disrupted the CS2 avoidance to a greater extent than the CS1 avoidance. In the final challenge test, rats previously treated with olanzapine were tested under risperidone (0.33 mg/kg), whereas rats previously treated with risperidone were tested under olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg). Results show that rats previously treated with risperidone 1.0 mg/kg group made significantly fewer avoidance responses than the vehicles under olanzapine at 0.5 mg/kg. These findings confirm that olanzapine and risperidone disrupt avoidance response primarily by selectively attenuating the motivational salience of the CS. The present study also suggests that there is a generality of antipsychotic drug experience that is mediated by a shared interoceptive drug state mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

79251601931	Resveratrol improves neuron protection and functional recovery in rat model of spinal cord injury	Researches on the pathology of spinal cord injury (SCI) have been recently focused on oxidative radicals stress and inflammation associated neuronal apoptosis. Resveratrol, a natural phenolic compound, has been extensively studied and shown a wide variety of health beneficial effects, including prevention of cardiovascular diseases and cancer and neuroprotective activities. However, the study of its potential role in neuroprotection and underlying mechanism in SCI model has been limited. In this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol on neurologic functions and histopathologic changes after SCI and the mechanism underlying its neuroprotective effects. First, neuronal function after SCI was evaluated with Basso Beattle Bresnahan locomotor rating scale (BBB) and the result showed that injured animals treated with resveratrol showed a significant increase in BBB scores. Further, histopathological alternations were evaluated with HE and Nissl staining, showing a restored neural morphology and an increase of the number of neurons after resveratrol administration. To explore the underlying mechanism, anti-oxidation effect of resveratrol was assessed by measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level after SCI. Resveratrol treatment reversed the decrease of SOD activity and increase of MDA level caused by SCI, suggesting its anti-oxidation role in response to the injury. In addition, resveratrol treatment suppressed immunoreactivity and expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) after SCI, suggesting an anti-inflammation effect of resveratrol. Finally, resveratrol treatment inhibited injury-induced apoptosis as assessed by electrical microscopy and TUNEL staining and affected the expression level of apoptosis-related gene Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3, which indicated its anti-apoptosis role after SCI. Our data suggest that resveratrol significantly promotes the recovery of rat dorsal neuronal function after SCI, and this effect is related to its characteristics of anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79955794649	Association study of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene in schizophrenia and its clinical features in Chinese Han population	Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental illness which is characterized by the development of various detrimental clinical features, and its etiology still remains unknown. Based on the evidence from neurobiological and pharmacological research, dysfunctions in central serotonergic transmission may be involved in the development of schizophrenia. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), a newly identified isoform of tryptophan hydroxylase (the rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin), regulates the brain-specific serotonin synthesis. To further clarify the role of TPH2 in this disease, we performed a case-control study to examine the association of the TPH2 gene with schizophrenia and its clinical features. We genotyped three putative functional polymorphisms (rs4570625, rs7305115, and rs4290270) within the gene and carried out a case-control study consisting of 304 schizophrenia patients and 362 healthy subjects. The severity of psychotic symptoms was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The frequencies of genotypes and alleles of rs4570625, rs7305115, and rs4290270 did not differ significantly between schizophrenic patients and controls. However, the PANSS positive symptom subcore was significantly associated with rs4570625 (P=0.022). These results suggest that rs4570625 of TPH2 may play an important role in the development of positive symptoms in Han Chinese schizophrenic patients. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

79959281225	Hydroxysafflor Yellow A Protects PC12 Cells Against the Apoptosis Induced by Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation	Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) was reported neuroprotective under several ischemic models in vivo. In this study, the direct effect of HSYA against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) inducing acute neuronal injury and the underling mechanisms in vitro were investigated. Four-hour oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 20 h reperfusion (adding back oxygen and glucose, OGD-R) was used to induce in vitro ischemia reperfusion injury in differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. HSYA (1, 10, and 100 μmol/l) was added to the cultures 30 min prior to the ischemic insult and was present during OGD and reoxygenation phases. The survival rate of PC12 cells was detected by MTT assay. The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were elevated by biochemical method. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometric analysis were used to detect apoptosis; western blotting was used to detect the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Cytochrome C protein. The activity of caspase-3 was assessed by colorimetry. HSYA concentration-dependently attenuated neuronal damage with characteristics of increasing injured neuronal absorbance of MTT, decreasing cell apoptosis, and antagonizing decreases in SOD activity and increase in MDA level induced by OGD-R. Moreover, the down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to cytosol and the consequent activation of caspase-3 were reversed by HSYA in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that apoptosis is an important characteristic of OGD-R-induced PC 12 death and that treatment of PC12 cells with HSYA can block OGD-R-induced apoptosis through suppression of intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondria dependent caspase cascade. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79959468264	Effects of recombinant adeno-associated viruses expressing human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 on spinal cord injury	Numerous studies have confirmed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) improves the function of neural cells following spinal cord injury (SCI). However, some studies have also verified that VEGF cannot significantly induce the increase in vascular density at or surrounding the lesion, and that VEGF therapy exacerbated secondary damage following SCI. Based on the dual effects of VEGF on SCI, we constructed the recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV)-hVEGF165-IRES-human recombinant green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) (AAV-VEGF) and rAAV-IRES-hrGFP (AAV-GFP). Our results suggested that rAAV expressed hVEGF165, and a low dose of VEGF relieved increased vascular permeability, improved microcirculation in the local spinal cord, lessened spinal cord edema, and decreased neuronal apoptosis. These results verified that the releasing effects of the rAAV virus vector had protective effects on the spinal cord.

80053262522	Lack of effect of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism on early onset schizophrenia in Chinese Han population	Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with high heritability. Schizophrenic patients with early-age onset tend to have a greater genetic component and may be an attractive subpopulation for genetic studies. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is considered a candidate gene for schizophrenia. A single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) was reported to be associated with schizophrenia, although discrepancy remains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and schizophrenia using an early onset sample in the Chinese Han population. Our sample consisted of 353 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 394 healthy controls. All subjects were of an ethnically homogenous Han Chinese origin. No significant differences of genotype or allele distribution were identified between the patients and controls. However, the Met allele was significantly associated with an earlier age of onset in male schizophrenic patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P = 0.005), but not in females (P = 0.289). The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has an important effect on the age of onset of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner. This may represent a significant genetic clue for the etiology of schizophrenia and thus, further studies are required to uncover the exact role of BDNF in the development of schizophrenia. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

83155165274	Self-stigma in patients with mood disorders and its related factors	Objective To investigate the level of self-stigma in patients with mood disorders and its related factors. Methods Self-stigma in 446 patients with mood disorders was evaluated using Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale (ISMI), and levels of self-stigma were compared among patients with different sociodemographic or clinical features. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted between self-stigma and clinical variables in 384 patients with depressive episode. Results Self-stigma existed in 72.9% of patients, and moderate to severe self-stigma accounted for 24.2%. The percent of patients with stigma resistance was the highest (79.6%), and the percent of patients with discrimination experience was the lowest (41.0%). Male patients had higher scores of stereotype endorsement, discrimination experience and social withdrawal subscale than female patients (P < 0.05). Employed patients had lower score of discrimination experience subscale than the unemployed (P < 0.05). Patients with higher education had lower ISMI total score, as well as lower alienation, stereotype endorsement, discrimination experience and social withdrawal subscale scores than those with lower education (P <0.05). There was no significant difference in ISMI total score between patients with major depressive disorder and those with bipolar disorders (P > 0.05). ISMI total score and alienation, stereotype endorsement, social withdrawal and stigma resistance subscale scores of unrecovered patients were significantly higher than those of the recovered (P < 0.05). Age and depression severity (total score of 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) were positively associated with ISMI total score (r = 0.168, P <0.01; r = 0.300, P <0. 01), and education experience was negatively associated with ISMI total score (r= -0. 178, P <0.01) in patients with depressive episode. Conclusion Self-stigma and high stigma resistance are common in patients with mood disorders. Self-stigma of patients with certain sociodemographic and clinical features should be attached great importance and assessed cautiously and comprehensively. Efforts on helping patients to enhance their ability to resist stigma should be strengthened.

84855669469	Contextual and behavioral control of antipsychotic sensitization induced by haloperidol and olanzapine	Repeated administration of haloperidol (HAL) and olanzapine (OLZ) causes a progressively enhanced disruption of the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) and a progressively enhanced inhibition of phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotion in rats (termed antipsychotic sensitization). Both actions are thought to reflect intrinsic antipsychotic activity. The present study examined the extent to which antipsychotic-induced sensitization in one model (e.g. CAR) can be transferred or maintained in another (e.g. PCP hyperlocomotion) as a means of investigating the contextual and behavioral controls of antipsychotic sensitization. Well-trained male Sprague-Dawley rats were first repeatedly tested in the CAR or the PCP (3.2 mg/kg, subcutaneously) hyperlocomotion model under HAL or OLZ for 5 consecutive days. Then they were switched to the other model and tested for the expression of sensitization. Finally, all rats were switched back to the original model and retested for the expression of sensitization. Repeated HAL or OLZ treatment progressively disrupted avoidance responding and decreased PCP-induced hyperlocomotion, indicating a robust sensitization. When tested in a different model, rats previously treated with HAL or OLZ did not show a stronger inhibition of CAR-induced or PCP-induced hyperlocomotion than those treated with these drugs for the first time; however, they did show such an effect when tested in the original model in which they received repeated antipsychotic treatment. These findings suggest that the expression of antipsychotic sensitization is strongly influenced by the testing environment and/or selected behavioral response under certain experimental conditions. Distinct contextual cues and behavioral responses may develop an association with unconditional drug effects through a Pavlovian conditioning process. They may also serve as occasion setters to modulate the expression of sensitized responses. As antipsychotic sensitization mimics the clinical effects of antipsychotic treatment, understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of antipsychotic sensitization and its contextual control would greatly enhance our understanding of the psychological and neurochemical nature of antipsychotic treatment in the clinic. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84856001160	Panax notoginsenoside produces neuroprotective effects in rat model of acute spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Acute spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCII) is associated with pathological changes, including inflammation, edema, and neuronal apoptosis. Panax notoginsenoside (PNS), an important traditional Chinese medicine, has shown a variety of beneficial effects, including homeostasis maintenance, anti-myocardial ischemia activities, and neuroprotective functions. However, whether it can produce neuroprotective effects in SCII and the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Aim of the study: In the present study, we investigated the effects of PNS on neurological and histopathological changes after SCII as well as the underlying mechanisms. Materials and methods: Sixty-four adult rats were randomly assigned into one of the four groups: the sham group, the ischemic group, the PNS group, and the Methylprednisolone group. A rat model of SCII was adopted from a commonly used protocol that was initially proposed by Zivin. Neurological function was evaluated with the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale. Histopathological changes were examined with hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as Nissl staining. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were conducted to compare the changes in tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-10, aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), member 6 of the TNF receptor superfamily (Fas), and Fas ligand (FasL) in the spinal cord. Finally, neuronal apoptosis was measured by electron microscopy. Results: The BBB scores of the PNS-treated injured animals were significantly increased. The gross histopathological examination showed restored neuronal morphology and increased number of neurons after the PNS treatment. The PNS treatment decreased SCII-induced up-regulation of cytokine levels. In addition, PNS suppressed the increased expression of AQP-4 after SCII, suggesting an anti-edema effect. Finally, PNS treatment inhibited injury-induced apoptosis and reduced the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins, Fas and FasL, confirming its anti-apoptosis effects against SCII. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that PNS produces robust neuroprotective effects in spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury, and this role may be mediated by its anti-inflammation, anti-edema, and anti-apoptosis actions. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84859698907	Effects of Olig2-Overexpressing Neural Stem Cells and Myelin Basic Protein-Activated T Cells on Recovery from Spinal Cord Injury	Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is a major focus of current research for treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, it is very important to promote the survival and differentiation of NSCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). In this study, myelin basic protein-activated T (MBP-T) cells were passively immunized to improve the SCI microenvironment. Olig2-overexpressing NSCs were infected with a lentivirus carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene to generate Olig2-GFP-NSCs that were transplanted into the injured site to differentiate into OLs. Transferred MBP-T cells infiltrated the injured spinal cord, produced neurotrophic factors, and induced the differentiation of resident microglia and/or infiltrating blood monocytes into an "alternatively activated" anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype by producing interleukin-13. As a result, the survival of transplanted NSCs increased fivefold in MBP-T cell-transferred rats compared with that of the vehicle-treated control. In addition, the differentiation of MBP-positive OLs increased 12-fold in Olig2-GFP-NSC-transplanted rats compared with that of GFP-NSC-transplanted controls. In the MBP-T cell and Olig2-GFP-NSC combined group, the number of OL-remyelinated axons significantly increased compared with those of all other groups. However, a significant decrease in spinal cord lesion volume and an increase in spared myelin and behavioral recovery were observed in Olig2-NSC- and NSC-transplanted MBP-T cell groups. Collectively, these results suggest that MBP-T cell adoptive immunotherapy combined with NSC transplantation has a synergistic effect on histological and behavioral improvement after traumatic SCI. Although Olig2 overexpression enhances OL differentiation and myelination, the effect on functional recovery may be surpassed by MBP-T cells. © 2011 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

84859938020	Expression of BMP-2 and BMP-4 proteins by type-1 and type-2 astrocytes induced from neural stem cells under different differentiation conditions	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a subgroup of the TGF-β superfamily, play critical roles in neural progenitor cell fate determination. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that can differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes under certain conditions. In our recent report, using an antibody that can recognize both BMP-2 and BMP-4 (BMP-2/4), we showed that BMP-2/4 is only expressed in astrocytes differentiated from NSCs in a medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). In this in vitro model, the astrocytic differentiation of NSCs was mainly toward type-2. When NSCs were cultured in a medium containing 10% FBS, most of the cells differentiated into type-1 astrocytes. However, little information is available for BMP-2 and BMP-4 expression in type-1 and type-2 astrocytes induced from NSCs under these different culture conditions. In this study, using two antibodies specific for BMP-2 and BMP-4, respectively, we discriminated the presence of BMP-2 and BMP-4 in NSCs and their derivatives under 1% and 10% FBS culture conditions by RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. We found that BMP-2 and BMP-4 are highly expressed in both type-1 and type-2 astrocytes, and no detectable expression in NSCs, neurons and oligodendrocytes. This suggests that the astrocytes might be one source of BMPs during the differentiation of NSCs. However, in our model, we cannot exclude the possibility that microglia or endothelial cells could also be a source of BMPs. © 2012 by Polish Neuroscience Society - PTBUN, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology.

84860850593	Hydroxysafflor yellow a protects PC12 cells against the apoptosis induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation	Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) was reported neuroprotective under several ischemic models in vivo. In this study, the direct effect of HSYA against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) inducing acute neuronal injury and the underling mechanisms in vitro were investigated. Fourhour oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 20 h reperfusion (adding back oxygen and glucose, OGDR) was used to induce in vitro ischemia reperfusion injury in differentiated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. HSYA (1, 10, and 100 lmol/l) was added to the cultures 30 min prior to the ischemic insult and was present during OGD and reoxygenation phases. The survival rate of PC12 cells was detected by MTT assay. The contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were elevated by biochemical method. Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometric analysis were used to detect apoptosis; western blotting was used to detect the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Cytochrome C protein. The activity of caspase-3 was assessed by colorimetry. HSYA concentration-dependently attenuated neuronal damage with characteristics of increasing injured neuronal absorbance of MTT, decreasing cell apoptosis, and antagonizing decreases in SOD activity and increase in MDA level induced by OGD-R. Moreover, the down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to cytosol and the consequent activation of caspase-3 were reversed by HSYA in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that apoptosis is an important characteristic of OGD-R-induced PC 12 death and that treatment of PC12 cells with HSYA can block OGD-R-induced apoptosis through suppression of intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondria dependent caspase cascade.

84862769717	Association of PDE4B polymorphisms and schizophrenia in Northwestern Han Chinese	The phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) is a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia (SCZ), interacting with DISC1, a known genetic risk factor for SCZ. To examine if variants within PDE4B gene are associated with SCZ in Northwestern Han Chinese, and if these effects vary in gender-specific subgroup, we analyzed 20 SNPs, selected from previous studies and preliminary HapMap data analyses with minor allele frequency (MAF) â‰¥ 20%, in a cohort of 428 cases and 572 controls from genetically independent Northwestern Han Chinese. Single SNP association, haplotype association and sex-specific association analysis were performed. We found that rs472952 is significantly associated with SCZ and rs7537440 is associated with SCZ in females. Further analysis indicated that a haplotype block spanning PDE4B2 splice site is highly associated with SCZ and several haplotypes in this block have about twofold to threefold increase in cases. Our results provide further evidence that PDE4B may play important roles in the etiology of SCZ. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84863108076	Effect of SOX10 gene polymorphism on early onset schizophrenia in Chinese Han population	Schizophrenia is one of highly heritable psychiatric disorders. Patients with early onset schizophrenia tend to have a greater genetic loading and may be an attractive subpopulation for genetics studies. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs139887 in sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10), a candidate gene for schizophrenia, was suggested to be associated with schizophrenia although inconsistent results had been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between SOX10 rs139887 polymorphism and schizophrenia using an early onset sample in the Chinese Han population. A total of 321 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 400 healthy controls were recruited for association study. In addition, two populations involved in three studies were selected for meta-analysis to determine the effect of rs139887 on schizophrenia. Our association study results showed that the allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different between schizophrenic patients and controls (P= 0.013 and P= 0.034, respectively). Interestingly, a significant association in allele and genotype frequencies were found in male patients (P= 0.017 and P= 0.045, respectively), but not female patients. Moreover, the C/C genotype had a significant association with an earlier age of onset in male schizophrenic patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P= 0.029), but not in female patients (Kaplan-Meier log-rank test P= 0.876). The meta-analysis result showed the same C allele was significantly associated with schizophrenia (P= 0.007). In conclusion, the SOX10 rs139887 polymorphism was related to the development of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner, and may be a significant genetic marker for managing subgroups and etiological clues in schizophrenia. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84863865965	Common variants in the TPH2 promoter confer susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia	Serotonergic system-related genes may be good candidates in investigating the genetic basis of schizophrenia. Our previous study suggested that promoter region of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2) may confer the susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated whether common variants within TPH2 promoter may predispose to paranoid schizophrenia in Han Chinese. A total of 509 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for paranoid schizophrenia and 510 matched healthy controls were recruited for this study. Five polymorphisms within TPH2 promoter region were tested. No statistically significant differences were found in allele or genotype frequencies between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. The frequency of the rs4448731T- rs6582071Ars7963803A-rs4570625T-rs11178997A haplotype was significantly higher in cases compared to the controls (P=0.003; OR=1.49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.95). Our results suggest that the common variants within TPH2 promoter are associated with paranoid schizophrenia in Han Chinese. Further studies in larger samples are warranted to elucidate the role of TPH2 in the etiology of paranoid schizophrenia. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84863866357	Association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and cognitive performance in antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia	Cognitive impairment is one of the core symptoms in schizophrenia, which reflects the neurodevelopmental deficits in the etiology of this disease. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in various neurodevelopmental processes. Growing evidence has shown that BDNF may be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to examine the association of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with cognition in patients with schizophrenia. Various neuropsychological tests including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were employed in a sample of 112 antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia and 63 healthy controls. We examined the Val66Met polymorphism in the 112 patients and 394 controls. Among the patients, cognition was compared between Met allele carriers and non-Met allele carriers. A wide range of cognitive deficits were demonstrated in the schizophrenic patients, compared with the controls (Ps<0.01). No significant differences of genotype or allele distribution were identified between patients and controls. The patients with Met allele showed more percent WCST perseverative errors than those without Met allele (P=0.007). After stratification based on gender, an association between the Met allele and a higher percentage of perseverative errors was found in male patients (P=0.014), but not in females (P=0.09). Cognitive performance is broadly impaired in schizophrenic patients. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may be involved in the impaired executive function. This effect may have gender-specific characteristics. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84863873385	Passive immunization with myelin basic protein activated T cells suppresses axonal dieback but does not promote axonal regeneration following spinal cord hemisection in adult rats	The previous studies suggested that some subpopulations of T lymphocytes against central nervous system (CNS) antigens, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), are neuroprotective. But there were few reports about the effect of these T cells on axon regeneration. In this study, the neonatally thymectomied (Tx) adult rats which contain few T lymphocytes were subjected to spinal cord hemisection and then passively immunized with MBP-activated T cells (MBP-T). The regeneration and dieback of transected axons of cortico-spinal tract (CST) were detected by biotin dextran amine (BDA) tracing. The behavioral assessments were performed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale. We found that passive transferring of MBP-T could attenuate axonal dieback. However, no significant axon regeneration and behavioral differences were observed among the normal, Tx and sham-Tx (sTx) rats with or without MBP-T passive immunization. These results indicate that passive transferring of MBP-T cells can attenuate axonal dieback and promote neuroprotection following spinal cord injury (SCI), but may not promote axon regeneration.

84865637939	Neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion as a valid model of schizophrenia: Evidence from sensory gating study	Background The neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) rat model has been proposed as an experimental model for schizophrenia. NVHL rats display impaired central nervous system (CNS) inhibition, which may lead to a phenomenon similar to P50 sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenic patients. In this study, we investigated whether sensory gating deficits occurred in the NVHL rat as a model for schizophrenia. Methods We created the NVHL rat model using ibotenate. The P20 and N40 were measured to assess sensory response and gating in NVHL and sham rats. Epidural electrodes recorded evoked potentials (EPs), from which latencies, amplitudes, difference scores (S1-S2), and gating ratios (S2/S1) were assessed. Results Compared with sham controls, prolonged S1 N40 latency and decreased S2 N40 amplitude were detected in the NVHL group. In neither difference scores nor gating ratios, a significant difference was found between NVHL group and sham controls. Conclusions NVHL rats may be a valid animal model for schizophrenia. This strategy will be useful in future neurobiological studies investigating the etiology of schizophrenia.

0038269617	The expression of laminin and laminin receptor in human villi and hydatidifore mole	Objective: To investigate the relationship between laminin (LN), laminin receptor (LN-R) and the onset mechanism of hydatidiform mole. Methods: Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the expression of LN, LN-R in human villi and hydatidiform mole. Results: LN was stained in continued-lining shape both at the site of basal membrane cellular membrane and surrounded by positive staining which was thicker on the side of normal villi and hydatidiform mole. The staining corresponded negatively to gestational weeks. The expression of LN-R in both basal membrane of normal villi and hydatidiform mole was sited on the surface epithelial membrane. Conclusion: Lamine and its receptor might play an important role in the occurrence of hydatidiform mole.

84869074205	ANK3 as a risk gene for schizophrenia: New data in han Chinese and meta analysis	Histological and neuroimaging evidence supports the hypothesis that neuronal disconnectivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10761482 in ankyrin 3 (ANK3), a major neuron-enriched gene, was associated with schizophrenia although inconsistent results had been reported. Two meta analyses reported another SNP rs10994336 in ANK3 gene confers risk to bipolar disorder (BD). Due to evidence of genetic overlap between schizophrenia and BD, we investigated common findings by analyzing the association of ANK3 polymorphisms (rs10761482, rs10994336, and two missenses, rs3808942 and rs3808943) with schizophrenia, using the Han Chinese population. A total of 516 schizophrenia cases, 400 controls, and 81 trios of early onset schizophrenia were recruited for association studies. Furthermore, the published datasets were combined with our results to determine the effect of the loci on schizophrenia. Our association study showed the frequencies of C allele of rs10761482 and T allele of rs10994336 were higher in patients than in controls. Furthermore, allele condition analyses indicated the association signal observed at rs10761482 and rs10994336 was independent. A haplotype analysis revealed the rs10761482-rs3808942-rs3808943 haplotype was associated with schizophrenia. The frequency of the T-T-T haplotype was higher in patients than in controls. In the transmission disequilibrium test analysis, the C allele of rs10761482 and the rs10761482-rs3808942-rs3808943 haplotype were preferentially transmitted in the trios. Meta analysis incorporating previous and current studies also showed rs10761482 and rs10994336 were associated with schizophrenia. We conclude that ANK3 gene has a major influence on susceptibility to schizophrenia across populations. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84869792144	A comparative study of N400 in generalized anxiety disorder versus obsessive compulsive disorder patients	Objective: To explore the features of events-related potentials (ERP) component N400 in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) versus obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients and understand the cognitive pattern and processing characteristic for Chinese characters. Methods: ERP component N400 was recorded by Guangzhou Runjie WJ-1 ERP apparatus. And 41 GAD patients, 69 OCD patients and 58 normal controls (NC) were tested by the Chinese idioms ending with matching (congruent) or mismatching (incongruent) words. Results: (1) Latencies; Significant differences were found of N400 latencies in ending words with the same pronunciation but different forms and meanings (NC:(377 ± 40) ms, OCD:(395 ±43) ms, GAD:(396 ±43) ms, congruent; NC:(415 ±32) ms, OCD:(429 ±35) ms, GAD:(430 ±36) ms, incongruent), ending words with the same meaning but different pronunciations and forms (NC:(411 ± 32) ms, OCD:(424 ±40) ms, GAD:(433 ±39) ms, incongruent), ending words with different pronunciations, forms and meanings (NC:(399 ± 47) ms, OCD:(427 ± 53) ms, GAD:(434 ± 42) ms, congruent; NC:(442±36) ms, OCD:(465±35) ms, GAD:(474±35) ms, incongruent) (P < 0.05-0.01). Compared with NC, the N400 latencies were prolonged in GAD and OCD patients. Compared with OCD patients, the GAD patients also showed prolonged N400 latencies in ending words with different pronunciations, forms and meanings (incongruent situation). (2) Significant differences were found of N400 amplitudes in ending words with the same pronunciation but different forms and meanings (NC:(9 ±5) μV, OCD:(6±5)μV, GAD:(6±5) μV, congruent; NC:(11±6)μV, OCD:(5±4) μV, GAD:(6± 4) μV, incongruent), ending words with similar forms but different pronunciations and meanings (NC:(9 ±5) μV, OCD:(5±4) μV, GAD:(7±5) μV, congruent; NC:(14±6)μV, OCD:(6±5) μV, GAD:(9 ±7) μV, incongruent), ending words with different pronunciations, forms and meanings (NC:(9 ±5) μV, OCD:(5 ±4)μV, GAD:(5 ±3) μV, congruent; NC:(14 ±6)μV, OCD:(9 ±7) μV, GAD:(9 ±7) μV, incongruent) (P < 0.05 - 0.01). Compared with NC, N400 amplitudes decreased in GAD and OCD patients respectively. Compared with OCD patients, the GAD patients also showed elevated N400 amplitudes in ending words with similar forms but different pronunciations and meanings (congruent). Conclusion: The cognitive and emotional problems in GAD and OCD may be measured by N400 elicited by Chinese idioms. Notable N400 priming effects can be found in Chinese idioms.

84869878797	The role of BDNF, NTRK2 gene and their interaction in development of treatment-resistant depression: Data from multicenter, prospective, longitudinal clinic practice	Background: Although genetic variants may play a key role in development of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), relevant research is scarce. Methods: To examine whether the polymorphisms of BDNF (rs6265) and NTRK2 (rs1387923, rs2769605 and rs1565445) genes confer risk for TRD in major depressive disorder (MDD), a total of 948 MDD patients were recruited in a 12-week, multicenter, prospective longitudinal study. Results: Our study showed a significant allelic association between rs1565445 and TRD with an excess of the T allele in the TRD group, compared to non-TRD group (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.16-1.76, p = 0.0008); while patients with genotype C/C and T/C in rs1565445 were less likely to develop TRD than those carrying T/T (OR = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.33-0.82; OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.54-0.97, respectively; p = 0.005). Haplotype T-T (rs1565445 and rs1387923) had 1.41-fold increased risk of TRD (p = 0.0014). Furthermore, significant four-locus (rs1387923-rs1565445-rs2769605-rs6265) gene-gene interactions were detected by the Multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Discussion: These results suggest that the interactions of BDNF (rs6265) with NTRK2 (rs1387923, rs2769605 and rs1565445) gene polymorphisms likely play an essential role in the development of TRD in Han Chinese MDD patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84870388281	Venlafaxine inhibits the upregulation of plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the Chinese patients with major depressive disorder: A prospective longitudinal study	Although tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) has been recognized to be involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) for a long time, only few studies so far investigated the effects of antidepressant, venlafaxine on TNF-α and the results are inconsistent. Moreover, the association between plasma TNF-α levels and suicide accompanied with MDD is entirely unknown. To elucidate these relationships, in the present study, 64 first-episode drug-naïve MDD patients and 64 matched healthy controls were recruited. Total 61 MDD patients received 8-week venlafaxine treatment and they were divided into responders and non-responders according to the reduction rate of HRSD-17. Prior to venlafaxine treatment, both responders and non-responders shared a similar plasma TNF-α (p=0.33), which was significantly decreased following venlafaxine treatment (p<0.001, p=0.03, respectively). Compared to non-responders, the responder group had a greater reduction in TNF-α (p=0.01), which was associated with the greater reduction rate of HRSD-17 (B=1.02, p=0.01). In addition, the plasma TNF-α levels were equally higher in both suicidal and non-suicidal MDD patients (p=0.84) compared to the healthy controls on admission (p=0.001, p=0.03, respectively). Together, our data suggest that MDD per se rather than suicide is associated with the elevated plasma TNF-α, which can be inhibited with venlfaxine monotherapy. The extent of TNF-α reduction may be associated with the efficiency of venlafaxine. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84870447499	Association analysis between dopamine D1 receptor gene and symptom quantitative trait of schizophrenia	Objective: To explore the relationship between dopamine Dl receptor gene (DRD1) and symptom quantitative trait of schizophrenia. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 211 schizophrenics and 247 healthy controls at our center. Five tag SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) (rs4532, rs5326, rs2168631, rs6882300 & rs267418) within DRD1 gene were genotyped by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) was used to quantify the phenotypes of schizophrenia. Results: No significant differences existed in the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of DRD1 gene between the schizophrenics and normal controls (Ps > 0.05); strong linkage disequilibrium was observed between rs4532 and rs5326 (D'= 0.84); no significant difference of haplotypic distribution was identified between the patients and controls (Ps > 0.05); the patients with rs4532G allele had a higher negative subscale score than those without G allele (20.3 ± 3.3 vs 18.2 ± 3.9, P < 0.01). Conclusion: The rs4532 within DRD1 gene may be associated with negative symptom quantitative trait in schizophrenia. Copyright © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84874303932	T102C polymorphism of serotonin 2A type receptor gene confers susceptibility to (early onset) schizophrenia in Han Chinese: An association study and meta-analysis	Introduction: Several lines of evidence have indicated that serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One functional polymorphism in HTR2A (T102C) has been widely investigated; however, the results have been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between HTR2A T02C polymorphism and schizophrenia in a Chinese Han population. Methods: We performed a case-control study, using an early onset sample, which may be an attractive subgroup for genetic studies. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of the combined sample groups in Han Chinese. Results: Our study, based on 385 schizophrenic patients and 399 controls, found a significant genotype-wise association of T102C and schizophrenia (P=0.02). After applying stratified analyses, the dominant model for T allele produced significant association (OR=1.60, 95%CI=1.11-2.30, P=0.01). In the meta-analysis including all of the published population-based association studies in Han Chinese and the present association study, the pooled genotype-wise result in a dominant model was statistically significant with a summary OR of 1.25 (95%CI=1.04-1.50, P=0.02). Discussion: Our results suggest that the HTR2A T102C polymorphism may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia in Han Chinese. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84874321692	In Vitro Characterization of Echinomycin Biosynthesis: Formation and Hydroxylation of L-Tryptophanyl-S-Enzyme and Oxidation of (2S,3S) β-Hydroxytryptophan	Quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QXC) and 3-hydroxyquinaldic acid (HQA) feature in quinomycin family and confer anticancer activity. In light of the significant potency against cancer, the biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported from many different Streptomyces strains, and the biosynthetic pathway were proposed mainly based on the in vivo feeding experiment with isotope labeled putative intermediates. Herein we report another gene cluster from Streptomyces griseovariabilis subsp. bandungensis subsp. nov responsible for the biosynthesis of echinomycin (a member of quinomycin family, also named quinomycin A) and presented in vitro evidence to corroborate the previous hypothesis on QXC biosynthesis, showing that only with the assistance of a MbtH-like protein Qui5, did the didomain NRPS protein (Qui18) perform the loading of a L-tryptophan onto its own PCP domain. Particularly, it was found that Qui5 and Qui18 subunits form a functional tetramer through size exclusion chromatography. The subsequent hydroxylation on β-carbon of the loaded L-tryptophan proved in vitro to be completed by cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase Qui15. Importantly, only the Qui18 loaded L-tryptophan can be hydroxylated by Qui15 and the enzyme was inactive on free L-tryptophan. Additionally, the chemically synthesized (2S,3S) β-hydroxytryptophan was detected to be converted by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase Qui17 through LC-MS, which enriched our previous knowledge that tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase nearly exclusively acted on L-tryptophan and 6-fluoro-tryptophan. © 2013 Zhang et al.

84875397285	Crosstalk between 5-HT2cR and PTEN signaling pathway in atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome and cognitive dysfunction	Accumulating evidence indicates that chronic treatment with atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) leads to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cognitive dysfunction. It has been found that patients receiving antipsychotic treatment with MetS have significantly worse cognitive function when compared to those without the MetS, suggesting an intrinsic relationship between MetS and cognitive dysfunction. Thus, investigating the reasons for the side effects induced by AAPs is an important step in the effort to understand the patholophysiology of this condition. The 5-HT2c receptor (5-HT2cR) antagonist properties of AAPs are likely to contribute to AAP-induced MetS. There is crosstalk between phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and 5-HT2cR. PTEN negatively regulates the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, which plays an important role in obesity-induced insulin resistance in peripheral tissue. In the central nervous system, PI3K/AKT signaling modulates synaptic plasticity, a mechanism underlying learning and memory processes. This suggests that PI3K/AKT signaling contributes to both metabolic and cognitive activities. Since PTEN negatively regulates PI3K/AKT signaling and has crosstalk with 5-HT2cR, we hypothesized that the 5-HT2cR antagonism of AAPs may disrupt its crosstalk with PTEN and then trigger the PI3K/AKT signaling, and AAP-induced MetS and cognitive impairments may occur via this analogous signaling pathway. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875858796	In vivo investigation of the substrate recognition capability and activity affecting amino acid residues of glycosyltransferase FscMI in the biosynthesis of candicidin	Alteration of sugar moieties of natural products often leads to novel antibiotics with different chemical and physical properties. fscMI is a putative glycosyltransferase (GT) in a gene cluster for the production of candicidin, a polyene macrolide antibiotic, produced by Streptomyces sp. FR-008. In this report, we established an in vivo biochemical detection system by inactivating fscMI and the DH11 domain of polyketide synthase (PKS) through double homologous recombination to unveil the interaction between polyene GTs and their substrates. We found that homologous GT genes including amphDI, nysDI and pimK can catalyze the conversion of candicidin aglycone into candicidin/FR-008-III in fscMI mutant, suggesting that homologous polyene GTs show some tolerance toward aglycones and that it is possible to create new polyene analogues with altered aglycones through genetic engineering. Inactivation of the DH11 domain of PKS led to novel polyene derivatives with mycosamine added to the altered polyketide backbones, further confirming the loose substrate specificity of polyene GTs. Furthermore, mutation of Ser346, Ser361, His362 or Cys387 of FscMI by site-directed mutagenesis significantly reduced its catalytic activity. Further analysis suggested that Ser361 and Cys387 are likely the critical donor interacting residues that could affect the activity of GT FscMI. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the critical residues in a polyene GT. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84875875018	A population-based association study of 2q32.3 and 8q21.3 loci with schizophrenia in Han Chinese	It has been reported that two new schizophrenia susceptibility loci (2q32.3 and 8q21.3) containing two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs17662626 and rs7004633) have been identified in Europeans by a genome-wide association study. To determine if the two regions are associated with schizophrenia in Han Chinese, which are distinct from Europeans, we analyzed 9 SNPs, including rs17662626 and rs7004633, within 2 regions involving 1430 cases and 1570 controls from the Han population. Single SNP association, haplotype association, and gender-specific association analyses were performed. Single SNP analyses revealed that there was no association with schizophrenia in the region of 2q32.3, but rs7004633 mapping to the region of 8q21.3 was significantly associated with schizophrenia (p = 5.1 × 10

84877689177	Effects of sodium ferulate on preventing steroid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis in rabbits	The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of sodium ferulate (SF) on anti-apoptosis in steroid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis in rabbits. Japanese white rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (control group, treatment group, and model group), each with 24 rabbits. The model and treatment groups were first injected with an intravenous dose of horse serum, 10 ml/kg, three weeks later with an intravenous dose of 7.5 ml/kg, and two weeks later with an intramuscular dose of methylprednisolone, 45 mg/kg, three times in order to establish rabbit models of osteonecrosis. Concurrently, the treatment group was injected with intravenous doses of SF 20 mg/kg for two weeks, once per day. Three time points, Weeks 2, 4, and 8, were selected after modeling was completed. Osteonecrosis was verified by histopathology with haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The apoptosis rate of osteonecrosis was observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The apoptosis expressions of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The rabbit models of osteonecrosis were successfully established and observed by HE staining. SF was effective in intervening in apoptosis and decreasing the apoptosis rate in femoral head necrosis by the immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay (P<0.01). Western blot analysis indicated that there were statistical significances in the protein levels of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 (P<0.01). SF has a protective effect by reducing the incidence of early steroid-induced femoral head necrosis in rabbits, effectively intervening in apoptosis through decreasing caspase-3 expression and up-regulating Bcl-2 expression. © 2013 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878231875	SOX10 rs139883 polymorphism is associated with the age of onset in schizophrenia	Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric disorder with high heritability. The age of onset is an important phenotype of schizophrenia and may be under considerable genetic control. Our previous study showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs139887 in sex-determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) gene was associated with the age of onset in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of another SNP rs139883 in the exon 4 of SOX10 on schizophrenia using an early-onset samples in the Han Chinese population. A total of 309 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 390 healthy controls were recruited for association study. No significant differences of allele or genotype frequencies were identified between the schizophrenic patients and controls. However, the C allele was significantly associated with an earlier age of onset in total patients and male patients (Kaplan-Meier log rank test P = 0.026; Kaplan-Meier log rank test P = 0.047, respectively), but not in females. In conclusion, the SOX10 rs139883 polymorphism influenced the age of onset of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner and this may represent a vital genetic clue for the etiology of schizophrenia. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84880932895	Nonlinear dynamics of electroencephalography study in schizophrenic patients	Background Few characteristic changes of linear electroencephalograph (EEG) have been reported in schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in temporal-spatial dimensional properties of EEG under different cognitive tasks in patients with schizophrenia. Methods EEG was recorded by using EEG-1518K system and mapping system (Nihon Kohden Tomioka Corporation, Japan) in 45 schizophrenic patients and 47 healthy adults (normal control, NC) under five states: eyes closed, eyes open, mental arithmetic test with eyes closed, memory test with eyes open, and number cancellation test. Correlation dimension (D2) and point-wise correlation dimension (PD2) were calculated for all EEG analyses. Results (1) There were no significant differences of D2 and PD2 between NC and schizophrenic patients under states of eyes open and closed. (2) Compared with NC, schizophrenic patients showed decreased performance of D2 in mental arithmetic test with eyes closed and number cancellation test (mental arithmetic test with eyes closed: Nc 5.9±0.6, Sch 3.0±0.8; number cancellation test: Nc 6.0±0.6, Sch 4.4±0.7; P <0.05 or P <0.01). (3) Schizophrenic patients also showed decrease performance of PD2 in mental arithmetic test with eyes closed, memory test with eyes open, and number cancellation test (mental arithmetic test with eyes closed: Nc 6.9±0.7, Sch 4.0±0.8; memory test with eyes open: Nc 6.6±0.8, Sch 5.0±0.9; number cancellation test: Nc 7.1±0.7, Sch 4.8±0.9; P <0.05 or P <0.01). Conclusions Nonlinear dynamic analysis provided a new approach in clinical investigation of EEG signals. It was helpful to further understand the cerebral mechanism in schizophrenic cognitive process.

84881537785	Association Study of Val66Met Polymorphism in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Gene with Clozapine-Induced Metabolic Syndrome: Preliminary Results	The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is higher among patients receiving atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) treatment, and even among AAPs, treatment with clozapine has been shown to be associated with a higher long-term incidence rate of MetS. Likewise, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) deficiency has been reported to result in metabolic traits, such as increased food intake, hyperphagia and obesity, etc. In this study, we hypothesized that a functional polymorphism (Val66Met) in the BDNF gene may confer susceptibility to clozapine-induced MetS, potentially in a sex-specific manner, since an interaction between Val66Met polymorphism and sex was observed in our previous studies. A total of 199 schizophrenia patients being treated with clozapine were divided into two groups, MetS and non-MetS, based on the diagnostic criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III. We genotyped the Val66Met polymorphism, and measured the serum levels of fasting glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). There was a trend indicating a significant association between the homozygous Met/Met genotype and MetS in male patients (OR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.05-5.41; p = 0.039; corrected p = 0.078). Among the six risk factors listed in the ATPIII criteria, we found a significant association between fasting GLU levels and Val66Met polymorphism in males (p = 0.005; corrected p = 0.03), but not in females (p = 0.65). Post-hoc analysis in males revealed that the Met/Met carriers had significant higher levels of fasting GLU than those with Val/Val or Val/Met genotypes (p = 0.007; corrected p = 0.042 and p = 0.002; corrected p = 0.012, respectively). In conclusion, we observed a weak association between the Val66Met polymorphism and clozapine-induced MetS in a sex-specific manner. While preliminary, such findings prompt further, large-scale longitudinal studies to replicate these findings. © 2013 Zhang et al.

84882881289	Association of genetic variation in CACNA1C with bipolar disorder in Han Chinese	Background A growing body of evidence highlights the existence of shared genetic susceptibility to both major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), suggesting some potential genetic overlap between the disorders. Genome-wide association studies have identified consistent association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the α-1 C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel gene (CACNA1C) with MDD and BD, suggesting CACNA1C as a promising candidate gene for susceptibility to mood disorders. In the present study, we tested the association of CACNA1C with MDD and BD in Han Chinese. Methods We genotyped three potentially functional polymorphisms in 635 MDD patients, 286 BD patients and 730 normal, control patients. Results The genotype frequencies of SNP rs1051375 showed statistically significant differences between the BD and control groups (P=0.005). At the allele level, the difference of G allele frequency of rs1051375 between BD patients and control subjects was also significant (P=0.011; OR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.06-1.58). We found that GG genotype of rs1051375 carriers had a lower age at onset than those with the AG or AA genotype, and the mean±standard deviation ages at onset of GG, AG and AA carriers were 24.04±4.22, 25.76±4.75 and 25.78±4.33 years, respectively. Neither genotype nor allele frequencies of the three polymorphisms were found to be significantly different between the MDD patients and control subjects. Limitations The relative small sample size in BD group should be considered a limitation of this study. Conclusions Our initial findings support a potential association of CACNA1C as a genetic risk factor for BD susceptibility. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885178774	Does the bipolar disorder-associated CACNA1C gene confer susceptibility to schizophrenia in Han Chinese?	The gene coding for the calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C subunit (CACNA1C) has been reported to be associated with bipolar disorder (BD) in our previous study. Broad evidence suggests some degree of shared genetic susceptibility between BD and schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the BD-associated gene CACNA1C confers susceptibility to schizophrenia. The association was assessed using a cross section study of 696 schizophrenia patients and 1,114 matched control subjects of Han Chinese origin. Between-group comparisons of genotypic or allelic frequencies showed no statistically significant differences. CACNA1C is unlikely to play a major role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in Han Chinese. Further large-scale replication studies using a haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism selection approach are required to obtain more conclusive results of any potential association. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84886950512	Estrogen receptor 1 gene rs2295193 polymorphism and anorexia nervosa: New data and meta-analysis	Introduction: Estrogen plays essential roles in the regulation of food intake, adiposity, and body weight control. The estrogen alpha receptor, encoded by estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1), has been implicated with anorexia nervosa (AN). A previous study indicated that the rs2295193 polymorphism in ESR1 may confer a genetic susceptibility to AN. Methods: In a case-control study, we assessed 195 AN probands and 93 healthy controls; 99 trios were studied in a family-based association analysis through genotyping the rs2295193 polymorphism in ESR1. Additionally, we carried out a meta-analysis of the combined sample groups. Results: There were no significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies of the rs2295193 polymorphism between the AN and control groups (Ps>0.05). In the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analyses, there was no evidence for biased transmission of the G allele of rs2295193 polymorphism (P=0.32). In female-only samples, no significant association was observed between the rs2295193 polymorphism and AN in either case-control or transmission disequilibrium test analyses (Ps>0.05). The meta-analysis revealed that no excess of transmission of the G allele in AN families (pooled odds ratio =1.10, P=0.79). Discussion: Meta-analytically combined evidence from the present genotyping and the literature showed that rs2295193 polymorphism in ESR1 is not a major genetic susceptibility factor in AN. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84886285680	Influence of polymorphisms in genes SLC1A1, GRIN2B, and GRIK2 on clozapine-induced obsessive-compulsive symptoms	Rationale: Clinical observations indicate that atypical antipsychotics, especially clozapine, induce obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Recent data from neuroimaging and clinical trials suggest a role for altered glutamate neurotransmission in the etiology of OC disorder (OCD), and SLC1A1, GRIN2B, and GRIK2 have all been reported to regulate glutamate transmission and affect OCD pathophysiology. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether SLC1A1, GRIN2B, and GRIK2 are associated with clozapine-induced OC symptoms. Methods: A total of 250 clinically stable schizophrenia patients receiving clozapine treatment were recruited. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to evaluate the severity of OC symptoms. Based on their Y-BOCS scores, 250 patients were divided into the OC and non-OC groups (patients with or without OC symptoms, respectively). Additionally, three reported OCD susceptibility polymorphisms, SLC1A1 (rs2228622), GRIN2B (rs890), and GRIK2 (rs1556995), were genotyped. Results: Trends of association with OC symptoms were observed in rs2228622A and rs890T alleles. SLC1A1 and GRIN2B interaction was found in the significant two-locus gene-gene interaction model (p = 0.0021), using the multifactor dimensionality reduction method. Further analysis showed a significant interaction between SLC1A1 and GRIN2B on the Y-BOCS score (F

84888368825	Difference in remission in a Chinese population with anxious versus nonanxious treatment-resistant depression: A report of OPERATION study	Background: A secondary analysis was conducted to compare treatment outcomes for anxious depression and nonanxious depression in previous published OPERATION trials of a variety of antidepressants and augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: A total of 375 patients that met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and the stage 2 TRD criteria (described by Thase & Rush) were enrolled. Anxious depression was defined as MDD with a HRSD-17 anxiety/somatization factor score ≥7. Data were derived from an earlier study, designed to compare efficacy and tolerability of fixed dosage of extended-release venlafaxine, mitazapine, paroxetine, and risperidone, sodium valproate, buspirone, trazodone or thyroid hormone augmenting to paroxetine in those patients. Treatment outcomes were compared between patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD. Results: Nearly 70%of participants had anxious depression. Remission rates were significantly lower and ratings of adverse event frequency were significantly greater in patients with anxious TRD than in those with nonanxious TRD. Presence of anxious depression predicted worse outcomes. Limitations: Lack of a placebo control arm prevents us from ruling out placebo effects. The two groups were non-randomly allocated to medications. Only patients with stage 2 TRD were enrolled, which may limit generalizablity to patients without a history of resistance. Comorbid anxiety disorders that might confound the specific treatment effects were not addressed. Conclusions: The findings support and extend the hypothesis that anxious depression is associated with poorer outcomes. It suggests a dimensional assessment of co-occurring anxious features of MDD patients may be clinically feasible for countries like China where difficulties in making comorbidity diagnosis exist. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84891890047	Influence of BCL2 gene in major depression susceptibility and antidepressant treatment outcome	Background Our recent work indicated that low-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) mRNA was observed among untreated major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, and the subsequent altered level of Bcl-2 was found to be close to the antidepressant treatment outcome. The primary aim of this present study was to examine whether a particular gene, encoding Bcl-2 (BCL2) confers risk to MDD, and likewise to investigate whether this gene acts as an indicator of antidepressant treatment outcome. Methods We enrolled 178 treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and 612 non-treatment- resistant depression (NTRD) patients as well as 725 healthy controls. In total, three selected tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) of BCL2 (rs2279115, rs1801018 and rs1564483) were genotyped to test for possible association. Using TaqMan relative quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we analyzed leukocytic expression of BCL2 mRNA in 47 healthy subjects. Results Of the three SNPs, we observed no significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between the MDD and control groups as well as between the TRD and NTRD groups. However, we found a significant association between the rs2279115C allele and TRD in males (corrected P=0.048) but not in females. Further real-time quantitative PCR analysis in healthy subjects revealed that the rs2279115 polymorphism significantly influenced BCL2 mRNA expression (P=0.03). Limitations This is a preliminary investigation with relatively small sample size and cross-sectional design. Conclusions These initial findings strengthen the hypothesis that BCL2 may play an important role in mediating the outcome of antidepressant treatment, a result that may further be confirmed by future genetic studies from large-scale populations that can overcome the limited sample size of this preliminary finding. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84891600402	Genetic modulation of working memory deficits by ankyrin 3 gene in schizophrenia	Neuropsychological endophenotype approach is an emerging strategy in schizophrenia research to understand and identify the functional importance of genetically transmitted, brain-based deficits present in this disorder. Accumulating evidence indicated that working memory deficit is a core neuropsychological dysfunction in schizophrenia and a primary endophenotype indexing the liability to develop schizophrenia. Genetic variation in ankyrin 3 gene (ANK3) is likely to have widespread cognitive effects. Our previous study has identified a significant association of ANK3 SNPs and schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to examine whether the schizophrenia-risk SNPs within ANK3 may affect working memory deficits in schizophrenia patients. Herein, we assess the working memory performance in 163 patients with first-episode, antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia and 42 sex, age-matched healthy subjects using N-back task. Two SNPs rs10761482 and rs10994336 were genotyped among the patients and 209 controls. Our results showed that schizophrenia patients showed significantly poorer performance than healthy controls on N-back task (ps. <. 0.01). After adjusting for the scores of intelligence quotient, memory quotient and the demographic factors, there was a significant genotype effect of the rs10994336 on the accuracy rate and reaction time of 2-back item (p= 0.048 and 0.024, respectively). Post-hoc analyses showed that patients with rs10994336T/T genotype had significantly lower accuracy rate and more reaction time at 2-back task than those with T/C and C/C genotypes. The association of SNP rs10994336 with schizophrenia was replicated in our sample (genotypic p= 0.024 and allelic p= 0.006). However, we did not find any significant association of rs10761482 with schizophrenia and parameters in N-back task. Our results indicated that genetic variation within ANK3 may exert gene-specific modulating effects on working memory deficits in schizophrenia. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84892922538	Effect of resveratrol on inflammatory reaction after spinal cord injury in rats	Objective: To study the effect of resveratrol on inflammatory reaction after spinal cord injury in Rats. Methods: A total of 63 rats were randomly assigned into three groups with 21 in each: sham group, control group and resveratrol group. Rats in sham group underwent operation exposure only; the model of spinal cord injury was established in control group by Allen's weight hit. Resveratrol group received intraperitoneal injection of resveratrol at the dose of 200 mg/kg. At 24, 48 and 72 h after operation, the contents of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were observed by ELISA assay. The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was observed by colorimetric method assay. At 72 h, the expressions of IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α and MPO in spinal cord injury tissues were observed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot assay. Results: IL-1β, IL-10 and TNF-α expressions as well as MPO activity were significantly lower at 24, 48 and 72 h in resveratrol group than in control group (P<0.05). The results of colorimetric method showed that resveratrol group had significantly downregulation MPO activity comparied with control group at 24, 48, and 72 hours (P<0.05). The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot assay showed that IL-1β, IL-10, TNF-α and MPO expressions were signicantly decreased in resveratrol group compared with those in control group at 72 h after operation (P<0.05). Conclusion: Resveratrol has a protective effect on spinal cord injury in rats by reducing inflammatory mediator activity after spinal cord injury.

84893956740	A study of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene (GRIN2B) variants as predictors of treatment-resistant major depression	Rationale: In clinical practice, ketamine, an antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), is used to alleviate depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), especially in those with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Accordingly, the human gene coding for the 2B subunit of the NMDAR (GRIN2B) is considered a promising candidate gene for MDD susceptibility. Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to examine whether potentially functional polymorphisms of GRIN2B confer risk for MDD, and second to investigate whether GRIN2B acts as a genetic predictor for TRD in MDD patients. Methods: We enrolled 178 TRD and 612 non-TRD patients as well as 779 healthy controls. Results: Four potentially functional polymorphisms (rs1805502, rs890, rs1806201, and rs7301328) within GRIN2B were genotyped in all participants. The haplotype analysis found significant differences in the distribution of the G-T haplotype between the TRD and control groups (corrected P = 0.007), and the frequency of the G-T haplotype in TRD group was significantly higher than that in the controls (TRD/control ratio 0.31:0.21). Statistically significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies were detected between TRD and non-TRD groups for the rs1805502 polymorphism within GRIN2B. There was a significant allelic association between rs1805502 and TRD with an excess of the G allele in the TRD group, compared to non-TRD group (OR = 1.55, 95 % CI = 1.18-2.05, corrected P = 0.008). Conclusions: These initial findings strengthen the hypothesis that GRIN2B not only confers susceptibility to TRD, but also plays a genetic predictor for TRD in MDD patients. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84900865522	Metabolic syndrome in patients taking clozapine: Prevalence and influence of catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype	Rationale: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has consistently been identified as an adverse effect of long-term treatment with atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) such as clozapine. Elevated serum homocysteine concentration has been found to act as an independent risk factor for MetS, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the homocysteine metabolism. We accordingly hypothesized that COMT dysregulation may confer the susceptibility to MetS induced by AAPs, potentially in a gender-specific manner, because the interaction effects of COMT and gender have been consistently reported. Objectives: This study aimed at determining the prevalence and influence of COMT on MetS among a population undergoing long-term clozapine treatment. Methods: A total of 468 schizophrenia patients taking clozapine were divided into two groups, those experiencing MetS and non-MetS. We genotyped three functional variants (rs4633, rs4680, and rs4818) in COMT and measured the serum levels of fasting homocysteine, glucose, triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: MetS was found in 202/468 (43.2 %) of all the patients, with 40.2 % prevalence (138/343) in males and 51.2 % (64/125) in females. Patients with MetS had notably higher metabolic parameters than those without MetS. The mean levels of homocysteine in patients with MetS were significantly higher than those without MetS. We found a positive association between the rs4680 polymorphism and the serum triglyceride levels (corrected P∈=∈0.024). Further analysis revealed that the rs4680 Met allele was significantly associated with increased triglyceride levels among female patients (P∈=∈0.009), but not among males (P∈=∈0.07). Conclusions: Our findings suggest a potential association between rs4680 in COMT and elevated TG levels, particularly among female patients. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84901257461	A Pilot Study of iPad-Assisted Cognitive Training for Schizophrenia	In this pilot study, we aimed to examine whether iPad-assisted cognitive training could be beneficial in ameliorating some of the cognitive impairment that accompany schizophrenia. Totally, 20 first-episode schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to an experiment group (with cognitive training) or to a control group (without cognitive training). The N-back task was assessed at baseline and after intervention, to see what effects iPad-assisted training might have (week 4). The experimental group exhibited significant improvement in the accuracy rate at 2-back, and reaction time at 0, 1 and 2-back tasks. These findings suggest that iPad- or other technically-assisted cognitive training may potentially be a valid strategy for pursuing cognitive rehabilitation among those with schizophrenia. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84901666971	Effects of DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2C genes on process of metabolic syndrome induced by clozapine	Objective: To investigate the effects of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), 5-serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A), and 5-serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C) genes on the process of metabolic syndrome (MS) induced by clozapine. Methods: According to the diagnostic criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII), 199 schizophrenic patients with long-term use of clozapine were divided into MS group and non-MS group. The polymorphisms of DRD2, HTR2A, and HTR2C (rs1800497, rs6311 and rs1414334, respectively) were genotyped by the SNaPshot SNP and the serum levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were measured. Results: The differences of body mass index, levels of waist circumference, FPG, TG, HDL, and blood pressure of two groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). The differences of allele and genotype frequencies of SNPs of two groups were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The differences of FPG levels of patients with different genotypes of rs1800497 were statistically significant (F=3.4, P=0.036) and the FPG levels of patients with T/T genotype were significantly higher than those of patients with C/T genotype (P=0.011). Conclusion: The rs1800497 of DRD2 may not be the direct-causing polymorphism of clozapine induced MS. But it may affect the expression of DRD2, cause the abnormal glucose metabolism, and then increase the risk for MS.

84901676120	Analysis of association between polymorphism of Bcl-2 gene promoter and major depressive disorder and its clinical phenotypes	Objective: To investigate the genetic association between the polymorphism of rs2279115 of Bcl-2 gene promoter and the major depressive disorder (MDD) and its clinical phenotypes among Chinese Han population. Methods: Totally 701 MDD patients (the MDD group) who visited the Division of Mood Disorders of Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from January, 2006 to December, 2012 and 725 healthy control subjects (the control group) were chosen for the study. The clinical phenotypes of patients were determined by the 17 items of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). The peripheral blood samples were collected and the DNA was extracted. Rs2279115 was then genotyped by the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Results: The differences of frequencies of genotypes and alleles of rs2279115 between the MDD group and control group were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The differences of scores of HAMD, depressive emotion, and general symptom among polymorphous genotypes of rs2279115 were statistically significant (P<0.05). The scores of HAMD, depressive emotion, and general symptom of MDD patients with C/C genotype were significantly higher than those of MDD patients with C/A or A/A genotype. Conclusion: The rs2279115 of Bcl-2 gene promoter may be relevant to the clinical symptoms of MDD.

84902544017	Significantly decreased mRNA levels of BDNF and MEK1 genes in treatment-resistant depression	The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the levels of mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) and a related gene MEK1 were more obviously decreased in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In total, 50 patients with major depressive disorder (including 26 with TRD and 24 with treatment-responsive depression) and 48 healthy controls were enrolled. BDNF and MEK1 mRNA levels in blood samples from all patients and controls were measured using reverse transcriptase-PCR. BDNF and MEK1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in patients with major depressive disorder when compared with healthy controls (BDNF: P<0.01; MEK1: P<0.001), as well as among treatment-resistant depressive patients as compared with treatment-responsive depressive patients (BDNF: P<0.001; MEK1: P<0.01). Our findings support the hypothesis that BDNF and MEK1 mRNA expression levels are more obviously decreased in patients with TRD. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84903935830	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and bipolar disorder in patients in their first depressive episode: 3-Year prospective longitudinal study	Background Early identification of patients with bipolar disorder during their first depressive episode is beneficial to the outcome of the disorder and treatment, but traditionally this has been a great challenge to clinicians. Recently, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD), but it is not clear whether BDNF levels can be used to predict bipolar disorder among patients in their first major depressive episode. Aims To explore whether BDNF levels can differentiate between MDD and bipolar disorder in the first depressive episode. Method A total of 203 patients with a first major depressive episode as well as 167 healthy controls were recruited. After 3 years of bi-annual follow-up, 164 patients with a major depressive episode completed the study, and of these, 21 were identified as having bipolar disorder and 143 patients were diagnosed as having MDD. BDNF gene expression and plasma levels at baseline were compared among the bipolar disorder, MDD and healthy control groups. Logistic regression and decision tree methods were applied to determine the best model for predicting bipolar disorder at the first depressive episode. Results At baseline, patients in the bipolar disorder and MDD groups showed lower BDNF mRNA levels (P<0.001 and P = 0.02 respectively) and plasma levels (P = 0.002 and P = 0.01 respectively) compared with healthy controls. Similarly, BDNF levels in the bipolar disorder group were lower than those in the MDD group. These results showed that the best model for predicting bipolar disorder during a first depressive episode was a combination of BDNF mRNA levels with plasma BDNF levels (receiver operating characteristics (ROC) = 0.80, logistic regression; ROC = 0.84, decision tree). Conclusions Our findings suggest that BDNF levels may serve as a potential differential diagnostic biomarker for bipolar disorder in a patient's first depressive episode. Declaration of interest None.

84904576179	Altered brain network modules induce helplessness in major depressive disorder	Objective The abnormal brain functional connectivity (FC) has been assumed to be a pathophysiological aspect of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it is poorly understood, regarding the underlying patterns of global FC network and their relationships with the clinical characteristics of MDD. Methods Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 16 first episode, medication-naïve MDD patients and 16 healthy control subjects. The global FC network was constructed using 90 brain regions. The global topological patterns, e.g., small-worldness and modularity, and their relationships with depressive characteristics were investigated. Furthermore, the participant coefficient and module degree of MDD patients were measured to reflect the regional roles in module network, and the impairment of FC was examined by network based statistic. Results Small-world property was not altered in MDD. However, MDD patients exhibited 5 atypically reorganized modules compared to the controls. A positive relationship was also found among MDD patients between the intra-module I and helplessness factor evaluated via the Hamilton Depression Scale. Specifically, eight regions exhibited the abnormal participant coefficient or module degree, e.g., left superior orbital frontal cortex and right amygdala. The decreased FC was identified among the sub-network of 24 brain regions, e.g., frontal cortex, supplementary motor area, amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus. Limitation The limited size of MDD samples precluded meaningful study of distinct clinical characteristics in relation to aberrant FC. Conclusions The results revealed altered patterns of brain module network at the global level in MDD patients, which might contribute to the feelings of helplessness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84922461418	Glutamate receptor 1 phosphorylation at serine 845 contributes to the therapeutic effect of olanzapine on schizophrenia-like cognitive impairments	Schizophrenia patients exhibit a wide range of impairments in cognitive functions. Clinically, atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPs) such as olanzapine (OLZ) have a therapeutic effect on memory function among schizophrenia patients rather than typical antipsychotics, e.g., haloperidol. To date, however, little is known about the neuroplasticity mechanism underlying the effect of AAPs on the impairment of cognitive functions. Here, we treated schizophrenia rat models with a systematic injection of MK-801 (0.1. mg/kg) and chose the drug OLZ as a tool to investigate the mechanisms of AAPs when used to alter cognitive function. The results showed that the systematic administration of MK-801 results in the impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as spatial working memory in a Morris water maze task. OLZ but not HAL improved these MK-801-induced cognitive dysfunctions. After MK-801 application, the hippocampal LTP was profoundly impaired. In conjunction with the results of the behavioral test, the administration of OLZ but not of HAL resulted in a significant reversal effect on the impaired LTP induced via MK-801 application. Furthermore, we found that OLZ but not HAL can upregulate the phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845. These data suggest that the therapeutic effect of OLZ on cognitive dysfunctions may be due to its contribution to synaptic plasticity via the ability to upregulate the state of GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation. We therefore suggest that the upregulated state of GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation may be a promising target for developing novel therapeutics for treating schizophrenia.
