1542347065	Localization of cyclostationary coherent sources in the presence of both multiplicative noise and additive noise	In this paper, we consider the problem of localizing cyclostationary sources when the sources are coherent and the received signal is corrupted by both multiplicative noise and additive noise. In actual wireless communication systems, complex noise case and multipath propagation are often encountered. Considering these and exploiting the signal's cyclostationarity, we propose a direction finding algorithm based on third-order cyclic moment to detect non-Gaussian cyclostationary sources in the presence of both multiplicative noise and additive noise. Also, coherent sources case caused by multipath is discussed. The method is given to resolve coherent and incoherent signals. The simulation results under different noise distributions and different coherent sources situations indicate that the proposed method can effectively suppress additive and nonzero multiplicative stationary noise with any distribution, no matter the noises are Gaussian and non-Gaussian, white or colored, and the signals are coherent or incoherent.

1542432729	Dynamic resource allocation for multimedia CDMA wireless system with downlink beamforming and power control	Downlink beamforming can be used to limit strong interference induced by high data rate users, thereby improve the system performance. On the other hand, power control and data rate allocation are two fundamental techniques for improving the spectral efficiency of wireless multimedia communications. In this paper, an optimal problem is formulated which jointly optimizes downlink beamforming weights and data rates for given system throughput and soft target SIR thresholds using DS-CDMA technology. We also study the relation of data rate and target threshold by minimizing the total transmitted power. The law, which governs the dynamic data rate allocation, is analyzed by adjusting target thresholds. Computer simulation results show that user has to sacrifice its target SIR threshold to obtain more resource.

1542432739	Direction-of-arrival estimation using fourth-order cyclic cumulant in multipath environment	In wireless communication systems, communication signals exhibit cyclostationarity, and multipath propagation due to various reflections are often encountered. Considering these, we propose a direction-of-arrival estimation algorithm using an antenna array to detect non-Gaussian cyclostationary sources in multipath environment by constructing fourth-order cyclic cumulant matrix and using MUSIC.

In micro- or pico-cell environment, the angular separation between each path of the same user is relatively large, thus per-user-per-weight (PUPW) beamforming scheme suffers from strong inter-finger interference (IFI). In order to suppress both multiple-access interference (MAI) and IFI effectively, in this paper, we consider the problem of joint beamforming and power control when per-path-per-weight (PPPW) beamformer is employed in a multirate DS-CDMA system with multicode scheme. The optimal solution of the beamforming weights and transmitted powers is obtained by taken into account the data information of all users and minimizing the power radiated by the mobile terminals while maintaining the SIR requirements. Computer simulations show that for 5 user environment with SIR threshold of 6.8 dB, PPPW scheme saves about 7 dB total transmission power than PUPW scheme when the angular spread is 20 degree.

Due to the hill-climbing characteristic of the expectation maximization (EM) method, it is sensitive to the initial model parameters and easy to lead to a sub-optimal model in practice. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a new hybrid training method based on the global searching capability of genetic algorithms (GA) and the effectiveness of fuzzy approach to obtain GMMs with optimized model parameters. Experimental results based on PKU-SRSC database showed that this method could obtain more optimized GMMs and better results than the hybrid GA based on the EM re-estimation and the traditional EM method. © 2005 IEEE.

34147221912	Speaker recognition based on adaptive niche hybrid genetic algorithms	The traditional training methods of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) are sensitive to the initial model parameters, and they often lead to a sub-optimal model in practice. To resolve this problem, it proposed a new GMM optimization method. It utilized the niche techniques and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm in the Genetic Algorithms (GA) training step and provided a new architecture of hybrid algorithm. The new hybrid algorithm can reduce the possibility of premature convergence presence and improve the exploitation capabilities of GA.

Besides, the other speakers' discriminative information was integrated into fitness function to increase the accuracy of classification and make GMM more generalization ability. The experimental results show that this method can obtain more optimum GMM parameters and better results than the traditional and the two improved versions for speaker recognition.

7744245509	A new approach of higher-order cyclostationarity based direction estimation of coherent narrow-band signals	In this paper, we propose a new higher order cyclic forward-backward linear prediction (HOC-FBLP) approach for coherent signals impinging on a uniform linear array (ULA), by exploiting the spatial and temporal properties of most communication signals. The method utilizes the merits of higher-order statistics and cylcostationarity to enhance the performance of DOA estimation and to effectively reject interference and noise. It is proved that the proposed method can de-correlate the coherency with fewer sensors by incorporating a subarray scheme into a linear prediction technique. The superiority of the method in resolving the closely spaced coherent signals with a small length of data and at relatively low signal-to-noise (SNR) is shown in the numerical experiment.

77449105192	The Cramer-Rao bounds of RSS location estimation for 3D wireless sensor networks	Location information is of paramount importance for wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The design of WSNs has always been focused on an specific point of networks in a two-dimensional (2D) space. Nowadays this design is not enough and the study of the three dimension is needed. In this article, we focus on 3D location accuracy in WSNs. We quantify the estimation accuracy for the RSS measurements by deriving the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), and discuss the performance in two application scenarios, 2D WSN and 3D WSN. Matlab simulation indicates that the 3D location accuracy is superior to the 2D location accuracy for WSNs with reference devices and blindfolded devices being deployed randomly. ©2009 IEEE.

78650111456	Joint space-time block code and downlink beamforming in FDD DS-CDMA systems	Joint space-time block coding (STBC) and beamforming schemes for DS-CDMA are introduced in this paper. STBC scheme and beamforming technique have been considered separately as means to increase the bit rate and capacity in DS-CDMA systems. In STBC scheme, a user's stream is split two independent streams to transmit in two antennas, which will result in intersymbol interference at receiver in multipath environment. Thus, a STBC-beamforming scheme is discussed to compensate for the intersymbol interference. The beamforming weight is determined by downlink channel covariance (DCCM). Computer simulations show that using the STBCB scheme can provider better BER performance than conventional STBC scheme and single array diversity. © 2003 IEEE.

78650126190	Study on denoising of fractal signal based on Shannon entropy	In this paper, the wavelet coefficients' Shannon entropy of 1/f fractal signal and white noise at different scales is analyzed. Based on the proportion of wavelet coefficients' Shannon entropy of 1/f signal with that of signal polluted by noise at each scale, a new method of estimating 1/f fractal signal from added white noise is proposed in this paper. The simulation results show that this method is effective and practicable. Since it doesn't need to know the parameters of fractal signal and the statistical characteristic of added white noise in advance, this method is suitable in many situations. © 2003 IEEE.

The aforementioned approach converts a frequency selective fading channel to several frequency nonselective fading subchannels, avoids tracking the channel fading coefficients and takes the desired user's spreading sequence as a perpetual training sequence without the overhead of the desired user's data symbols. The simulation validates the performance of suppressing multiple access interference and combating near-far effects.

0036880513	A cyclic statistics-based parametric approach to time-delay estimation	The problem of estimating the difference in arrival times of a radio wave impinging on two spatially separated antennas is considered. By exploiting the cyclostationary property of the signal of interest, a new parameter estimation algorithm that is highly tolerant to interference and noises is proposed. The new algorithm models the time-delay operator as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. From a set of linear equations involving cyclic (cross) correlation, the time delay is estimated to be the index of the FIR filter parameter that has the maximum value. When the signal of interest has a known (or measurable) carrier frequency or keying rate that is distinct from those of interference, the new approach exhibits signal selectivity from the temporally, spectrally, or spatially overlapped interference and noises. The computational complexity of the new approach is comparable to that of the conventional method.

10444226490	A novel higher order cyclic cumulant based direction finding algorithm in multipath	we develop a novel higher order cyclic cumulant based direction finding algorithm in multipath. Firstly, three fourth-order cyclic cumulant matrices of the received signals are constructed and the generalized steering vector is estimated, then Forward-Backward Linear Prediction (FBLP) method with subarrays is used to resolve the DOAs of each group of coherent signals of interest (SOIs), which can improve resolution of closely spaced coherent signals in small data length. The simulations show the advantages of the proposed method compared with the EVESPA algorithm. Unlike EVESPA algorithm, the total number of signals (SOIs and interferences) impinging on the array can be more than 2K(K-1)/3 with K-sensor uniform linear subarray and a maximum of 2K(K-1)/3 coherent SOIs can be resolved. The capability of noise-suppression and signal-selectivity in multimath environment of mobile communications is improved.

10444230361	Blind DOA estimation using higher order cyclostationarity and linear prediction in multipath environment	In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines cyclostationarity and linear prediction (LP) to extract the cyclic correlations of only signals with the same cycle frequency and null out the cyclic correlations of stationary additive noise and all other interferences with different cycle frequencies in coherent environment. Unlike similar existing methods, the proposed algorithm requires only a uniform linear subarray and the rest of array may have arbitrary and unknown response. The maximum number of signals resolvable with our method may exceed the number of sensors. Simulations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

10444238702	A private watermarking for halftone image by stochastic error diffusion	In this paper, we introduce a novel method to hide binary visual pattern into halftone images by stochastic error diffusion with the Jarvis kernel. And when we detect the watermarking, we only need to overlap the original halftone image without watermark and the halftone image with watermark or to subtract the two images. Then we will find the binary visual pattern directly on the overlapped or subtracted image. Simulation results show that the halftone image with watermark has good visual effect compared with the halftone image without watermark and when the halftone image with the watermark is severely stained or scratched, the detection algorithm can detect the watermark efficiently.

By analyzing the characteristic of detail subband coefficients of the image after Discrete Wavelet Transform, we use the mean and variance of the detail subbands to modify the wavelet coefficients adaptively to embed the watermark. This is a blind watermark algorithm to confirm the copyright without the original image and the watermark is a meaningful binary image. The experimental results and attack analysis show that the proposed algorithm is effective and robust to common image processing operations and some geometric attacks, such as JPEG/JPEG2000 lossy compression, additive noise, cropping, pixel-shift, and so on.

11144335982	An approach for higher-order cyclostationarity based DOA estimation of multipath signals without eigendecomposition and spatial smoothing	In this paper, we propose a higher order cyclostationarity based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation approach for multipath signals without eigendecomposition and spatial smoothing. In the approach, by using a combination of higher order cyclic statistics (HOCS) and a forward-backward subarray scheme, the coherency of multiple signals of interest (SOIs) are de-correlated and the performance of signal selectivity and interference suppression is improved. To reduce the computation load in order to adapt to tracking moving sources, the need for computation of the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) or the singular value decomposition (SVD) is avoided by linear operations based on fourth-order cyclic cumulant matrix.

11144344998	Array beamforming in multipath environment by exploitation of higher-order cyclic cumulant based DOA estimation	Firstly, a higher order cyclic cumulant based direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is presented to detect both of the signals of interests (SOIs) and the interferences from multipath environment via the choice of different cyclic frequencies. A cyclic cumulant-based forward-backward spatial smoothing (CC-FBSS) method is provided to solve rank-deficiency of conventional covariance matrix in DOA estimation for coherent signals. Based on the signal selective multipath DOA estimation results, we develop a DOA-based beamforming algorithm. Its optimum weights are determined to reduce the contributions of the interfering signals from directions other than the SOIs. The proposed method doesn't require a priori knowledge of the training sequence to adapt the weights, and can decrease the degradation in performance caused by coherent signals. Also it owns powerful signal-selectivity capability to remove interferences with different cycles from SOIs and suppress additive stationary noise and the Gaussian noise with unknown spatial content.
