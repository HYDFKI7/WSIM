37549069280	Effects of geometrical characteristics of surface roughness on droplet wetting	Surface roughness is known to alter the wettability on a solid substrate. In general, either Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter theory is adopted to describe the apparent contact angle. Following the minimum free energy pathway associated with the imbibition process, we have derived a generalized expression for the apparent contact angle on a textured surface and the liquid-gas contact area within the groove that plays a key role. Depending on the geometrical characteristics of the grooves, the surface wetting falls into three regimes: (i) single stable state which is either Wenzel (completely wetted roughness) or Cassie-Baxter (completely nonwetted roughness) state, (ii) two stable states (Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter) separated by an energy barrier, and (iii) single stable state with partially wetted roughness. The sufficient condition for each regime is derived and several groove geometries are given to show the free energy path. Alteration in the geometric parameters may lead to the wetting crossover. We also show that the Cassie-Baxter can occur at a hydrophilic surface for particular pore shapes. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

40149104977	Forced dissociation of a biomolecular complex under periodic and correlated random forcing	The dissociation of a biomolecular complex under the action of periodic and correlated random forcing is studied theoretically. The former is characterized by the period τp and the latter by the correlation time τr. The rupture rates are calculated by overdamped Langevin dynamics and three distinct regimes are identified for both cases by comparison to local relaxation time τR and bond lifetime 〈T〉. For periodic forcing, the adiabatic approximation cannot be applied in the regime τp τR and the bond lifetime is determined by the average pulling. As τR τp 〈T〉, the rupture rate is enhanced by periodic forcing but is τp independent. Analytical expressions are obtained for small and large force amplitudes. As 〈T〉 τp, the rupture rate depends on the phase lag and the process behaves like it is under constant force or loading rate. The result of correlated random forcing is similar to that of periodic forcing. Since the fluctuating forces greater than the average force 〈F〉 contribute more than the fluctuating forces less than 〈F〉, the force fluctuations enhance the rupture rate. As 〈T〉 < τr, the pulling felt by the bond before rupture cannot follow the random forcing protocol and, thus, force fluctuations decline with increasing τr. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

40849140994	Electrophoretic size separation of particles in a periodically constricted microchannel	The size separation of Brownian particles with the same free mobility in an electrophoretic microchannel with alternating thick regions and narrow constrictions is studied theoretically. The electrophoretic mobility is field dependent and generally increases with field strength. In weak fields, Brownian diffusion dominates and the migration is controlled by the entrance effect. Therefore, smaller particles migrate faster than larger ones. In strong fields, however, the particle tends to follow electric field lines. Smaller particles are susceptible to Brownian motion and thus influenced by the nonuniform electric field in the well significantly. As a result, larger particles possess higher mobilities. Our simulation results agree with the experimental observations and provide guidance for efficient nanofluidic separation. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

Recently, core-shell-corona (CSC) and segmented-worm (SW) micelles formed by ABC triblock terpolymers with three mutually immiscible blocks are observed in experiments. We have performed dissipative particle dynamics simulations to study the effects of molecular architecture, block length and solution concentration on the morphologies of ABC triblock terpolymers. The formation of CSC and SW micelles for linear and miktoarm star ABC terpolymers is confirmed in this work. In addition, we predict that different multicompartment micellar morphologies (e.g. incomplete skin-layered micelles and segmented worms) can be formed by linear copolymer with different arrangements of the three blocks. ©2008 American Institute of Physics.

40449139406	Studies of drug delivery and drug release of dendrimer by dissipative particle dynamics	Dendrimers, like unimolecular micelles, may encapsulate guest biomolecules (drug) and therefore are attractive candidates as carriers in drug delivery applications. Hydrophobic drugs can be complexed within the hydrophobic dendrimer interior to make them water-soluble. The equilibrium partition of hydrophobic solutes into a dendrimer with hydrophobic interior from aqueous solutions is studied by dissipative particle dynamics. The drug is mainly distributed in the vicinity of the interface between hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior within a dendrimer. The partition coefficient, which is defined as the concentration ratio of the drug distributed within dendrimer to aqueous phases, depends on the interaction between drug and hydrophilic dendrimer exterior. Increasing the repulsion between them reduces the solubilization ability associated with the dendrimer. ©2008 American Institute of Physics.

46649108749	Tiny bubble removal by gas flow through porous superhydrophobic surfaces: Ostwald ripening	The fact that tiny bubbles are easily formed on the rough, hydrophobic surface results in difficulties in bubble detachment and removal. We show that bubbles captured by porous superhydrophobic surfaces merge into larger ones, which can detach by buoyancy. The responsible mechanism is convective Ostwald ripening because networklike pores in the superhydrophobic film remain nonwetted and provide passage for gas flow between adhered bubbles. A large bubble grows spontaneously by absorbing all small adhered bubbles due to capillary pressure differences. Our results demonstrate that porous hydrophobic film can be an efficient, passive way of bubble removal in microfluidic systems. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

56349112027	Brownian escape and force-driven transport through entropic barriers: Particle size effect	Brownian escape from a spherical cavity through small holes and force-driven transport through periodic spherical cavities for finite-size particles have been investigated by Brownian dynamic simulations and scaling analysis. The mean first passage time and force-driven mobility are obtained as a function of particle diameter a, hole radius RH, cavity radius RC, and external field strength. In the absence of external field, the escape rate is proportional to the exit effect, (RH RC) (1-a2 RH)32. In weak fields, Brownian diffusion is still dominant and the migration is controlled by the exit effect. Therefore, smaller particles migrate faster than larger ones. In this limit the relation between Brownian escape and force-driven transport can be established by the generalized Einstein-Smoluchowski relation. As the field strength is strong enough, the mobility becomes field dependent and grows with increasing field strength. As a result, the size selectivity diminishes. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

While some chemical groups can resist nonspecific protein adsorption from simple solutions for limited contact times, there remains a need for new nonfouling functional groups and surface coatings that prevent protein adsorption from complex media like blood or in harsh environments like seawater. Recent studies of the molecular mechanisms of nonfouling surfaces have identified a strong correlation between surface hydration and resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption. In this work, we describe a simple experimental method for evaluating the intrinsic hydration capacity of model surface coating functional groups based on the partial molal volume at infinite dilution. In order to evaluate a range of hydration capacity and nonfouling performance, solutes were selected from three classes: ethylene glycols, sugar alcohols, and glycine analogues. The number of hydrating water molecules bound to a solute was estimated by comparing the molecular volume at infinite dilution to the solute van der Waals molecular volume. The number of water molecules associated with each solute was further validated by constant pressure and temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, a size-normalized molecular volume was correlated to previously observed protein adsorption experiments to relate the intrinsic hydration capacity of functional groups to their known nonfouling abilities. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

67650469284	The interactions between surfactants and vesicles: Dissipative particle dynamics	The interactions between surfactants and vesicles formed by double-tail amphiphiles are investigated by the dissipative particle dynamics. As the surfactant concentration is increased, vesicle solubilization can be generally described by the three-stage hypothesis including vesicular region, vesicle-micelle coexistence, and mixed micellar region. We study the partition of surfactants between the bilayer phase and the aqueous phase where a higher value of K indicates that more surfactant molecules are incorporated in the bilayer. It is found that ln (K-1) is proportional to the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB), which depicts the degree of hydrophilicity associated with a surfactant. As the overall hydrophilicity of surfactants increases, i.e., higher HLB, K declines and vice versa. When the amounts of surfactants reach a critical point, the solubilization begins and the coexistence of vesicles and mixed micelles is observed. Further increase in the surfactant concentration results in total collapse of the vesicle. Consistent with experimental observations, the three stages are identified through the vesicle size-surfactant concentration relation. Our simulations clearly demonstrate the process of the vesicle solubilization and confirm the validity of the three-stage hypothesis. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

69049106528	High contact angle hysteresis of superhydrophobic surfaces: Hydrophobic defects	A typical superhydrophobic surface is essentially nonadhesive and exhibits very low water contact angle (CA) hysteresis, so-called Lotus effect. However, leaves of some plants such as scallion and garlic with an advancing angle exceeding 150° show very serious CA hysteresis. Although surface roughness and epicuticular wax can explain the very high advancing CA, our analysis indicates that the unusual hydrophobic defect, diallyl disulfide, is the key element responsible for contact line pinning on allium leaves. After smearing diallyl disulfide on an extended polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film, which is originally absent of CA hysteresis, the surface remains superhydrophobic but becomes highly adhesive. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

70450230610	Superhydrophobic floatability of a hydrophilic object driven by edge effect	It is generally believed that a water-repellent surface is necessary for small insects to stand on water. Through a combined experimental and theoretical study, we demonstrate that an object with hydrophilic surface can float with apparent contact angle greater than 90° due to edge effect. The apparent contact angle rises with increasing loading even to a value typically displayed only by superhydrophobic surfaces. On the basis of free energy minimization, two regimes are identified. When buoyancy controls, the meniscus meets the object with the intrinsic contact angle. As surface tension dominates, however, contact angle is regulated by total force balance. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

However, the suspended state of non-Brownian particles is essential in applications, such as Si-wafer wire sawing. By the addition of alkyl amine, micron-sized SiC suspensions are shown to form particle gel in ethylene glycol. The ratio of storage to loss modulus is about 3, indicating a weak gel. The structure by particle-particle attraction is demonstrated through existing yield stress. With increasing surfactant concentration, the gel forms easier, the sediment layer swells more significantly, and the yield stress is greater accordingly.

77249156462	Wetting invasion and retreat across a corner boundary	The wetting phenomenon in the vicinity of a corner boundary is ubiquitous. The daily-life examples include the meniscus of water near the mouth of a container and the halt of the movement of a sliding droplet by the edge. In this study the wetting behavior near the edge is investigated both theoretically and experimentally by considering the volume growth of a droplet atop a conical frustum and the gradual immersion of a wedge. On the basis of free energy minimization, three different regimes are identified. When the contact line is away from the edge, Young's equation is followed. Once the contact line reaches the edge, the contact line is pinning at the edge due to the boundary minimum of the free energy. Consequently, the apparent contact angle exceeds the intrinsic contact angle and grows with increasing droplet volume or water level. As the apparent contact angle reaches the critical angle, which depends on the solid edge angle, liquid extends over the edge and the contact line advances along the new surface at its intrinsic contact angle. Similar behavior can be observed for wetting retreat but in a reverse order. The theoretical prediction has been experimentally confirmed. Copyright © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77952371575	Communications: Wall free capillarity and pendant drop removal	When a sessile drop encounters a pendant drop through a hole, it is generally anticipated that they will coalesce and flow downward due to gravity. However, like "wall-free" capillarity, we show that the pendant drop may be sucked up by a sliding drop instantaneously if the radius of the curvature of the former is smaller than that of the later. This phenomenon can be explained by Laplace-Young equation and convective Ostwald ripening.

The free energy of a cluster can be obtained from its force-displacement relation. The dissociation kinetics of the cluster can be modeled as the dissociation of an effective single bond. There is a critical force Fc beyond which the barrier for the cluster dissociation vanishes. Fc scales such as ks 1/2 and Fc /N is small compared to the critical force of a single bond. The theoretical predictions of free energy landscape and cluster lifetime are supported by numerical simulations for large number of bonds.

The electro-osmotic mobility in an aqueous solution is essentially independent of the microchannel size. However, in low-permittivity solvents, the screening effect is absent and the mobility is found to grow with the capillary radius according to our analytical theory and electro-osmotic flow experiments. Our results show that regardless of low surface charge density, electro-osmosis always occurs for long enough microchannels. Therefore, electro-osmosis provides a method for determining extremely low surface charge density associated with low-permittivity media. The implication in the response time of electronic paper is given as well. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Self-assembly of rod-coil block copolymer B y A x in a selective solvent for its coil block is studied by using dissipative particle dynamics, where B y A x denotes the polymer comprising of y rodlike B beads and x coil-like A beads. The influences of polymer concentration, component compatibility, solvent quality for coil block, rod-block length, and - interaction on the resulting aggregate conformations are examined. It was found that distinctly different from coil-coil copolymers, the aggregates of rod-coil copolymers exhibit morphological and structural diversity induced by the intrinsically rigid nature of the rod blocks. In general, the aggregate adopts the overall shape of sphere, cylinder, perforated sheet, or network. The morphology of the rod-block domain within aggregate is even richer and the interesting structures such as porous sphere, spherical spiral, helical bundles, discrete chunks, and nematic cylinder are observed. The short-range order parameter indicates that as rod length is long enough, neighboring rods begin to orient parallel to one another and nematic domains appear. Moreover, in the presence of - interactions, the neighboring rods within the B domains become more coherently oriented and smectic domains can thus be formed. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

79953254754	Equilibrium phase diagram of drop-on-fiber: Coexistent states and gravity effect	Drop-on-fiber is commonly observed in daily life and is closely related to digital microfluidics. The wetting behavior of droplet-on-fiber is different from that of droplet-on-plane due to the global cylindrical shape. It is generally believed that the equilibrium geometric shape of a droplet on a fiber takes either asymmetric clam-shell or axisymmetric barrel conformation in the absence of gravity. The barrel-to-clam-shell transition is determined by the stability condition. Nonetheless, experimental observations showed that both barrel and clam-shell conformations can coexist in some situations and thus indicated the existence of the multiple stable states. In this Article, the phase diagrams of droplet-on-fiber, that is, the plots of droplet volume against contact angle, are established on the basis of the finite-element simulation (Surface Evolver). When the gravity effect is absent, there are three regimes including barrel, clam-shell, and coexistence of barrel and clam-shell. As the gravity effect is considered, there exist three regimes, including (I) downward clam-shell, (II) coexistence of barrel and clam-shell, and (III) falling-off. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

Thus, a combined theoretical and experimental approach is pursued to explore spontaneous nanowire formation. A dissipative particle dynamics simulation is first performed to study the morphologies formed by rodlike polymers with various side-chain structures. The results surprisingly predict that conjugated polymers with branched side chains are well suited to form thermodynamically stable nanowires. Proof of this concept is provided via the design and synthesis of a branched polymer of regioregular poly(3-2-methylbutylthiophene) (P3MBT), which successfully demonstrates highly dense nanowire formation free from any stringent conditions and stratagies.

However, flow characteristics of nanogranules differ significantly from those of granules. The former can form low-volume fraction (5%) particle gels in air and do not exhibit gravity-driven granular flow easily. It is found that although dry nanogranules possess a high compressibility, close to gases, they are less susceptible to flow than granules due to high yield stress and viscosity. Such differences can be attributed to van der Waals attractions, which support the weight of nanoparticles to form aerogels and resist shearing deformation. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

79961069139	Solubilization mechanism of vesicles by surfactants: Effect of hydrophobicity	Simulations based on dissipative particle dynamics are performed to investigate the solubilization mechanism of vesicles by surfactants. Surfactants tend to partition themselves between vesicle and the bulk solution. It is found that only surfactants with suitable hydrophobicity are able to solubilize vesicles by forming small mixed micelles. Surfactants with inadequate hydrophobicity tend to stay in the bulk solution and only a few of them enter into the vesicle. Consequently, the vesicle structure remains intact for all surfactant concentrations studied. On the contrary, surfactants with excessive hydrophobicity are inclined to incorporate with the vesicle and thus the vesicle size continues to grow as the surfactant concentration increases. Instead of forming discrete mixed micelles, lipid and surfactant are associated into large aggregates taking the shapes of cylinders, donuts, bilayers, etc. For addition of surfactant with moderate hydrophobicity, perforated vesicles are observed before the formation of mixed micelles and thus the solubilization mechanism is more intricate than the well-known three-stage hypothesis.

80053900962	Understanding three hydration-dependent transitions of zwitterionic carboxybetaine hydrogel by molecular dynamics simulations	In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study a carboxybetaine methacrylate (CBMA) hydrogel under various swelling states. The water content in this study ranged from 28% to 91% of the total weight of the hydrogel. Three transitions of the CBMA hydrogel were observed as the water content increased. The first transition occurs when the water content increases from 33% to 37%. The observed kink in the self-diffusion coefficient of water indicates that the hydration of the polymer network of the hydrogel is saturated; the further added water is in a less confined state. The second transition was found to be related to the physical cross-links of the polymer network. As the water content rises to above 62%, the lifetime of the physical cross-links decreases significantly. This abrupt change in the lifetime indicates that the transition represents the equilibrium swelling state of the hydrogel. Finally, the third transition was observed when the water content goes above 81%. The significant increases in the bond and angle energies of the polymer network indicate that the hydrogel reaches its upper limit swelling state at this transition. These results are comparable to previously published experimental studies of similar zwitterionic hydrogels. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84855589565	Morphology and internal structure control of rod-coil copolymer aggregates by mixed selective solvents	The molecular packing of rod-coil copolymers, which relates closely to their aggregate morphology, significantly influences their optoelectronic properties. The morphological phase diagram of rod-coil block copolymers in mixed selective solvents and the internal structures of the resulting aggregates are studied by using dissipative particle dynamics. The coil-selective solvent is mixed well with the rod-selective solvent and the effective solvent quality can be tuned by their relative amount. The diverse morphologies and morphological transitions of structural aggregates induced by mixed solvents depend on the mixed solvent composition, rod-block length, and copolymer concentration. Our simulation results show that while the overall morphology of the aggregate is controlled primarily by the rod length and polymer concentration, the domain morphology within the aggregate, as well as the degree of local rod alignment, are primarily controlled by the rod length and solvent quality. Specifically, we observe that spheres, cylinders, perforated sheets, and three-dimensional networks are sequentially formed with increasing rod length or copolymer concentration irrespective of the solvent quality. On the other hand, changing the solvent quality influences the morphology within an aggregate both by determining any preference for the exposed surface of the aggregate, and also because the rod-selective solvent tends to disrupt the orderly packing of the rod blocks. The range of morphologies within the aggregate is even richer, and interesting structures, such as an inverted vesicle, a structural sphere, an inverted cylindrical vesicle, a segmented cylinder, and a segmented network are observed. Unique segmented-like structures exhibiting the most ordered conformation in the rod domains appear when roughly equal amounts of rod- and coil-selective solvents are used. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84856018538	Self-assembly of organophilic nanoparticles in a polymer matrix: Depletion interactions	The dispersion of nanoparticles in a polymer matrix has been proven a challenge. A recent experiment reveals that it can be controlled by the relative size of nanoparticle/matrix polymer instead of their compatibility. Dissipative particle dynamics simulations are thus employed to investigate self-assembly of organophilic nanoparticles and dispersion of organophobic nanoparticles. The degree of aggregation in terms of the mean aggregation number is evaluated to explore the aggregation kinetics of nanocubes and nanoplatelets. The influence of the length of the matrix polymer on the aggregation behavior is studied as well. It is found that the depletion attraction plays the major role for the aggregation of organophilic nanoparticles. Large nanoplatelets prefer clustering, while small nanoplatelets tend to disperse because the depletion attraction grows with the face area of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the slow aggregation kinetics, hindered by the energy barrier associated with depletion interactions and low nanoparticle diffusivity, is responsible for the low degree of aggregation for organophobic nanoparticles. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The effects of the solvophobicsolvophilic length, polymeric architecture (linear, star, dendritic, and cyclic type), chain rigidity, and solvophobic additives on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the aggregative patterns are systematically investigated. It is found that molecular architectures have a noteworthy impact on the aggregative properties. For linear diblock copolymers, the CMC declines with increasing solvophobic length but rises with increasing solvophilic length. Nonetheless, the solvophobic group has comparatively greater influence on the CMC. Imposition of the star, dendritic, or cyclic structures onto the solvophobic or solvophilic parts of the polymeric surfactant leads to an increase in the CMC. On the contrary, polymers imposed with the greater degree of the rigidity on the solvophobic or solvophilic block have lower CMC. The addition of solvophobic additives results in a decrease of CMC as well. The effects of the concentration and length of the additives on the aggregative behaviors of polymer surfactants were investigated. Interesting supramolecular structures such as caterpillar and worm-like micelles were observed. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The nanostructure leads to networklike pores on the superhydrophobic film and convective Ostwald ripening is observed. Owing to their distinct resistance to liquid imbibition, contact angle hysteresis on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces is fundamentally different.

84859469441	Droplet compression and relaxation by a superhydrophobic surface: Contact angle hysteresis	In this article, the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) of acrylic glass is experimentally and theoretically studied through the compression-relaxation process of droplets by using a superhydrophobic surface with negligible CAH effect. In contrast to the existing technique in which the volume of the droplet changes during the measurement of CAH, this procedure is carried out at a constant volume of the droplet. By observing the base diameter (BD) and the contact angle (CA) of the droplet during the compression-relaxation process, the wetting behavior of the droplet can be divided into two regimes, the contact line withdrawal and the contact line pinning regimes, depending on the gap thickness (H) at the end of the compression process. During the compression process, both regimes possess similar droplet behavior; the contact line will move outward and the BD will expand while the CA remains at the advancing angle. During the relaxation process, the two regimes are significantly different. In the contact line withdrawal regime, the contact line will withdraw with the CA remaining at the receding angle. In the contact line pinning regime, however, the contact line will be pinned at the final position and the CA will decline to a certain value higher than the receding angle. Furthermore, the advancing pinning behavior can also be realized through a successive compression- relaxation process. On the basis of the liquid-induced defects model, Surface Evolver simulations are performed to reproduce the behavior of the droplet during the compression-relaxation process; both contact line withdrawal and pinning regimes can also be identified. The results of the experiment and simulation agree with each other very well. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84861401098	Membrane properties of swollen vesicles: Growth, rupture, and fusion	A vesicle can be swollen in response to the imposed osmotic pressure gradient and vesicular membrane properties are changed. The swelling of small unilamellar vesicles is explored by dissipative particle dynamics, including the growth, rupture, and fusion processes. The spontaneously formed vesicles are inflated by water addition into the vesicle lumen. As the vesicle size grows due to the increment of lumenal contents, the bilayer gets thinner and the area density of the inner lipid head declines much more significantly than that of the outer does. Both area densities converge to the same value before membrane rupture. The packing parameters for both leaflets also decrease and the shape of lipids in the inner leaflet changes from an inverted truncated cone to a truncated cone. The distribution of lipid tails indicates that an interdigitated structure takes place within the bilayer of an inflated vesicle. The outcome of local order parameter demonstrates that the orientation order decays with inflation, revealing that vesicular membrane stretching is accompanied with entropy increment, which is opposite to stretched elastic membrane with entropy reduction. The Young-Laplace equation is adopted to estimate tension, which rises with inflation. Although vesicles of different sizes rupture at distinct degrees of inflation, membrane properties, such as membrane thickness, packing parameter, order parameter, and tension increment must reach the same critical values for all vesicle sizes before rupture. It is also found that the vesicle fusion process is greatly facilitated by the increment of tension owing to the substantial reduction in the time periods for adhesion and hemifusion processes. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84862067648	Improved mechanical properties of zwitterionic hydrogels with hydroxyl groups	Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to examine the mechanical properties of poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA) hydrogels. pCBMA hydrogels with additional hydroxyl groups as physical cross-linkers (OH-pCBMA hydrogels) were studied for comparison. Results show that OH-pCBMA hydrogels have higher elastic modulus than pCBMA hydrogels. This improvement can be explained by hydrogen bond formation between hydroxyl groups and carboxylate groups in the OH-pCBMA hydrogel, which result in an enhanced polymer network within the hydrogel. The enhancement of the polymer work is also suggested by a smaller value of root-mean-square deviation of zwitterionic side chain pairs in the OH-pCBMA hydrogel than that in the pCBMA hydrogel. Additionally, the presence of hydrogen bonds leads to a lower equilibrium water content for the OH-pCBMA hydrogel compared to the pCBMA hydrogel, which is another reason for the greater mechanical modulus of the OH-pCBMA hydrogel. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

The self-assembly of polymer brushes consisting of a solvophobic backbone attached with two different side chains, solvophilic and amphiphilic diblock, is explored by dissipative particle dynamics. Dependent on the block length, molecular architecture, and grafting density, the multicompartment aggregate exhibits a rich variety of morphological conformations, including five types of vesicles: porous aggregates, worm-like micelles, donut micelles, hamburger micelles, and unimolecular micelles. For certain polymer brushes, atypical polymersomes with asymmetric multilayered membranes are spontaneously formed. In addition, temperature variation induced morphological transformation from an asymmetric four-layered polymersome to a symmetric seven-layered polymersome is observed for polymer brushes containing a thermoresponsive block. Consequently, the resulting polymersome decreases in size quite sharply as temperature exceeds lower critical solution temperature. These simulation findings are consistent with experimental observations. By varying the lengths of various blocks, the morphological phase diagram and internal structures of the resulting aggregates are obtained. At a fixed composition of polymer brushes, the aggregate morphology varies with the structural arrangement of the two solvophilic blocks in the molecule. Asymmetric polymersomes are formed when the two solvophilic blocks are separately attached to the backbone and side chain. Although asymmetric vesicles are observed at moderate grafting density, unique donut aggregates are formed for high density but hamburger micelles develop at low density. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84862908211	Size-dependent properties of small unilamellar vesicles formed by model lipids	The size-dependent behavior of small unilamellar vesicles is explored by dissipative particle dynamics, including the membrane characteristics and mechanical properties. The spontaneously formed vesicles are in the metastable state and the vesicle size is controlled by the concentration of model lipids. As the vesicle size decreases, the bilayer gets thinner and the area density of heads declines. Nonetheless, the area density in the inner leaflet is higher than that in the outer. The packing parameters are calculated for both leaflets. The result indicates that the shape of lipid in the outer leaflet is like a truncated cone but that in the inner leaflet resembles an inverted truncated cone. Based on a local order parameter, our simulations indication that the orientation order of lipid molecules decreases as the size of the vesicle reduces and this fact reveals that the bilayer becoming thinner for smaller vesicle is mainly attributed to the orientation disorder of the lipids. The membrane tension can be obtained through the Young-Laplace equation. The tension is found to grow with reducing vesicle size. Therefore, small vesicles are less stable against fusion. Using the inflation method, the area stretching and bending moduli can be determined and those moduli are found to grow with reducing size. Nonetheless, a general equation with a single numerical constant can relate bending modulus, area stretching modulus, and bilayer thickness irrespective of the vesicle size. Finally, a simple metastable model is proposed to explain the size-dependent behavior of bilayer thickness, orientation, and tension. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84863268390	Structure-photophysical property relationship of conjugated rod-coil block copolymers in solutions	A study was conducted to investigate structure-photophysical property relationship of conjugated rod-coil block copolymers in solutions. It was demonstrated that in most rod-coil block copolymer solutions, the solvent was selective for the coil block, leading to the formation of aggregates with the soluble coils exposed to the solvent. The self-assembly morphology was influenced by the molecular structure, including architecture, rod length (y), coil length (x), and the π-π interaction. The researchers considered the archetypical rod-coil systems, diblock copolymers with y:x. The optoelectronic property was closely related to the inner rod arrangement despite the aggregate morphology was complicated and intriguing.

The flow patterns can be controlled by wall wettability, flowrate ratio between two phases, and Reynolds number (Re). For neutral and partially wettable walls, segmented flows are formed and polymer stretching can be controlled by Re and segment length. At high Re, stratified flows are observed and the extension ratio can be tuned by the flowrate ratio. For nonwettable walls, slug flows are formed and polymer stretching can be controlled by Re and slug length. At high Re or flowrate ratio, annular flows are observed and high extension ratio can be easily attained. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84866075896	Photoresponsive polymersomes formed by amphiphilic linear-dendritic block copolymers: Generation-dependent aggregation behavior	Azobenzene-containing linear-dendritic block copolymers (LDBC) with varied generation numbers were synthesized recently. This photosensitive LDBC consists of a linear solvophilic block (R) and solvophilic dendrons of which the periphery is attached with a solvophobic coil-rod diblock (B-Y). The self-assembly and its photoresponsive transformation are explored by dissipative particle dynamics. Dependent on the generation number, polymer concentration, block lengths, and π-π interaction between rod blocks, the aggregate exhibits a rich variety of morphological conformations, including spherical micelle, worm-like micelle, cylindrical micelle, hamburger-like micelle, nanosheet, nanobowl, and vesicle. In general, polymersomes take shape for LDBCs with large generation number while nanofibers and nanosheets develop for LDBCs with small generation number. Upon UV illumination, the photoinduced trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene takes place and the membrane becomes distorted, wrinkled, and even ruptured. A significant increase in water permeation through the polymersome membrane is also observed. These simulation findings are consistent with experimental observations. By varying polymer concentration and lengths of R- and B-blocks, morphological phase diagrams and internal structures of the resulting aggregates are obtained. Transformation from nanosheet or nanobowl to polymersome is observed as polymer concentration grows. When the R-block length decreases, the generation number at which polymersomes start to form declines. On the other hand, nanosheets tend to form for long R-block length. This prediction is also consistent with experimental observations. Polymersomes can also be formed for long enough B-block length at lower generation number. The membrane resistance to water permeation grows with increasing B-block length because of the increment of the hydrophobic layer thickness. Finally, as the π-π strength is increased, the overall morphologies vary from polymersome, nanobowl, to nanosheet. Therefore, polymersomes are formed only when the π-π strength is weak enough due to the hindrance associated with high degree of alignment among azo-rods. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

In this study, the pinning and dewetting mechanism of a tilted drop pinned by a designed patch on a superhydrophobic surface with negligible contact angle hysteresis (CAH) is explored both experimentally and theoretically. The patch is designed in different shapes including square, rectangle, and triangle.

84872546431	Vesicle deposition on hydrophilic solid surfaces	Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) are popular as model systems for cell membranes and are promising for future applications in diagnostic devices and biomimetics. However, the mechanism of SLB formation is not fully understood. In this study, the deposition process of a single small unilamellar vesicle on hydrophilic supports is explored by dissipative particle dynamics. Depending on the lipid tail hydrophobicity and vesicle size, there exist three distinctive pathways of vesicle deposition, involving non-disintegrated, partially disintegrated, and completely disintegrated vesicle. A morphological phase diagram is presented and it reveals that a vesicle with weak tail hydrophobicity and small size tends to be completely disintegrated upon deposition. In contrast, the adsorption of an intact vesicle is observed as it possesses strong tail hydrophobicity and large size. Moreover, our simulation results clearly indicate that the deposition process of a vesicle onto the solid surfaces can be adjusted by altering the vesicular membrane tension and the interaction strength between the lipid head and the solid support. Finally, the deposition process of multiple vesicles on the hydrophilic solid surface is also investigated. The result shows that the fusion of vesicles has a tendency to hinder the formation of a SLB. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

In this study, depletion attraction between two solvophilic nanodiscs and the aggregation behavior of a nanodisc suspension are explored by dissipative particle dynamics. The depletion force due to polymer addition is proportional to the product of the osmotic pressure and the area of the nanodisc, even for concentrated polymer solutions. For a suspension of nanodiscs, three possible equilibrium states are observed upon polymer addition: dispersion, pretransition, and phase separation. By varying nanodisc concentration (φ

84879533793	Evaporation stains: Suppressing the coffee-ring effect by contact angle hysteresis	A ring-shaped stain is frequently left on a substrate by a drying drop containing colloids as a result of contact line pinning and outward flow. In this work, however, different patterns are observed for drying drops containing small solutes or polymers on various hydrophilic substrates. Depending on the surface activity of solutes and the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) of substrates, the pattern of the evaporation stain varies, including a concentrated stain, a ringlike deposit, and a combined structure. For small surface-inactive solutes, the concentrated stain is formed on substrates with weak CAH, for example, copper sulfate solution on silica glass. On the contrary, a ringlike deposit is developed on substrates with strong CAH, for example, a copper sulfate solution on graphite. For surface-active solutes, however, the wetting property can be significantly altered and the ringlike stain is always visible, for example, Brij-35 solution on polycarbonate. For a mixture of surface-active and surface-inactive solutes, a combined pattern of a ringlike and concentrated stain can appear. For various polymer solutions on polycarbonate, similar results are observed. Concentrated stains are formed for weak CAH such as sodium polysulfonate, and ring-shaped patterns are developed for strong CAH such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). The stain pattern is actually determined by the competition between the time scales associated with contact line retreat and solute precipitation. The suppression of the coffee-ring effect can thus be acquired by the control of CAH. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84879249215	Trapped liquid drop in a microchannel: Multiple stable states	A liquid drop trapped in a microchannel, in which both contact angle (wettability) and opening angle (geometry) can vary with position, is investigated based on the minimization of free energy. The calculus of variation yields the Young-Laplace equation and its further integration leads to the general force balance. The equilibrium position of the trapped drop is determined by the balance between the area-mean capillary force and the area-mean hydrostatic pressure difference. Trapped liquid drops in truncated cones and hyperboloids are studied to elucidate our theory. As the volume of the drop trapped in the hydrophilic cones is increased, four regimes separated by three critical volumes are identified. The drop is either trapped at the narrow end or away from the cone top. The solution at the cone top satisfies the force balance by adjusting the upper contact angle, which is experimentally observed and verified by Surface Evolver (SE) simulations. Multiple stable states can exist in a particular regime. The hyperboloid tube in which the opening angle varies with position is also considered. As the gravitational strength is increased in hydrophilic hyperboloid, four regimes separated by three critical gravitational strengths are identified. The drop is either trapped near the neck or below the neck. Unlike hydrophilic cones, the drop stays near the neck of the hyperboloid due to varying opening angles. Multiple stable states are also observed. For both cone and hyperboloid, hydrophobic cases are studied as well and all theoretical solutions of the force balance agree well with SE simulation outcomes. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84880665772	Structural characteristics and fusion pathways of onion-like multilayered polymersome formed by amphiphilic comb-like graft copolymers	The self-assembly behavior of amphiphilic comb-like graft copolymers bearing pH-responsive hydrophilic side-chains on hydrophobic backbone in a selective solvent is investigated by dissipative particle dynamics. The aggregate exhibits a rich variety of the morphological conformations dependent on pH, polymeric concentration, side-chain length, and grafting density. The morphological phase diagram shows that micellar aggregates take shape at low pH. As pH increases, unilamellar vesicle (ULV) can form at low polymer concentration and the vesicle size grows with increasing concentration. Further increment of pH to neutral leads to the formation of multilamellar vesicles (MLV) with the layer-by-layer structure similar to that of an onion. The total number of layers rises with increasing polymer concentration. Our simulation outcomes are consistent with the experimental observations. The simulation results also reveal that as the grafting density is decreased, the thickness of the hydrophobic layer grows and thus the total number of layers declines for MLVs. The water permeation process through ULV is monitored to explore the effects of grafting density and pH on the membrane permeability. As the grafting density is decreased or the neutral pH is approached, the permeability of the vesicle membrane descends. Controlled releases of two types of drugs with different hydrophobicity situated at different layers of MLV are also examined. The release rate of hydrophilic drug is faster than that of hydrophobic drug. Polymersomes tend to fuse but the fusion mechanism is different from that of liposomes. The fusion pathway of ULVs follows the anisotropic stalk-pore scenario and both stalk and pore formation prefer to occur on the edge of the contact zone due to significant deformations of comb-like polymers in this region. The fusion pathway of MLVs is layer-by-layer and the fusion time of the inner layer is faster than that of the outer layer. The fusion process is expedited at about neutral pH but is prolonged substantially as the side-chain length is increased. Finally, it is interesting to observe that the total number of layers of the fused MLV can be greater than that of MLVs before fusion. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84881161608	Depletion-induced size fractionation of nanorod dispersions	Depletion can induce aggregation of nanoparticles and therefore has been employed for size fractionation of nanoparticle dispersions. In this study, depletion-induced separation of solvophilic nanorods in polymer solution is explored via dissipative particle dynamics. Three possible equilibrium states are observed upon polymer addition: dispersion, pre-transition (formation of clusters), and phase separation. By varying the concentration (φ<inf>R</inf>) and length (L) of nanorods or changing the system temperature (T), two morphological phase diagrams including φ<inf>R</inf>-L and φ<inf>R</inf>-T are obtained at a given polymer concentration. For a binary nanorod mixture in the pre-transition state, the cluster can be homogeneous or mixed and the latter hinders the size fractionation. According to the φ<inf>R</inf>-L phase diagram, two criteria associated with the formation of homogeneous clusters are given. Based on the criteria, two methods, dilution and temperature increment, for the improvement of fractionation resolution are proposed. This methodology can be generally applied to fractionate nanoparticle dispersions of any kind. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84885089130	An equilibrium phase diagram of drops at the bottom of a fiber standing on superhydrophobic flat surfaces	Droplet-on-fiber is commonly seen and the drop at the bottom of a rigid fiber standing vertically on a flat surface is closely related to dip-pen nanolithography. A combined approach of numerical simulation and experimental observation is conducted to investigate the equilibrium shape of a drop-on-fiber/plane system. For superhydrophobic surfaces, the equilibrium geometrical shape of the drop adopts either axisymmetric barrel or asymmetric clam-shell conformation. In contrast, for hydrophilic surfaces, the equilibrium drop shape adopts either axisymmetric bell-like or asymmetric half-bell-like conformation. At the transition between the two conformations, both conformations can coexist and the multiple steady states are indicated. In this paper, the phase diagrams of drop-on-fiber/plane, that is, the plots of the droplet volume against the liquid-fiber contact angle, are established on the basis of the finite-element simulation for liquid-plane contact angles of 70° and 165°. The general features of the phase diagrams for drop-on-fiber/plane systems in the presence of gravity are similar to those of drop-on-fiber in the absence of gravity. Three regimes, barrel only (bell-like only), clam-shell only (half-bell-like only), and coexistence, can be identified. However, on superhydrophobic surfaces, the regime of clam-shell only is deflated, since the gravitational energy benefits barrel more than clam-shell. On the other hand, on hydrophilic surfaces, the regime of bell-like only prevails owing to the spreading tendency of the drop and the coexistent regime diminishes significantly. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The aim was to investigate if the anchoring of the triple line, due to friction forces generated by dilute superficial defects, could be observed for drop impingement experiments. During the early inertially dominated spreading phase, the drops showed similar behaviors independently of the initial impact velocities. However, just after this phase, droplets impacting at low Weber numbers indeed exhibited this peculiar friction-induced pinned configuration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84894109083	The fusion mechanism of small polymersomes formed by rod-coil diblock copolymers	The fusion mechanism of polymersomes self-assembled by rod-coil copolymers is intrinsically different from that of liposomes due to the effect of chain topology on conformational entropy and molecular packing. The influences of membrane tension, coil-block length, rod-block length, mutual compatibility between the solvent and the rod-coil block, and π-π interaction strength on the fusion pathway are explored by dissipative particle dynamics. The fusion process of spontaneously formed polymersomes generally consists of four stages. In the kissing stage, hopping of rod-blocks forms a connection between two vesicles of a one-legged rod-coil copolymer. In the adhesion stage, a stalk is developed by a few link-up rods and then a stretched diaphragm with rods lying parallel to the stretching direction is formed in the hemi-fusion stage. Eventually, a pore is developed and expanded in the fusion stage. If the membrane tension (τ) is adjusted by deflation/inflation of the polymersomes, the hemi-fusion diaphragm disappears. As τ is reduced, multiple stalks take shape and lead to the formation of inverted micelles, which is the rate-determining step and raises the fusion time substantially. As τ is elevated, a neck is developed after the stalk formation. The fusion process is significantly accelerated. τ of spontaneously formed vesicles varies with the coil-block length, rod-block length, solvent quality, and π-π interaction strength. There exists a critical value of τ below which the fusion process cannot be completed and a hemi-fused polymersome is formed. In addition to τ, the anisotropic steric interactions within the rod layers also resist hopping of longer rod-blocks. The coil layers develop a barrier impeding fusion between vesicles with longer coil-blocks. Consequently, lowering the solvent quality for the coil-block or rod-block facilities the fusion process due to the formation of a thinner coil layer. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84894460715	Self-assembled polymersomes formed by symmetric, asymmetric and side-chain-tethered coil-rod-coil triblock copolymers	Self-assembly behaviors of coil-rod-coil copolymers in selective solvents are explored by dissipative particle dynamics. The morphological phase diagram as a function of rod length and coil length shows five distinct types of aggregates, including spherical micelles, worm-like micelles, disk-like aggregates, honeycomb structures, and polymersomes. Small polymersomes are formed at rather poor alignment associated with monolayered rod domains. Some of the rods are even lying perpendicular to the radial direction. For symmetric copolymers (C<inf>m</inf>R<inf>x</inf>C<inf>m</inf>), the condition of vesicle formation is restricted to short coil and rod lengths. To favor the formation of CRC-polymersomes, two architecture modifications are adopted. One is to increase the coil length asymmetrically to be C<inf>m</inf>R<inf>x</inf>C <inf>n</inf>, where n > m. The other one is to tether a T-block onto the middle of the rod-block as C<inf>m</inf>(R<inf>x</inf>T<inf>y</inf>)C <inf>m</inf> copolymers. For those CRC-polymersomes, structural, transport, and mechanical properties of the vesicular membrane are determined, including membrane thickness, area density of coil blocks, order parameter, solvent permeability, frequency of flip-flop, membrane tension, and stretching and bending moduli. The influences of the coil length (n) and tethered block length (y) on membrane properties are examined. Finally, the mechanism of membrane fusion between CRC-polymersomes is investigated. The fusion process involves four stages and in the contact region the rods lying perpendicular to the radial direction of the polymersome play the key role. The encounter of two vesicles may result in a fused, hemifused, or non-fused polymersome. The final fate is determined by the competition between membrane tension and the steric barrier of the coil corona. The fusion outcome may change if the tension is altered by manipulating the lumen pressure. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84903367739	Superhydrophilic graphite surfaces and water-dispersible graphite colloids by electrochemical exfoliation	Superhydrophilic graphite surfaces and water-dispersible graphite colloids are obtained by electrochemical exfoliation with hydrophobic graphite electrodes. Such counterintuitive characteristics are caused by partial oxidation and investigated by examining both graphite electrodes and exfoliated particles after electrolysis. The extent of surface oxidation can be explored through contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscope, electrical sheet resistance, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta-potential analyzer, thermogravimetric analysis, UV-visible, and Raman spectroscopy. The degree of wettability of the graphite anode can be altered by the electrolytic current and time. The water contact angle declines generally with increasing the electrolytic current or time. After a sufficient time, the graphite anode becomes superhydrophilic and its hydrophobicity can be recovered by peeling with adhesive tape. This consequence reveals that the anodic graphite is oxidized by oxygen bubbles but the oxidation just occurs at the outer layers of the graphite sheet. Moreover, the characteristics of oxidation revealed by UV peak shift, peak ratio between D and G bands, and negative zeta-potential indicate the presence of graphite oxide on the outer shell of the exfoliated colloids. However, thermogravimetric analysis for the extent of decomposition of oxygen functional groups verifies that the amount of oxygen groups is significantly less than that of graphite oxide prepared via Hummer method. The structure of this partially oxidized graphite may consist of a graphite core covered with an oxidized shell. The properties of the exfoliated colloids are also influenced by pH of the electrolytic solution. As pH is increased, the extent of oxidation descends and the thickness of oxidized shell decreases. Those results reveal that the degree of oxidation of exfoliated nanoparticles can be manipulated simply by controlling pH. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84905841439	Structural and mechanical characteristics of polymersomes	Polymersomes self-assembled from amphiphilic macromolecules have attracted growing attention because of their multifunctionality and stability. By controlling the structural characteristics of polymersomes, including vesicle shape, size, and membrane thickness, their mechanical and transport properties as well as their fusion behavior can be manipulated. Numerous experimental techniques have been developed to explore polymersome characteristics; however, experimental microscopic observations and knowledge of vesicles are limited. Mesoscale simulations can complement experimental studies of the vesicular features at the microscopic level and thus provide a feasible method to better understand the relationship between the fundamental structures and physicochemical properties of polymersomes. Moreover, the predictive ability of the simulation approaches may greatly assist developments and future applications of polymersomes. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84906070264	Colloidosomes formed by nonpolar/polar/nonpolar nanoball amphiphiles	Fullerene-based amphiphiles are able to form bilayer vesicles in aqueous solution. In this study, the self-assembly behavior of polymer-tethered nanoballs (NBs) with nonpolar/polar/nonpolar (n-p-n′) motif in a selective solvent is investigated by dissipative particle dynamics. A model NB bears two hydrophobic polymeric arms (n′-part) tethered on an extremely hydrophobic NB (n-part) with hydrophilic patch (p-part) patterned on its surface. Dependent on the hydrophobicity and length of tethered arms, three types of aggregates are exhibited, including NB vesicle, core-shell micelle, and segmented-worm. NB vesicles are developed for a wide range of hydrophobic arm lengths. The presence of tethered arms perturbs the bilayer structure formed by NBs. The structural properties including the order parameter, membrane thickness, and area density of the inner leaflet decrease with increasing the arm length. These results indicate that for NBs with longer arms, the extent of interdigitation in the membrane rises so that the overcrowded arms in the inner corona are relaxed. The transport and mechanical properties are evaluated as well. As the arm length grows, the permeability increases significantly because the steric bulk of tethered arms loosens the packing of NBs. By contrast, the membrane tension decreases owing to the reduction of NB/solvent contacts by the polymer corona. Although fusion can reduce membrane tension, NB vesicles show strong resistance to fusion. Moreover, the size-dependent behavior observed in small liposomes is not significant for NB vesicles due to isotropic geometry of NB. Our simulation results are consistent with the experimental findings. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84922447204	Anti-oxidative copper nanoparticles and their conductive assembly sintered at room temperature	Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) can be used as conductive inks for flexible electronics but it suffers low oxidation resistance. After reduction, CuNPs with 40. nm diameter are formed and stabilized by a capping agent. By adding oxygen scavenger, CuNPs become anti-oxidative and can be stored in an ambient condition for at least 10 months. After dilution and centrifugation, the capping agent is removed and CuNP aggregates are obtained. According to field-emission scanning electron microscopy and resistivity, CuNPs are weakly sintered by pressure difference at room temperature and therefore furnish resistivity greater than the typical value of copper. The resistivity of CuNP assemblies is insensitive to the degree of sintering which is increased by annealing.
