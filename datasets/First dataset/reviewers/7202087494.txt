84930041706	Endoscopic management for the assessment and treatment of anastomotic bleeding in laparoscopic anterior resection for rectal cancer	OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the impact of routine intraoperative endoscopy (IOE) on postoperative anastomotic bleeding of laparoscopic anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer, and to investigate the value of the IOE in terms of prevention and treatment of postoperative anastomotic bleeding. METHODS:: Medical records of the 279 cases of LAR from January 2006 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed, of which postoperative anastomotic bleeding occurred in 18. Univariate analysis was taken to determine the possible influencing factors of the bleeding. Then related influencing factors were put into the multivariate logistic regression analysis to ultimately determine the independent influencing factors of anastomotic bleeding. The efficacy of treatments to the anastomotic bleeding was also evaluated. RESULTS:: The incidence of anastomotic bleeding after LAR is 6.5% (18/279).The rates of anastomotic bleeding in lower tumor location group and upper tumor location group were 9.2% (16/173) and 1.9% (2/106), respectively, as in intraoperative colonoscopy and nonintraoperative colonoscopy group were 3.3% (5/151), and 10.2% (13/128), respectively. Comparing the location of the tumor, the coefficient of regression and relative risk value for lower tumor were 1.564 and 4.776. Comparing the intraoperative colonoscopy and nonintraoperative colonoscopy group, the value for intraoperative colonoscopy group were -1.085 and 0.338. Sex, age, tumor stage, pathologic type, and preventive ileostomy had no relevance with the anastomotic bleeding. In 18 cases of the anastomotic bleeding, 7 received conservative treatments, 9 underwent endoscopic treatment, and 2 underwent reoperation. All the 18 cases had reached hemostasis. CONCLUSION:: IOE is an independent protective factor of anastomotic bleeding after LAR. Endoscopic hemostasis is recommended for an anastomotic bleeding after LAR for rectal cancer with a stapling technique.

19944430956	Laparoscopic versus open right hemicolectomy with curative intent for colon carcinoma	Aim: Laparoscopic surgery, especially laparoscopic rectal surgery, for colorectal cancer has been developed considerably. However, due to relatively complicated anatomy and high requirements for surgery techniques, laparoscopic right colectomy develops relatively slowly. This study was designed to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (LRH) with open right hemicolectomy (ORH) in the treatment of colon carcinoma. Methods: Between September 2000 and February 2003, 30 patients with colon cancer who underwent LRH were compared with 34 controls treated by ORH in the same period. All patients were evaluated with respect to surgery-related complications, postoperative recovery, recurrence and metastasis rate, cost-effectiveness and survival. Results: Among 30 LRH, 2 (6.7%) were converted to open procedure. No significant differences were observed in terms of mean operation time, blood loss, post-operative complications, and hospital cost between LRH and ORH groups. Mean time for bowel movement, hospital stay, and time to resume early activity in the LRH group were significantly shorter than those in the ORH group (2.24±0.56 vs 3.25±1.29 d, 13.94±6.5 vs 18.25±5.96 d, 3.94±1.64 vs 5.45±1.82 d respectively, P<0.05). As to the lymph node yield, the specimen length and total cost for operation and drugs, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Local recurrence rate and metachronous metastasis rate had no marked difference between the two groups. Cumulative survival probability at 40 mo in LRH group (76.50%) was not obviously different compared to the ORH group (74.04%). Conclusion: LRH in patients with colon cancer has statistically and clinically significant advantages over ORH. Thus, LRH can be regarded as a safe and effective procedure. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

20844442461	Effects and possible anti-tumor immunity of electrochemotherapy with bleomycin on human colon cancer xenografts in nude mice	Aim: To evaluate the anti-tumor effects and possible involvement of anti-tumor immunity of electrochemotherapy (ECT) employing electroporation and bleomycin in human colon cancer xenografts in nude mice, and to establish the experimental basis for clinical application of ECT. Methods: Forty nude mice, inoculated subcutaneously human colon cancer cell line LoVo for 3 wk, were allocated randomly into four groups: B+E+ (ECT), B+E- (administration of bleomycin alone), B-E+ (administration of electric pulses alone), and B-E- (no treatment). Tumor volumes were measured daily. The animals were killed on the 7th d, the weights of xenografts were measured, and histologies of tumors were evaluated. Cytotoxicity of spleen natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells was then assessed by lactic dehydrogenase release assay. Results: The mean tumor volume of group B+E+ was statistically different from the other three groups after the treatment (F= 36.80, P<0.01). There was one case of complete response, seven cases of partial response (PR) in group B+E+, one case of PR in group B+E- and group B-E+ respectively, and no response was observed in group B-E-. The difference of response between group B+E+ and the other three groups was statistically significant (χ

22644434361	Urinary nucleosides as biological markers for patients with colorectal cancer	Aim: Fourteen urinary nucleosides, primary degradation products of tRNA, were evaluated to know the potential as biological markers for patients with colorectal cancer. Methods: The concentrations of 14 kinds of urinary nucleosides from 52 patients with colorectal cancer, 10 patients with intestinal villous adenoma and 60 healthy adults were determined by column switching high performance liquid chromatography method. Results: The mean levels of 12 kinds of urinary nucleosides (except uridine and guanosine) in the patients with colorectal cancer were significantly higher than those in patients with intestinal villous adenoma or the healthy adults. Using the levels of 14 kinds of urinary nucleosides as the data vectors for principal component analysis, 71% (37/52) patients with colorectal cancer were correctly classified from healthy adults, in which the identification rate was much higher than that of CEA method (29%). Only 10% (1/10) of patients with intestinal villous adenoma were indistinguishable from patients with colorectal cancer. The levels of m1G, Pseu and m1A were positively related with tumor size and Duke's stages of colorectal cancer. When monitoring the changes in urinary nucleoside concentrations of patients with colorectal cancer associated with surgery, it was found that the overall correlations with clinical assessment were 84% (27/32) and 91% (10/11) in response group and progressive group, respectively. Conclusion: These findings indicate that urinary nucleosides determined by column switching high performance liquid chromatography method may be useful as biological markers for colorectal cancer. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

27744566432	Effects of shark hepatic stimulator substance on the function and antioxidant capacity of liver mitochondria in an animal model of acute liver injury	This study was carried out to investigate whether shark hepatic stimulator substance (HSS) can prevent acute liver injury and affect mitochondrial function and antioxidant defenses in a rat model of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver injury. The acute liver injury was induced by two intraperitoneal injections of TAA (400 mg/kg) in a 24 h interval. In the TAA plus shark HSS group, rats were treated with shark HSS (80 mg/kg) 1 h prior to each TAA injection. In this group, serum liver enzyme activities were significantly lower than those in the TAA group. The mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was improved, and the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities were increased in the TAA plus shark HSS group. The mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme activities and glutathione level were higher in the TAA plus shark HSS group than in the TAA group. These results suggest that the protective effect of shark HSS against TAA-induced acute liver injury may be a result of the restoration of the mitochondrial respiratory function and antioxidant defenses and decreased oxygen stress. ©Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

33744962547	Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma of common bile duct: A case report and literature review	Background: Minimal access techniques have gained wide acceptance in surgical practice, but the role of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is still controversial. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy has seldom been described. In this report, we assessed the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the common bile duct. Case Report: According to imaging findings, a 71-year-old Chinese man was diagnosed with malignancy of the common bile duct, and successfully underwent laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy in our center. The operation's safety, postoperative recovery, complications, oncological clearance, and short-term follow-up results of the patient are evaluated. No severe intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. The operation time was 390 minutes, and the blood loss was about 50 ml; the flatus, time to resume early activity and hospital stay were 3, 4, and 30 days respectively. The patient remained well at a follow-up of 6 months. Conclusions: Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed feasibly and safely by surgeons with advanced laparoscopic skills, and could be considered for the treatment of common bile duct tumors. © Med Sci Monit, 2006.

33746121932	Clinical advantages of laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery in the elderly	Background and aims: Elderly patients have a high incidence of colorectal cancer, which may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to complex comorbidity and diminished cardiopulmonary reserves. The aims of this study were to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery with those observed in traditional open surgery in patients aged over 70 years. Methods: Betwe en January 2003 and October 2004, 51 patients aged over 70 years with colorectal cancer, who underwent laparoscopic surgery (LAP group), were evaluated and compared with 102 controls (also over 70 years old) treated by traditional open surgery (OPEN group) in the same period. All patients were evaluated with respect to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, surgery-related complications, and postoperative recovery. Results: No surgery-related death was observed in the LAP group, whereas two deaths occurred in the OPEN group for severe post-operative pulmonary infection and anastomotic leak, respectively. No pneumoperitoneum-related complications were observed in the LAP group; 2 (3.9%) patients required conversion to open surgery, because of the unexpectedly bulky tumor and severe adhesions in the abdominal cavity. With the increase in patients' age, increased ASA classification was observed. No significant differences were observed in gender, Dukes' staging or types of procedures between LAP and OPEN groups. The overall morbidity in the LAP group was significantly less than that of the OPEN group [17.6% (9/51) vs 37.3% (38/102), p=0.013]. Mean blood loss, time to flatus passage, and time to semi-liquid diet in the LAP group were significantly shorter than those of the OPEN group (90.7±49.9 vs 150.3±108.7 ml, 2.4±1.2 vs 3.5±2.9 d, 5.0±1.8 vs 5.9±1.2 d, respectively, p<0.05). No significant differences were observed in terms of mean operation time or hospital stay between LAP and OPEN groups. Conclusion: Laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery in elderly patients with colon cancer has clinically significant advantages over traditional open surgery, and appears to be the ideal surgical choice for the elderly. © 2006, Editrice Kurtis.

33747607473	Clinical significance of human kallikrein 10 gene expression in colorectal cancer and gastric cancer	Background and Aim: Recent evidence suggests that the human kallikrein 10 (KLK10) gene is differentially regulated in endocrine-related tumors and has potential as diagnostic and/or prognostic marker; however, KLK10 expression has never been investigated in gastrointestinal cancers. The aims of this study were to demonstrate expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms of KLK10 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC), and to correlate the relative KLK10 expression level with clinicopathological factors of CRC and GC. Methods: Between March 2004 and January 2005, 63 patients with histologically confirmed CRC and 36 with GC were recruited into the study. Using quantitative real-time (qRT) RT-PCR and Western blot, KLK10 expression in tumor and non-tumor colorectal and gastric tissues was determined at the mRNA and protein levels. KLK10 protein was localized by immunohistochemistry. The KLK10 genomic DNA from 16 cases of paired normal/cancerous colorectal tissues was PCR-amplified and examined for single nucleotide polymorphisms by direct sequencing. Results: KLK10 mRNA expression was detected by qRT in 61 of 63 (96.8%) CRC specimens and in all GC specimens. KLK10 expression was much higher in tumor tissue than in the corresponding normal mucosal tissue at the mRNA and protein levels (P < 0.01). The KLK10 mRNA expression level significantly correlated with lymphatic invasion (P = 0.034) and clinical stage of CRC (P = 0.025). The KLK10 mRNA expression level significantly correlated with the depth of GC invasion (P = 0.018), clinical stage (P = 0.045), patient sex (P = 0.027) and Lauren type of gastric cancer (P = 0.028). No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in exon 1, 2 and 5 of KLK10 gene in CRC. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in codon 50 of exon 3, GCC (alanine) to TCC (serine). The genetic changes of exon 4 were located at codon 106 [GGC (glysine) to GGA (glysine)], codon 112 [ACG (threonine) to ACC (threonine)], codon 141 [CTA (leucine) to CTG (leucine)], and codon 149 [CCG (proline) to CTG (leucine)]. All were identical in tumor and corresponding normal tissue DNA from the same individuals. Conclusion: KLK10 expression is up-regulated in CRC and GC and higher expression of KLK10 closely correlates with advanced disease stage, which predicts a poorer prognosis; however, further follow-up study is needed. © 2006 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

34347270174	Vascular endothelial growth factors C and D represent novel prognostic markers in colorectal carcinoma using quantitative image analysis	Background/Aims: Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) are potent lymphangiogenic and angiogenetic mediators in many kinds of tumors. However, the exact impacts of VEGF-C and VEGF-D on the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. The aims of this study were to demonstrate the expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D and to correlate their expression levels with clinicopathological factors and long-term survival in patients with CRC. Patients and Methods: Between January 1996 and January 1998, 69 patients with pathologically confirmed CRC who received routine follow-up at the Ruijin Hospital were included in this study. VEGF-C and VEGF-D protein expression and microvessel density of 69 surgical specimens were assessed by immunohistochemistry, with 20 samples of normal colorectal tissues as controls. All patients were followed up for 108 months or until death. The Immunohistochemical stains were quantified and analyzed by means of a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging analysis system. Results: The protein expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in tumor tissues was much higher than that in normal colorectal tissues (p < 0.01). The VEGF-C expression significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.011) and clinical stages of CRC (p < 0.01). The VEGF-D expression correlated with patient ages (p = 0.013), depth of tumor invasion (p = 0.013), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.028). The expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D was significantly correlated with the microvessel density. Both overall survival and disease-free survival at 108 months were significantly lower in the CRC patients with a high VEGF-C and/or a high VEGF-D expression, and the patients with a high expression of both VEGF-C and VEGF-D had the shortest overall survival and disease-free survival when compared with other patients. Conclusion: The VEGF-C or VEGF-D expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis and long-term prognosis and could be applied as prognostic markers in CRC. Copyright © 2007 S.

33644875559	Normal and modified urinary nucleosides represent novel biomarkers for colorectal cancer diagnosis and surgery monitoring	Background: Up to now, there is still no ideal tumor marker in early diagnosis and effective monitoring, especially for surgical resection of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the application of urinary normal and modified nucleosides in diagnosis and surgery monitoring of CRC. Methods: Between October 2002 and July 2003, 52 consecutive patients with pathological confirmed CRC were enrolled. Spontaneous urine samples were collected 1 day before surgery and on day 8 postoperatively, and 14 urinary nucleosides were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Another 62 healthy people were also studied as control. The clinical routine tumor markers, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA)199, CA125, and α-fetoprotein (AFP) of CRC patients, were correspondingly evaluated by elecctrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Results: The levels of 11 out of 14 of the determined urinary nucleosides in the CRC group were much higher than those of normal controls. Through the principal component analysis of these 14 nucleosides, 76.9% of CRC patients were correctly classified. The sensitivity of this analysis was much higher than that of CEA (38.5%), CA199 (40.4%), CA125 (15.4%), and AFP (17.3%; P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of 1-methylguanosine (m1G) and pseudouridine (Pseu) showed good sensitivity-specificity profiles of the diagnosis of CRC. The elevated levels of the nine nucleosides significantly decreased after curative resection of 40 CRC cases. The data also showed that the preoperative levels of some nucleosides were positively related with tumor size and Dukes staging of CRC. Conclusion: The evaluation of normal and modified urinary nucleosides might become novel tumor markers, which will be facilitated in the clinical setting and helpful in the diagnosis, management and follow up of CRC. Pseu and m1G may be more promising for clinical use and be worthy of further studies in the near future. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

79951570105	Direct and indirect costs and long-term survival of laparoscopic anterior resection for rectal cancer	Background: Few studies evaluate the cost-effectiveness issues of laparoscopic anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer. This study evaluates direct and indirect costs of LAR and its long-term survival rate in rectal cancer patients. Material/Methods: This prospective nonrandomized controlled trial included 2 endpoints (direct and indirect costs, and disease-free survival). From January 2003 to May 2005, rectal cancer patients admitted to our center were assigned to 2 groups: 87 patients underwent LAR (LAP), while 86 cases received open anterior resection (OPEN). The direct costs were prospectively evaluated. Main indirect cost is productivity loss. The data of direct costs, indirect costs, and the total costs were collected for the minimal cost analysis. Results: Disease-free survival at 65 months in the LAP group and the OPEN group was 78.2% and 74.7%; there was no significant difference between the groups. Median direct costs were not significantly different between the LAP and the OPEN groups. Indirect costs of the LAP group were significantly lower than those of the OPEN group, while total costs were not significantly different. Cost percentage for operations, medications, and hospitalization were 75.90%, 11.28%, and 2.18% in the LAP group; while in the operation group, they were 54.50%, 29.09%, and 3.35%. Conclusions: Total economic budget for a patient receiving LAR was not significantly increased compared with the conservative method owing to its technical predominance, oncologic safety, as well as frequent bed turnover. © Med Sci Monit, 2010.

84877705173	Long-term results of laparoscopy-assisted radical right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy: Clinical analysis with 177 cases	Purposes: To study the feasibility, safety, and short-/long-term outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy for colon cancer. Methods: The clinical data of 177 cases that underwent laparoscopy-assisted radical right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy for colon cancer between Jun 2003 and Sep 2010 was collected; the safety of operation, status of recovery, complication, oncological outcomes, and results of short-/long-term follow-up were analyzed. Results: No case died in this study; five cases (2.82 %) were converted to open surgery. Four cases (2.26 %) underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. The average operation time was 133 ± 36 min, and the blood loss was 94 ± 34 ml. The average time for passage of flatus, liquid food eating, and hospitalization were 2.1 ± 0.7, 3.2 ± 0.5, and 10.4 ± 2.7 day, respectively. The total number of lymph nodes removed was 15.2 ± 10.1. Postoperative complications were observed in 23 of 177 patients (12.99 %). The median follow-up period was 54 months; port-site recurrence was observed in one patient; local recurrence was found in five cases (2.82 %); distant metastasis was found in 21 cases (11.86 %). The cumulative overall survival of all stages at 12, 36, 60, and 72 months was 97.18 %, 83.73 %, 70.37 %, and 68.99 %, respectively. The cancer-specific survival was 98.73 % (12 months), 87.81 % (36 months), and 80.17 % (60 months). Conclusions: Laparoscopy-assisted right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy can be successfully performed for right colon cancer with the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. Moreover, the results implied appropriate short- and long-term outcomes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84887359682	Up-regulation of type I collagen during tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer revealed by quantitative proteomic analysis	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. The discovery of non-invasive biomarker candidates for diagnosis and prognosis is important for the management of CRC. In this study, we performed proteomic profiling of serum from patients with different stages of CRC using a 2D-LC-MS/MS based approach combined with the APEX quantitative method. 917 proteins were identified and 93 were differentially expressed in normal and three patient groups (stages I, II and III). These proteins were predominantly involved in cell adhesion, immune response, coagulation process and metabolism. Importantly, we found collagen I dynamically changed from stages I to IV, with maximum expression in stage II, as detected in serum by MS analysis. Expression of collagen I was also validated in tumor tissues from the same group of CRC patients by real-time PCR and western blotting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that serum levels of collagen I degradation telopeptide (CTx) are correlated with staging and poor disease-free survival of CRC patients by ELISA analysis. These results suggest (1) serum proteomics may reflect biological changes in colorectal tumor tissues and (2) altered collagen I expression may be an early event in CRC tumorigenesis and CTx may provide additional information for prognosis of CRC. Biological significance: In this work, we performed a systematic characterization of serum proteomic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC) with different stages using a LC-MS based approach combined with the APEX quantitative method, attempting to gain overview of relevant proteins in tumorigenesis and discover non-invasive CRC-derived markers. We found a significant up-regulation of collagen I based on the proteomics data, and confirmed its expression in tissue and serum of the same group of patients. In addition, we also demonstrated that serum levels of collagen I degradation telopeptide (CTx) are correlated with the staging and poor survival rate of CRC. Those findings imply that alternation of collagen I might be an early event during tumorigenesis of CRC, and might contribute to the metastasis of CRC under the degradation regulated by some specific proteases. This work provides evidence for the clinical application of serum proteomics, and would aid the understanding of the role of the ECM in the clinical progression of CRC. © 2013.

84898011248	E2A predicts prognosis of colorectal cancer patients and regulates cancer cell growth by targeting miR-320a	Background and objective: Transcriptional factor E2A is crucial for the normal development and differentiation of B and T lymphocytes. Dysregulation of E2A leads to leukemia and tumorigenesis of some solid tumors. The expression and clinical significance of E2A as well as its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still unknown. This study aims to assess E2A expression in CRC tissues, evaluate its prognosis value, and investigate its role in colon cancer cell growth. Methods: E2A expression in CRC tissues and normal mucosa was detected by immunohistochemical staining; Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the prognostic value of E2A. Lentivirus was used to construct E2A stably knocked-down cells. MTT assay was employed to detect cell proliferation change; cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry; and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to validate the predicted binding target of E2A. Results: Expression of E2A was lower in CRC tissues than normal mucosa; low E2A expression correlated with advanced TNM stage and larger tumor size, and predicted poor prognosis of CRC patients. E2A knockdown resulted in increased cell proliferation rate and cell cycle acceleration. ChIP assay showed miR-320a was a direct target of E2A and upregulation of miR-320a in E2A downregulated cells could reverse cell proliferation and cell cycle changes caused by E2A deficiency. Conclusions: E2A is an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients and targets miR-320a to regulate cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. © 2014 Huang et al.

43549111181	High-level expression of recombinant human nerve growth factor beta in milk of nontransgenic rabbits	The technology for the large-scale production of therapeutic recombinant proteins remains a challenge in the biopharmaceutical industry. In this study, we reported a nontransgenic approach to producing a large quantity of human nerve growth factor beta (hNGF-β) in rabbit milk by employing a recombinant adenoviral expression system. After directly instilling hNGF-β recombinant adenoviruses into rabbit mammary glands, a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 13.2 kDa was detected in rabbit milk. The maximal expression level of hNGF-β reached 346 μg/ml. The biological activity of recombinant hNGF-β was confirmed using PC12 cells and cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons from chicken embryos. Our data suggest that instilling recombinant adenovirus directly into the mammary gland of mammals is an efficient approach to producing a large quantity of hNGF-β. © 2008 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

54949151907	Aberrant expression and demethylation of γ-synuclein in colorectal cancer, correlated with progression of the disease	Recent evidence suggests that γ-synuclein is abnormally expressed in a high percentage of tumor tissues of diversified cancer types, but rarely expressed in tumor-matched non-neoplastic adjacent tissues (NNAT). The molecular mechanism of CpG island demethylation may underlie aberrant γ-synuclein expression. To fully understand the roles of aberrant γ-synuclein expression and demethylation in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), we examined the expression and methylation status of γ-synuclein in 67 CRC samples, 30 NNAT samples, and five CRC cell lines as well. By using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry analyses, γ-synuclein expression was detected in both HT-29 and HCT116 cells, and was much higher in CRC samples than in NNAT samples (P < 0.05). The demethylating agent, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, can induce re-expression of γ-synuclein in COLO205, LoVo, and SW480 cells. Unmethylated γ-synuclein alleles were detected in HT-29, HCT116, and LoVo cells by nested methylation-specific PCR, and the demethylated status of γ-synuclein was much higher in CRC samples than in NNAT samples by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (P < 0.05). The results of genomic bisulfite DNA sequencing further confirmed that the aberrant γ-synuclein expression in CRC was primarily attributed to the demethylation of CpG island. The protein expression and demethylation status of γ-synuclein in 67 CRC samples correlated with clinical stage, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. These findings suggest an involvement of aberrant γ-synuclein expression and demethylation in progression of CRC, especially in advanced stages. © 2008 Japanese Cancer Association.

54349095650	Simultaneous laparoscopy-assisted low anterior resection and distal gastrectomy for synchronous carcinoma of rectum and stomach	Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer or gastric cancer has been advocated for the benefits of a reduced morbidity, a shorter treatment time, and similar outcomes. However, simultaneous laparoscopy-assisted low anterior resection and distal gastrectomy for synchronous carcinoma of rectum and stomach are rarely documented in literature. Endoscopic examination revealed a synchronous carcinoma of rectum and stomach in a 55-year-old male patient with rectal bleeding and epigastric discomfort. He underwent a simultaneous laparoscopy-assisted low anterior resection and distal gastrectomy with regional lymph nodes dissected. The operation time was 270 min and the estimated blood loss was 120 mL. The patient required parenteral analgesia for less than 24 h. Flatus was passed on postoperative day 3, and a solid diet was resumed on postoperative day 7. He was discharged on postoperative day 13. With the advances in laparoscopic technology and experience, simultaneous resection is an attractive alternative to a synchronous gastrointestinal cancer. © 2008 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

63949087765	Different roles of galectin-9 isoforms in modulating E-selectin expression and adhesion function in LoVo colon carcinoma cells	Galectin-9, a member of galectin family, plays multiple roles in a variety of cellular functions, including cell adhesion, aggregation, and apoptosis. Galectin-9 also has three isoforms (named galectin-9L, galectin-9M, and galectin-9S), but whether these isoforms differ in their functions remains poorly understood. In this study, we showed that transient expression of galectin-9L decreased E-selectin levels, while transient expression of galectin-9M or galectin-9S increased E-selectin levels in LoVo cells, which do not express endogenous galectin-9. We also found that over-expression of three galectin-9 isoforms led to increased attachment of LoVo cells to extracellular matrix proteins respectively, while over-expression of galectin-9M or galectin-9S increased the adhesion of LoVo cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. In summary, these findings indicate that different isoforms of galectin-9 exhibit distinct biological functions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

67649528416	Expression of recombinant human nerve growth factor beta in milk of goats by recombinant replication-defective adenovirus	For producing a large quantity of human nerve growth factor beta (hNGF-β), the recombinant adenovirus containing an expression cassette of hNGF-β complementary DNA gene was constructed and then instilled directly into goats' mammary glands. The recombinant hNGF-β was detected in the milk. The maximal expression level of recombinant hNGF-β in the milk reached 196.8 mg/l. The biological activity of the recombinant hNGF-β, compared with the commercial hNGF-β, was tested using PC12 cells. The results demonstrate that instilling recombinant adenovirus directly into the mammary gland of goat is an efficient approach to producing a large quantity of hNGF-β.

67651252158	Chapter 2 Urinary Markers in Colorectal Cancer	Colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Studies have demonstrated that patient outcome is substantially influenced by cancer stage at the time of diagnosis. For example, patients with early stage colorectal have a significant higher 5-year survival rates compared to patients diagnosed at late stage. Thus, it is important to develop effective methods for early diagnosis as well as for precise staging of this disease process. Although traditional colonoscopy remains the most effective means to diagnose colorectal cancer, this approach generally suffers from poor patient compliance. As such, it is imperative to develop accurate and specific tests that utilize a more convenient approaches including urine examination. Urine collection is noninvasive, requires no presampling preparation, and substantially improves compliance. Recent advances in metabolomics, analytical techniques, and data analysis have tremendous potential for application in diagnostic pathology including identification of novel urinary markers in colorectal cancer. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

70349898797	Intraoperative cholangiography and laparoscopic ultrasonography are complementary in the detection of occult choledocholithiasis	Background: There is still debate about the utility of intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) or laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) for the detection of occult choledocholithiasis during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).The aim of this study was to assess the value of IOC combined with LUS in detecting occult common bile duct (CBD) stones at LC. Material/Methods: From Dec 2002 to Aug 2006, 103 patients with moderate risk of CBD stones underwent IOC and LUS simultaneously during LC. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated and compared with those of the gold standard. Results: The success rates of IOC and LUS were 91.3% and 100%, respectively, and the time required for LUS was significantly shorter (P<0.01). The visualization of the intrapancreatic part of the CBD by IOC (97.3%) was significantly higher than by LUS (73.8%). The sensitivities, specificities, accuracies, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios identifying occult CBD stones were 75.0%, 98.7%, 92.2%, 95.5%, 91.4%, 57.7, and 0.253 by IOC and 82.1%, 98.7%, 94.2%, 95.8%, 93.7%, 63.2, and 0.181 by IUS, respectively. The McNemar test showed no significant difference between the two methods. The sensitivity of IOC combined with LUS was 92.9%, which was greater than that of IOC and LUS taken separately. Conclusions: LUS is usually performed in cases where IOC has failed or is contraindicated. The combination of both methods maximizes the intraoperative detection of occult CBD stones and should at least be recommended as two complementary methods. © Med Sci Monit, 2009.

70350784327	Modulated T-complex protein 1 ζ and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B are two novel indicators for evaluating lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer: Evidence from proteomics and bioinformatics	Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is an important indicator for systematic therapy, which could increase the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, effective clinical evaluation for LNM is still absent to date. In this study, protein expression profiles of CRC tissues were compared between patients with and without LNM. Based on average expression level, 12 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the CRC tissues with LNM, whose discrimination reliability was confirmed by PCA. With stepwise linear discriminant analysis, T-complex protein 1ζ subunit and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) were identified as two main contributors for separating CRC tissues with positive LNM from those negative ones in both original-grouped and cross-validated-grouped cases, which was also supported in subsequent linear support vector machine analysis. In addition, the expression alterations of the two proteins were verified by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Functional studies also confirmed the role of PPIB in migration and invasion of cancer cells. Taken together, the down-regulated T-complex protein 1 ζ subunit and up-regulated PPIB were identified as two promising indicators for the clinical evaluation of LNM in CRC patients. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods: HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations (0-80 μmol/L) of GHSC-73. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. Cell cycle distribution was assessed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide (PI) staining. Expression of the S phase associated genes GADD153, cyclin D1, cyclin A2, DHFR, TYMS, and p21 was determined by real-time RT-PCR before and after GHSC-73 treatment.

71349086735	2′-epi-2′-O-Acetylthevetin B extracted from seeds of Cerbera manghas L. induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells	2′-epi-2′-O-Acetylthevetin B (GHSC-74) is a cardiac glycoside isolated from the seeds of Cerbera manghas L. We have demonstrated that GHSC-74 reduced the viability of HepG2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The present study was designed to explore cellular mechanisms whereby GHSC-74 led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Cell cycle flow cytometry demonstrated that HepG2 cells treated with GHSC-74 (4 μM) resulted in S and G2 phase arrest in a time-dependent manner, as confirmed by mitotic index analysis. G2 phase arrest was accompanied with down-regulation of CDC2 and Cyclin B1 protein. Furthermore, GHSC-74-induced apoptotic killing, as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation, DAPI staining, and flow cytometric detection of sub-G1 DNA content in HepG2 cells. GHSC-74 treatment resulted in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, activation of caspase-9, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrion to the nucleus in HepG2 cells. Nevertheless, after GHSC-74 exposure, no significant Fas and FasL up-regulation was observed in HepG2 cells by flow cytometry. In addition, treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk partially prevented apoptosis but did not abrogate GHSC-74-induced nuclear translocation of AIF. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GHSC-74 inhibited growth of HepG2 cells by inducing S and G2 phase arrest of the cell cycle and by triggering apoptosis via mitochondrial disruption including both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways, and ROS generation. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

73449105750	Expression of γ-synuclein in colorectal cancer tissues and its role on colorectal cancer cell line HCT116	AIM: To investigate the expression pattern of γ-synuclein in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, and to study the effects of γ-synuclein on CRC cell line HCT116 biological features in vitro . METHODS: The expression pattern of γ-synuclein was determined in 54 CRC tissues and 30 tumor-matched nonneoplastic adjacent tissues (NNAT) 5 cm away from the tumor via real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. The relationship between γ-synuclein protein expression and clinicopathological factors of CRC tissues was analyzed. Three small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting γ-synuclein mRNA plasmids were constructed and transfected into the CRC cell line HCT116. The stable cell lines were selected with G-418 for 28 d, and the biological features of these cells were examined by cell growth curve, soft agar assay, and cell migration and invasion assays in vitro . RESULTS: The expression of γ-synuclein mRNA and protein was much higher in CRC tissue samples than in NNAT samples (P = 0.02, P = 0.036). There was a significant correlation between the γ-synuclein protein expression and clinical stage and lymph node involvement of CRC (P = 0.02, P = 0.033). In functional analysis we found that down-regulation of γ-synuclein expression in HCT116 cells could inhibit the growth, colony formation rate, and migration and invasion ability of HCT116 cells. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of γ-synuclein in CRC tissues and the biological effects of reduced γ-synuclein expression on HCT116 cells suggest that γ-synuclein may play a positive role in the progression of CRC. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

76649098026	Expression of α-, β- and γ-synuclein in colorectal cancer, and potential clinical significance in progression of the disease	The synucleins (α-, β- and γ-synuclein) are a small, soluble, highly conserved group of neuronal proteins that attracted considerable attention due to their involvement in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In this study, we examined the synuclein exprsssion in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, tumor-matched non-neoplastic adjacent tissues (NNAT), and CRC cell lines, and then investigated clinical significance of synucleins. By using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, synuclein mRNA expression was detected in eight CRC cell lines. It was much higher in CRC samples than in NNAT samples (P<0.05). The results of Western blotting showed that the levels of synucleins protein expression in CRC cells approximately corresponded to the levels of synuclein mRNA expression. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that γ-synuclein protein expression was up-regulated in CRC samples compared to NNAT samples (P=0.022), and was significantly correlated with clinical stage and lymph node involvement of CRC (P<0.05). Although, there was no significant difference in either α- or β-synuclein protein expression between tumor and normal samples (P>0.05), often more than one form of synuclein was expressed in a tumor sample. More ratios of later stage and lymph node-positive tumors expressed a least one type of synuclein protein, and more ratios showed positive for either α or γ-synuclein expression, as well as positive either for β or γ-synuclein in more ratios of lymph node-positive tumors. These results show that α-, β- and γ-synuclein are expressed in a high percentage of CRC. γ-synuclein protein is valuable for evaluation of progression of CRC, and it is more sensitive to predict advanced stage and lymph node invasion by detection of γ-synuclein protein combined with either α- or β-synuclein protein or both than by detection of γ-synuclein only.

77956514340	P21-activated protein kinase 1 induces colorectal cancer metastasis involving ERK activation and phosphorylation of FAK at Ser-910	Pak1 has been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer, but the role of Pak1 in colorectal cancer remains unclear. In this study, Pak1 expression and activity were associated with aggressive behavior of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of Pak1 increased colorectal cancer cell motility and invasion, whereas down-regulation of Pak1 expression or activity reduced colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion. In addition, activated Pak1 inhibited stress fiber and focal adhesion complex formation in colorectal cancer cells and led to formation of motile phenotypes. Importantly, activated Pak1 elicited phosphorylation of FAK at Ser-910 via an ERK-dependent pathway in colorectal cancer cell lines and clinical samples. In conclusion, our results suggest that activated Pak1 regulates colorectal cancer metastasis requiring an ERK-dependent phosphorylation of FAK at Ser-910.

77956518768	Urinary metabolic profiling of colorectal carcinoma based on online affinity solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography and ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most commonly encountered cancer and fourth cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Abundant studies have demonstrated that one of the best effective therapies for enhancing the 5-year survival rate of patients is to diagnose the disease at an early stage. Urine metabonomics is widely being utilized as an efficient platform to investigate the metabolic changes and discover the potential biomarkers of malignant diseases. In this study both ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and online affinity solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography (SPE-HPLC) were used to analyze the urinary metabolites from 34 healthy volunteers, 34 benign colorectal tumor and 50 colorectal carcinoma patients to produce comprehensive metabolic profiling data. A reliable separation between the control and disease groups as well as significantly changed metabolites were obtained from orthogonal signal correction partial least squares models which were built based on the two separate data sets from UPLC-MS and affinity SPE-HPLC, respectively. 15 metabolites, showing the metabolic disorders of CRC, were identified finally. These metabolites were found to be related to glutamine metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, nucleotide biosynthesis and protein metabolism. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

77957586820	Laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal carcinoma: Complications and management in 132 consecutive patients	AIM: To analyze the clinical manifestations and risk factors of complications in laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer patients. METHODS: A series of 132 consecutive patients who received laparoscopic LAR for rectal cancer in our center were included. The etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of rectal cancer were studied among the patients with surgery-related complications using both univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: No conversion to open surgery was observed and 5 cases converted to hand-assisted laparoscopic operation. The overall morbidity rate was 20.5%. Complications occurred during the operation in 7 patients (5.3%), within 30 postoperative days in 24 patients (18.2%), and within 3 mo in 2 patients (1.5%). The most significant complications were anastomotic leakage (9.1%) and anastomotic hemorrhage (5.3%). Size and location of tumor, pathological staging and preoperative nutrition were significant factors associated with LAR complications, while gender, age and pathological type showed no relevance. Binary logistics regression showed that the size and location of tumor, and pathological staging were independent factors of laparoscopic LAR. All the complications were treated during their onset of clinical manifestations by interventional or conservative therapy. CONCLUSION: Anastomotic leakage is a major complication in laparoscopic LAR. The complications may be associated with tumor size and site, and pathological stage. Interventional therapies are of value in the management of laparoscopic LAR complications. © 2010 Baishideng.

77958016919	Laparoscopic treatment for small intestinal bleeding: A report of 77 cases	Background: Morbidity of small intestinal disease is rare and the associated lesion is hard to be detected due to lack of specific manifestations and effective diagnostic approaches. Hematochezia and melena are the most common symptoms in small intestinal diseases. Hence, small intestinal disease is an important differential diagnosis when hematochezia or melena occurs, especially when gastric and colonic diseases are excluded. As the small intestinal lesion is hard to be located preoperatively, laparotomy used to be performed without a preoperative location. This might lead to related postoperative complications. With the development of laparoscopic technique, laparoscopic operations are more frequently applied to surgical disease, despite their benign or malignant nature. Generally, almost all kinds of small intestinal disease can be treated with laparoscopic surgery. Methods: Clinical data of 77 patients with small intestinal bleeding undergoing laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted operations from April 2003 to December 2008 were included, and their clinical information were analyzed retrospectively. Results: No intraoperative complication or conversion was observed in all cases. The mean operative time, mean estimated blood loss, and mean size of incision were 78.3±30.5 minutes, 17.5±9.8mL, and 3.3±1.9cm, respectively. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 patients, including 2 cases of adhesive ileus, 1 case of gastric retention, and 1 case of anastomotic bleeding. All of them were cured by nonoperative management. The mean flatus time was 2 days after operation and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. There was 1 case of gastrointestinal stromal tumor with local recurrence and hepatic metastasis. Four patients died from metastasis of malignant tumors during the follow-up from 2 to 70 months after operations. No trocar site or wound recurrences were noted. Conclusions: Laparoscopic treatment in small intestinal bleeding is feasible, safe, and minimally invasive. It may be widely used in the future for its good therapeutic outcomes and improved diagnostic chance in small intestinal bleeding diseases. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

78649310749	Long-term outcome of laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for middle and low rectal cancer	This study aimed to assess the feasibility and long-term outcome of laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for middle and lower rectal cancer. Retrospective assessment was performed on 612 patients with middle and low rectal cancer in the surgery department of our hospital. Three-hundred and three patients underwent laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME), and 309 patients underwent open TME (OTME). All the data regarding patient details, operative variables and the short-and long-term outcomes were collected and compared. The sphincter-preserving rates of the two groups were similar. The conversion rate in LTME was 2.31% (seven cases). Fourteen cases (6.67%) of protective diverting stoma were fashioned in the LTME group compared with 57 cases (26.64%) in the OTME group. The postoperative morbidity was the same in these two groups, while the postoperative period until bowel movement and hospital discharge was shorter in the LTME group (P < 0.01). The median follow-up period was 34 (681) months for the LTME group and 36 (681) months for the OTME group. Local recurrence rates, the five-year disease-free survival rate and the five-year overall survival rate showed no difference between the two groups. Laparoscopic surgery is feasible and safe in patients with middle and lower rectal caner and can provide favorable short-term and long-term outcomes. © 2010 Informa Healthcare.

This study evaluates direct and indirect costs of LAR and its long-term survival rate in rectal cancer patients. Material/Methods: This prospective nonrandomized controlled trial included 2 endpoints (direct and indirect costs, and disease-free survival). From January 2003 to May 2005, rectal cancer patients admitted to our center were assigned to 2 groups: 87 patients underwent LAR (LAP), while 86 cases received open anterior resection (OPEN). The direct costs were prospectively evaluated. Main indirect cost is productivity loss. The data of direct costs, indirect costs, and the total costs were collected for the minimal cost analysis. Results: Disease-free survival at 65 months in the LAP group and the OPEN group was 78.2% and 74.7%; there was no significant difference between the groups. Median direct costs were not significantly different between the LAP and the OPEN groups. Indirect costs of the LAP group were significantly lower than those of the OPEN group, while total costs were not significantly different. Cost percentage for operations, medications, and hospitalization were 75.90%, 11.28%, and 2.18% in the LAP group; while in the operation group, they were 54.50%, 29.09%, and 3.35%. Conclusions: Total economic budget for a patient receiving LAR was not significantly increased compared with the conservative method owing to its technical predominance, oncologic safety, as well as frequent bed turnover. © Med Sci Monit.

79955064352	Laparoscopic gastric resection approaches for gastrointestinal stromal tumors of stomach	Purpose: To evaluate laparoscopic gastric resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Gist). Methods: From June, 2003 to October, 2009, 56 patients with gastric GIST who underwent laparoscopic gastric resection were retrospectively reviewed, and their surgical procedure, perioperative outcomes, pathology, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Results: All patients underwent laparoscopic gastric resection successfully, including 33 laparoscopic wedge resections, 19 laparoscopic transgastric tumor-everting resections, 3 laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomies, and 1 laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic resection. The operative approaches performed were mostly based on the tumor location. No conversions were observed. The mean operative duration was 90 minutes (30 to 210 min), blood loss was 55 mL (5 to 180 mL), time for passage of flatus was 2 days (1 to 11 d), and the postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (3 to 13 d). The resection margin was microscopic negative. After 21.5 months (6 to 76 mo) of follow-up, there was no operative recurrence and metastasis. Conclusions: Laparoscopic gastric resection for selective cases of gastric GISTs is safe, feasible, and effective. Laparoscopic wedge resection procedure is the first choice for most GISTs located in fundus and anterior wall, laparoscopic transgastric tumor-everting resection procedure can be used in cases with the tumor located in esophagogastric junction area and in posterior wall of the stomach as well. For antral tumors, laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy should be performed. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

79955714445	A novel antioestrogen agent (3R,6R)-bassiatin inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by repressing cyclin D1 expression in 17β-oestradiol-treated MCF-7 cells	Bassiatin [(3R,6R)-bassiatin] was isolated from the endogenous fungus Fusarium oxysporum J8-1-2. We found that oestrogen-dependent cell growth was inhibited by bassiatin in MCF-7 ERα (oestrogen receptor α)-positive breast cancer cells. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of ERα and the oestrogen-responsive gene cyclin D1 were down-regulated by bassiatin in the presence of 17β-oestradiol. Co-treatment of 17β-oestradiol and bassiatin increased phospho-cyclin D1 (Thr286), an indicator of cyclin D1 phosphorylation-dependent degradation. However, this effect was not obvious in the absence of 17β-oestradiol, suggesting that bassiatin may play a role in the metabolism of cyclin D1 by decreasing cyclin D1 protein expression in the presence of 17β-oestradiol.

Salinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of breast CSCs. Methods: The human CRC cell lines HT29 and SW480 were treated with salinomycin and oxaliplatin. Cell viability was determined with cell counting kit 8. Fraction of CD133+ cell subpopulations was assessed by Flow Cytometric analysis. Clonogenecity and migration were determined with soft agar and Boyden chamber assays. Molecular changes were assessed by immunofluorescence staining, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. Results: We report that salinomycin reduces the proportion of CD133+ subpopulations in human CRC HT29 and SW480 cells. Furthermore, salinomycin treatment decreases colony-forming ability and cell motility in HT29 cells. Moreover, salinomycin downregulates the expression of vimentin and induces the E-cadherin expression in HT29 cells. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability of salinomycin to selectively target "CD133+" cell subpopulations and decrease the malignant traits in colorectal cancer lines. © 2011 Society of Surgical Oncology.

Neriifolin reduced viability of HepG2 cells, induced S and G2/M phase arrests of the cell cycle, and stimulated apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Stimulation of HepG2 cells with neriifolin induced activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and up-regulated expression of Fas and FasL proteins.

84863024905	Distinct urinary metabolic profile of human colorectal cancer	A full spectrum of metabolic aberrations that are directly linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) at early curable stages is critical for developing and deploying molecular diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that will significantly improve patient survival. We have recently reported a urinary metabonomic profiling study on CRC subjects (n = 60) and health controls (n = 63), in which a panel of urinary metabolite markers was identified. Here, we report a second urinary metabonomic study on a larger cohort of CRC (n = 101) and healthy subjects (n = 103), using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Consistent with our previous findings, we observed a number of dysregulated metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, urea cycle, pyrimidine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, polyamine metabolism, as well as gut microbial-host co-metabolism in CRC subjects. Our findings confirm distinct urinary metabolic footprints of CRC patients characterized by altered levels of metabolites derived from gut microbial-host co-metabolism. A panel of metabolite markers composed of citrate, hippurate, p-cresol, 2-aminobutyrate, myristate, putrescine, and kynurenate was selected, which was able to discriminate CRC subjects from their healthy counterparts. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of these markers resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.993 and 0.998 for the training set and the testing set, respectively. These potential metabolite markers provide a novel and promising molecular diagnostic approach for the early detection of CRC. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

METHODS: The human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines HT29 and SW480 were treated with nigericin or oxaliplatin under the conditions specified. Cell viability assay and invasion and metastasis assay were performed to evaluate the effect of nigericin on CRC cells.Sphere-forming assay and soft agar colony-forming assay were implemented to assess the action of nigericin on the cancer stem cell properties of CRC cells undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). RESULTS: Compared with oxaliplatin, nigericin showed more toxicity for the HT29 cell line (IC50, 12.92 ± 0.25 μmol vs 37.68 ± 0.34 μmol).A similar result was also obtained with the SW116 cell line (IC50, 15.86 ± 0.18 μmol vs 41.02 ± 0.23 μmol).A Boyden chamber assay indicated that a significant decrease in the number of HT29 cells migrating through polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was observed in the nigericin-treated group, relative to the vehicle-treated group [11 ± 2 cells per high-power field (HPF) vs 19.33 ± 1.52 cells per HPF, P < 0.05].Compared to the control group, the numbers of HT29 cells invading through the Matrigel-coated membrane also decreased in the nigericin-treated group (6.66 ± 1.52 cells per HPF vs 14.66 ± 1.52 cells per HPF, P < 0.05).Nigericin also reduced the proportion of CD133

However, the role of Pak1 in gastric cancer metastasis remains unclear. Here, we showed that Pak1 is overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues from 74 patients by immunohistochemistry. Overexpression of Pak1 was associated with metastasis and prognosis of gastric cancer. In addition, overexpression of Pak1 increased gastric cancer cell motility and invasion, whereas downregulation of Pak1 expression reduced gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. In further study, data showed that activated Pak1 inhibited stress fiber and focal adhesion complex formation in gastric cancer cells and led to the formation of motile phenotypes. Importantly, activated Pak1 elicited phosphorylation of the ERK and JNK-dependent pathway in gastric cancer cell lines. In conclusion, our results suggest that Pak1 is overexpressed in gastric cancer and plays an important role in the metastasis of gastric cancer. The mechanism by which Pak1 induces cancer metastasis may involve activation of ERK and JNK.

84863553403	Polo-like kinase 1 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and participates in the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells	Background:Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is an important molecule in proliferation of many human cancers. The aim of study is to clarify the expression patterns and potential function of PLK1 in colorectal cancers. Material/Methods: Fifty-six colorectal cancers samples were collected and arranged onto a tissue array and the expression of PLK1 were detected by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics and expression of PCNA. Expression of PLK1 in 9 colorectal cancer cells lines was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot, then SW1116 cells lines were treated with PLK1 siRNA and the efficiency was examined by Western blot. Transwell test was applied to detect the migration and invasion capability of cancer cells by counting the number of cells passing through the membranes. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Annexin-V Kit. Results: PLK1 was positively expressed in 73.2% (41/56) of colorectal cancers tissues, but in only 3.6% (2/56) of normal tissues, and was associated with Duke's stage (P<0.01), tumor size (P<0.01), invasion extent (P<0.05) and lymphatic metastasis (P<0.01). The expression of PLK1 was correlated with expression of PCNA (R=0.553, P<0.01). PLK1 was inhibited in SW1116 cells by treating with PLK1 siRNA oligos, which resulted in a decreased number of cells passing through the membrane as compared with control groups (P<0.01) at 24 hours after transfection. Cell proliferation was inhibited from 48 hours after transfection, while cells apoptosis was induced from 72 hours after transfection. Conclusions: PLK1 could be a progression marker for colorectal cancer patients and PLK1 depletion can inhibit migration and invasion capability of colorectal cancer cells SW1116, suggesting that PLK1 might be involved in metastasis and invasion of colorectal cancer. Therapeutic strategies targeting PLK1 may be a new approach to colorectal cancer. © Med Sci Monit.

84865097993	Colorectal cancer migration and invasion initiated by microRNA-106a	MicroRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of several cellular signaling pathways of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Although emerging evidence proves that microRNA (miR)-106a is expressed highly in primary tumor and stool samples of CRC patients; whether or not miR-106a mediates cancer metastasis is unknown. We show here that miR-106a is highly expressed in metastatic CRC cells, and regulates cancer cell migration and invasion positively in vitro and in vivo. These phenotypes do not involve confounding influences on cancer cell proliferation. MiR-106a inhibits the expression of transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2), leading to increased CRC cell migration and invasion. Importantly, miR-106a expression levels in primary CRCs are correlated with clinical cancer progression. These observations indicate that miR-106a inhibits the anti-metastatic target directly and results in CRC cell migration and invasion. © 2012 Feng et al.

84871613593	Laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) with medial access for right-hemi colon cancer: Feasibility and technical strategies	Objective This study was designed to investigate the feasibility and technical strategies of laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) for right-hemi colon cancer. Methods: The clinical and pathological findings of 64 patients with right-hemi colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic CME between March 2010 and September 2011 were collected retrospectively. Among them, 35 cases were eligible for the final analysis through various screening factors. The quality of surgery also was assessed by reviewing the recorded video obtained through the operations in terms of specimen anatomic planes and completeness of the excised mesocolon. Results: Laparoscopic CME is focused on applying the concept of enveloped visceral and parietal planes during the operations. Laparoscopic approach proceeds with medial access where the dissection starts at ileocolic vessel before proceeds along with the superior mesenteric vessel. The access also emphasized en bloc resection of mesocolon without defections to the planes. Besides, lymph node resections at the root of ileocolic; right colic and middle colic vessels are necessary for ileocecum cancer. Cancers at the hepatic flexure requires further dissection of subpy- loric lymph nodes and of greater omentum that is within 15 cm of the tumor and along the greater curvature. Thirtyfive cases were evaluated as good plane. The median total number of central lymph nodes retrieved was 19 (range, 15-25) and central lymph node metastasis was found in 5 of all stage III cases. The median operation time was 2.6 h and the blood loss was 80 mL. The median time for passage of flatus and hospitalization were 2 and 12 days respectively. Complications were observed in three cases. Conclusions: CME is a novel concept for colon cancer surgery and might be a standard for the procedure. Laparoscopic CME with medial access is technically feasible and randomized trials are needed to evaluate its long-term outcomes. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84872357477	Feasibility of incremental laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair development in china: An 11-year experience	Background: Our objective was to investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair during its developmental phases in China. Study Design: The clinical data of 2,056 patients (2,473 hernias) who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair at Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center between January 2001 and December 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The operation priority was used to divide the patients into 7 groups for analysis of the learning curve. Results: There were 1,005 transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repairs (TAPP), 1,458 total extraperitoneal repairs (TEP), and 10 intraperitoneal onlay mesh repairs performed on 874, 1,175, and 7 patients, respectively. Median follow-up period was 60 months. The operation time and postoperative hospital stay for TEP were considerably shorter than those for TAPP. The complication rate for TEP, especially seroma, was considerably lower. Transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repair was performed in 81.4% of the recurrent inguinal hernias. Seven patients underwent unilateral intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair and 3 others underwent unilateral intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair and TAPP on the opposite. Most of patients with grade I and II hernias underwent TEP. The learning curve has demonstrated that more obstacles occurred in the earlier phase of the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair training, supported by findings such as fewer cases performed annually, longer operation time, and higher incidence of complications and recurrence. These findings have improved as experience is accumulated through more operations. In addition, the ratios of TEP to TAPP and mesh nonfixation to fixation also evolved throughout the course of the study. Conclusions: Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is a feasible technique that can be popularized in China. © 2013 by the American College of Surgeons.

84879388581	Metabonomics identifies serum metabolite markers of colorectal cancer	Recent studies suggest that biofluid-based metabonomics may identify metabolite markers promising for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. We report here a follow-up replication study, after a previous CRC metabonomics study, aiming to identify a distinct serum metabolic signature of CRC with diagnostic potential. Serum metabolites from newly diagnosed CRC patients (N = 101) and healthy subjects (N = 102) were profiled using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS). Differential metabolites were identified with statistical tests of orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (VIP > 1) and the Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05). With a total of 249 annotated serum metabolites, we were able to differentiate CRC patients from the healthy controls using an orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) in a learning sample set of 62 CRC patients and 62 matched healthy controls. This established model was able to correctly assign the rest of the samples to the CRC or control groups in a validation set of 39 CRC patients and 40 healthy controls. Consistent with our findings from the previous study, we observed a distinct metabolic signature in CRC patients including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, glutamine, fatty acids, and gut flora metabolism. Our results demonstrated that a panel of serum metabolite markers is of great potential as a noninvasive diagnostic method for the detection of CRC. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84879979807	The Metastasis Suppressor, N-myc Downregulated Gene 1 (NDRG1), Is a Prognostic Biomarker for Human Colorectal Cancer	Metastasis remains to be one of the most prevalent causes leading to poor long-term survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The clinical significances of tumor metastatic suppressor, N-myc downregulated gene 1 (NDRG1), have been inconsistently reported in a variety of cancerous diseases. In this study with 240 CRC clinical specimens, we showed that NDRG1 expression was significantly decreased in most of CRC tissues compared to the paired non-tumor counterparts. Statistical analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation of NDRG1 expression with tumor stage, differentiation status and metastasis. Compared with NDRG1-negative group, NDRG1-positve group had better disease-free/overall survival (p = 0.000) over 5 years' follow-up. Furthermore, NDRG1 was considered to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.001) and recurrence (p = 0.003). Our study concludes that NDRG1 is a novel favorable predictor for the prognosis in CRC patients. © 2013 Mao et al.

84880032367	Isolation and purification of two triterpenoids from the chinese medicinal plant fomes officinalis ames	A high-speed counter-current chromatography method is developed for the separation and purification of two triterpenoids from the Chinese Uyghur medicinal plant Fomes officinalis ames. Crude triterpenoids were obtained from Fomes officinalis ames through ethanol extraction. Preparative high-speed counter-current chromatography with two-phase solvent systems made up of n-hexane-ethylacetatemethanol-water with a volume ratio of 1:1.5:1.2:1 (v/v) was successfully performed in a stepwise elution. The process yielded two relatively pure triterpenoids in a single run from 500 mg crude extract. The purities of the dehydrosulphurenic acid and 3-ketodehydrosulphurenic acid were 96.8 % and 92.3 %, respectively.

84879651908	Extraction of polysaccharides from Fomes officinalis Ames and their antitumor activity	The aim of this study was to optimize the extraction parameters of Fomes officinalis Ames polysaccharides (FOAPs) and evaluate their antitumor activity. FOAPs were extracted using the hot water extraction, acid extraction and alkali extraction methods, respectively. Alcohol precipitation and acetone washes were conducted to separate and purify the FOAPs. The FOAP content was determined using the phenol-sulfuric acid method. The effects of raw material particle size, extraction time and material-liquid ratio on the yield of FOAPs were investigated, and the effects of FOAPs on the immune function of S180 tumor-bearing mice and their antitumor activity were evaluated. The yield of FOAPs obtained with the hot water extraction method was higher compared with the yields of the other methods. The optimum extraction conditions were as follows: a raw material particle size of 24 mesh; an extraction time of 2.5 h; and a material-liquid ratio of 1 g:12 ml. Under these conditions, the yield of FOAPs was 1.13%. FOAPs significantly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced the immune function in S180 tumor-bearing mice. FOAPs extracted using the hot water extraction method have antitumor activity.

84890744633	Laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation with an intra-abdominal fixation technique: A report of 53 cases	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, the safety, and outcomes of renal replacement therapy with the laparoscopic technique for peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter implantation with an intra-abdominal fixation. METHODS: Medical records of 53 patients with end-stage renal disease who underwent laparoscopic PD catheter implantation with an intra-abdominal fixation in our department from December 2008 to October 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Their surgical procedure, operative outcomes, postoperative complications, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients underwent laparoscopic PD catheter implantation with an intra-abdominal fixation successfully. Neither conversion to open surgery nor major intraoperative complications were observed. The median operative time was 24.2±10.5 minutes. The operative cost was 837.3±107.0 US$. Two patients (3.8%) had catheter obstruction peritonitis 12 and 15 months after surgery, respectively, and both of them had the catheter removed. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic PD catheter implantation with an intra-abdominal fixation of the catheter tip is feasible and safe. It had a low incidence of PD catheter migration and other PD-related postoperative complications with the benefit of minimal invasiveness, a shorter operation time, and quicker postoperative recovery.

84890911521	E2A suppresses invasion and migration by targeting YAP in colorectal cancer cells	Background: E2A gene, which encodes two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors E12 and E47, has been identified as regulator of B lymphoid hematopoiesis and suppressor of lymphoma. E47 protein was found to decrease E-cadherin expression and induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the role of E2A in colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis is still elusive.Methods: qRT-PCR and semi-qRT-PCR were performed to determine mRNA level of E2A in CRC specimens and colorectal cancer cells. RNAi was employed to downregulate E2A expression and subsequent protein level change was evaluated by immunoblot. Cell invasion and migration capacity were detected by transwell assay using cell culture inserts with or without basement membrane matrix, respectively.Results: E2A expression was decreased in metastatic CRC tissues. Invasion and migration assays showed downregulation of E2A increased metastatic capacity of CRC cells while forced expression of E12 or E47 could offset this effect. Both E12 and E47 suppressed EMT induced by E2A downregulation. Moreover, Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) was a downstream target of E2A and suppression of YAP inhibited the pro-migration/invasion of E2A deficiency.Conclusion: Our results suggest that E2A suppresses CRC cell metastasis, at least partially if not all, by inhibiting YAP expression. © 2013 Zhao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84891846377	High expression level of TMPRSS4 predicts adverse outcomes of colorectal cancer patients	Abstracts: Transmembrane protease/serine 4 (TMPRSS4), a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family, is highly expressed in some human cancers and involved in the EMT regulation of cancer cells. The prognostic value of TMPRSS4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been discussed. This study aims to evaluate the association between TMPRSS4 expressions and survival in CRC patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed high expression of TMPRSS4 in 69/122 CRC samples, compared with 14/47 in normal tissues (P < 0.01). Correlation analysis showed high expression of TMPRSS4 was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage (P = 0.011), pT (P = 0.019), pN (P = 0.035), and pM status (P = 0.004). Higher TMPRSS4 predicted shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in CRC patients (P < 0.01, both). Moreover, both TMPRSS4 expression and TNM stage were independent predictive factors of OS and DFS in Cox regression analysis. The findings in our study demonstrated the potential value of TMPRSS4 expression level as a prognostic biomarker for CRC patients. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84896054910	Oncological superiority of extralevator abdominoperineal resection over conventional abdominoperineal resection: A meta-analysis	Purpose: The oncological superiority, i.e., lower circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement, lower intraoperative perforation (IOP), and local recurrence (LR) rates, of extralevator abdominoperineal resection (EAPR) over conventional abdominoperineal resection (APR) for rectal cancer is inconclusive. This meta-analysis systematically compared the rates of CRM involvement, IOP, and LR of rectal cancer patients treated by EAPR and APR, respectively. Methods: An electronic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library through May 2013 was performed by two investigators independently to identify studies evaluating the CRM involvement, IOP, and LR rates of EAPR and APR, and search results were cross-checked to reach a consensus. Data was extracted accordingly. A Mantel-Haenszel random effects model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results: Six studies with a total of 881 patients were included. Meta-analysis of CRM involvement and IOP data from all six studies demonstrated significant lower CRM involvement (OR, 0.36; 95%CI, 0.23-0.58; P<0.0001) and IOP (OR, 0.31; 95%CI, 0.12-0.80; P=0.02) rates of EAPR. Data from four studies also showed that EAPR was associated with a lower LR rate than APR (OR, 0.27; 95%CI, 0.08-0.95; P=0.04). No differences of between-study heterogeneity or publication bias were seen in any of the meta-analyses. Conclusions: Extralevator abdominoperineal resection could achieve better CRM involvement outcome and lower IOP and LR rates, demonstrating an oncological superiority over conventional abdominoperineal resection. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84896529721	TMPRSS4 correlates with colorectal cancer pathological stage and regulates cell proliferation and self-renewal ability	Transmembrane protease/serine 4 (TMPRSS 4) is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family and it was found highly expressed in several cancers. This study aims to evaluate the expression of TMPRSS 4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and investigate its role in proliferation and self-renewal of colon cancer cells. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression level of TMRPSS 4 in CRC samples respectively. Loss of function assay was conducted with RNAi technique. Cell proliferation was done with WST-8 assay; cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were performed with flow cytometry; invasion and migration were done with transwell assay. Plate and soft agarose clonogenic assays were used to detect clone-formation ability. CD44 and CD133 expressions were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blot. We found that TMPRSS 4 was highly expressed in CRC tissues both at mRNA and protein level and correlated with pathological stage. Knockdown of TMPRSS 4 in highly expressed colon cancer cell line HC T116 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell apoptosis and suppression of invasion and migration; moreover, knockdown of TMPRSS 4 suppressed the in vitro clone-formation ability of HC T116 and reduced the expressions of CD44 and CD133. The findings in this research showed that TMPRSS 4 was associated with CRC stage and regulated the proliferation and self-renewal ability of colon cancer cells; TMRPSS 4 was involved in the development and progression of CRC. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

84899045233	Completely medial versus hybrid medial approach for laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision in right hemicolon cancer	Objective: To explore the feasibilities between operational approaches for laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) to right hemicolon cancer. Methods: This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients admitted to a Shanghai minimally invasive surgical center to receive laparoscopic CME from September 2011 to January 2013 randomized into two groups: hybrid medial approach (HMA) and completely medial approach (CMA). The feasibilities and strategies of the two techniques were studied and compared. Furthermore, the operation time and vessel-related complications were designed to be the primary end points, and other operational findings, including the classification of the surgical plane and postoperative recovery, were designed to be the secondary end points for this study. Results: After screening, 50 cases were allocated to the HMA group and 49 to the CMA group. Within the HMA group, there were 48 cases graded with mesocolic plane and 2 with intramesocolic plane. For the CMA group, there were 42 cases graded with mesocolic plane and seven with intramesocolic plane. The differences between the two were insignificant, as were the number of lymph nodes retrieved. The mean ±standard deviation total operation time for the CMA group was 128.3 ± 36.4 min, which was significantly shorter than that for the HMA group, 142.6 ± 34.8 min. For the CMA group, the time involved in central vessel ligations and laparoscopic procedures was 58.5%, 14.1 and 81.2 ± 23.5 min, respectively, which were shorter than the HMA group. The vessel-related complication rate was significantly higher in the HMA group. Conclusions: Laparoscopic CME via the total medial approach is technically feasible after the precise identification of the surgical planes and spaces for the right hemicolon. The procedure has a shorter operation time and fewer vessel-related complications. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

84899946513	Long-term outcome of laparoscopic-assisted right-hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy versus open surgery for colon carcinoma	Purpose: To investigate the applicability, safety, short-term and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of right-sided colon carcinomas with D3 lymphadenectomy. Methods: Between June 2003 and September 2010, 324 patients with right-sided colon carcinoma underwent surgical treatment in the same hospital, 177 cases were treated by laparoscopic surgery (LRH group) and 147 cases by open surgery (ORH group). We performed a retrospective analysis of the differences between the two groups in terms of the clinical data. Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups in the demographic data; however, the recovery time was significantly shorter in the LRH group, the number of overall lymph nodes harvested and principle lymph nodes harvested in the LRH group was significantly higher than in the ORH group, the incidence of postoperative complications was 12.99 % in the LRH group and 22.45 % in the ORH group (P < 0.05), and the recurrence rate in the LRH group was lower than that in the ORH group, although the difference was not significant (15.25 vs 19.73 %). The cumulative overall survival for all stages at 1, 3 and 5 years in the LRH group (97.18, 83.73 and 70.37 %) were not significantly different compared to those in the ORH group (94.56, 77.84 and 66.97 %). Conclusions: Laparoscopic-assisted right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy for colon carcinomas is safe and effective, while it is also superior to open surgery regarding the short-term outcomes, and the long-term outcomes are similar to those of open surgery. © 2013 Springer.

84903785573	Learning curve and long-term outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer	Objective: To discuss the learning curve of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with lymph node dissection and the oncological results and long-term outcomes of different periods in the learning stage. Patients and Methods: One hundred twenty-four patients with gastric cancer who received LADG with lymph node dissection from January 2004 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. They were divided into three groups (A-C) according to different operative date: 41 were in Group A (early), 41 in Group B (middle), and 42 in Group C (laer). There were no significant statistical differences among the three groups with respect to age, gender, early/advanced gastric cancer, Union for International Cancer Control stage, and lymph node dissection. Then the following items were compared in these groups: operative time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes harvested, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, and long-term survival. Results: The operative time in Group A (235.0±50.3 minutes) was significantly longer than in Groups B (201.7±39.6 minutes) and C (199.0±44.7 minutes), but there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. The harvest of lymph nodes from Group A (11.0±5.5) was significantly less than from Groups B (16.3±9.2) and C (17.2±8.7), but there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. The postoperative hospital stay and complications, overall survival, and disease-free survival showed no difference among the three groups. Conclusions: The learning curve of gastrointestinal surgeons with experience of laparoscopic operation is about 40 cases. The oncological principles and long-term outcomes were not sacrificed during the learning stage. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

84903843992	Downregulation of GRHL2 inhibits the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by targeting ZEB1	Previous reports have associated GRHL2 with tumor progression. However, the biological role of GRHL2 in human colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been explored. We examined the expression of GRHL2 in 75 CRC samples, as well as the paired non-tumor tissues, by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis. The association between GRHL2 expression and various clinicopathological parameters including Ki-67, a marker of proliferative activity, was also evaluated. We performed lentivirus-mediated shRNA transfection to knock down GRHL2 gene expression in HT29 and HCT116 CRC cells. Cell proliferation was examined by the CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) assay, colony formation, and cell cycle assay in vitro. Tumorigenesis in vivo was assessed using a mouse xenograft model. Moreover, we transiently silenced ZEB1 expression in GRHL2-knockdown CRC cells using specific shRNA, and then examined the effects on GRHL2 and E-cadherin expression, as well as cell proliferation. Herein, we demonstrated that enhanced GRHL2 expression was detected in CRC, and correlated with higher levels of Ki-67 staining, larger tumor size, and advanced clinical stage. Knocking down GRHL2 in HT29 and HCT116 CRC cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation by decreasing the number of cells in S phase and increasing that in the G0/G1 phaseof the cell cycle. This resulted in inhibition of tumorigenesis in vivo, as well as increased expression of ZEB1. Furthermore, transient ZEB1 knockdown dramatically enhanced cell proliferation and increased GRHL2 and E-cadherin expression. Collectively, our study has identified ZEB1 as a target of GRHL2 and suggested a reciprocal GRHL2-ZEB1 repressive relationship, providing a novel mechanism through which proliferation may be modulated in CRC cells. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

84921673074	Design of a Stereo Handheld amera Tool for Single Port Laparoscopy	SPL (Single Port Laparoscopy) might bring improved surgical outcomes but this new procedure needs effective and functional next-generation surgical tools. Although several robotic systems for SPL have been constructed, only manual SPL tools are currently used in clinical SPL procedures. This paper presents the design, construction and experimental characterizations of a stereo handheld camera tool with integrated illumination for SPL. The camera tool can be folded for the insertion into abdomen through a Ø12mm trocar. Besides providing 3D visualization and illumination of the surgical scene, it can also be unfolded to spare an additional access port for other surgical tools. The actual effectiveness of this camera tool could be further gauged in a surgical setting with other manual SPL tools.
