84946685873	Matrix optimization problems for MIMO systems with matrix monotone objective functions	In this paper, various optimization problems with matrix variates for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are unified into a novel optimization framework namely matrix-monotonic optimization problems. Monotonicity is one of the most important and fundamental characteristics of a function, which can be exploited to derive and analyze the optimal solutions. In this paper, we discover that in several cases taking advantage of the monotonicity in the field of positive semidefinite matrices, the considered optimization problems can be significantly simplified e.g., the dimensionality of the variables are reduced from matrix variates to be vector ones with much lower dimensionality. We believe that just like convexity, monotonicity, especially for positive semi-definite matrices, will have a critical role in the future wireless designs,

84946693620	Feasible D2D communication distance in D2D-enabled cellular networks	In D2D-enabled cellular networks, data communications between user equipments (UEs) can be completed by two modes: the cellular mode and the D2D mode where UEs bypass the base station and directly communicate with each other. Usually the transmission mode is selected based on the distance between the UEs. In this paper, the feasible D2D communication distance, i.e., the maximum allowable distance for D2D communications, in a D2D-enabled cellular network is analyzed. To proceed, the coverage probabilities of the cellular and the D2D modes are first derived in closed-forms. Different from prior studies, both the uplink and the downlink transmissions are considered when analyzing the coverage probability of the cellular mode and multi-cell interference is also taken into account in the analysis. Based on the analytical results on the coverage probabilities, the maximum allowable distance for D2D communications is then given in closed-form. The impacts of various system parameters on the maximum allowable distance for D2D communications are finally discussed. The analytical result theoretically justifies the traffic offloading function of D2D communications and shows that D2D communications is applicable especially for modern cellular communication networks where base stations are densely deployed. It also provides an effective guidance on mode selection in D2D-enabled cellular networks.

29144460118	Semi-blind estimation of channels and symbols for asynchronous MIMO systems	Semi-blind channel estimation and equalisation algorithms for asynchronous multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems are proposed. MIMO channels are estimated from the second-order statistics of the received signals subject to an ambiguity matrix and unknown time delays. Then some pilot symbols are used to resolve the ambiguity matrix and the time delays. Two methods are presented for equalisation: the direct method and the two-step method. The direct method equalises the symbols directly without explicitly estimating the channels, while the two-step method needs to estimate the channels before recovering the symbols. Only upper bounds for the channel orders and the time delays are needed for implementing the algorithms. Neither the knowledge of real channel orders nor precise synchronisation of different users is required, which makes the algorithm applicable to practical multiuser MIMO systems.

By taking the channel uncertainties into account, two robust design algorithms are proposed to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of the output signal at the destination. One is an iterative algorithm with its convergence proved analytically. The other is an approximated closed-form solution with much lower complexity than the iterative algorithm. Although the closed-form solution involves a minor relaxation for the general case, when the column covariance matrix of the channel estimation error at the second hop is proportional to identity matrix, no relaxation is needed and the proposed closed-form solution is the optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms reduce the sensitivity of the AF MIMO relay systems to channel estimation errors, and perform better than the algorithm using estimated channels only. Furthermore, the closed-form solution provides a comparable performance to that of the iterative algorithm. © 2006 IEEE.

Furthermore, several existing linear beamforming designs for multi-user (MU) MIMO systems and AF MIMO relaying systems can be considered as special cases of the proposed solution.

84865013143	Distributed filter-and-forward beamforming for two-way relaying networks under channel uncertainties	In this paper, we consider robust distributed filterand-forward beamforming design for two-way relaying networks over the frequency selective fading channels, in which two users exchange information with the aid of multiple single-antenna relay nodes. In contrast to the prior works in which the channel state information (CSI) is available, in our work CSI for all relevant links between the users and relay nodes is not perfectly known with stochastic channel errors. Under stochastic channel errors, a robust beamforming design aiming at maximizing the total system signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) under individual relay power constraints is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed robust beamformer reduces the sensitivity of the two-way relaying systems to channel estimation errors, and performs better than the algorithm using estimated channels only. © 2012 IEEE.

84873917749	A general robust linear transceiver design for multi-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relaying systems	In this paper, linear transceiver design for multi-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) relaying systems with Gaussian distributed channel estimation errors is investigated. Commonly used transceiver design criteria including weighted mean-square-error (MSE) minimization, capacity maximization, worst-MSE/MAX-MSE minimization and weighted sum-rate maximization, are considered and unified into a single matrix-variate optimization problem. A general robust design algorithm is proposed to solve the unified problem. Specifically, by exploiting majorization theory and properties of matrix-variate functions, the optimal structure of the robust transceiver is derived when either the covariance matrix of channel estimation errors seen from the transmitter side or the corresponding covariance matrix seen from the receiver side is proportional to an identity matrix. Based on the optimal structure, the original transceiver design problems are reduced to much simpler problems with only scalar variables whose solutions are readily obtained by an iterative water-filling algorithm. A number of existing transceiver design algorithms are found to be special cases of the proposed solution. The differences between our work and the existing related work are also discussed in detail. The performance advantages of the proposed robust designs are demonstrated by simulation results. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

84881585093	Joint resource allocation for learning-based cognitive radio networks with MIMO-OFDM relay-aided transmissions	In this paper, we investigate the joint power allocation for dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO-OFDM cognitive radio (CR) networks. The considered AF MIMO-OFDM CR network coexists with a primary radio (PR) network through underlay spectrum sharing. In order to mitigate the interference to the PR network, environmental learning algorithm is adopted to blindly estimate the null space of the PR user, which are orthogonal to the PR communication channels. With necessary channel state information, under independent transmit power constraints as well as the interference constraints, the power allocation of CR source and relay and subcarrier pairing over two hops are optimized jointly to maximize the CR network throughput. Furthermore, the relay node implements an effective subcarrier permutation policy to enhance the performance further at the cost of affordable complexity. Finally, the performance advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by the simulation results. © 2013 IEEE.

84881106928	Robust transceiver design for MIMO-OFDM systems based on cluster water-filling	In this paper, robust transceiver designs for point-to-point MIMO-OFDM systems are investigated. A general performance metric of weighted mean-square-error (MSE) minimization is adopted as the optimization objective function. Exploiting the signal structure of point-to-point MIMO-OFDM systems, a simple and readily comprehensive derivation procedure for the optimal solution is given. It is revealed that for the optimal robust transceiver design the solution is an interesting variant of the famous water-filling solution, which is named as cluster water-filling. This solution is significantly different from that of the robust transceiver design over flat fading channels and its counterpart with perfect channel state information (CSI) as the water-filling bottoms are also variables to be optimized among different subcarriers. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates the performance advantages of the proposed robust design. © 1997-2012 IEEE.

84883254929	Analysis of hybrid arq in ad hoc networks with correlated interference and feedback errors	In this paper, the performance of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) technique in an ad hoc network is analyzed. Unlike most prior works on the analysis of HARQ, both time-correlated interference and feedback errors are taken into account in the analysis. Based on the theory of point processes, outage probability after the nth retransmission, delay limited throughput and mean transmission time are derived in closed forms. The analytical results are verified by simulations and the impacts of various parameters on the network performance are investigated in detail. It is found that the outage probability obeys the inverse-\frac{2}{α} power law over the number of retransmissions, where α is the path loss exponent. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the feedback error significantly degrades the delay limited throughput when the ad hoc network becomes dense, while the increment of mean transmission time due to the feedback error is a concave function of the intensity of the network. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

84883112726	A matrix-field weighted mean-square-error model for mimo transceiver design	We investigate the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver design using a weighted mean-square-error (MSE) minimization approach. A novel weighted MSE model is proposed, and it is defined as a linear matrix function with respect to the traditional data detection MSE matrix. The new model can be interpreted an extension of the weighting operation from vector field to matrix field. Based on the proposed weighting operation, a general transceiver design is proposed, which aims at minimizing an increasing matrix-monotone function of the output of the previous linear matrix function. The structure of the optimal solutions is also derived. Furthermore, two important special cases of the matrix-monotone functions are discussed in detail. It is revealed that these two problems are equivalent to the transceiver design of sum MSE minimization and capacity maximization for dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO relaying systems, respectively. Finally, it is concluded that the AF relaying can be interpreted as a specific application of the proposed weighting operation. © 2013 IEEE.

84891362661	Analysis of hybrid ARQ in interference dominant mobile ad hoc networks	In this paper, outage performance of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) technique in interference dominant mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is analyzed. Unlike prior analysis, interference and spatial randomness of the nodes (i.e. the randomness in the number of nodes and nodes' locations) are considered. Based on the theory of point processes, the outage probabilities of two popular HARQ techniques, that are type-I HARQ and HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC), are derived in closed forms. The outage performance gain of HARQ-CC over type-I HARQ is also discussed and is found to follow the scaling law of Θ (k 2(k+1)/α) where α is the path loss exponent and k is the number of retransmissions. It is also demonstrated that both type-I HARQ and HARQ-CC can significantly improve the communication performance even in interference dominant MANETs. Furthermore, it is revealed that in most cases HARQ-CC is superior over type-I HARQ, however, for a dense network type-I HARQ can provide comparable performance with lower complexity than HARQ-CC and is thus more preferable. © 2013 IEEE.

84899627212	TOA-Based passive localization in quasi-synchronous networks	This letter addresses the problem of localization in a quasi-synchronous network using time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. The object to be localized is passive, i.e., it is neither a transmitter nor a receiver. Unlike prior TOA-based algorithms, no perfect synchronization between the transceivers is assumed here. A two-step linear algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the location of the passive object and the unknown time offset between the transceivers. The Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRB) for quasi-synchronous networks is then given for comparison. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve the BCRB and significantly outperform the algorithms using time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and differential TOA (DTOA) measurements. © 2014 IEEE.

84904789066	Distributed hybrid power state estimation under PMU sampling phase errors	Phasor measurement units (PMUs) have the advantage of providing direct measurements of power states. However, as the number of PMUs in a power system is limited, the traditional supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system cannot be replaced by the PMU-based system overnight. Therefore, hybrid power state estimation taking advantage of both systems is important. As experiments show that sampling phase errors among PMUs are inevitable in practical deployment, this paper proposes a distributed power state estimation algorithm under PMU phase errors. The proposed distributed algorithm only involves local computations and limited information exchange between neighboring areas, thus alleviating the heavy communication burden compared to the centralized approach. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is very close to that of centralized optimal hybrid state estimates without sampling phase error. © 2013 IEEE.

84904132804	Outage analysis of opportunistic amplify-and-forward cooperative cellular systems with random relays	In this paper, the outage performance of an opportunistic amplify-and-forward cooperative downlink cellular system is analyzed. Different from prior works, the randomness of the network topology is taken into account by modeling the user nodes as a homogeneous Poisson point process. Based on this model, outage probability is derived and the impacts of several system parameters are investigated. Under certain conditions, the closed form expression of outage probability is derived. It is found from our results that the diversity order of this opportunistic cooperative system at high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is one. Moreover, optimal power allocation can be found from our results to minimize the outage probability. © 2013 IEEE.

84907001166	Performance analysis of incremental redundancy hybrid ARQ in mobile ad hoc networks	In this paper, the performance of hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is analyzed. Based on the theory of stochastic geometry, both interference and the randomness in nodes' locations are incorporated into our analysis. The outage probability after the kth retransmission is analyzed and the outage performance of HARQ-IR is compared with that of Type-I HARQ and HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC). Our analysis reveals that the performance gains of HARQ-IR over Type-I HARQ and HARQ-CC increase with the number of retransmissions while they decrease with the path loss exponent. The network throughput in terms of transmission capacity is also analyzed. The results indicate that a certain small number of retransmissions is sufficient to achieve the maximal transmission capacity. Meanwhile, the optimal intensity of source nodes to maximize the transmission capacity is shown to be within a specific interval. © 2014 IEEE.
