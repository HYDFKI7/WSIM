22544432875	Polarization of L dwarfs by dust scattering	The degree of polarization in L dwarfs of spectral types L0-L6 resulting from dust scattering in a rotation-induced oblate photosphere is calculated. Assuming that forsterite is the main condensate, we derive the atmospheric dust distribution for different spectral types based on a chemical equilibrium model. The degree of polarization at optical is then calculated using a single-scattering model. The expected linear polarization at optical is found to peak at around spectral type L1. For a fixed rotational velocity, the degree of polarization decreases from hotter to cooler objects. However, with the increase in mean grain size, the degree of linear polarization reduces significantly. We fit the recently observed linear polarimetric data of L dwarfs and find that the single dust scattering model coupled with the chemical equilibrium models of condensates is consistent with the observational results. © 2005.

28044453922	Dust extinction in compact planetary nebulae	The effects of dust extinction on the departure from axisymmetry in the morphology of planetary nebulae (PNs) are investigated through a comparison of the radio free-free emission and hydrogen recombination line images. The dust extinction maps from five compact PNs are derived using high-resolution (̃0"1) Hα and radio maps of the HST and VLA. These extinction maps are then analyzed by an ellipsoidal shell ionization model including the effects of dust extinction to infer the nebulae's intrinsic structure and orientation in the sky. This method provides a quantitative analysis of the morphological structure of PNs and represents a step beyond qualitative classification of morphological types of PNs. © 2005.

30544436819	Discovery of multiple coaxial rings in the quadrupolar planetary nebula NGC 6881	We report the discovery of multiple two-dimensional rings in the quadrupolar planetary nebula NGC 6881. As many as four pairs of rings are seen in the bipolar lobes, and three rings are seen in the central torus. While the rings in the lobes have the same axis as one pair of the bipolar lobes, the inner rings are aligned with the other pair. The two pairs of bipolar lobes are likely to be carved out by two separate high-velocity outflows from the circumstellar material left over from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind. The two-dimensional rings could be the results of dynamical instabilities or the consequence of a fast outflow interacting with remnants of discrete AGB circumstellar shells. © 2005.

33645508333	Subarcsecond mid-infrared imaging of dust in the bipolar nebula Hen 3-401	We present high-resolution, nearly diffraction-limited narrow- and broadband mid-IR images of bipolar reflection nebula Hen 3-401. The deconvolved images yield a pixel-limited spatial resolution of 0″.09, demonstrating the superior imaging quality of the Gemini telescope. The infrared image of Hen 3-401 consists of a prominent core region of size 1″ and extended emissions along the walls of the bipolar lobes. We find that the distribution of aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission is different from that of the continuum emission and that the star has undergone multiple ejection of the AIB emission feature carrier at the end stages of its evolution. From the observed temperature gradient in the core, we suggest that the core has a flared disk geometry. © 2006. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

33751227822	Evolution from the asymptotic giant branch to planetary nebulae	The post-asymptotic-giant-branch (post-AGB) or pre-planetary nebulae (PPN) phase of stellar evolution plays an important role in the dynamical shaping of PNe. While the interacting stellar winds model has achieved tremendous success in the explaining of the 1-D structures (shells, crowns, haloes) of PNe, the origins of arcs, rings, and multipolar structures remain a mystery. The synthesis of gas-phase molecules and solid-state compounds that begin in the stellar winds from AGB stars also undergo significant evolution during the post-AGB phase. Organic compounds of both aliphatic and aromatic structures are produced, which carries significant implications on the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

Furthermore, using the Spitzer/Glimpse survey of the Galactic plane, we found counterparts in the 3.6 micron band for all of the OH/IR objects without previous NIR identification. One of the most interesting objects among these is IRAS 18450-0148 (W43A) with collimated outflows.

33845694648	An infrared imaging study of the bipolar proto-planetary nebula IRAS 16594-4656	High-resolution mid-infrared images have been obtained in N and Q band for the proto-planetary nebula IRAS 16594-4656. A bright equatorial torus and a pair of bipolar lobes can clearly be seen in the infrared images. The torus appears thinner at the center than at the edges, suggesting that it is viewed nearly edge-on. The infrared lobes correspond to the brightest lobes of the reflection nebula seen in the Bubble Space Telescope (HST) optical image, but with no sign of the point-symmetric structure seen in the visible image. The lobe structure shows a close correspondence with a molecular hydrogen map obtained with HST, suggesting that the dust emission in the lobes traces the distribution of the shocked gas. The shape of the bipolar lobes shows clearly that the fast outflow is still confined by the remnant circumstellar envelope of the progenitor asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. However, the nondetection of the dust outside of the lobes suggests that the temperature of the dust in the AGB envelope is too low for it to be detected at 20 μm. © 2006.

33846478675	Synthesis of organic compounds in planetary nebulae and proto-planetary nebulae	Recent millimeter-wave and infrared spectroscopic observations have found evidence of rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules in the late stages of stellar evolution. The chemical synthesis begins with the formation of acetylene, the first building block of benzene, in carbon stars. In the following proto-planetary nebula stage, emission features corresponding to stretching and bending modes of aliphatic compounds are detected. When these objects evolve to become planetary nebulae, aromatic C-H and C-C stretching and bending modes become strong. These results show that complex carbonaceous compounds can be produced in a circumstellar environment over a period of only a few thousand years. Isotopic analysis of meteorites and interplanetary dust collected in the upper atmosphere have revealed the presence of pre-solar grains similar to those formed in evolved stars. This provides a direct link between star dust and the solar system and raises the possibility that the early solar system was chemically enriched by stellar ejecta. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

Odin was used to observe the 557 GHz line of water with high spectral resolution in 12 comets between 2001 and 2005. Line shapes and spatial mapping provide information on the anisotropy of the outgassing and constraints on water excitation, enabling accurate measurements of the water production rate. Five comets were regularly observed over periods of more than one month to monitor the variation of their water outgassing rate with heliocentric distance. Observing campaigns have been generally coordinated with ground-based observations of molecular lines at Nançay, CSO or IRAM 30-m telescopes to obtain molecular abundances relative to water.

34347234533	Diffraction-limited 3 μm spectroscopy of IRAS 04296+3429 and IRAS 05341+0852: Spatial extent of hydrocarbon dust emission and dust evolutionary sequence	We present 3 μm spectroscopy of the carbon-rich protoplanetary nebulae IRAS 04296+3429 and IRAS 05341+0852, conducted with the adaptive optics system at the Subaru Telescope. We utilize the nearly diffraction-limited spectroscopy to probe the spatial extent of the hydrocarbon dust emitting zone. We find a hydrocarbon emission core extending up to 100-160 mas from the center of IRAS 04296+3429, corresponding to a physical diameter of 400-640 AU, assuming a distance of 4 kpc. However, we find that IRAS 05341+0852 is not spatially resolved with this instrumentation. The physical extent of these protoplanetary nebulae, along with the reanalyzed data of IRAS 22272+5435 published previously, suggests a correlation between the physical extent of the hydrocarbon dust emission and the spectral evolution of the aliphatic to aromatic features in these post-AGB stars. These measurements represent the first direct test of the proposed chemical synthesis route of carbonaceous dust in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars. © 2007, The American Astronomical Society, Ail rights reserved.

Eleven northern nebulae were observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.3 and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 and 3.6 cm. Two northern objects, 19W32 and M1-91, and three southern objects, He 2-25, He 2-84, and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio core with a rising spectrum consistent with an ionized jet.

34547363629	A study of the 3.3 and 3.4 μm emission features in proto-planetary nebulae	Medium-resolution spectra have been obtained of seven carbon-rich proto - planetary nebulae (PPNs) and one young planetary nebula from 3.2 to 3.8 μm, an interval containing the prominent hydrocarbon C - H stretches at 3.3 and 3.4 μm due to aromatic and aliphatic structures, respectively. The 3.3 μm feature is newly identified in IRAS 23304+6147, 22223+4327, and 06530-0213 and is confirmed in Z02229+6208. Three of the PPNs emit in the 3.4 μm feature, two of these being new identifications, IRAS 20000+3239 and 01005+7910, with two others showing possible detections. The 3.3 and 3.4 μm emission features in IRAS 22272+5435 are seen in the nebula offset from the star but not at the position of the central star, consistent with the 2003 results of Goto et al. A similar distribution is seen for the 3.3 μm feature in IRAS 22223+4327. All of the PPNs except IRAS 22272+5435 show Class A 3 μm emission features. These observations, when combined with those of the approximately equal number of other carbon-rich PPNs previously observed, demonstrate that there are large differences in the 3 μm emission bands, even for PPNs with central stars of similar spectral type, and thus that the behavior of the bands does not depend solely on spectral type. We also investigated other possible correlations to help explain these differences. These differences do not depend on the C/O value, since the Class B sources fall within the C/O range found for Class A. All of these 3.3 μm sources also show C

High resolution imaging observations in the submillimeter (e.g., SMA) and in the mid-infrared (e.g., Gemini) have made possible the mapping of the distribution of these compounds, allowing us to infer the history of circumstellar chemistry. In this paper, we present some of the recent spectroscopic and imaging observations of the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars and discuss a scenario of chemical evolution including the possible role of photochemistry in the late stages of stellar evolution. © 2007.

The identification of similar compounds in the solar system suggests that these stellar materials can survive the long trip through the Galaxy and be deposited in the early solar system.

38049123683	A spectral line survey of Orion KL in the bands 486-492 and 541-577 GHz with the Odin satellite: II. Data analysis	Aims.We investigate the physical and chemical conditions in a typical star forming region, including an unbiased search for new molecules in a spectral region previously unobserved.Methods.Due to its proximity, the Orion KL region offers a unique laboratory of molecular astrophysics in a chemically rich, massive star forming region. Several ground-based spectral line surveys have been made, but due to the absorption by water and oxygen, the terrestrial atmosphere is completely opaque at frequencies around 487 and 557 GHz. To cover these frequencies we used the Odin satellite to perform a spectral line survey in the frequency ranges 486-492 GHz and 541-577 GHz, filling the gaps between previous spectral scans. Odin's high main beam efficiency, = 0.9, and observations performed outside the atmosphere make our intensity scale very well determined.Results.We observed 280 spectral lines from 38 molecules including isotopologues, and, in addition, 64 unidentified lines. A few U-lines have interesting frequency coincidences such as ND and the anion SH. The beam-averaged emission is dominated by CO, HO, SO, SO, CO and CHOH. Species with the largest number of lines are CHOH, (CHO, SO, CHOH, CHCN and NO. Six water lines are detected including the ground state rotational transition 1-1 of -HO, its isotopologues -HO and -HO, the Hot Core tracing -HO transition 6-7, and the 2-1 transition of HDO. Other lines of special interest are the 1-0 transition of NH and its isotopologue NH. Isotopologue abundance ratios of D/H, C/C, S/S, S/S, and O/O are estimated. The temperatures, column densities and abundances in the various subregions are estimated, and we find very high gas-phase abundances of HO, NH, SO, SO, NO, and CHOH. A comparison with the ice inventory of ISO sheds new light on the origin of the abundant gas-phase molecules.. © 2007 ESO.

Dust emissions are detected in both the bipolar lobes and in the equatorial region of IRAS 17441 -2411. In particular, the orientation of the axis of the infrared torus is found to be offset by 23 °from the bipolar axis. If the torus is responsible for or related to the collimation of the bipolar outflow, this raises the possibility that the outflow has undergone precession over the last 100 years. © 2007.

34249096457	Multiple coaxial rings in the bipolar nebula hubble 12	A series of two-dimensional rings along a common axis aligned with the bipolar lobes is found in the planetary nebula Hb 12. The rings have separations of about 0.3″, which can be translated into physical separations of ∼ 1000 AU, or time separations of the order of 50 yr. We suggest that the existence of the rings is a manifestation of the interaction between a time-variable, collimated fast outflow with the circumstellar envelope created by the stellar wind of an asymptotic giant branch star. Comparison of Hb 12 with other bipolar nebulae with hourglass structures such as Hen 2-104, MyCn 18, and SN 1987A suggests that the nebula of Hb 12 may represent the inner nebula of a much larger bipolar structures, and we propose to search for such outer structures with a wide-field infrared camera. © 2007.

The investigation of molecular compositions in CSEs is essential to understand the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In order to study circumstellar chemistry in different environments, we have been systematically performing molecular line surveys of a sample of evolved stars from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, proto-planetary nebulae (PPNs), to planetary nebulae (PNs). The dynamical time scales in different evolutionary stages can impose a time limit on the reaction time scales. Here we report our results for CRL 2688. © 2013 International Astronomical Union.

Moreover, organic (aromatic and aliphatic) compounds have been detected in proto-planetary nebulae and planetary nebulae, which are the descendants of carbon stars. This implies that molecular synthesis is actively happening in the circumstellar environment on timescales as short as several hundred years. The detection of stellar grains in the Solar System suggests that they can survive their journey through the interstellar medium and that they are a major contributor of interstellar grains.

53349089436	Molecular lines in the envelopes of evolved stars	We report a spectral line survey of the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars at millimeter wavelengths. The data allow us to investigate the chemical processes in different physical environments and evolutionary stages. A total of more than 500 emission features (mostly rotational transitions of molecules) are detected in the survey. Our observations show that the sources in different evolutionary stages have remarkably different chemical composition. As a star evolves from AGB stage to proto-planetary nebula, the abundances of Si-bearing molecules (SiO, SiCC, and SiS) decrease, while the abundances of some long-chain molecules, such as CH3CN, C4H, and HC3N, increase. After further evolution to planetary nebula, the abundances of neutral molecules dramatically decrease, and the emission from molecular ions becomes more intense. These differences can be attributed to the changes of the role that dust, stellar winds, shock waves, and UV/X-rays from the central star play in different evolutionary stages. These results will provide significant constraints on models of circumstellar chemistry. © 2008 International Astronomical Union.

Aliphatic features at 3.4 and 6.9 m are also observed; however, these features are often stronger in PPNe than in PNe. These observations suggest an evolution in the features from simple molecules (C2H2) in AGB stars to aliphatics in PPNe to aromatics in PNe. In the same carbon-rich PPNe, a strong, broad, unidentified 21 m emission feature has been found.

In this review, we summarize the observational evidence for the existence of complex aliphatic and aromatic compounds in these circumstellar environments, and discuss the nature of their possible carriers.

54249159101	Stellar evolution from AGB to planetary nebulae	Planetary nebulae are formed by an interacting winds process where the remnant of the AGB wind is compressed and accelerated by a later-developed fast wind from the central star. One-dimensional dynamical models have successfully explained the multi-shell (bubble, shell, crown, haloes) structures and the kinematics of planetary nebulae. However, the origin of the diverse asymmetric morphology of planetary nebulae is still not understood. Recent observations in the visible, infrared, and the submillimeter have suggested that the AGB mass loss becomes aspherical in the very late stages, forming an expanding torus around the star. A fast, highly collimated wind then emerges in the polar directions and carves out a cavity in the AGB envelope to form a bipolar nebula. Newly discovered structures such as concentric arcs, 2-D rings, multiple lobes, and point-symmetric structures suggest that both the slow and fast winds may have temporal and directional variations, and precession can play a role in the shaping of planetary nebulae. In this paper, we review the latest observations of planetary nebulae and proto-planetary nebulae and discuss the various physical mechanisms (rotation, binary, magnetic field, etc) that could lead to the observed morphologies. © 2008 International Astronomical Union.

They were observed from 10 to 36μm at relatively high spectral resolution, R 600. The sample was chosen because they all gave some evidence in the visible of a carbon-rich chemistry. All seven of the sources show the broad, unidentified 21μm emission feature; three of them are new detections (IRAS 06530 - 0213, 07430+1115, and 19477+2401) and the others are observed at higher signal-to-noise ratio than in previous spectra.

The photometry and images of these PNs at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 μm, taken through the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS), are presented. Most of these nebulae are very red and compact in the IRAC bands, and are found to be bright and extended in the 24 μm band. The infrared morphology of these objects are compared with Hα images of the Macquarie-AAO-Strasbourg (MASH) and MASH II PNs. The implications for morphological difference in different wavelengths are discussed. The IRAC data allow us to differentiate between PNs and H II regions and be able to reject non-PNs from the optical catalog (e.g., PNG 352.1 - 00.0). Spectral energy distributions are constructed by combing the IRAC and MIPS data with existing near-, mid-, and far-IR photometry measurements. The anomalous colors of some objects allow us to infer the presence of aromatic emission bands. These multi-wavelength data provide useful insights into the nature of different nebular components contributing to the infrared emission of PNs. © 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

0035264474	Properties of OH/IR stars with IRAS LRS spectra	1858 OH satellite line (1612 MHz) maser sources associated with the IRAS counterparts were assembled from the literature. Cross-correlation between collected OH/IR - IRAS sources and the recent catalogue of the IRAS LRS spectra (Kwok et al. 1997) allows us to subdivide 1024 of them (after excluding OH sources with uncertain IRAS associations) into 10 groups according to the Volk & Cohen (1989) classification scheme. We have found that sources with silicate emission form the largest group (about 57%), followed by the group with silicate absorption (only about 16%). For more sensitive individual OH maser surveys these numbers differentiate even more and the ratio between silicate emission and absorption sources reaches a value close to 6. Surprisingly, we found an association of OH maser emission with a small number of stars with carbon-rich atmospheres. The distribution of these subgroups of OH/IR stars in the IRAS colour-colour and the period-colour diagrams as well as histograms of some physical properties are presented. The galactic distribution of important parameters (periods, IRAS colours, expansion and stellar velocities) for different classes of OH/IR sources is analyzed from the point of view of the stars' evolutionary status. The correlations among the periods, colours, expansion and star velocities and the pumping efficiencies for selected subgroups of OH/IR stars are also investigated. These analyses allow us to demonstrate that a significant fraction of silicate emission group sources do not form an evolutionary sequence with the silicate absorption objects - as is suggested e.g. by the IRAS colour-colour diagram, but rather form a lower initial mass sequence, i.e. these sources will never develop sufficient mass loss to manifest silicate absorption.

74149089307	Delivery of complex organic compounds from planetary nebulae to the solar system	Infrared spectroscopic observations of planetary nebulae and proto-planetary nebulae have shown that complex organic compounds are synthesized in these objects over periods as short as a thousand years. These compounds are ejected into the interstellar medium and spread throughout the Galaxy. Evidence from meteorites has shown that these stellar grains have reached the Solar System, and may have showered the Earth during the heavy bombardment stage of the Early Earth. In this paper, we discuss the chemical structure of stellar organic grains and compare them to the organic matter found in meteorites, comets, asteroids, planetary satellites, and interplanetary particles.

77953164725	Morphological structures of planetary nebulae	Since various structural components of planetary nebulae (PN) manifest themselves differently, a combination of optical, infrared, submillimetre and radio techniques is needed to derive a complete picture of planetary nebulae. The effects of projection can also make derivation of the true 3-D structure difficult. Using a number of examples, we show that bipolar and multipolar nebulae are much more common than usually inferred from morphological classifications of apparent structures of planetary nebulae. We put forward a new hypothesis that the bipolar and multipolar lobes of PN are not regions of high-density ejected matter, but the result of ionization and illumination. The visible bright regions are in fact volumes of low density (cleared by high-velocity outflows), through which UV photons are being channelled. We suggest that multipolar nebulae with similar lobe sizes are not caused by simultaneous ejection of matter in several directions, but by leakage of UV photons in those directions. © Astronomical Society of Australia 2010.

78650021713	A spitzer/infrared spectrograph spectral study of a sample of galactic carbon-rich proto-planetary nebulae	Recent infrared spectroscopic observations have shown that proto-planetary nebulae (PPNs) are sites of active synthesis of organic compounds in the late stages of stellar evolution. This paper presents a study of Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph spectra for a sample of carbon-rich PPNs, all except one of which show the unidentified 21μm emission feature. The strengths of the aromatic infrared band, 21μm, and 30μm features are obtained by decomposition of the spectra. The observed variations in the strengths and peak wavelengths of the features support the model that the newly synthesized organic compounds gradually change from aliphatic to aromatic characteristics as stars evolve from PPNs to planetary nebulae. © 2010.

78650131993	An optical-infrared study of the young multipolar planetary nebula NGC 6644	High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the compact planetary nebula NGC 6644 has revealed two pairs of bipolar lobes and a central ring lying close to the plane of the sky. From mid-infrared imaging obtained with the Gemini Telescope, we have found a dust torus which is oriented nearly perpendicular to one pair of the lobes. We suggest that NGC 6644 is a multipolar nebula and construct a three-dimensional model that allows the visualization of the object from different lines of sight. These results suggest that NGC 6644 may have similar intrinsic structures as other multipolar nebulae and the phenomenon of multipolar nebulosity may be more common than previously believed. © 2010.

80053469456	Morphology of the red rectangle proto-planetary nebula	The morphology of the Red Rectangle (RR) exhibits several singular attributes. Most prominent are a series of linear features perpendicular to the symmetry axis which appear as "ladder rungs" across the nebula. At the edge of each "rung" gas seemingly flows from bright knots in a parabolic shape toward the center of the nebula. We present a new model of the RR which explains these features as a projection effect of the more common concentric arcs seen in other proto-planetary nebulae (e.g., Egg Nebula). Using the three-dimensional morpho-kinematic modeling software SHAPE, we have created a model of the RR that consists of spherical shells evacuated by a bi-conical outflow. When the symmetry axis is oriented perpendicular to the line of sight, the spherical shells become linear, thereby reproducing the "rungs" seen in the RR. When oriented at different inclinations, the linear features become spherical as observed in the Egg Nebula. The model also accurately reproduces the bright knots and the parabolic outflows from these knots that have proven difficult to explain in the past. Using this model, we are able to place a lower limit on the speed of the outflow of 158kms

80455130958	Mixed aromatic-aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features	Unidentified infrared emission bands at wavelengths of 3-20 micrometres are widely observed in a range of environments in our Galaxy and in others. Some features have been identified as the stretching and bending modes of aromatic compounds, and are commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. The central argument supporting this attribution is that single-photon excitation of the molecule can account for the unidentified infrared emission features observed in ĝ€̃ cirrus' clouds in the diffuse interstellar medium. Of the more than 160 molecules identified in the circumstellar and interstellar environments, however, not one is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule. The detections of discrete and broad aliphatic spectral features suggest that the carrier of the unidentified infrared emission features cannot be a pure aromatic compound. Here we report an analysis of archival spectroscopic observations and demonstrate that the data are most consistent with the carriers being amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure. This structure is similar to that of the organic materials found in meteorites, as would be expected if the Solar System had inherited these organic materials from interstellar sources. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84861371385	Amorphous organic solids as a component of interstellar dust	The discovery of rapid synthesis of complex organic solids in the late stages of stellar evolution has led to a new realization that carbonaceous compounds can be a major significant component of interstellar dust. Signatures of aromatic and aliphatic solids are seen in interstellar clouds as well as the diffuse interstellar medium. Similar features are also seen in the integrated spectrum of galaxies. This has raised the possibilities that many of the unidentified astronomical phenomena such as the diffuse interstellar bands, the 217 nm feature, the extended red emission, the 21 and 30 μm emission features, could also arise from complex organics. In this paper, we discuss the possible chemical structures of these organic solids and the relationships between circumsmtellar and interstellar dust with the organics found in meteorites, asteroids, comets and planetary satellites. The possibility that all these organics share a common origin is discussed. Copyright © The Society of Geomagnetism and Earth Planetary and Space Scienees (SGEPSS).

84862925778	Planetary nebulae detected in the spitzer space telescope glimpse 3d legacy survey	We used the data from the Spitzer Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) to investigate the mid-infrared (MIR) properties of planetary nebulae (PNs) and PN candidates. In previous studies of GLIMPSE I and II data, we have shown that these MIR data are very useful in distinguishing PNs from other emission-line objects. In the present paper, we focus on the PNs in the field of the GLIMPSE 3D survey, which has a more extensive latitude coverage. We found a total of 90 Macquarie-AAO-Strasbourg (MASH) and MASH II PNs and 101 known PNs to have visible MIR counterparts in the GLIMPSE 3D survey area. The images and photometry of these PNs are presented. Combining the derived IRAC photometry at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 μm with the existing photometric measurements from other infrared catalogs, we are able to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these PNs. Among the most notable objects in this survey is the PN M1-41, whose GLIMPSE 3D image reveals a large bipolar structure of more than 3 arcmin in extent. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

84863505915	[Fe III] Emission lines in the planetary nebula NGC2392	NGC2392 is a young double-shell planetary nebula (PN). Its intrinsic structure and shaping mechanism are still not fully understood. In this paper we present new spectroscopic observations of NGC2392. The slits were placed at two different locations to obtain the spectra of the inner and outer regions. Several [Fe III] lines are clearly detected in the inner region. We infer that NGC2392 might have an intrinsic structure similar to the bipolar nebula Mz3, which also exhibits a number of [Fe III] lines arising from the central regions. In this scenario, the inner and outer regions of NGC2392 correspond to the inner lobes and the outer outflows of Mz3, respectively. We construct a three-dimensional morpho-kinematic model to examine our hypothesis. We also compare the physical conditions and chemical composition of the inner and outer regions, and discuss the implications on the formation of this type of PN. © 2012.

84864467802	Discovery of a Halo around the helix nebula NGC7293 in the wise all-sky survey	We report the discovery of an extended halo (40′ in diameter) around the planetary nebula NGC7293 (the Helix Nebula) observed in the 12 μm band from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer all-sky survey. The mid-infrared halo has an axisymmetric structure with a sharp boundary to the northeast and a more diffuse boundary to the southwest, suggesting an interaction between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium (ISM). The symmetry axis of the halo is well aligned with that of a northeast arc, suggesting that the two structures are physically associated. We have attempted to fit the observed geometry with a model of a moving steady-state stellar wind interacting with the ISM. Possible combinations of the ISM density and the stellar velocity are derived from these fittings. The discrepancies between the model and the observations suggest that the stellar mass loss has a more complicated history, including possible time and angle dependences. © 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

84865705257	[Fe III] lines in the planetary nebula NGC 2392	The Eskimo Nebula (NGC 2392) is a young double-shell planetary nebula (PN). Its intrinsic structure and the responsible shaping mechanism are still not fully understood. We present new optical spectroscopy of NGC 2392 at two different locations to obtain the spectra of the inner and outer shells. Several [Fe iii] lines are clearly detected. We find that these [Fe iii] lines mostly originate from the inner shell. Therefore, we suggest that NGC 2392 might have an intrinsic structure similar to the Ant Nebula Mz 3, which exhibits a number of [Fe iii] lines from the central dense regions. In this scenario, the inner and outer shells correspond to the central emission core and the outer lobes of Mz 3, respectively. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.

84865724449	Historical overview of planetary nebulae research	Planetary nebulae (PNs) were first discovered over 200 years ago and our understanding of these objects has undergone significant evolution over the years. Developments in astronomical optical spectroscopy and atomic physics have shown that PNe are gaseous objects photoionized by UV radiation from a hot central star. Studies of the kinematics of the nebulae coupled with progress in theories of stellar evolution have led to the identification that PNe are evolved stars and progenitors of white dwarfs. Development of infrared and millimeter-wave technology in the 1970s made us realize that there is significant amount of neutral matter (molecules and dust) in PNe. The link of PNe to the stellar winds from their progenitor asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and subsequent dynamical interactions are now believed to be the underlying causes of the morphological structures of PNe. The role of PNe as prolific molecular factories producing complex molecules and organic solids has significant implications on the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy. In this paper, we discuss the misconceptions and errors that we have encountered in our journey of understanding the nature of PN. The various detours and dead ends that had happened during our quest to pin down the evolutionary status and causes of nebulae ejection will be discussed. As there are still many unsolved problems in PN research, these lessons of history have much to offer for future progress in this field. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.

84865730563	Morphokinematic properties of the 21 micron source IRAS 22272+5435	We obtained a high-resolution CO map of IRAS 22272+5435 in the CO J = 2-1 line using CARMA. The target exhibits a second biggest angular size of the circumstellar molecular envelope among known 21 μm sources. In the preliminary results, we found that the CO properties of IRAS 22272+5435 is clearly different from those of IRAS 07134+1005, which is another well-investigated 21 μm source. For example, elongations seen in the mid-infrared and CO images are extended in mutually perpendicular directions, although in case of IRAS 07134+1005 the CO feature coincides well with the mid-infrared structure. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.

84865772755	Planetary nebulae detected in the Spitzer Space Telescope GLIMPSE 3D Legacy Survey	Due to interstellar extinction, optical census of Galactic planetary nebulae (PNs) is highly incomplete, and some compact H ii regions might have been mis-classified as PNs. The problem is particularly severe in the Galactic plane where the extinction in the optical is significant and hampers the detections of PNs. Unlike optical observations, infrared (IR) observations are hardly affected by interstellar extinction, and provide a good opportunity to study highly obscured PNs. In this study, we use the data from the Spitzer Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire 3D (GLIMPSE 3D) to investigate the mid-infrared (MIR) properties of PNs and PN candidates. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.

84865794982	Multipolar planetary nebulae: Not as geometrically diversified as thought	We present a general three-dimensional model of multipolar planetary nebulae (PNe). By rotating to different viewing angles and adjusting the angles between the multiple lobes, we demonstrate that the model is able to reproduce HST Hα images of 20 multipolar young PNe. Though this model only considers the geometrical projection effects, it significantly unifies the selected PNe and can be considered as a first-order fundamental model of the "multipolar" morphological class. This kind of model reduces complexity and is essential to pursuing of the shaping mechanism. In addition, we illustrate that under some special conditions, i.e. in certain viewing angles, or with low sensitivity, it will be hard to imagine that the projected image originates from a multipolar-lobed model. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.

84865797447	A study of the effect of ionization and illumination on morphologies of planetary nebulae	We carry out a modelling study of the effect of ionization and illumination on the morphologies of planetary nebulae (PNs), aiming to investigate the hypothesis of Kwok (2010) that the bipolar and multipolar lobes of PNs can be produced by leakage of UV photons into those directions. Using photoinization code, we construct a series of nebular models consisting of a dense envelope and cones of low density. The results show that the visible morphologies of PNs may be fundamentally different from their intrinsic structures. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.

84865799444	Maser kinematics and infrared properties of the water fountain IRAS 18286-0959	A "water fountain" is a transitional object between an AGB star and a PN. The VLBA observations of 22.2 GHz water maser emission reveal a "double-helix" outflow pattern from one of the water fountains, IRAS 18286-0959. The pattern is reasonably fit by a model consisting of two precessing jets. We propose that the two jets observed are a result of a single driving source with a significant proper motion. Using data from the AKARI catalogs, we also found that water fountains might have their own IR colors which are affected by the 9.7 μm silicate feature and the optical thickness of stellar envelopes. The colors could serve as new criteria for searching this type of rare objects. © 2012 International Astronomical Union.

84870273363	Multipolar planetary nebulae: Not as geometrically diversified as thought	Planetary nebulae (PNe) have diverse morphological shapes, including point-symmetric and multipolar structures. Many PNe also have complicated internal structures such as tori, lobes, knots, and ansae. A complete accounting of all the morphological structures through physical models is difficult. A first step toward such an understanding is to derive the true three-dimensional structure of the nebulae. In this paper, we show that a multipolar nebula with three pairs of lobes can explain many such features, if orientation and sensitivity effects are taken into account. Using only six parameters - the inclination and position angles of each pair - we are able to simulate the observed images of 20 PNe with complex structures. We suggest that multipolar structure is an intrinsic structure of PNe and the statistics of multipolar PNe have been severely underestimated in the past. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

84874465321	Post asymptotic giant branch bipolar reflection nebulae: Result of dynamical ejection or selective illumination?	A model for post asymptotic giant branch bipolar reflection nebulae has been constructed based on a pair of evacuated cavities in a spherical dust envelope. Many of the observed features of bipolar nebulae, including filled bipolar lobes, an equatorial torus, searchlight beams, and a bright central light source, can be reproduced. The effects on orientation and dust densities are studied and comparisons with some observed examples are offered. We suggest that many observed properties of bipolar nebulae are the result of optical effects and any physical modeling of these nebulae has to take these factors into consideration. © 2013.

84879015330	Unidentified infrared emission bands: Pahs or maons?	We suggest that the carrier of the unidentified infrared emission (UIE) bands is an amorphous carbonaceous solid with mixed aromatic/aliphatic structures, rather than free-flying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. Through spectral fittings of the astronomical spectra of the UIE bands, we show that a significant amount of the energy is emitted by the aliphatic component, implying that aliphatic groups are an essential part of the chemical structure. Arguments in favor of an amorphous, solid-state structure rather than a gas-phase molecule as a carrier of the UIE are also presented. © 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

84882743732	Molecular evolution from AGB Stars to planetary nebulae	The late stages of stellar evolution from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) to planetary nebulae represent the most active phase of molecular synthesis in a star's life. Over 60 molecular species, including inorganics, organics, radicals, chains, rings, and molecular ions have been detected in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. Most interestingly, complex organic compounds of aromatic and aliphatic structures are synthesized over very short time intervals after the end of the AGB. Also appeared during the post-AGB evolution are the unidentified 21 and 30 μm emission features, which are believed to originate from carbonaceous compounds. The circumstellar environment is an ideal laboratory for the testing of theories of chemical synthesis. The distinct spectral behavior among AGB stars, proto-planetary nebulae (PPN), and planetary nebulae (PN) and the short evolutionary time scales that separate these stages pose severe constraints on models. In this paper, we will present an observational summary of the chemical synthesis in the late stages of stellar evolution, discuss chemical and physical processes at work, and speculate on the possible effects these chemical products have on the Galaxy and the Solar System. © 2011 International Astronomical Union.

84899913319	Hubble space telescope observations and geometric models of compact multipolar planetary nebulae	We report high angular resolution Hubble Space Telescope observations of 10 compact planetary nebulae (PNs). Many interesting internal structures, including multipolar lobes, arcs, two-dimensional rings, tori, and halos, are revealed for the first time. These results suggest that multipolar structures are common among PNs, and these structures develop early in their evolution. From three-dimensional geometric models, we have determined the intrinsic dimensions of the lobes. Assuming the lobes are the result of interactions between later-developed fast winds and previously ejected asymptotic giant branch winds, the geometric structures of these PNs suggest that there are multiple phases of fast winds separated by temporal variations and/or directional changes. A scenario of evolution from lobe-dominated to cavity-dominated stages is presented. The results reported here will provide serious constraints on any dynamical models of PNs. © 2014.
