1642321771	Cesarean scar pregnancy: Issues in management	Objective: To evaluate our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of Cesarean scar pregnancy. Methods: During a 6-year period, 12 cases of Cesarean scar pregnancy were diagnosed using transvaginal color Doppler sonography and treated conservatively to preserve fertility. Incidence, gestational age, sonographic findings, β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels, flow profiles of transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound, and methods of treatment were recorded. Results: The incidence of Cesarean scar pregnancy was 1:2216 and its rate was 6.1% in women with an ectopic pregnancy and at least one previous Cesarean section. Gestational age at diagnosis ranged from 5 + 0 to 12 + 4 weeks. The time interval from the last Cesarean section to the diagnosis of Cesarean scar pregnancy ranged from 6 months to 12 years. High-velocity and low-impedance subtrophoblastic flow (resistance index, 0.38) persisted until β-hCG declined to normal. Patients were treated as follows: transvaginal ultrasound-guided injection of methotrexate into the embryo or gestational sac (n = 3), transabdominal ultrasound-guided injection of methotrexate (n = 2), transabdominal ultrasound-guided injection of methotrexate followed by systemic methotrexate administration (n = 2), systemic methotrexate administration alone (n = 2), dilatation and curettage (n = 2), or local resection of the gestation mass (n = 1). Eleven of the 12 patients preserved their reproductive capacity; the remaining patient, treated by dilatation and curettage, underwent a hysterectomy because of profuse vaginal bleeding. The Cesarean scar mass regressed from 2 months to as long as 1 year after treatment. Uterine rupture occurred in one patient during the following pregnancy at 38 + 3 weeks' gestational age. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection emerges as the treatment of choice to terminate Cesarean scar pregnancy. Surgical or invasive techniques, including dilatation and curettage are not recommended for Cesarean scar pregnancy due to high morbidity and poor prognosis. Copyright © 2004 ISUOG.

17144401155	Primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the uterus: A case report	Objective: Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are a group of unusual malignancies arising in the bone and soft tissue. Pure uterine neuroectodermal tumors are rare. We report the first case of PNET arising from the uterus in our hospital. Case Report: A 52-year-old perimenopausal woman had multiple myoma and was regularly followed-up in our hospital. She suddenly developed lower abdominal pain without vaginal bleeding. Sonography revealed a pelvic mass measuring 10.7 × 6.8 cm with multiple myoma. The patient underwent tumor resection. There were multiple necrotic tumors on the uterus, bladder, broad ligaments, cardinal ligaments, and cul-de-sac. Final pathology revealed PNET because tumor cells were CD99 positive. Conclusion: PNETs belong to the Ewing's sarcoma family. They are closely related to malignant, small round-cell tumors of soft tissue and bones. They strongly express the glyco protein p30/32 (CD99) on the cell membrane, which is encoded by the M/C2 gene. A cranslocation at t(11;22)(q24;q12) has been identified. PNETs are mostly recognized by the histologic characteristics of neural differentiation and immunohistochemical expression of at least two different neural markers. Uterine PNETs have a poor prognosis and, to date, there is no standard treatment. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy plus adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy are recommended.

17144412193	Ruptured intramural pregnancy with low and declining β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels	Objective: Intramural pregnancy is the rarest type of ectopic pregnancy and its diagnosis is usually not made until surgery. This case of intramural pregnancy had an unusual course and an ultrasound appearance not previously reported. Case Report: A 29-year-old woman presented with vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound revealed an empty uterus and a heterogeneous mass at the fundus that displayed prominent blood flow on color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound. Initial serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was 441 mIU/mL and dropped to 295 mIU/mL 2 days later. The woman, however, had heavy vaginal bleeding on the following day. The mass was excised at emergency laparotomy. The pathologic report confirmed the diagnosis of intramural pregnancy. Conclusions: Intramural pregnancy may appear as a heterogeneous mass with prominent blood flow on Doppler ultrasound. The possibility of rupture should be kept in mind even if serum β-hCG is low and keeps falling.

20344391361	IVF versus ICSI in sibling oocytes from patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome: A randomized controlled trial	Background: This study compares the fertilization rate and embryonic development of oocytes randomly inseminated by conventional IVF or ICSI in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and normozoospermic semen during IVF cycles. Methods: Sibling oocytes were randomized to be inseminated either by ICSI or IVF. Fertilization rate (two pronuclei/COC), day 2 embryonic morphology and rate of development were assessed. Results: A total of 1089 cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) were collected in 60 cycles (mean ± SD, 18.2 ± 7.2). Totals of 541 and 548 COC were inseminated by IVF and ICSI respectively, with a significantly higher fertilization rate in the ICSI group (ICSI versus IVF, 72.3 ± 15.5 versus 44.8 ± 25.1%). No fertilization failure occurred in the group of oocytes inseminated by ICSI, whereas the COC in nine patients (15%) inseminated by IVF had complete fertilization failure. The day 2 embryonic morphology and rate of development were not different regardless of the insemination method. Conclusions: Our results suggested that another randomized controlled study, randomizing patients instead of sibling oocytes, should be undertaken to compare the pregnancy rate per started cycle and to see whether ICSI should be performed on all, or at least on a portion of, oocytes for patients with PCOS undergoing IVF cycles. © The Author 2005.

27644596790	The correlation between renal function and systolic or diastolic blood pressure in severe preeclamptic women	Objective. To evaluate the correlation between renal function and systolic or diastolic blood pressure in preeclamptic mothers. Methods. In this prospective study from August 1998 to September 2002, 28 women ≥ 28 weeks gestation with severe pre-eclampsia were selected. Meanwhile, 56 normotensive pregnant women without proteinuria or edema served as the control group. Urine was collected for 24 hours for all subjects. The concentration of uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, calcium, and albumin in the 24-hour urine and blood of both groups were examined. Neonatal outcome also was evaluated. Results. The serum and 24-hour urine concentration of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and albumin were significantly higher in severe preeclamptic women. Serum uric acid and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly higher in severe preeclamptic women compared with that in normotensive mothers and showed positive correlation with systolic or diastolic blood pressure. On the other hand, serum calcium/creatinine ratio was significantly lower in the severe preeclamptic group and negatively correlated to blood pressure. In multiple regressions, systolic or diastolic blood pressure was dependent on serum uric acid, albumin/creatinine, and calcium/creatinine ratios. Fetal birth weight was significantly lower in women with severe preeclampsia and with a lower Apgar score < 7 at 1 minute and 5 minutes and more preterm delivery compared with that in normotensive women. Conclusion. Renal function in women with severe preeclampsia was significantly impaired and highly correlated with systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis Inc.

33745381747	Comparison of outcome of clomiphene citrate/human menopausal gonadotropin/cetrorelix protocol and buserelin long protocol - A randomized study	This study evaluates the efficacy of a stimulation protocol with clomiphene citrate (CC)/human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)/cetrorelix and its effects on oocyte quality and endometrium. One hundred and twenty couples with male-factor infertility who were about to undergo their first intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles were randomized into two groups. Sixty women were stimulated with the CC/hMG/cetrorelix protocol (cetrorelix group) and 60 received the buserelin long protocol (buserelin group). Fewer oocytes were recovered in the cetrorelix group than in the buserelin group (mean ± standard deviation (SD): 11.1 ± 4.0 vs. 17.3 ± 5.8, p < 0.001); however, the percentages of metaphase II, metaphase I and germinal vesicle oocytes were similar between the two groups. Serum estradiol level was significantly lower in the cetrorelix than in the buserelin group (mean ± SD: 2600.58 ± 1189.11 vs. 3293.46 ± 1221.49 pg/ml, p = 0.006), but the endometrial thickness was similar. The implantation rates (19.2% vs. 17.7%) and the pregnancy rates (41.7% vs. 40.0%) were similar between groups. The ampoules (mean ± SD: 18.9 ± 3.0 vs. 38.9 ± 12.2, p < 0.001) and injections (mean ± SD: 6.8 ± 1.1 vs. 15.7 ± 3.1, p < 0.001) of gonadotropin used were significantly lower in the cetrorelix group than in the buserelin group. No patients in either group developed a premature luteinizing hormone surge. The present study found no statistically significant difference between the two treatment modalities with regard to pregnancy rates. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

33748780621	Is a lower dose of cetrorelix acetate effective for prevention of LH surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation?	Purpose: This study was performed to evaluate whether a lower dose (0.2 mg) of cetrorelix would prevent premature LH surge in patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Methods: Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation was carried out in 45 patients, starting on menstrual cycle day 3 with recombinant FSH (r-FSH), and a cetrorelix of 0.2 mg was administered from day 5 evening of ovarian stimulation until the day before hCG injection. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in serum LH level one day after the first cetrorelix injection and on the day of hCG administration. Serum LH concentrations were maintained constantly low during the follicular phase with no premature LH surge occurring in any of the patients. Clinical pregnancy was achieved for 18 women (40%), with one of these experiencing intrauterine fetal death before 12 week' gestation. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a daily dose of cetrorelix 0.2 mg is able to prevent premature LH surge. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.

33748162239	Outcomes and complications of laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy	Objective: To report whether operative time, intraoperative complications, and rate of conversion to laparotomy decreased after physicians had acquired an additional 4 years experience with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). Methods: Group 1 (n = 462) included the women who underwent LAVH from May 1, 1994 to December 31, 1997, and group 2 (n = 583) included those who underwent LAVH from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2001. Results: The mean duration of surgery in groups 1 and 2 was 146 and 114 min, respectively, and the difference was significant (P < 0.0001). The overall complication rate in the last 4 years of the study was 7.1%, which was significantly lower than the 13.4% calculated for the first 4 years (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Operative time as well as rates of surgical complications and conversion to laparotomy decreased with increased surgeon experience at performing LAVH. © 2006 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

33847037477	Impact of estradiol patterns in clomiphene citrate/human menopausal gonadotropin/cetrorelix protocol	The importance of serum estradiol changes associated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists is not clear. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the impact of estradiol changes after cetrorelix injection on the outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. This was a prospective observational study. One hundred and thirteen women with male-factor infertility who were undergoing first ICSI cycles were reviewed for this study. Excluding seven cycles with incomplete data, 106 cycles were included in the analysis. The women were stimulated with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). Cetrorelix acetate (2.5 mg) was given when the leading follicles reached 14 mm. After cetrorelix administration, serum estradiol rose in 48 cycles (45.3%), plateaued in 26 cycles (24.5%) and dropped in 32 cycles (30.2%). Mean age and day-3 follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and estradiol levels were similar among the three groups. The mean ampoules of hMG used, estradiol levels on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin injection and the clinical outcomes, including numbers of oocytes retrieved and fertilization, implantation and pregnancy rates, were similar in all three groups regardless of the trend of estradiol. In conclusion, estradiol patterns after cetrorelix injection show no correlation with clinical outcome and ovarian reserve, and falling estradiol is not associated with adverse outcome. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

34447128667	Subtle progesterone rise in the single-dose gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (cetrorelix) stimulation protocol in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles	A subtle rise in serum progesterone during the late follicular phase in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles is a frequent event that can decrease implantation and pregnancy rates in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocols that use a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and effect of the subtle progesterone rise during COH with single-dose GnRH antagonist in combination with clomiphene citrate (CC) and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) in IVF or ICSI cycles. Ninety-five women undergoing COH with CC, hMG and a single 2.5 mg dose of the GnRH antagonist, cetrorelix, were enrolled in the study. Patients were grouped according to serum progesterone level on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (P < 1.2 ng/ml or P ≥ 1.2 ng/ml). The incidence of a subtle progesterone rise was 54.7% (52/95). The group with P ≥ 1.2 ng/ml had significantly higher serum levels of luteinizing hormone (p = 0.002) and estradiol (p < 0.001) on the day of hCG injection than the group with P < 1.2 ng/ml, and more oocytes were retrieved (p = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in fertilization, clinical pregnancy or implantation rate between the two groups. In conclusion, a subtle progesterone rise during the late follicular phase is common but not associated with pregnancy outcome. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

34347245263	Midtrimester maternal serum inhibin A levels after multifetal pregnancy reduction	Objective: To investigate the relationship between the maternal serum inhibin A concentrations and the number of fetuses. Further, the maternal serum inhibin A levels for twin pregnancies and multiple pregnancies reduced to twins in the second trimester were compared. Methods: Three groups of women with pregnancies following in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer were recruited for this study. Groups 1, 2 and 3 included 20 singleton pregnancies, 37 twin pregnancies, and 35 multifetal pregnancies, respectively. In group 3, multifetal reduction was performed during 10-12 weeks of gestation. Blood samples were obtained longitudinally at 10th, 12th, 15th and 18th week of gestation. Results: There was a significant association between the number of fetuses and maternal plasma inhibin A prior to multifetal reduction. The inhibin A levels were not significantly different between twin and multifetal reduced twin pregnancies at 15th and 18th weeks of gestation. Conclusion: In multifetal reduction to twin pregnancies, the maternal serum levels of inhibin A decrease to the level of twin pregnancies during the second trimester. Therefore, inhibin A may be effectively used as a marker for Down syndrome screening in cases of twin pregnancy following multifetal reduction. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

34548307037	Comparative study of conservative and surgical management for symptomatic moderate and severe hydronephrosis in pregnancy: A prospective randomized study	Background. To analyze the role of different measures in the treatment of acute moderate or severe symptomatic hydronephrosis in pregnancy. Methods. Of the 18,130 women delivering at our institution between January 2000 and December 2004, 93 patients were admitted due to symptomatic hydronephrosis. Among these, 50 patients were diagnosed with moderate or severe hydronephrosis, and were randomly treated with conservative measures (25 patients) or double pigtail stent insertion (25 patients). Renal sonography, urinalysis, serum creatinine levels, white blood cell counts, and urine culture were done in all patients at first visit. The clinical and perinatal outcomes of the two groups were compared. Results. The incidence of symptomatic hydronephrosis in pregnancy was 0.5% in our institution (93/18,130). The majority of the moderate or severe hydronephrosis (88%) cases were diagnosed after the first trimester. There were no statistically significant differences in the fetal body weight, Apgar score, preterm labor, and hospitalization day between the two groups. Among those receiving conservative treatment, five patients (5/25, 20%) failed to respond and were subsequently treated by double pigtail stent insertion successfully, compared with the surgical group, in which all patients were successfully relieved by double pigtail stent (p=0.018). Four patients receiving double pigtail stent insertion complained of stent discomfort and flank pain after the procedure (16%). Conclusion. Double pigtail stent insertion is effective for the treatment of moderate or severe symptomatic hydronephrosis in pregnancy, and showed a lower failure rate than the conservative treatment. However, due to the complications and discomfort with surgical treatment, conservative treatment should still be the first choice. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

34548422779	Application of GnRH antagonist in combination with clomiphene citrate and hMG for patients with exaggerated ovarian response in previous IVF/ICSI cycles	Purpose: To investigate if the combination of clomiphene citrate, hMG, and cetrorelix (CC/hMG/cetrorelix protocol) can be applied to patients who had excessive response to GnRHa long protocol. Methods: Fifty patients who coasted and failed to conceive in their first cycles stimulated with GnRHa long protocol were stimulated with CC/hMG/cetrorelix protocol. The peak serum estradiol levels, the need of coasting and prolonged coasting (≥4 days), and the incidences of OHSS were compared. Results: The peak estradiol level was significantly lower with CC/hMG/cetrorelix protocol compared to GnRHa long protocol. With CC/hMG/cetrorelix protocol, only four patients (8%) needed coasting and no one coasted ≥4 days. In contrast, in the first cycles, 11 patients (22%) needed coasting ≥4 days. The incidence of moderate OHSS was significantly lower with CC/hMG/cetrorelix protocol. Conclusions: The CC/hMG/cetrorelix protocol is an acceptable alternative protocol for patients who had excessive response to GnRHa long protocol. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

0033656172	Prenatal diagnosis of meconium peritonitis in a twin pregnancy after intracytoplasmic sperm injection: A case report	BACKGROUND: Meconium peritonitis occurring in pregnancies following artificial reproductive techniques (ART) is rare. We report the first case of meconium peritonitis following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). CASE: A 37-year-old woman attended our in vitro fertilization (IVF) program because her husband suffered from hypospermatogenetic azoospermia due to cancer surgery and radiotherapy. The patient achieved a twin pregnancy through ICSI from testicular sperm extraction at our IVF center. Meconium peritonitis, fetal ascites, polyhydramnios, bowel dilatation, hydrocele and intraabdominal calcification were noted in one of the twins on ultrasound at 30 weeks' gestation. Cesarean section due to breech presentation in labor was performed at 36 weeks' gestation. A normal female and male infant with a distended abdomen were delivered. Emergency laparotomy was performed on the male twin because of dyspnea. A 0.2-cm perforation was found in the terminal ileum. Ileotomy was performed and closed after 27 days. CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnosis of meconium peritonitis is possible through careful ultrasonographic examination, and early surgical intervention and intensive postoperative support are required to improve the prognosis.

0033794916	Methotrexate for cesarean scar pregnancy after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer: A case report	BACKGROUND: Cesarean scar pregnancy is an exceedingly rare occurrence. We present the first case of cesarean scar pregnancy following in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). CASE: A 40-year-oldwoman with a history of a previous cesarean section presented with five years of unexplained infertility. The patient complained of abdominal pain 16 days after embryo transfer. Ultrasonography revealed a gestational sac with cardiac activity located outside the lower segment of the uterus. Dilatation and curettage was performed due to misdiagnosis of inevitable abortion. Two weeks later, repeated sonography demonstrated a sacculus, 4.07 x 4.07 cm, within the uterine isthmus with only 7.1 mm of thickness separating the sac from the urinary bladder. Normal cervical length without ballooning was noted. Cesarean scar pregnancy was diagnosed. Local injection of methotrexate (MTX) under ultrasound guidance was performed. Plasma β-hCG levels declined from 23,328 to 8 mIU/mL within two months. CONCLUSION: For women with cesarean scar pregnancy who desire fertility, conservative treatment using MTX is an excellent choice.

38149140122	Laparoscopic surgery in polycystic ovary syndrome: Reproductive and metabolic effects	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of chronic anovulation. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is the first-line treatment for ovulation induction for infertile women with PCOS. In CC-resistant women, a particular surgical method, laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD), has been proposed in recent years as an alternative treatment. LOD produces overall spontaneous ovulation and pregnancy rates of 30 to 90% and 13 to 88%, respectively, for CC-resistant PCOS women. The mechanism of LOD is still unknown. The reduction of serum androgen level is believed to be the possible mechanism of LOD to improve spontaneous ovulation and promote fertility in women with PCOS. In addition, LOD may cause a significant reduction in serum luteinizing hormone and insulin levels. However, it should be kept in mind that postoperative adhesion is the most common adverse effect of LOD, and more punctures may be responsible for premature ovarian failure.

4043081963	Intentional cryopreservation of epididymal spermatozoa from percutaneous aspiration for dissociated intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles	Background. To investigate the possibility of cryopreservation of spermatozoa obtained from percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) in patients with obstructive azoospermia and the feasibility of intentional dissociation of PESA and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. Methods. Fifty-six patients with obstructive azoospermia underwent diagnostic PESA before ovarian stimulation. If spermatozoa were found, they were frozen for subsequent ICSI. The outcome was compared with 17 fresh PESA/ICSI cycles. Results. Among the 56 patients, diagnostic PESA obtained spermatozoa in 51 patients. The mean motility of the spermatozoa decreased from 15.2% to 4.2% after freezing and thawing. These patients underwent 96 frozen PESA/ICSI cycles. The rates of fertilization, implantation and clinical pregnancy for frozen-thawed spermatozoa (71.6, 14.0 and 40.6%, respectively) were similar to those for fresh spermatozoa (69.2, 13.2 and 41.2%, respectively). Conclusions. Sufficient numbers of spermatozoa can be obtained for cryopreservation through PESA and the spermatozoa work well after thawing. The strategy of performing diagnostic PESA before ovarian stimulation and freezing the recovered spermatozoa for subsequent ICSI is feasible for patients with obstructive azoospermia. © Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 83 2004.

34247511579	Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy from a ruptured superficial uterine vessel	A 31-year-old multipara woman pregnant at gestational age 32+ weeks with twins encountered hemoperitoneum resulting from superficial uterine vessel rupture during tocolytic course. The initial presentations were unspecific and sonographic examination was negative. Later the aggravated symptoms led to an impression of abruptio placentae and emergent cesarean section was performed. A superficial venous bleeder was located on the posterior uterine wall and the internal bleeding was up to 3 L. Maternal and fetal outcome were good. Hemoperitoneum during pregnancy is rare but life-threatening to both mother and fetus, and it mimics placenta abruption in many ways. However, by careful investigations with cardiotocogram and bedside echo, they are quite distinguishable. Aggressive fluid replacement and immediate surgical intervention after rapid diagnosis provides the best prognosis.

80052901856	Expression of visfatin mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is not correlated with visfatin mRNA in omental adipose tissue in women with polycystic ovary syndrome	Background Visfatin, which is secreted predominantly from visceral adipose tissue, has an insulin-mimetic action and may play a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity in humans. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from venous blood samples are the most accessible tissue for the analysis of gene expression. The aims of the study were to compare the expression of visfatin in PBMCs with that in omental adipose tissue in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods Visfatin mRNA was measured in omental adipose tissue and PBMCs from 10 women with PCOS and 10 healthy controls, matched for BMI and age, using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results The expression of visfatin mRNA in both omental adipose tissue and PBMCs from the women with PCOS was significantly higher (P = 0.01 and P = 0.05, respectively) than that in the controls. This finding indicated that mononuclear cells are a potential source of visfatin in women with PCOS. However, only the expression of visfatin mRNA in adipose tissue, not that in PBMCs, showed a significant positive correlation with insulin levels 2h after glucose loading (P = 0.044, r

44249095375	Influence of serum from pregnant women and selected pregnancy hormones on in-vitro maturation of murine oocytes	Maturation medium for in-vitro maturation (IVM) is usually supplemented with serum. The objective of this study was to investigate whether serum from pregnant women had any adverse effects on IVM, and if so, whether the hormonal changes in pregnancy played a role. Serum was obtained from 40 pregnant women and was analysed for oestradiol, prolactin, β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-HCG), progesterone and testosterone. In the first part of the study, immature murine oocytes were cultured in maturation media supplemented with various sera. The control group was supplemented with 10% serum from fertile women, and groups 2-5 were respectively supplemented with 10, 20, 40 and 80% serum from pregnant women. In the second part of the study, immature murine oocytes were matured in the medium with the addition of different hormones according to the concentrations found in the serum of pregnant women. Compared with the control group, the maturation and fertilization rates were significantly lower in medium supplemented with 10% serum from pregnant women (59.7 versus 71.5% and 60.1 versus 77.0% respectively, both P < 0.05). There was a trend of decreasing maturation and fertilization rates with increasing concentrations of serum from pregnant women. Addition of prolactin, β-HCG, progesterone and testosterone also impaired oocyte maturation. © 2008 Published by Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

45849141630	Effectiveness of cetrorelix for the prevention of premature luteinizing hormone surge during controlled ovarian stimulation using letrozole and gonadotropins: a randomized trial	Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a GnRH antagonist in preventing premature LH surge under a letrozole and gonadotropin protocol. Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial. Setting: A teaching hospital and tertiary medical center. Patient(s): Sixty-one patients were randomly assigned into two letrozole and gonadotropin-treated groups. These were distinguished by the absence (group I) or presence (group II) of supplementation with 0.25 mg of cetrorelix. Intervention(s): Controlled ovarian stimulation with letrozole and gonadotropins, cetrorelix and intrauterine insemination. Main Outcome Measure(s): Rate of premature LH surge. Result(s): Compared with group I, the rate of premature LH surge was statistically significantly lower for group II (43.4% [13/30] vs. 19.4% [6/31]), but the amount of gonadotropins used was statistically significantly higher (817.5 ± 28.5 vs. 907.5 ± 27.3 IU). Patients with premature LH surge had a statistically significantly lower pregnancy rate (21.4% [9/42] vs. 0 [0/18]) relative to their unaffected counterparts. Conclusion(s): A flexible protocol of 0.25 mg of cetrorelix for IUI cycles appears to suppress the rate of premature LH surge during ovarian stimulation with letrozole and gonadotropins. However, the incidence of premature LH surge remains too high, and modification will be necessary before the application of cetrorelix to IVF treatment. © 2008 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

4544323556	Ovarian stimulation by concomitant administration of cetrorelix acetate and HMG following Diane-35 pre-treatment for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: A prospective randomized study	Background: Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may need a longer period of pituitary downregulation to suppress the elevated serum LH and androgen levels effectively during IVF treatment using the GnRH agonist long protocol. We proposed a stimulation protocol incorporating Diane-35 and GnRH antagonist (Diane/cetrorelix protocol) and compared it with the GnRH agonist long protocol for PCOS patients. Methods: Part I of the study was an observational pilot study to evaluate the hormonal change as a result of the Diane/cetrorelix protocol (n = 26). Part II of the study was a prospective randomized study comparing the Diane/cetrorelix protocol (n = 25) and the GnRH agonist long protocol (n = 24). In the Diane/cetrorelix protocol, patients were pretreated with three cycles of Diane-35, followed by 0.25 mg of cetrorelix on cycle day 3. From day 4, cetrorelix and gonadotrophin were administered concomitantly until the day of HCG injection. Results: Serum LH, estradiol and testosterone levels were suppressed comparably in both protocols at the start of gonadotrophin administration. Serum LH was suppressed at constant levels without a premature LH surge in the Diane/cetrorelix protocol. The clinical results for both protocols were comparable, with significantly fewer days of injection, lower amounts of gonadotrophin used and lower estradiol levels on the day of HCG injection following the Diane/cetrorelix protocol. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in clinical pregnancy outcome between the two stimulation protocols. Conclusions: The Diane/cetrorelix protocol has a similar pregnancy outcome to the GnRH agonist long protocol for women with PCOS undergoing IVF treatment. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved.

45749086919	Effect of cetrorelix dose on premature LH surge during ovarian stimulation	Previous studies have shown that ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate (CC), human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG), and multiple-dose gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist is associated with a high rate of premature LH surge. This study assessed whether administration of the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix at an incremental dose or at a high dose (0.5mg) from the start could prevent premature LH surge. Couples with male factor or unexplained infertility who were going to undergo intrauterine insemination were randomized into two stimulation protocols. All women were stimulated with CC and HMG. In protocol A, cetrorelix was given at 0.25 mg per day when the leading follicles reached 14 mm, and increased to 0.5 mg when the leading follicles were 16 mm. With protocol B, cetrorelix was given at 0.5 mg per day when the leading follicles reached 14 mm. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of premature LH surge. Premature LH surge occurred in 21.6% of patients undergoing protocol A, and in 18.9% of patients undergoing protocol B. Cetrorelix at incremental dose or at 0.5 mg per day does not prevent premature LH surges associated with the CC/ HMG/multiple-dose cetrorelix stimulation protocol. © 2008 Published by Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

67651097746	Dermoid Cyst of the Retrouterine Pouch of Douglas	Objective: Benign cystic teratomas are one of the most common ovarian tumors. Teratomas of the retrouterine pouch of Douglas are extremely rare. We report a case of benign cystic teratoma of the Douglas pouch in a woman who underwent laparoscopic surgery. Case Report: A 61-year-old woman presented with lower abdominal pain. On pelvic examination, a pelvic mass was palpated in the right adnexa. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated two cyst-like masses in the right adnexa. One was homogeneous and measured 4.0 × 3.5 cm, while the other was heterogeneous and measured 3.5 × 3.0 cm. The concentration of the CA125 tumor marker was 8.88 U/mL. On laparoscopy, a cyst 5 × 4 cm in diameter located in the right adnexa, and a 4 × 3 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the cul-de-sac were found. Pathology revealed a right ovarian simple cyst and a benign cystic teratoma in the pouch of Douglas. Conclusion: The etiology of benign cystic teratomas of the Douglas pouch is poorly understood. We report a rare site of a benign cystic teratoma that may provide insights into the differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass in the retrouterine pouch of Douglas. © 2004 Taiwan Association of Obstetric & Gynecology.

67651123047	Omental adipose tissue overexpression of fatty acid transporter CD36 and decreased expression of hormone-sensitive lipase in insulin-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome	BACKGROUNDElevated free fatty acids (FFAs) are involved in insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We investigated the role of fatty acid transporter CD36, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in regulation of lipolysis in insulin-resistant women with PCOS.METHODSCD36, HSL and ATGL proteins were analyzed in omental adipose tissue from 10 women with PCOS and 10 healthy, BMI- and age-matched controls by western blotting.RESULTSWomen with PCOS had higher fasting and 2 h insulin levels (P < 0.002, P < 0.029, respectively) and a higher homeostasis model insulin resistance index (P < HOMAIR, 0.005) and a lower fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio (G0/I0) (P < 0.001) than controls. CD36 protein levels in the PCOS women were higher (268 of control levels, P < 0.05) and HSL protein levels were lower (43 of control levels, P < 0.05). However, ATGL protein levels were not different in the two groups. Fasting serum insulin levels showed a positive correlation with CD36 levels (P = 0.01, r = 0.875) and a negative correlation with HSL levels (P = 0.045, r = -0.73). Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between serum testosterone levels and CD 36 protein levels (P = 0.025, r = 0.817) but the correlation did not reach significance after controlling for HOMAIR. After adjusting insulin resistance index of HOMAIR by analysis of covariance, only CD36 differed between PCOS and control (P = 0.026).CONCLUSIONSOur results suggest that, in insulin-resistant women with PCOS, changes in CD36 and HSL expression may result in altered FFA uptake.

69249138780	Effects of growth factors and granulosa cell co-culture on in-vitro maturation of oocytes	The maturation medium for in-vitro oocyte maturation is usually supplemented with serum. However, supplementation with serum from pregnant women adversely affects the outcome of in-vitro maturation. The purpose of the study was to assess if growth factors or granulosa cell co-culture could overcome the adverse effects of pregnant women's serum. The basal maturation medium consisted of TCM199, 75 mIU/ml human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG), 0.2 mmol/l pyruvate, and 10% serum. The maturation medium for control 1 contained fertile women's serum. The maturation medium for control 2 contained pregnant women's serum. The maturation media for the study groups consisted of medium for control 2, with the addition of EGF, IGF-I, activin, TGFβ or granulosa cell co-culture. Immature oocytes were obtained from FVB mice, and the experiment was repeated six times. After maturation, the oocytes were fertilized and cultured to blastocysts, and the cumulus cells were analysed for apoptosis. The maturation, fertilization and blastocyst rates of the control 2 group were significantly lower than those of control 1 group (P < 0.05). Addition of EGF, IGF-1, activin, TGFβ or granulosa cell co-culture could not improve the outcome of in-vitro maturation. Cumulus cell proliferation was inhibited by pregnant women's serum. Apoptosis of cumulus cell was not related to in-vitro oocyte maturation and subsequent embryo development.

70049088469	Effectiveness of double cervical cerclage in women with at least one previous pregnancy loss in the second trimester: A randomized controlled trial	Aim: To evaluate the effect of double cervical cerclage on the prevention of preterm delivery, and perinatal and maternal outcomes in women with previous fetal loss in the second trimester. Methods: Between January 2001 and December 2006 we conducted a prospective study in which patients with a previous preterm delivery at the second trimester who met clinical criteria for the diagnosis of cervical incompetence were randomly allocated to receive double cervical cerclage or traditional single cervical cerclage at a ratio of 1:2. Results: The perinatal and maternal outcomes of the two groups were compared. A total of 17 women were allocated to the double cervical cerclage group, and 34 to the traditional single cervical cerclage group. The single cervical cerclage group had a higher incidence of preterm delivery at <28 weeks than the double cerclage group (29.4 vs 5.9%, respectively, P = 0.0528). The mean gestational age and birth weight in the double cervical cerclage group were significantly higher than in the traditional single cervical cerclage group (35.9 ± 5.4 vs 32.9 ± 7.5 weeks, respectively for gestational age, P = 0.045; 2696 ± 911 vs 2242 ± 1119 g, respectively for birth weight, P = 0.048). No significant differences in rates of neonatal survival (P = 0.241) and neonatal admission to the intensive care unit were found between the two groups. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that double cervical cerclage may significantly improve perinatal outcome in women with at least one previous pregnancy loss in the second trimester. © 2009 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

70350542695	Omental fat receptor interacting protein 140 mRNA expression in women with polycystic ovary syndrome	Background: Receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is a co-repressor and essential for oocytes released by the ovary during ovulation. The aim of the study is to investigate adipose mRNA expression of RIP140 in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) before and 3 months after laparoscopic ovarian electrocauterization (LOE). Methods: Adipose tissues obtained from 15 women with PCOS before and after LOE were analyzed. Ten lean, age- and BMI-matched non-PCOS women served as controls. Gene expression of RIP140 was quantified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Results: The overall spontaneous ovulation rate was 73.3% in PCOS after the LOE procedure. However, no difference was found in the expression of RIP140 between women with PCOS before LOE and controls or between PCOS before and after LOE. No difference was found in RIP140 expression between obese and lean women with PCOS, or between obese PCOS and lean controls. Further, there was no correlation between RIP140 and fasting or 2-hour glucose or insulin, homeostasis model insulin resistance index (HOMA

0035029476	Acute hydrothorax as the only manifestation of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after in vitro fertilization: Case report and literature review	The authors present a rare case of bilateral hydrothoraces after ovulation induction in vitro fertilization and review the etiology and management of such cases. The patient, a 33-year-old G2, P0 woman with a 10-year history of infertility, underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer at the authors' institution. She experienced abdominal tenderness, dyspnea, and a dry cough 2 days after treatment commenced. Transvaginal and transabdominal sonography showed bilateral ovarian enlargement and no ascites. Chest roentgenograms revealed a moderate right hydrothorax and a small left hydrothorax. Thoracocentesis was performed because of severe dyspnea. Pleural fluid investigations showed that she was free of infection, collagen vascular disease, tuberculosis, and malignancy. Pigtail drains were inserted and remained in place for 6 days. A total of 3,400 ml of transudate fluid was drained. The patient was discharged without complications. Most hydrothoraces in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome resolve spontaneously without treatment, but thoracocentesis is necessary in the event of respiratory distress.

71849099955	Laminaria Tent vs Misoprostol for Cervical Priming before Hysteroscopy: Randomized Study	Study Objective: To compare the efficacy of laminaria tents and orally administered misoprostol in priming the cervix before operative hysteroscopy. Design: Randomized, controlled study (Canadian Task Force classification I). Setting: Tertiary medical center. Patients: One hundred twenty premenopausal women who underwent operative hysteroscopy between March 2005 and January 2007. Intervention: The women were randomized to receive a laminaria tent or misoprostol for cervical priming. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcomes were postpriming cervical width insofar as size of Hegar dilators and need for cervical dilation. The secondary outcomes were adverse effects from the priming methods. Postpriming cervical width was greater in the laminaria group but not significantly different from that in the misoprostol group. However, cervical dilation before hysteroscopy was required in more patients in the misoprostol group. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding were more common in the misoprostol group, and the incidences of chills and headache were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Laminaria tents are superior to oral misoprostol insofar as less need for cervical dilation and fewer adverse effects. © 2009 AAGL.

Methods: In this prospective controlled study 100 patients who underwent LAVH from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2007, were randomized to receive an injection of vasopressin (n = 50) or normal saline (n = 50) solution in the colpotomy wound. Results: In the vasopressin group, bleeding from the colpotomy wound occurred for more than 7 days in 9 patients (18%), and none was bleeding after 1 month; in the control group, the corresponding values were 29 (58%) and 2 (4%). Compared with the study group, the control group had a significantly higher rate of chronic bleeding from the colpotomy wound for more than 7 days and for more than 14 days after LAVH (P < 0.001 for both). Conclusion: Infiltrating the colpotomy wound with diluted vasopressin was found to prevent chronic vaginal bleeding, which frequently occurs following LAVH. © 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

77649329641	Oral sex is a risk factor for human papillomavirus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma in husbands of women with cervical cancer	Sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) is etiologically related to cervical carcinoma and a distinct subset of cancers of the nasopharyngeal tract. We report 2 patients with HPV-associated cervical cancer and synchronous diagnoses of HPV-related head and neck cancer of their husbands. These patients had active oral sex for more than 20 years. The first patient was a 64-year-old woman who had an abnormal Papanicolaou smear and was found to have squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix on cervical punched biopsy. Her husband was diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma 1 year previously, and was treated with total laryngectomy and adjuvant radiation. HPV-16 DNA was detected in both their tumor specimens using polymerase chain reaction. The other patient was a 50-year-old female with cervical carcinoma treated surgically and with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. HPV-31 DNA was detected in her tumor specimen. Three years later, her husband presented with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, although not a tobacco or alcohol user. HPV-18 DNA was detected in his tumor specimen.These findings strongly suggest that HPV may play a major role in the carcinogenesis of urogenital and nasopharyngeal tumors and the transmission potential of orogenital sex. © 2010 S.

77949656905	Decreased p21 expression in HPV-18 positive cervical carcinomas	The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between different human papillomaviruse (HPV) genotypes and the expression of p53, p21 and p27 in cervical carcinomas. A total of 103 cases of cervical carcinomas were assayed for expression of p53, p21 and p27 by immunohistochemistry. HPV typing was carried out by two polymerase chain reaction-based methods. Overall, HPV prevalence was 97.1% among the cervical carcinomas in this study. HPV-16 was detected in 66% of the tumors, HPV-18 in 7.8%, HPV-16/18 in 7.8% and other HPV types in 15.5%. The expression of p53 and p27 was not related to HPV genotype. However, in the HPV-18 positive cervical carcinomas, expression of p21 was significantly decreased or completely absent (P = 0.019). Our results indicated that down-regulation of p21 was strongly associated with HPV-18 positive cervical carcinomas. The significantly lower expression of p21 protein in HPV-18 positive samples compared to HPV-18 negative cervical carcinomas supports the hypothesis that inactivation and degradation of p21 proteins by HPV-18 E7 may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of HPV-18 positive cervical neoplasia. © 2009 Arányi Lajos Foundation.

77952545779	Safety and efficacy of mixing cetrorelix with follitropin alfa: a randomized study	Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of mixing cetrorelix with follitropin alfa (rFSH) in assisted reproductive technology. Design: Prospective, randomized study. Setting: An IVF center in a teaching hospital. Patient(s): One hundred forty patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection were randomized into mixed (M) or separate (S) injection groups. Intervention(s): In the M group, rFSH and cetrorelix were mixed immediately before administration, whereas in the S group, rFSH and cetrorelix were administered separately. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary efficacy end point was the incidence of premature LH surge. The secondary efficacy endpoints included estradiol levels on the day of hCG injection, numbers of oocytes obtained, implantation, and ongoing pregnancy rates. The safety endpoints included ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and adverse events related to injections including local tolerability. Result(s): Excluding eight patients who dropped out of the study, there were 66 patients in each group for analysis. Patients in the M group received significantly fewer injections than patients in the S group (9.1 vs. 13.9). Other outcome parameters, including incidences of premature LH surge, numbers of oocytes retrieved, fertilization, implantation, and ongoing pregnancy rates were similar between the two groups. Conclusion(s): Cetrorelix and rFSH can be mixed together without compromising their reported safety and efficacy. This observation is in line with the reported safety and efficacy profile of the products listed in their current package inserts. © 2010 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Methods: We enrolled 233 patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with r-FSH and GnRH antagonist for IVF or ICSI. A subtle Prog rise 1 day before hCG administration was defined as a Prog value of ≥1.2 ng/ml. Results: 100 of 233 cycles (42.9%) showed a subtle Prog rise in this study. The mean serum Prog levels and area under curve (AUC) in the group with Prog ≥1.2 ng/ml was significantly higher than that in the Prog <1.2 ng/ml group on cycle day 8 (1.17 ± 0.4 and 0.80 ± 0.3 ng/ml, respectively, for Prog level, p = 0.003; 571 ± 123 and 763 ± 250 for AUC, p = 0.001), and remained significantly higher until the day of hCG administration. Moreover, 55% of the patients on cycle day 9, 65% on cycle day 10, 75% on cycle day 11 and 85% on cycle day 12 in the Prog ≥1.2 ng/ml group have a serum Prog level of ≥1.2 ng/ml. Conclusion: A subtle Prog rise may occur as early as cycle day 8 in r-FSH/GnRH antagonist cycles. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

79251476204	Expression levels of haem oxygenase-1 in the omental adipose tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with polycystic ovary syndrome	BACKGROUNDHaem oxygenase (HO)-1, an enzyme that degrades haem, plays a key role in the regulation of the inflammatory response and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of HO-1 in the regulation of insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).METHODSOmental adipose tissue and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven women with PCOS and five healthy controls, matched for BMI and age, were analysed using western blotting and the real-time PCR.RESULTS Women with PCOS were found to have significantly higher fasting and 2-h insulin levels, a significantly higher homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index and a lower fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio (G0/I0) than the controls. The level of HO-1 protein in omental fat (P 0.002), and the expression of HO-1 mRNA in omental fat and PBMCs from the women with PCOS were significantly lower (P 0.002 and 0.05, respectively) than those of the controls. The expression of adiponectin mRNA in omental fat was also significantly lower (P 0.02) in the women with PCOS than in the controls. However, there were no significant differences in the expression of tumour necrosis factor-α or interleukin-6 between the two groups.

79960380763	Effect of incubation with different concentrations and durations of FSH for in-vitro maturation of murine oocytes	The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether a lower concentration of FSH or 2-h incubation with FSH would improve the outcome of in-vitro maturation of oocytes. The immature oocytes were obtained from FVB mice, and were allocated to four groups and incubated in the maturation media for 24 h. The maturation media were supplemented with 10 mIU/ml FSH for 24 h (group 1), 10 mIU/ml FSH for 2 h (group 2), 75 mIU/ml FSH for 24 h (group 3) or 75 mIU/ml FSH for 2 h (group 4). In each group, half of the in-vitro-matured oocytes were fertilized and cultured to blastocysts and the remaining matured oocytes were analysed for growth differentiation factor (GDF)-9 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-15 mRNA to assess the oocyte quality. The maturation rates and oocyte BMP-15 mRNA concentrations were similar among the four groups. The GDF-9 mRNA concentrations were similar in group 2 and group 4. The fertilization and blastocyst rates were higher in groups 2 and 4 than in groups 1 and 3. It is concluded that 2-h incubation with FSH is better than 24-h incubation in terms of the fertilization rate and blastocyst development. Immature oocyte retrieval followed by in-vitro maturation (IVM) is a feasible alternative to IVF. However, the implantation rate of IVM remains lower than that of traditional IVF. The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether a lower concentration of FSH or 2-h incubation with FSH would improve the outcome of IVM. The Immature oocytes were obtained from mice, and were allocated to four groups and incubated in the maturation media for 24 h. The maturation media were supplemented with 10 mIU/ml FSH for 24 h (group 1), 10 mIU/ml FSH for 2 h (group 2), 75 mIU/ml FSH for 24 h (group 3) or 75 mIU/ml FSH for 2 h (group 4). In each group, half of the in-vitro-matured oocytes were fertilized and cultured to blastocysts and the remaining matured oocytes were analysed for growth differentiation factor (GDF)-9 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-15 mRNA to assess the oocyte quality.

The fertilization and blastocyst rates were higher in groups 2 and 4 than in groups 1 and 3. We conclude that 2-h incubation with FSH is better than 24-h incubation in terms of the fertilization rate and blastocyst development. © 2010, Reproductive Healthcare Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

80051635146	P16 methylation is an early event in cervical carcinogenesis	Background: Aberrant gene promoter methylation is a critical event in tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the promoter hypermethylation of p16 and DAPK1 during the progression of cervical precancerous lesions. Methods: A series of 98 cervical neoplasms (72 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 26 cervical carcinomas) were evaluated. The promoter methylation status of p16 and DAPK1 was assessed from cervical scrapings by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Results: For p16, the frequency of promoter hypermethylation showed an increasing trend from normal to dysplastic to invasive squamous cancer specimens, and this increase reached statistical significance (P < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in the promoter methylation state of DAPK1 with regard to the various grades of cervical lesions (P = 0.077). Specifically, methylation of p16 was a frequent event in the cervical carcinoma samples, and these figures were statistically significant compared with the normal and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I cases (P = 0.015 and P = 0.021, respectively). Conclusions: These results imply that promoter hypermethylation of p16 occurs at an early stage of cervical neoplastic progression. This early event may play an initiating role in the malignant transformation of low-grade dysplasia into high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. We suggest that aberrant promoter methylation of p16 may serve as a useful biomarker during the follow-up of low-grade dysplasia. Copyright © 2011 by IGCS and ESGO.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study included nine patients with a history of > 3 years of unexplained infertility who had extensive uterine adenomyosis. These nine couples were diagnosed with unexplained infertility after excluding other possible causes, such as the male factor, ovulation disorders, structural abnormality, and infections. All were essentially normal except for presumed uterine adenomyosis and elevated serum levels of CA125. All underwent a careful excision of the adenomyosis tissue using a microsurgical technique, and then a six-month course of GnRH agonist therapy. The outcome evaluations included serum level of CA125, degree of dysmenorrhea, and rate of spontaneous pregnancy. Results: Postoperative follow-up showed that the severity of dysmenorrhea was significantly improved. The improvement scale was positively correlated with a decline in the serum level of CA125. A postoperative serum CA125 decreased to less than 10.00. IU/mL predicted well the spontaneous pregnancy rate, especially during the therapy. In the end, only two women became pregnant and finally delivered viable babies in this study. Conclusions: Although the combination of careful conservative surgery and GnRH agonist therapy might provide some benefits in patients with unexplained infertility and presumed severe adenomyosis, two-thirds of the patients still failed to become pregnant. The postoperative serum level of CA125 could predict the future pregnancy rate. © 2012 .

84864288506	Human papillomavirus genotyping as a predictor of high-grade cervical dysplasia in women with mildly cytologic abnormalities: A two-year follow-up report	High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA testing has emerged as another testing modality for women with mildly cytologic abnormalities. We conducted a two-year follow-up study of 108 women with mildly abnormal cervical cytology for detection of CIN 2/3. A cervical swab sample was obtained for HPV genotyping by a HPV blot and histologic follow-up results were correlated with HR-HPV types. Of the 108 cases, 93 (86.1%) were positive for HR-HPV DNA. HPV-16 was detected in 45.1% of patients. CIN grade 2 or 3 was confirmed in 25 (23.1%) of the 108 women during the two-year follow-up period. The two-year cumulative incidence rates of CIN 2/3 were 38.6% (17/44) among HPV-16- positive women, but only 5.6% among HR-HPV-positive women without HPV-16 or HPV-18. The sensitivity of a positive HPV-16 test for CIN 2/3 was 68.0%, the specificity was 67.5%. Our results demonstrated that the type-specific HPV-16 test increased sensitivity of detecting high-grade cervical dysplasia for women who have mildly cytologic abnormalities. The implication of the present findings is that HPV genotyping may identify women with the greatest risk of high-grade CIN. Copyright © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

0036903220	Comparative study of vaginal, laparoscopically assisted vaginal and abdominal hysterectomies for uterine myoma larger than 6 cm in diameter or uterus weighing at least 450 g: A prospective randomized study	Background. The purpose of this study was to compare peri-operative morbidity, preoperative sonographic estimation of uterine weight and postoperative outcomes of women with uterine fibroids larger than 6 cm in diameter or uteri estimated to weigh at least 450 g, undergoing either vaginal, laparoscopically assisted vaginal or abdominal hysterectomies. Method. Ninety patients who met the criteria of uterine fibroids larger than 6 cm by ultrasonographic examination were included in our prospective study. Patients were randomized into laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (30 patients), vaginal hysterectomy (30 patients) and abdominal hysterectomy (30 patients) groups. Results. The laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy group had significantly longer operative times than the abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy groups (109 ± 22 min, 98 ± 16 min, and 74 ± 22 min, respectively, p < 0.001). Blood loss for vaginal hysterectomy was significantly lower than for either abdominal or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomies (215 ± 134 ml, 293 ± 182 ml, and 343 ± 218 ml, respectively, p = 0.04). Vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy groups had shorter hospital stays, lower postoperative pain scores, more rapid bowel recovery and lower postoperative antibiotic use than the abdominal hysterectomy group. Uterine weight in the abdominal hysterectomy group was significantly heavier than in the vaginal and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy groups (1020 ± 383 g, 835 ± 330 g, and 748 ± 255 g, , respectively, p = 0.02). We estimated that when a myoma measured between 8 and 10 cm, the uterus weighed approximately 450 g, and the sensitivity of this prediction was 57.5%. For a myoma larger than 13 cm, the estimated uterine weight was more than 900 g and the sensitivity of this prediction was 71%. Conclusion. The study shows vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy can be performed in women with uterine weight of at least 450 g. Preoperative ultrasonographic examination can provide the surgeon with valuable information on the size of the fibroid and the estimated weight of the enlarged uterus before implementing a suitable surgical method.

Increased human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration during the first trimester is the most likely cause of NVP. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hCG on gastrointestinal transit and plasma concentrations of cholecystokinin (CCK) in ovariectomized (Ovx) rats. I.p. injection of hCG was used to evaluate the dose effect of hCG on gastrointestinal transit in Ovx rats. The CCK antagonist lorglumide was used to clarify the role of CCK in regulating gastrointestinal transit. Gastrointestinal transit was assessed 15 min after intragastric gavage of a mixture of 10% charcoal and Na

84878536642	Clinical outcome according to timing of cabergoline initiation for prevention of OHSS: A randomized controlled trial	Cabergoline, a dopamine receptor-2 agonist, is suggested to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during ovarian stimulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different timing of cabergoline administration on clinical outcome among patients at risk of developing OHSS. Among infertile women undergoing IVF treatment at risk of developing OHSS, 206 were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, i.e. the study group (n = 100) receiving cabergoline beginning on the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) injection and the control group (n = 100) receiving cabergoline starting on the day of oocyte retrieval. Oocyte metaphase-II rate, fertilization rate, clinical outcome and incidence of severe OHSS were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in oocyte metaphase-II rate (0.86 ± 0.16 versus 0.85 ± 0.15) or fertilization rate (0.79 ± 0.22 versus 0.76 ± 0.20) or in the incidence of OHSS between two groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in implantation or clinical pregnancy rate between the two groups. Cabergoline can be administered as soon as HCG injection to prevent early OHSS, without adverse effects on oocyte maturation, fertilization rate and clinical outcome. Cabergoline, a dopamine receptor-2 agonist, is suggested to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during ovarian stimulation. Nevertheless, the most suitable timing of cabergoline administration has not yet been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different timing of cabergoline administration on final oocyte maturation, fertilization rate and clinical outcome among patients at risk of developing OHSS. Among infertile women undergoing IVF treatment at risk of developing OHSS, 206 were enrolled in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, i.e. the study group (n = 100) receiving cabergoline beginning on the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) injection and the control group (n = 100) receiving cabergoline starting on the day of oocyte retrieval. Oocyte metaphase II rate, fertilization rate, clinical outcome and incidence of severe OHSS were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in oocyte metaphase II rate (0.86 ± 0.16 versus 0.85 ± 0.15) or fertilization rate (0.79 ± 0.22 versus 0.76 ± 0.20) or in the incidence of OHSS (3/100 versus 1/100) between the control and study groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in implantation rate (36.6% versus 34.0%) or clinical pregnancy rate (54.0% versus 51.0%) between the two groups. Among women at high risk of OHSS, cabergoline can be administered as soon as the HCG injection to prevent early OHSS, without adverse effects on oocyte maturation, fertilization rate and clinical outcome. © 2013, Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

84880819102	Transvaginal sono-guided aspiration of gestational sac concurrent with a local methotrexate injection for the treatment of unruptured cesarean scar pregnancy	Purpose: Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) is one of the rarest forms of ectopic pregnancy. A delay in treatment can lead to massive bleeding, uterine rupture, and life-threatening maternal morbidity. We present a conservative method for the management of CSP at a single tertiary centre over a 6-year period. Methods: Eleven patients with unruptured CSPs who were treated by transvaginal aspiration of the gestational sac followed by a local methotrexate injection were evaluated. Results: Gestational age at diagnosis ranged from 5 + 2 weeks to 7 + 4 weeks. Seven of the patients had undergone two prior Caesarean sections (63.6 %). The levels of β-hCG at the time of diagnosis ranged from 1,290 to 81,586 mIu/ml. The mean time of the procedure was 8.2 ± 1.6 min. During follow up, 54.5 % of the patients may need an additional systemic MTX injection due to an elevation of β-hCG. Estimated blood loss of the procedure was <50 ml and no blood transfusion is needed. This method has a shorter operative time, less blood loss and no hospitalization is needed for CSPs. All patients had their uterus successfully preserved without maternal morbidity or mortality. Conclusions: Transvaginal sono-guided sac aspiration concurrent with a local MTX injection is an effective management option for preserving the fertility of women with an unruptured CSP. However, additional systemic MTX injection may be needed if β-hCG levels >20,000 mIU/ml at diagnosis. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84884596609	Following the 2009 American Institute of Medicine recommendations fornormal body mass index and overweight women led to an increased riskof fetal macrosomia among Taiwanese women	Objective: This study aimed to investigate the risk of birth weights over 4000g (macrosomia) in association with following the 2009 American Institute of Medicine (AIOM) recommendations. Materials and Methods: Seventy-six nondiabetic women who delivered a singleton, term macrosomic fetus and 82 women who delivered a singleton, term fetus weighing <4000g were analyzed retrospectively. The relationship between the risk of macrosomia and gestational weight gain in different periods of pregnancy was investigated using logistic regression. Results: The incidence of macrosomia from January 2008 to December 2009 was 1.8% among the Taiwanese women. The incidences of cesarean delivery (54.5% vs. 18.2%, p<0.001) and blood loss >1000mL at delivery (35.5% vs. 6.1%, p<0.0001) were associated with macrosomia. The risk of macrosomia among normal weight women with gestational weight gain greater than 13kg increased four-fold [odds ratio (OR)=4.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-12.90]. For overweight women with total gestational weight gain >11.5kg, the risk of macrosomia increased nine-fold (OR=9.63; 95% CI 1.76-52.74). Conclusion: Macrosomia resulted in more cesarean deliveries and greater maternal blood loss at birth. In Taiwan, to prevent macrosomia, we suggest that the total gestational weight gain should be <11.5kg among normal weight women and within 10kg for overweight women. © 2013.

84886829849	Efficacy of hysteroscopic cervical resection for cervical stenosis	Study Objective: Cervical stenosis can be an impediment to embryo transfer (ET) and intrauterine insemination (IUI). We propose a technique of hysteroscopic cervical resection to overcome cervical stenosis. Design: Prospective clinical study (Canadian Task Force classification III). Setting: Private general hospital. Patients: Forty-three infertile women in whom trial ET or IUI had failed with 3 available catheters. Interventions: The procedure was performed with a hysteroscope under ultrasound guidance. Starting from the external os, the loop electrode gradually resected protrusions and cervical tissue until the hysteroscope could enter the uterine cavity. Repeat trial ET/IUI was performed 1 month later. The women who became pregnant underwent sonographic measurement of the cervical length and dilatation in the second and third trimesters. Measurements and Main Results: Excluding 13 patients in whom the sound could pass through the cervical canal after anesthesia, 30 patients were included for analysis. The procedure failed in 1 patient (3.3%). The mean operation time was 18.0 (±7.4) minutes. Repeat trial ET/IUI was successful in all patients. There were 5 twin pregnancies and 9 singleton pregnancies after IUI or ET. From the 5 women with twin pregnancies; 2 underwent premature delivery at 34 weeks; and 3 underwent elective cesarean delivery at 35, 36, and 37 weeks, respectively. From the 9 women with singleton pregnancies, 1 underwent cesarean section at 36 weeks because of preeclampsia, and the other 8 delivered at term. Conclusion: Hysteroscopic cervical resection is a safe and effective treatment for cervical stenosis. © 2013 AAGL.

To investigate the role of transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasonography combined with serum CA 125 level in diagnosing pelvic adhesions before scheduled laparoscopic surgery. Design. Prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-1). Setting. Tertiary care academic hospital. Patients. Fifty-nine women with an adnexal mass diagnosed by two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography. Intervention. Preoperative transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasonography and serum CA 125 level, followed by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Measurements and Main Results. Pelvic adhesions were correctly identified by transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasonography in 26 of 32 women in whom the lesions were confirmed at laparoscopy or laparotomy. Mean serum CA 125 level in women with adhesions was 70 ± 73.7 U/ml, which was significantly higher than that in women without adhesions (24 ± 16.16 U/ml, p = 0.004). The sensitivity of combined transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasonography and serum CA 125 level was 90%, specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100%, and negative predictive value was 89%. The two methods showed strong agreement with surgical results (κ = 0.889). Eight scheduled laparoscopies (13.6%) were converted to laparotomy due to severe adhesions. One patient (1.7%) experienced colon injury during laparoscopic adhesiolysis. Conclusion. Transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasonography combined with serum CA 125 level is sensitive in detecting pelvic adhesions before laparoscopic surgery. Patients with suspected severe pelvic adhesions should have preoperative bowel preparation to reduce the risk of intraoperative injury.

0142244721	Successful Laparoscopic Management of a Huge Ovarian Tumor in the 27th Week of Pregnancy: A Case Report	BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic surgery in the second trimester is very rare. The enlarging uterus impedes surgical procedures and increases the risk of surgery, We report on a woman in the 27th week of pregnancy who developed a huge ovarian tumor. CASE: A woman underwent laparoscopic surgery in the 27th week of gestation because of a rapid growing ovarian tumor. After aspiration of its contents, the tumor was extracted, and cystectomy was performed extracorporeally. The postoperative course was uneventful and the woman delivered a healthy infant at 42 weeks. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic gynecologic surgery can be performed through the 27th week of gestation, and extracorporeal manipulation makes the procedure much easier.

84892958633	Small trocar site hernia after laparoscopy	This review article is attempted to review the cases of 5-mm trocar site hernias (TSHs) after laparoscopic surgery and identify the risks associated with incarceration. We searched the English literature on the PubMed website using the key words "trocar site hernia" and "5 mm". We evaluated a total of 24 cases of 5-mm TSHs and analyzed and results showed that 17 (71%) and 7 (29%) resulted from gynecologic and gastrointestinal surgeries, respectively. The majority were found at the lateral abdomen (87.5%) and recognized within 2 weeks (87.5%). The most frequently herniated organ (n = 14) was the small bowel. Up to 62.5% of cases (n = 15) were repaired by exploratory laparotomy, and 25% (n = 6) required resection of herniated organs secondary to incarceration. The cases with incarceration were detected at 4.3 ± 2.2 days post-operation and those without incarceration at 47.4 days post-operation. No risk factors could beidentified to show a correlation between 5-mm TSHs and incarceration. We concluded that immediate 1--2-week postoperative care is of most importance, since the majority of 5-mm trocar site hernias with or without incarceration occurred within this period. © 2013.

84894663545	Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women-An unanswered issue	Menopause is a biological and natural process that occurs as part of aging in women and is secondary to ovarian failure with resultant estrogen deficiency; therefore, menopause should not be considered as a disease. However, there is no doubt that estrogen deficiency induces general psychological and physical changes, and that postmenopausal women will experience many health-related issues and problems, including osteoporotic fractures, coronary heart disease (CHD), and most importantly for the quality of life (QOL) and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) such as hot flashes and night sweats. Hormone therapy (HT) is very effective in the management of postmenopausal women with symptoms. With the large number of patients being treated with HT, especially the combination of estrogen and progestin therapy (EPT) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, clinicians now recognize the potential adverse effects of EPT. Although this concept is much clearer now, some women might still benefit from short-term HT, especially for young postmenopausal women. In this review, some health issues of postmenopausal women, especially alternative therapies are discussed. © 2012.

84895260233	The complications of laparoscopic hysterectomy, compared with vaginal and abdominal total hysterectomy	Hysterectomy is one of the most common major operations performed in the world. Since the first introduction of laparoscopic hysterectomy by Reich et al. in 1989, laparoscopic hysterectomy has become a well-known and common procedure worldwide. The incidence of hysterectomy for benign lesions with laparoscopy has been progressively increased in the recent years, and more than 45% of the procedures were performed via a laparoscopic route in several countries. There are major subdivisions of total hysterectomies that are performed by laparoscopy: laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), vaginally assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy (VALH) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). Patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) experienced faster bowel recovery, less postoperative pain and shorter hospitalization compared with patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. Nevertheless, LH still has associated morbidities. Complications from hysterectomy can be diagnosed intraoperatively or postoperatively. The rate of major complications has been reported to range from 0.5% to 1.7%. The most common intraoperative complications that occur at laparoscopic hysterectomy are injuries to the bladder, ureter, bowel and blood vessels. Postoperative complications such as urinary tract infection, colpotomy wound bleeding, pelvic cellulitis or pelvic abscess, and fever of unknown reason are common. Other factors associated with an increased risk of complications related to LH are increasing age, medical illness, obesity and malignancy. Appropriate training and experience is necessary for a physician to minimize intraoperative complications and safely perform a new surgical technique such as LH. Proper patient selection, knowledge of the pelvic anatomy and good surgical judgment are other keys to minimizing complications. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

84899117029	Comparison of Quinn's Advantage fertilization medium and tissue culture medium 199 for invitro maturation of oocytes	Objective: The purpose of the study was to compare the Quinn's Advantage fertilization medium (Q1) and the tissue culture medium 199 (TCM199) for invitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes and ammonium production during IVM. Materials and methods: The immature murine oocytes were randomly added into Q1 and TCM199. Ammonium concentrations were measured at the start and after 18hours of IVM, and the mature oocytes were fertilized and cultured into blastocysts. The blastocysts were then stained for inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm. Results: The maturation rate was higher in Q1 than in TCM199 (85.7% vs. 76.6%, p=0.024). The fertilization and blastocyst rates were slightly higher in Q1, but not significant. Differential staining of the blastocysts showed slightly higher ICM ratio in the blastocysts derived from Q1. Mean ammonium concentrations in Q1 and TCM199 at Time 0 were 184.9 and 339.2μg/dL, respectively (p=0.05), and after 18hours of IVM were 268.7 and 443.6μg/dL, respectively (p=0.045). Addition of ammonium chloride into Q1 adversely affects IVM. Conclusion: Q1 is superior to TCM199 in terms of oocyte maturation, which may be due to lower ammonium concentration. © 2014.

0347946711	Serum and adipocyte resistin in polycystic ovary syndrome with insulin resistance	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between resistin and insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: We compared serum resistin levels in 17 PCOS women and 10 lean, healthy, age-matched non-PCOS women and also compared levels of insulin receptor (IR), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-kinase), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein and resistin mRNA in adipocytes isolated from the omental adipose tissue of five of the PCOS patients and five age- and weight-matched, non-PCOS controls, to look for local defects in insulin action in PCOS. Results: The PCOS group was hyperinsulinaemic and displayed an impaired insulin response in a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and an abnormal homeostasis model insulin resistance index. Serum resistin levels were similar in PCOS patients and controls; however, resistin mRNA levels were 2-fold higher in adipocytes from PCOS patients. No correlation was found between serum resistin levels and either the BMI or testosterone levels. Western blot analysis showed that adipocyte levels of insulin receptor, PI3-kinase, and GLUT4 were respectively decreased by 56, 39.4 and 54% in PCOS patients compared with controls. Conclusions: These results suggest that overexpression of the resistin gene in adipocytes may be a local determinant factor in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

10644283079	Short-term postoperative GnRH analogue or danazol treatment after conservative surgery for stage III or IV endometriosis before ovarian stimulation: A prospective, randomized study	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of short-term use of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue for 3 months before ovarian stimulation in patients with stage III and IV endometriosis after conservative surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Eleven patients were randomly selected to receive intramuscular injections of GnRH analogue, leuprolide acetate (3.75 mg), every 28 days, or 400 mg danazol orally 2 times per day for 3 months before ovarian stimulation after conservative laparoscopic or laparotomy surgery for stage III and IV symptomatic endometriosis (group 1), as compared with 30 patients who had received no postoperative treatment with GnRH analogue or danazol but underwent ovarian stimulation immediately after the first menses within 3 months postoperatively (group 2). RESULTS: Although the number of oocytes retrieved and number of embryos per cycle were significantly higher in group 1, the pregnancy rate per cycle in group 1 was not significantly different from that in group 2 (18% vs. 20%). The cumulative pregnancy rate at 12 months was 54.5% and 56.7% in group 1 and group 2, respectively. With regard to recurrence of disease after 24 months of follow-up, group 2 had a statistically significantly higher recurrence rate (13.3%) than did group 1 (0%). CONCLUSION: Short-term use of GnRH analogue before ovarian stimulation in women with stage III or IV endometriosis confers no definite benefits on pregnancy rates per cycle when compared with patients who received ovarian stimulation within 3 months after conservative surgery.

0742323674	Prenatal three-dimensional ultrasound diagnosis of a camptomelic dysplasia	We describe a case of camptomelic dysplasia identified prenatally with the assistance of three-dimensional ultrasonography. The typical skeletal dysplasia of camptomelic dysplasia - including anterior bowing of the tibia, with skin dimpling over a convex surface at the point of maximal deformity, and talipes equinovarus was successfully identified using the techniques of surface-rendering, multiplanar displays and rotated volume data. Three-dimensional ultrasonography allows the diagnosis of camptomelic dysplasia, which has a poor prognosis as it is accompanied by respiratory insufficiency and spinal deformities, to be made without delay and provides information supplementary to that provided by two-dimensional ultrasound for early diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia.

10344263401	Subsequent pregnancy outcome after conservative treatment of a previous cesarean scar pregnancy	Background. To assess pregnancy course and outcome after conservative treatment of a cesarean scar pregnancy. Methods. During an 8-year period, 15 cases of cesarean scar pregnancies were diagnosed at our institution. Seven of the 14 patients for whom we successfully preserved the uterus; became pregnant within 3 years after termination of the scar pregnancy. The year of diagnosis, conservative method and gestational age for these five patients were recorded. Delivery method, time interval between the scar pregnancy and subsequent pregnancy, and maternal and neonatal outcome were evaluated. Results. Seven pregnancies (eight live and one dead baby) were noted. The mean interval between the ectopic pregnancy and subsequent pregnancy was 13.3 months (range 0-34 months). One patient, who became pregnant 3 months after the scar pregnancy was found, suffered uterine rupture at 38.3 weeks' gestational age. Two patients with placental accrete, and one of them who continued the existing intrauterine twin pregnancy after transvaginal sono-guided aspiration of the scar pregnancy received a cesarean hysterectomy at 32 weeks of gestation. The remaining four pregnancies were uneventful, followed by early cesarean sections at 36 weeks. Conclusion. The results of this first series of seven subsequent pregnancies after conservative treatment of scar pregnancies are promising. An early cesarean section before over-extension of the uterus and spontaneous labor can help to prevent uterine rupture. Placenta accrete is another severe morbidity of these patients in addition to uterine rupture. Thus a cesarean hysterectomy may be the choice of treatment.

Methods: Sixty women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who underwent 68 IVM cycles were randomized by computer-generated numbers to receive FSH stimulation or not. Thirty-five cycles were pretreated with 75 IU rFSH for 6 days, and 33 cycles were not. Every cycle was given hCG 10 000 IU 36 h before oocyte retrieval. Immature oocytes were matured in vitro and fertilized by ICSI, and the resulting embryos were replaced on day 2 or 3. Results: A total of 1528 immature oocytes were recovered. The overall maturation and fertilization rates were 74.2 and 72.8% respectively. After embryo transfer, 23 pregnancies resulted (33.8%). The oocyte numbers and endometrial thickness were similar between FSH-primed and non-FSH-primed groups. Serum estradiol level on the day of hCG injection was significantly higher in the FSH-primed group than in the non-FSH-primed group (377.2 pmol/l versus 143.8 pmol/l, P = 0.001). The maturation rate, fertilization rate and pregnancy rate were 76.5, 75.8 and 31.4% respectively for FSH-primed group, and 71.9, 69.5 and 36.4% respectively for non-FSH-primed group (all not significant). Conclusions: IVM is a feasible treatment for women with PCOS. FSH priming has no additional beneficial effect on IVM.

11844302893	Resistin mRNA levels are downregulated by estrogen in vivo and in vitro	Resistin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, is suggested to be an important link between obesity and diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulatory effect of estrogen on adipocyte resistin gene expression in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and in isolated rat adipocytes in vitro. Subcutaneous injection of estradiol benzoate reduced resistin mRNA levels in adipocytes isolated from the inguinal, parametrial, perirenal, retroperitoneal, or periovarian fat deposits of OVX rats, while an in vitro study showed that estradiol treatment decreased resistin mRNA levels in cultured rat periovarian fat adipocytes. Results of Western blotting analysis also showed that estrogen decreased adipose resistin contents in vivo and in vitro. These data suggest that estrogen is a pivotal negative regulator of resistin gene expression. © 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
