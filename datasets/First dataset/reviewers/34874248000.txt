84877147688	Influence of sampling frequency and time on pressure fluctuation characteristics of axial-flow pump	In order to precisely analyze the pressure fluctuation in axial-flow pumps, the unsteady flow in such a pump was calculated based on the time-averaged N-S equations, the standard k-ε turbulence model and SIMPLEC algorithm with a structured mesh under a specific tip gap, then the pressure signals monitored were sampled with different sampling frequencies and times to show their effects on the pressure fluctuation characteristic. The results show that the point at f=0 stands for the average static pressure physically if the pressure was used as the Y-axis of FFT in a frequent domain diagram. Besides, the sampling frequency and time exhibit a significant effect on the pressure fluctuation feature and a too small sampling frequency is responsible for the aliasing phenomenon in time- and frequency-domain. It was derived that a spectral leakage at the basic frequency doesn't occur when the sampling frequency is an integer multiple of the product of the time for impeller rotating one revolution and the number of blades. Furthermore, a general equation for determining sampling time was established for the pressure fluctuation signals obtained in an axial-flow pump by numerical computation. According to that equation, sampling time is dependent on pump rotational speed. Obviously, such a finding forms the base for processing of pressure fluctuation signal obtained in CFD simulations in an axial-flow pump.

84897883048	Unbalance response characteristics of rotor system in high pressure multi-stage pump	In order to solve the rotating unbalance problem of the rotor in a high pressure multistage centrifugal pump, the modals of its rotor system supported by two water lubricated bearings were calculated by using FEM method, the mass unbalance location and distribution on the rotor were analyzed and optimized. The results show that this rotor system is rigid based on the 1st critical speed predicted. Under the design rotating speed, when a rotating unbalance is applied on the rotor at different positions, the vibration amplitude of the bearing in the suction chamber side exhibits substantial changes, indicating that bearing is very sensitive to unbalance; the vibration amplitude of the bearing in the discharge chamber side, however, has a little change and is insensitive to unbalance. Importantly, the residual unbalance mass distributed in the first three stages has a greater effect on shafting unbalance response. The case with smaller vibration amplitude in the two bearings has been secured by changing balance quality grades of the impellers and balance disk. When the balance quality grade of the first two-stage impellers is G2.5, but the grade of the rest impellers and the balance disk is G6.3, the bearing in the suction chamber side shows a significantly reduced vibration amplitude and the bearing in the discharge chamber side still keeps an acceptable small vibration amplitude. Under the other rotating speeds, the bearing in the suction chamber side can be even more sensitive to an unbalance mass than that in the discharge chamber side, thus it is suggested that the former should use a material with better wear-resistant property. These results can provide a theoretical basis and reference for stable operation of rotor system in high-pressure multistage centrifugal pumps.

The structure of a tip leakage vortex cavitation flow field was discussed and the evolution of cavitation bubble cloud was revealed at different cavitation conditions. Investigation results show that the modified numerical method in this paper could simulate the tip leakage vortex cavitation in the tip region of the impeller. The cavitation inception in an axial flow pump occurs in the tip clearance and leakage vortex regions. With cavitation number σ decreasing, the cavitation region is expanded to the rolling-up zone of the tip leakage flow. At a small cavitation number σ condition, the bubble cloud occurs in the suction sides of blades at the axial direction, which could induce flow instability and cavitation noise.

Numerical results show that the unsteady prediction results are more accurate than the steady results, and the maximal error of unsteady prediction is only 4.54%. The time-domain spectrums show that the static pressure fluctuation curves at the inlet and outlet of the rotor and the outlet of the stator are periodic, and all have four peaks and four valleys.

The flow characteristics of the high efficiency axial-flow pump have been simulated by RNG k -ε turbulence model and SIMPLEC arithmetic based on FLUENT software. Numerical results indicate that the data from the prediction show agreement with the experimental results, static pressure on pressure side of blades increases slightly at circumferential direction with radius increasing, and keep almost constant at the same radial while increasing gradually from inlet to exit on the suction side along flow direction at design conditions. The static pressure, total pressure and velocity at inlet, impeller outlet and vane outlet were measured by a five-hole probe, and a contrastive experiment was done to investigate the influence of hub leakage. The experimental results show that inlet flow is almost axial and the prerotation is very small at various conditions. The meridional velocity and circulation distribution are almost identical at impeller outlet at design conditions due to steady flow and high efficiency. The residual circulation exits at downstream of the guide vane, and the circumferential velocity component increases linearly from hub to tip at small flow rate conditions. Hub leakage in adjustable blades results in the decrease of the meridional velocity and circulation at blade exit near hub.

So the unsteady flow field of a two-stage deep well pump was simulated with FLUENT code based on sliding mesh and the RNG k-ε turbulence model, to investigate the pressure fluctuation by interactions between the impeller and guide vane. The computing domain extends from the inlet of the first stage deep well pump to the outlet of the second stage guide vane.

In this paper, the pressure fluctuation differences between the first stage and secondary are also compared. The numerical results show that the pressure fluctuates at the blade passage frequency, and the maximum amplitude of blade passage frequency occurs in the region from the rotor to the stator when the impeller blade gets close to the guide vane trailing edge, but it decreases rapidly after fluid entering the guide vane. Compared with the steady simulation, the averaged calculated single-stage head of unsteady simulation is more accord with the reality, which is less than the tested head with a relative deviation of 5%.

84863253364	Numerical simulation of water-air interface tracking in hydrodynamic coupling	The movement of fluid in a part-filled hydrodynamic coupling belongs to two-phase flow in centrifugal field, and the distributional pattern of liquid phase directly influences the output characteristic of turbine wheel. In order to acquaint the liquid distribution law, the movement of working medium is regarded as separated layer flow in a hydrodynamic coupling, and water-air interfaces of a standard peach shaped chamber coupling with effective diameter 562 mm in different working conditions are investigated by solving the volume of fluid(VOF) two-phase model. The periodic 3D flow channel model is built, the realizable k-ε turbulence model and PISO algorithm are employed in the numerical model, and the interior face is used to simulate the interaction between the pump wheel and turbine wheel. Water distribution on pump wheel blade is very similar to test result in the literature. The simulation results show that with the increasing of slip between pump wheel and turbine wheel, the incline of water-air interface becomes rapid and large circulation forms at last, and the distributing area of liquid on the pressure side of pump wheel blade increases while that on the suction side decreases. The results also show that low retainer has smaller influence on the circulation pattern than high one which seriously blocks the flow and stops the large circulation. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84865371345	Implementation on numerical algorithm for centrifugal pump rotor-stator flow coupling	To solve the problem of rotor-stator flow coupling, the FVM was adopted to discretize the incompressible rotating flow equations. The time and spatial discretization schemes of the convective, diffusive, and the source term of the equations were investigated. For the rotor, the non-inertial reference frame was adopted to solve the relative flow equations, and for the stator, the inertial reference frame was adopted to solve the absolute flow equations. To keep flux conservation, the Neuman condition was prescribed on the rotor-stator interface. To realize the rotor-stator flow coupling, the relative velocity at rotor outlet was transformed to the absolute velocity, which used as the stator inlet condition. Then a switch mode was adopted to run the algorithm. To validate this algorithm, the flow coupling between the ERCOFTAC centrifugal impeller and the diffuser was conducted, and the steady and unsteady results were obtained and compared with the literature. And good consistency was observed by comparison. It shows that the algorithm is capable of forcasting the rotor-stator flow coupling. The algorithm can be used to forecast and investigate the centrifugal pump flows.

84866061732	Fiber orientation and rheology behavior of the laminar suspension flow through a 2-D curved expansion duct	By coupling the fiber extra stress into the laminar Newtonian flow equations, the fiber orientation and the fiber suspension rheology in a 2D curved expansion duct is numerically investigated. The orientation distribution probability function is numerically solved to obtain the bulk orientation distributions and the extra stress distributions. The results show that the overall distribution of the flow field parameters, such as velocity, pressure have not been significantly affected in the most regions of the duct. But for the shear stress and normal stress difference, the non-equilibrium is significant. In the inlet region, the fibers rotate frequently due to the nonuniform flow shear effects, the orientation becomes more random and are less aligned with the local streamlines. But in the downstream region, with flow shear becomes uniform, the non-equilibrium is less obvious. In addition, with the fiber extra viscosity increasing, the shear stress and normal stress difference increase correspondingly.

84867922379	Property of unsteady pressure and meridional velocity in wake region of axial-flow pump impeller	In order to study the rotor-stator interaction in the wake region of the axial-flow impeller, the axial-flow pump model for South-to-North Water Diversion Project model was simulated based RNG k-ε turbulence model and the SIMPLE algorithm. The calculated values by steady simulation were compared with the experimental results to verify the computational grid and the applicability of turbulence model, and the unsteady field was simulated based on the steady results. The numerical results show that the relative error of Head is 4.56% and efficiency is 2.78% in optimal condition compared with the experimental data. In small flow rata condition, three peaks and three second peaks occur on the meridional velocity at axial flow impeller outlet in the circumferential direction. As the flow rate increases, the number of the velocity peak at impeller outlet is same to the guide-vane blade number. In the small flow rate and design conditions, the single-cycle time-domain of the pressure fluctuation in the impeller wake region appears three peaks and the additional three secondary peaks when flow rate increases. The main frequency of pressure fluctuation in different flow conditions is mainly blade frequency, and the other harmonic frequencies are the times of the fundamental blade frequency. The amplitude of pressure fluctuation frequency increases rapidly as the flow rate decreases.

84869098429	Numerical simulation of solid-liquid two-phase turbulent flow in submersible axial-flow pump	The solid-liquid two-phase turbulent flow in a submersible axial-flow pump was simulated by using a software-Fluent with the mixture multiphase flow model, RNG k-ε turbulence model and SIMPLEC algorithm to study the characteristics of such a flow. The results of two-phase flow have been compared with those of water flow. The flow patterns at several volume fractions, particle diameters and solid densities were revealed. It is concluded that solid particles mainly accumulate near the leading edge of pressure surface of blades but close to the hub in the flow channels of impeller. Solid particles tend to move to the suction side of blades as their diameter is increased at the same volume fraction. For the particles with the same diameter, as the solid volume fraction is increased, the solid particles on the pressure side tend to move to the blade leading edge and the hub, and those on the suction side tend to move to the outlet of impeller and the hub.

Miniature five-hole spherical probe was used to measure circulation and meridional velocity of South-to-North Water Diversion Project axial flow pump model (TJ04-ZL-06) in the blade outlet at the optimal condition. The experimental results show that the nonlinear circulation distribution appears in the axial flow impeller outlet. The circulation curve is relatively flat in the central of blade, while it reduces to about 0.8 times near hub and increases to about 1.2 times near tip. The meridional velocity distribution shows parabolic flow pattern and the maximum velocity appears in the middle of blade. The meridional velocity in blade outlet was calculated based on nonlinear circulation mathematical model. The results show that the calculated values show agreement with the experimental results, and the calculation errors of different radius points are less than 5%.

84874035406	Numerical simulation of tip clearance leakage vortex flow characteristic in axial flow pump	Tip Leakage Vortex (TLV) in axial flow pump is mainly cased by the leakage flow entraining with the main stream of the blade suction side, which could interfere with the main flow field of the whole passage and the performance of pump. The low pressure area of vortex nuclear also cause the cavitation, which often induce the noise, vibration and cavitation erosion on the end wall of the impeller. The steady turbulent flow fields of the tip clearance region at different conditions with different blade tip clearance sizes (0.15 mm, 0.50 mm, 1.50 mm and 3.00mm) were simulated based on the ANSYS CFX software. The application of the different turbulent models were compared and analyzed in the whole passage flow simulation and choose a turbulent model which can adapt the tip leakage vortex flow in the axial flow pump. Furthermore, the flow fields under different tip clearance sizes were simulated, the relationship of the flow field structure and size of the tip clearance was analyzed. The numerical results show that: The SST k-ω turbulent model can predict the energy characteristics of the model pump accurately, adapt the shear flow of the adverse pressure gradient and predict the tip leakage flow very well; With the increase of the mass flow, the start position of the tip leakage vortex cores remove from near the leading edge to the trailing edge along the shroud of the blade, and the strength of the vortex cores decreased; The energy characteristic decrease with the increase of the tip clearance; The positive-slope point arrive earlier when the tip above the 1.5mm; With the increase of the tip clearance, the start position of the tip leakage vortex cores remove from near the leading edge to the trailing edge along the shroud of the blade, the pressure of the vortex cores decrease, the strength of the vortex entrainment is bigger; The leakage vortex within the tip clearance of the axial flow pump enhances as the blade tip clearance size is more than 0.50 mm, and the vortex and pump performance all decline significantly in the small flow rate conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

The results revealed that the fluid field of inlet sump without impeller almost had no change in different flows. The situation in the one with impeller was complicated. The inlet recirculation effect of impeller in part-load had a main influence on the outlet of inlet sump which grew with decreased flow.

84877661543	Effect of tip clearance on the cavitation and flow field of axial flow pumps	To carry out the adaptability study of cavitation calculation for the model pump under three typical flow conditions, the development characteristics of cavitation of impeller area was explored, and the axial flow pump cavitation characteristics under different tip clearance δ (0.50, 1.50 and 3.00 mm) were comparative analyzed. The effects on cavitation characteristics and flow field of axial flow pump for the value of tip clearance were compared through making the numerical analysis and experimental study of full passage using scaling the model pump of south-to-north water transfer project for equal ration. The results show that the cavitation occurs at the blade inlet edge close to the tip clearance firstly with the reduction of cavitation number σ, and expands gradually to the outlet edge of blade, meanwhile to the suction surface of blade along radial direction and eventually occupies the entire suction surface of blade, causing the axial velocities of blade outlet edge close to 10% area of tip clearance decrease gradually. The critical cavitation number of model pump increases with the increase of tip clearance. The cavitation damage of cylindrical section of blade rim becomes serious gradually and moves from the front to the tail of blade with the increase of tip clearance, and the low velocity areas of axial velocity for blade outlet are mainly concentrated in the region of blade near 10% clearance. This process reveals the interior cavitation characteristics of axial flow pump with different tip clearance.

After steady analysis of the flow field and comparing the axial speed distributions at the impeller inlet, the results show that axial velocity distribution at the inlet has obvious velocity differences in bend plane with bend inlet, but the performances of pumps with straight-pipe inlet and bend are basically identical, corresponding with test results. the unsteady simulations under designed flow-rate show that the impeller with straight pipe inlet almost has no steady radial force, while the impeller with bend inlet has an obvious increase of steady radial force, especially the unsteady radial force at blade pass-frequency, but the unsteady radial force caused by activity and inertia interference remains basically the same. These analyses can be referential for fixed-flow and structure design with bend inlet.

84881402143	Investigations of unsteady flow field characters in axial flow pump based on numerical simulation	Investigations of the unsteady flow field characters in a axial-flow pump at different conditions are presented in the paper. The numerical simulation of the unsteady flow field is performed with FLUENT codes based on RNG k-ε model and SIMPLEC arithmetic. Numerical results show that the strong-coupling evolutions of static pressure and axial velocity distribution between rotor and stator in multi-conditions are periodic with the rotation of rotor. The interaction of stationary and rotating pressure field leads to periodic flow field distortions and induces pressure fluctuation. It is found that the maximum pressure amplitude of blade passing frequency occurs in the rotor inlet zone, but it deceases very fast backward to the stator. The dominant frequency at monitoring points located at rotor inlet, outlet and stator outlet, corresponds to the blade passage frequency. The axial velocity distortion resulting from the modulation of the interacting stationary and rotating flow field is affected by the blade numbers and thickness of both rotor and stator. The axial velocity has different distributions at different conditions, and the phase of it changes cyclically. However, the axial velocity distribution at stator outlet is also mainly affected by the stator blade numbers, but its phase does not change cyclically. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.

84881003271	Application and experiment of different turbulence models for simulating tip leakage vortex in axial flow pump	In order to explore a turbulence model to simulate the structure and the kinetic characteristic of the tip leakage vortex suitably, the study was conducted based on the ANSYS CFX soft and high-speed imaging experiment. The topology structure of the simulation domain was optimized with 20 layers in a blade tip region that got more flow information in the tip area. As a result, simulation requirements are met, while reducing the calculation time. The flow field characteristic, especially the tip leakage vortex simulated by four kinds of turbulence models, which are standard k-ε, renormalization group k-ε, standard k-ω, and shear stress transport k-ω, was compared and analyzed. The simulation and the experiment results showed that the external characteristic curve predicted basing on the SST k-ω model is in substantial agreement with the experiment curve, and the deviation of the head is about 4.7% in the operating condition, which is better than the others; Head error based on standard k-ω model had a little less than others. The distribution law of the streamlines of the tip leakage vortex predicted basing on the four models was similar, as well as the pressure field and the axial velocity in the blade tip area. However, the length of the low-pressure area computed by RNG k-ε was longer than other 3 models. The counter velocity narrow region based on the RNG k-ε and SST k-ω was bigger than others, and the vortex entrainment was stronger too. The identification of the vortex core based on vortex intensity was established and compared with the results by the high-speed imaging. The motion trajectory of the tip leakage vortex based on different turbulence was different. It moves up when simulated in a big working operation. The motion trajectory of the tip leakage vortex based on SST k-ω is in substantial agreement with the experiment by comprehensive comparison. Via the above study, the adaptability of the SST k-ω model in the tip leakage vortex simulation was determined to be the best turbulence model among these four turbulence models, so the SST k-ω model is recommended when studying the tip leakage vortex in axial flow pumps.

Inner velocity flow, pressure and circulation of high speed submersible mixer were analyzed. The numerical simulation results show that the gradient of velocity and pressure is significant from blade working face to back in impeller. The fluid velocity near blade working face is low with high pressure. There are high velocity and negative pressure zones near suction side. The axial velocity shows a parabolic distribution at impeller inlet and outlet with gentle change of velocity circulation. The axial velocity is approximately uniform at blade outlet with linear distribution of velocity circulation at blade inlet and outlet. The inner flow in impeller is stable to ensure decreased inverse flow with high operating efficiency of impeller.

By comparing the calculation results with experimental results, the influence of clearance of wear-rings on the external characteristic and internal flow field was analyzed. The results of the nume-rical simulation shows that the head and efficiency of the pump decrease as the size of clearance increases. Especially, when the size of clearance reaches 0.7 mm, the decreasing becomes very obvious yet the pump power almost remains constant; when the size of the clearance reaches 1.00 mm, the efficiency decreases from the highest point of 77.2% to 68.7%, and the head of pump decreases by about 3.5 m; when the size of clearance is 0.2 mm, reverse-flow will appear in the front shroud cavity of the first stage impeller and second stage impeller and in the area between the impeller outlet and the front shroud, which has a small influence on the flow of the impeller inlet and flow field, because there is little leakage flow; reverse-flow gradually disappears when the size of clearance increases to 0.5 mm, but more leakage flow could impact on the impeller inlet, which results in the area of passage of impeller inlet decreasing, and thus seriously affecting the hydraulic performance of the pump.

The results show that the predicted results have a good agreement with the experimental data. The result of the numerical simulation shows that the head and efficiency of pump decrease with the size of clearance increasing. Especially when the size of clearance is larger than 0.7 mm, the decreasing becomes more obvious. The leakage calculated through numerical simulation were compared with the values obtained according to empirical formula and the results indicates internal clearance leakage at design point is close to the value calculated through empirical formula in smaller wear-ring clearance, but the simulated values of leakage have a small gap with calculated value obtained from empirical formula. Simultaneously, the Second stage leakage decrease significantly compared to the first stage leakage with the flow rate increasing, while the values got by the empirical formula have a small gap with simulated values obtained. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84889239971	Effects of number of blades on cavitation of high specific speed axial flow pump	Based on turbulence model of shear stress transport (SST) k-ω, homogeneous multiphase model, and Zwart cavitation model, numerical simulations for high specific speed axial flow pumps with three difference blade number impellers were conducted. External characteristic curves and head performances of cavitation were obtained. Through the analysis, critical NPSHc of three impellers, whose blade number were 3, 4, 5, was respectively 6.19 m, 5.122 m and 4.765 m. In severe cavitation area, the more blades the impeller had, the faster head declined with NPSH reducing. Aiming at the two cavitation type in axial flow pump: fixed cavitation on suction side and vortex cavitation in tip region, the cavitating distribution rule in different NPSH value was found. Compared among three impellers, in the same NPSH, the five blades impeller got smaller cavitating distribution on suction side, which meant lower cavitation degree. However, this impeller would get a sharp head decline when it came to severe cavitation area. Low pressure zone caused by tip leakage vortex moved and expanded to upstream with the decreasing number of impeller blades. Moreover, cavitating volume in the impeller with smaller blade number was larger than the others, and it indicated that this impeller's cavitation degree was severer than others. So the effect of blades number on different cavitation types and different NPSH was not the same.

84889255088	Characteristics of tip leakage vortex cavitation in axial flow pump at small flow rate condition	The strong tip leakage vortex (TLV) in an axial flow pump at small flow rate condition will generate a cavitation vortex that would cause flow instability. In order to investigate tip leakage vortex (TLV) cavitation in axial flow pump in small flow rate, TJ04-ZL-02 hydraulic axial flow pump model was investigated based on the modified cavitation model and SST k-ω turbulence model. Numerical results showed that the separation vortex cavitation within the tip gap occurs around the blade pressure side corner, which was made up of a cavitation inception together with a tip leakage vortex cavitation. The gap region cavitation changes with the different blade chord ratio sections when the cavitation number is constant. With the increasing of the blade chord ratio, TLV cavitation region and bubble volume fraction increase gradually. With the decreasing of cavitation number, bubbles occur in the TLV entrainment region that emerged with the TLV cavitation vortex, and merged into bubble clouds. At small flow rate condition, owing to the large pressure difference between pressure side and suction side at the tip, the axial velocity of flow in the gap is negative, and the absolute value of axial velocity increases gradually from the pressure side to the suction side. High-speed photography experimental results show that as the cavitation number decreases gradually, leakage vortex cavitation initiates in the tip clearance at small flow rate condition, and then cavitation deteriorates severely and the bubble cloud breaks up in the trailing region of the blade, and gathers in the tip region and immensely occupies the blade passage region. While the cavitation number σ reaches 0.187~0.232, the suction side of blade is covered by bubbles, and bubbles separation and blasting occur due to the volume fraction increasing of the bubble cloud. The results from this study provide theoretical and experimental references to TLV cavitation in an axial pump.

The damage degree of large lump under the action of static pressure, pure impacting and the combination of pressure and impacting, and the damage difference between flat head rod and conical rod were compared. The simulation results indicate that the flat head rod cannot break the large lump effectively with pressure of 30 MPa, velocity of 15 m/s and the combination action of them. The damage range of large lump is throughout the body under a 200 m/s flat head rod, but the achievement of super-high velocity is difficult. A cone damage zone is formed under a conical rod with 30 MPa pressure and 15 m/s velocity, and the damage range is larger than a common hydraulic hammer with the same rod diameter. Cone rod with high pressure and high velocity can destruct the large lump coal within fewer times, and it is verified that the low frequency and heavy load scheme of breaking large lump coal is feasible.

The flow field prediction was based on the Reynolds-averaged N-S equations and the RNG two equation k-ε turbulence model; the structure response was handled by the elastic structural dynamic equations. Not only the deformation and stress distribution characteristics caused from fluid-structure interaction were identified, but also the influence of the interaction on the head and efficiency of the pump was analyzed. The results indicated that the maximum displacement occurs on the blade leading edge at impeller tip, but a smaller displacement appears on the blade trailing edge and in the blade root. A significant stress concentration occurs in the inlet side and the contact area of the blade root and the hub. All the stress level and deformation in the blades reduce steadily with increasing flow rate. The head and efficiency predicted by fluid-structure interaction model are lowered compared with those by the rigid structure model.However, this reduction in stress and deformation is very small.

Pressure fluctuations at four places including impeller inlet, impeller outlet, middle and outlet of guide vane were recorded during the unsteady numerical simulation, and the time domain and frequency domain of pressure fluctuation were analysed as well. Numerical results show that the maximum pressure fluctuation appears at the impeller inlet where the fluctuation amplitude is 2.48 times that at the impeller outlet and 16.6 times that at the middle of guide vane. The fluctuation at the impeller inlet becomes stronger with the deviation of flow rate from the design condition and the amplitude at 70% of design flow is 1.5 times that at the design flow rate. Rotor-stator interaction induced by the impeller blades has the greatest affect on the pressure fluctuation while the number of guide vanes has little effect. The results could provide the theoretical basis for the stable operation of mixedflow pumps to avoid hydraulic excitation.

84892640000	Development and verification of mathematical model for meridional velocity at impeller outlet of axial flow pump	A mathematical model is theoretically derived for calculation of meridional velocity distribution at the impeller outlet of an axial flow pump, based on the velocity gradient equations and an assumption of cylindrical layer independence. This model considers the head losses caused by the flow leakage at tip clearances and the secondary flows around the tips, using a correction factor to modify the calculation. It predicts the meridional velocity at minimum impeller loss and high cavitation performance. A miniature five-hole spherical probe was used to measure the meridional velocity at specific speeds of 550, 750, 1000 and 1250. Results show that meridional velocity distributions at the impeller outlet of different axial flow pumps of the same type are very similar, showing a drop near the hub and rim and a peak in the middle of blade. A quadratic regression analysis of the experimental data verified the mathematical model, and thus it would supply reference for hydraulic design of axial flow pump. Copyright.

84892864658	Numerical simulation on modal of large submersible axial-flow pump rotor	Based on method of fluid-solid coupling, a model of the large submersible axial-flow pump (1600QZ55-1100) rotating component which contains an impeller, axis and hub was studied by means of a second development of UDF and coupling WORKBENCH with APDL command. It obtained the natural frequencies and mode of vibration of a rotating component in a vacuum with pre-stress was considered, and pre-stress was not considered. Furthermore, it also achieved the natural frequencies and mode of vibration of a rotating component in water with pre-stress considered. All the above were studied in a steady condition. However, the axial-flow pump works in an unsteady condition in fact. This paper studied the effect of an unsteady condition on the structure mode too. The result showed that the natural frequencies of considering pre-stress in a steady condition are larger than those of not considering pre-stress, especially that the natural frequency corresponding to a longitudinal mode of vibration is 20% larger in a condition of considering pre-stress, and the natural frequencies of a structure in water decrease by about 10% compared with those in a vacuum. On the other hand, the first-order natural frequency in unsteady condition changes periodically with time, yet the range of that is so narrow that it could be regarded as steady. The narrow range of the first-order natural frequency that results from the range of the force on a structure in an unsteady condition is pretty narrow, compared with the huge axial force. It proved that the result in a steady condition was correct. The reason that caused the natural frequencies to increase with pre-stress considered in a vacuum is that the force on the structure results in the stress stiffening of structure, so that the stiffness of the structure in all directions is enhanced, especially the huge axial force on the structure lead to the natural frequencies increasing by 20% corresponding to a longitudinal mode of vibration. The effect of the damping of water was the main reason that makes the natural frequencies of a structure in water decrease, which also reduces the value of the amplitude of all modes of vibration at the same time. Thereby, the modal distribution consistent with the actual situation could be obtained, which can provide a theoretical basis for improving system performance and further study for more complicated dynamics analysis and fatigue analysis.

84892880217	Establishment and experiment of impeller cutting law of double channel pump	In order to put forward the impeller cutting law of double channel pump, two kinds of double channel pumps with the specific speed of 77 and 122 were selected as research objects. The impeller was cut as five times respectively and the performance experiments of double channel pumps were conducted. By investigating the change law between the performance parameters and the impeller diameter at optimal point and dead point, the corresponding value range and equation of cutting index were obtained. Results show that the flow rate, head, shaft power and efficiency reduce with the decrease of the impeller diameter. However, as the increase of impeller cutting percentage, the change law and the reducing amplitude of performance parameters at optimal point are different, and head and shaft power obviously decrease with the decreasing of the impeller diameter at dead point. The cutting index number of double channel pump at dead point can be viewed independent of the specific speed while the change of the cutting index number is obvious with the change of the specific speed at the optimum and common points. The predicted value of the cutting law according to the impeller cutting law established agrees with the experimental value well.

84892997543	Numerical and experimental investigation of tip leakage vortex trajectory in an axial flow pump	In this paper, the tip leakage vortex (TLV) structures in an axial flow pump were investigated by numerical and experimental methods. Based on the comparisons of different blade tip clearance size (i.e., 0.5 mm, 1mm and 1.5mm) and different flow rate conditions, TLV trajectories were obtained by Swirling Strength method, and simulated by modified SST κ-ω turbulence model with refined high-quality structured grids. A high-speed photography test was carried out to capture the tip leakage vortex cavitation in an axial flow pump with transparent casing. Numerical results were compared with the experimental leakage vortex trajectories, and a good agreement is presented. The detailed trajectories show that the start point of tip leakage vortex appears near the leading edge at small flow rate, and it moves from trailing edge to about 30% chord span at rated flow rate. At the larger flow rate condition, the starting point of TLV shifts to the middle of chord, and the direction of TLV moves parallel to the blade hydrofoil.

84893528296	Evaluation of turbulence models for the numerical prediction of transient cavitation around a hydrofoil	The objective of this paper is to evaluate the predictive capability of three turbulence models for the simulation of unsteady cavitating flows around a 2D Clark-y hydrofoil. Three turbulence models were standard k-ε model, hybrid model of density correction model (DCM) and filter-based model (FBM) and an improved partially-averaged Navier-Stokes model (PANS) based on k-ε model. Using the above-mentioned turbulence models and a homogeneous cavitation model, the unsteady cloud cavitation flows around the hydrofoil were numerically simulated and the time evolutions of cavity shape and lift evolutions over time were obtained. The results with comparison to a tunnel experiment data show that the hybrid model and PANS model can accurately capture unsteady cavity shedding details, fluctuation frequency and amplitude of lift and drag. The k-ε model has a poor agreement with the real experimental visualizations and this is mainly attributed to an over prediction of the turbulent viscosity in the rear part of the cavity, which limits the reentrant jet fully reaching the leading edge. The adverse pressure gradient plays an important role in the progression of the reentrant jet. Both the shock wave generated by the collapse of the cloud cavity and the growth of attached sheet cavity contribute to the increase of adverse pressure gradient. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

84893547097	Influence of blade tip rounding on tip leakage vortex cavitation of axial flow pump	Tip leakage flow in axial flow pumps is mainly caused by the tip clearance, which is the main cause of tip leakage vortex cavitation and blade tip cavitation erosion. In order to improve tip clearance flow and reduce TLV cavitation, four schemes were adopted to the round blade tip. These are: no tip rounding, one time tip clearance tip rounding, two times tip clearance tip rounding, four times tip clearance tip rounding. Using SST k-ω turbulence model and Zwart cavitation model in CFX software, this simulation obtained four kinds of inner flow field results.

84896295233	Transient cavitation characteristics of a special mixed-flow turbopump	In order to investigate the transient characteristic of pump hydraulic pressure system, mathematical models of the equipment transient velocity and pump transient speed were established based on the experimental data. The cavitation characteristics at 0.73, 0.90 and 1.00 s moments during the pump starting transient process were analyzed. Numerical results show that distribution of cavitation bubble volume fraction in the suction side of blades at the different net positive suction head (NPSH) conditions is similar. The volume fraction of cavitation bubble increases sharply from the span of 0.7 to 1.0, and reaches the maximum value at the rim. At the time when the equipment gets out of cabin, the average cavity fraction in the rim circumferential surface is about 33% at the condition of the available not positive suction head (NPSH) N

84897690045	Cavitation flow and blade loading characteristic in impeller tip region of axial flow pump	In order to take into account the local density of gas-liquid mixing area in cavitation flow field in impeller tip region of axial flow pump, the turbulent viscosity term in SST k-ω turbulence mode was corrected. NPSH curves, cavitation characteristic and blade loading were analyzed based on full cavitation model with simulation and experimental methods. The investigation results show that the modified SST k-ω turbulence model and cavitation model can predict the cavitation flow field with gas-liquid two-phase flow in the impeller tip region, and the relative error of the critical cavitation number between experimental and predicted values is 7.79% under design conditions, which is satisfactory for the computational accuracy. The high speed phohography experiments show that the cavitation inception is induced by blowing cavitation, clearance attached cavitation and tip leakage vortex cavitation, and the cavitation region continually spreads with the decrease of cavitation number. The break of cavitation bubble cluster occurs at the aft of the blade, and the position of bubble break moves toward the middle of the blade span. The angular interval between (13° and +13° is the main region of the suction side with low pressure. Within the 3% area attached to the blade tip clearance, the pressure gradually decreases with the increase of radius coefficient r*, decreasing the blade surface loading. Near the tip clearance, the blade loading decreases more obviously. © All Rights Reserved.

84897741703	Tip clearance cavitation characteristics in axial flow pump under different cavitation numbers	The cavitation flow field in the axial flow model pump with tip clearance δ=0.5 mm was simulated based on modified SST k-ω turbulence model and cavitation model. The cavitation bubble distributions at different circumferential sections, meridional velocity distribution at impeller outlet and cavitation volume fraction were analyzed. Numerical and experimental results showed that the NPSH curve and tip region cavitation flow were predicted successfully. Cavitation inception in axial flow pump occured in the tip region, including blowing vortex cavitation, leakage flow cavitation, rolling region cavitation and tip leakage vortex cavitation. In the condition of cavitation number σ=0.451, the tip leakage vortex induced obvious cavitation cloud. The cavitation range of rolling region expanded with the decreasing of cavitation number gradually, and merged with the leakage flow cavitation area, and finally extended the cavitation bubble cloud to the entire suction side of the blades. The meridional velocity at impeller outlet near the gap region decreased gradually, in the influence of the gap leakage flow, and was further declined with the decreasing cavitation number. In different cavitation conditions, the circumferential section cavitation area coefficient of the blade, ranging from the hub to the tip, increased primarily, nd decreased afterwards. In the tip region, cavitation area coefficient bursted to the peak and dropt rapidly.

Numerical results were compared with the experimental leakage vortex trajectories, and a good agreement was presented. The detailed trajectories of tip leakage vortex show that the starting point of tip leakage vortex occurs near the leading edge at small flow rate, and it moves from leading edge to about 30% chord length at design flow rate. At larger flow rate condition, the starting point of tip leakage vortex shifts to the middle of chord.

It was shown that the pressure in the liquid film was distributed nonlinearly along the circumferential direction and had a maximum peak at a certain position, but the pressure distribution was parabolic along the axial direction. The pressure profile was affected by length-diameter ratio and eccentricity, particularly, the pressure increased with them. These results are useful for design and selection of the water lubricated bearings of a high-pressure pump for desalination in million-ton processing capacity. It was conformed that the designed bearings have an acceptable reliability and a satisfactory lubrication condition and a sufficient sustainability for loads.

84898680621	Numerical simulation of tip leakage vortex hydrodynamics characteristics in axial flow pump	The scaled model pump of TJ04-ZL-02 hydraulic model, which has been applied on the Tianjin same test-bed for South-to-North Water Transfer Project, was simulated base on fine calculation for tip region flow field and SST k-ω turbulence model, and flow field structure for tip leakage vortex as well as filed dynamic characteristics were studied. Numerical calculations and experimental results show that numerical simulations for clearance leakage and boundary layer flow based on SST k-ω turbulence model are relatively accurate. The power arose from tip leakage vortex is regard as differential pressure between the pressure side and the suction side of blade. For the pressure difference of blade leading edge is the largest, velocity of tip leakage flow is higher. The pressure difference between blade pressure and suction side is increased gradually with the increase of blade chord coefficient λ, and clearance leakage flow velocity as well as leakage vortex strength is decreased gradually. The local low pressure of blade tip region mainly occurs on vortex region of separated vortex near the pressure surface, as well as tip leakage vortex region at the lower part of blade suction side. The local low pressure region of blade suction side is getting further away from blade suction side with the increase of blade chord coefficient λ. The local low pressure region of blade rim near blade pressure side is mainly caused by separated vortex which is induced by blade tip corner, and the low pressure near suction side of blade is resulted from tip leakage vortex, and the process reveals the flow characteristic of tip leakage vortex for axial flow pump.

84899048519	Numerical simulation and experimental study on impeller tip region cavitation in axial flow pump	Based on modified SST k-ω turbulence model and homogeneous cavitation model, a scaling model pump was simulated at large flow rate conditions. The tip clearance axial velocity and turbulent kinetic energy distribution were analyzed. The correlations between cavitation bubbles and pressure distribution of the different chord length cross-section in fixed cavitation number were studied as well. Combined with cavitation and high-speed photography experiments, the experimental results show good agreement with the calculated values. Numerical results show that tip cavitation bubbles are mostly located at the tip clearance region, vortex rolling region and tip leakage vortex region. With the increasing of the chord length coefficient, tip clearance cavitation caused by the corner vortex migrates downward along blade tip clearance from pressure side, and then covers the blade tip region. With the development of tip leakage flow, there is also a process of inception, development and burst in the leakage vortex cavitation. Experimental results show that cavitation bubbles of tip leakage vortex occur in the middle location of the chord at large flow rate conditions. Under serious cavitation conditions, cavitation bubbles occur which are induced by flow separation at pressure side at large flow rate conditions, and the cavitation bubbles also gradually cover the blade suction side, and then form attached sheet cavitation, together with tip leakage vortex, corner vortex and blowing vortex cavitation, which clog the flow channel seriously.

According to amplitude analysis, the results showed that the RMS tends to decrease firstly and then increase with the increase of flow rate at the impeller inlet, and decline in outlet of impeller and outlet of vane. The RMS varies more quickly with higher revolving speed.

The influences of spring stiffness, throttle nozzles diameter, and other parameters on the dynamic and static characteristics of the valve were analyzed using the AMESim simulation software, and accordingly the optimized parameters combination of the solenoid valve group was determined. In addition, a pure water hydraulic test-bed was built to measure the response characteristics of the valve group.

84900504522	Effects of non-uniform suction flow on performance and pressure fluctuation in axial-flow pumps	To study the effect of inflow conditions on an axial flow pump, two different types of non-uniform inlet velocity distributions were established. By comparing with uniform inflow conditions, the effects of the non-uniform inflow conditions on pump performance, radial forces and pressure fluctuations were achieved by numerical simulations. Comparison of numerical simulation results and experimental values under uniform inflow verifies the accuracy of the numerical model. A comparative analysis of the effects on pump head, efficiency and radial force curves was performed under 0.7Q-1.2Q conditions. The variation of the axial flow pump performance and radial loads with the non-uniformity of the inlet velocity was obtained. Finally, based on the unsteady simulation, pressure fluctuations at impeller inlet, impeller outlet and guide vane exit at design condition were monitored, and the effects of two non-uniform inflows on pressure pulsations at three typical positions were achieved. The results show that by controlling the inflow situation, the hydrodynamic performance with non-uniform inflow is better than that with uniform inflow distribution.

84901240360	Hydraulic performance optimization and experiment of special mixed-flow pump based on numerical simulation	In order to study mixed flow pump performance in pump hydraulic pressure system, the relevance between pump performance parameters and physical quantities during the system working process is analyzed. The formulas of mixed flow pump design flow rate, head and other parameters are derived successfully based on submerge equipment kinematic equations, and mixed flow pump design parameters are calculated to meet weapon launching requirements. Open discharge structure of pump exit is optimized based on the CFD method, and double arcs in the axial plane are designed to reduce the hydraulic loss. Numerical results show that area of passage in discharge structure with double arcs changes uniformly without vortex region, so the efficiency of pump device is improved because of the good pressure conversion capability. The slope of flow rate-head curve is increased by optimization of the blade wrap angle and blade outlet angle. The head of optimal case is higher in the full flow rate range, which could meet the equipment acceleration requirements at different operating conditions. Blade outlet flow pattern is optimized based on the non-linear circulation distribution, and the hydraulic efficiency is increased. The maximum efficiency of the optimal pump reaches 83.24%, which meets the design requirements. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84902782147	Influence of operational condition and tip clearance size on trajectory of tip leakage vortex	Based on the SST k-ω turbulence model and vortex intensity method, the flow through the impeller tip and tip leakage vortex trajectory in a model axial-flow pump were simulated numerically. The influence of operational condition and tip clearance size on the trajectory was analyzed. It is shown that the starting point of leakage vortex core moves to the middle portion of blade from the blade leading edge gradually with increasing flow rate. The relative flow direction in the impeller passage is deflected and the trajectory of tip leakage vortex is altered accordingly under the entrainment induced by the primary flow with increasing flow rate as well. Note that the slope of the vortex core trajectory also gets enlarged by the primary flow. The rollup of leakage vortex is enhanced and the affected region is expanded, the starting point of the vortex also moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge, and the static pressure in the vortex core is decreased gradually, causing a risk of cavitation with increasing tip clearance size. A positive head curve appears at around 0.9 times the design flow rate under a tip clearance as large as 1.5 mm, suggesting the tip leakage vortex can influence the instability of head curve significantly.

84919484652	Experimental investigation of pressure fluctuation with multiple flow rates in scaled axial flow pump	In order to discuss the characteristics of pressure fluctuation in a scaled axial flow pump at different flow rate conditions, the dynamic pressure fluctuation data of six pressure monitoring points on the pump casing was measured at different flow rates, and the law of pressure fluctuation in impeller was revealed. The experimental results show that waveform of pressure fluctuation at impeller inlet P1 was the normal sine shape, and the peak to peak value of pressure fluctuation at the measuring point P2 in the impeller reached the maximum, and then decreased at monitoring point P1 located in impeller inlet. Time domains of pressure fluctuations in impeller had four peaks and four valleys which were consistent with the impeller blade number, due to the alternating pressure gradient. The secondary flow and tip leakage vortex induced the second harmonic wave significantly at the middle of impeller at small flow rate conditions. Based on Fast Fourier Transform, the main frequencies of pressure fluctuations at three measuring points in the impeller region in different flow rate conditions were all blade passing frequency (BPF), and the harmonic frequency was the multiples of BPF. The amplitudes of harmonic frequency decayed exponentially. However, the low frequency which was induced by the reversed flow and flushing occured in the frequency domain of pressure fluctuations in the guide vane, and the BPF and its harmonics coexisted.
