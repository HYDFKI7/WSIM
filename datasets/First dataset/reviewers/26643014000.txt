14644407490	Thermal stability and microstructure characterization of sputtered Ni-P and Ni-P-Cr coatings	Ni-P and Ni-P-Cr alloy coatings were deposited onto silicon substrates by the RF magnetron sputtering technique with dual targets of electroless nickel-phosphorus alloy and chromium. To evaluate the effect of doping with a third element on the enhancement of thermal stability in Ni-P coatings, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to identify the onset temperature of phase transformation. The crystallization behavior at different stages of phase transition in the DSC plot was further evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructural evolution of the Ni-P based coating in the as-deposited and heat-treated states were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The broad peak in the DSC plot of both Ni-P and Ni-P-Cr deposits is attributed to the grain coarsening of nickel on the basis of XRD and TEM analyses. The addition of Cr atoms into Ni-P based coating not only suppresses the formation of Ni

1842532946	Crystallization behaviors and microhardness of sputtered Ni-P, Ni-P-Cr and Ni-P-W deposits on tool steel	The Ni-P-based coatings, including binary Ni-P, ternary Ni-P-Cr and Ni-P-W, were fabricated by the RF magnetron sputtering technique with dual target of electroless Ni-P alloy and a third metal element. To evaluate the influence of the doping element in Ni-P deposit, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis was employed to characterize the temperature of phase transformation. The phase transition during thermal evolution under heat-treatment was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Crystallization behavior in binary and ternary Ni-P-based coatings was quite distinct due to the addition of Cr and W. Microhardness tests indicated that the sputtered Ni-P-Cr and Ni-P-W coatings exhibited superior hardness and excellent thermal stability than the Ni-P coating. In addition, chromium exhibited compatible thermal characteristics with the tungsten for the ternary Ni-P-based system. The strengthening mechanism in the sputtered Ni-P-Cr and Ni-P-W deposits is also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33745450308	True 50% duty-cycle SSH and SHH SiGe BiCMOS divide-by-3 prescalers	Four 50% duty-cycle divide-by-3 prescalers - positively/negatively triggered sample-sample-hold (SSH) and sample-hold-hold (SHH) prescalers - are designed based on the current switchable D flip-flops and discussed in this paper. The positively triggered SSH and SHH prescalers are fabricated using the 0.35-μm SiGe BiCMOS technology and measured by the real-time oscilloscope and the spectrum analyzer. The SHH prescaler is our proposed structure and demonstrated in this paper. According to the measurement results, under the condition of the same input power, its maximum operation frequency is twice as high as that of the SSH prescaler thanks to better signal synchronization. At 2.7 V supply, the SSH prescaler operates from 500 MHz to 2 GHz as the SHH prescaler performs from 1 GHz to 3.4 GHz. The input sensitivity level of both structures is about -5 dBm, while the maximum output power is also about -5 dBm. The core current consumption is 4.538 mA and 4.258 mA for the SSH and SHH prescalers, respectively. Copyright © 2006 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

33749017909	Affinity-based mass spectrometry using magnetic iron oxide particles as the matrix and concentrating probes for SALDI MS analysis of peptides and proteins	Silane-immobilized magnetic iron oxide particles were used as the assisting material in surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SALDI) mass spectrometric analysis. This approach can be used to analyze small proteins and peptides. The upper detectable mass range is approximately 16 kDa. The detection limit for peptides is about 20 fmol. Silanized iron oxide particles with negatively charged functionalities can also be used as the affinity probes to selectively trap oppositely charged species from sample solutions by adjusting the pH of the solution. A tryptic digest product of cytochrome C at a concentration as low as 10 nM can be enriched by the particles and directly analyzed by iron oxide SALDI MS without the need for elution steps. Affinity-based mass spectrometry using the bifunctional silanized magnetic iron oxide particles as the SALDI matrix and concentrating probe is demonstrated in this study. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33846643023	Rapid enrichment of phosphopeptides and phosphoproteins from complex samples using magnetic particles coated with alumina as the concentrating probes for MALDI MS analysis	In this study, we used nanocomposite magnetic particles coated with alumina as the affinity probes to selectively concentrate phosphorylated peptides and proteins from a low volume of sample solution. Tryptic digest products of phosphoproteins including α- and β-caseins, human protein phosphatase inhibitor 1, nonfat milk, egg white, and a cell lysate were used as the samples to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. In only 30 and 90 s, phosphopeptides and phosphoproteins sufficient for characterization by MALDI-MS were enriched by the particles, respectively. Proteins trapped on the particles could be directly digested on the particles. The same particles in the digest solution were employed for enrichment of phosphopeptides. We estimated the required time for performing the enrichment of phosphopeptides from complex samples and characterization by MALDI MS was within 5 min.

33847374660	Rapid enrichment of phosphopeptides from tryptic digests of proteins using iron oxide nanocomposites of magnetic particles coated with zirconia as the concentrating probes	Iron oxide nanocomposites of magnetic particles coated with zirconia were used as affinity probes to selectively concentrate phosphopeptides from tryptic digests of α- and β-caseins, milk, and egg white to exemplify the enrichment of phosphopeptides from complex samples. Phosphopeptides, in quantities sufficient for characterization by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS), were enriched by the affinity probes within only 30 s. The affinity probe-target species conjugates were separated from the sample solution simply by applying an external magnetic field. The detection limit for tryptic digest of β-casein using this approach is ∼45 fmol. Furthermore, we combined this enrichment method with a rapid enzymatic digestion method, that is, microwave-assisted enzymatic digestion using magnetic particles as the microwave absorbers, to speed up the tryptic digest reactions. Thus, we alternatively enriched phosphoproteins on the zirconia-coated particles followed by mixing with trypsin and heated the mixture in a microwave oven for 1 min. The particles remaining in the mixture were used as affinity probes to selectively enrich phosphopeptides from the tryptic digestion product by pipeting, followed by characterization using MALDI MS. Using the bifunctional zirconia-coated magnetic particles as both the affinity probes and the microwave absorbers could greatly reduce the time for the purification and characterization of phosphopeptides from complex samples. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

33947427539	Acceleration of microwave-assisted enzymatic digestion reactions by magnetite beads	In this study, we demonstrated that microwave-assisted enzymatic digestion could be greatly accelerated by multifunctional magnetite beads. The acceleration of microwave-assisted enzymatic digestion by the presence of the magnetite beads was attributable to several features of the beads. Their capacity to absorb microwave radiation leads to rapid heating of the beads. Furthermore, their negatively charged functionalities cause adsorption of proteins with opposite charges onto their surfaces by electrostatic interactions, leading to a concentration on the surfaces of the beads of proteins present in trace amounts in the solution. The adsorbed proteins are denatured and hence rendered vulnerable to enzymatic digestion and are digested on the beads. For microwave heating, 30 s was sufficient for carrying out the tryptic digestion of cytochrome c, in the presence of magnetite beads, while 1 min was adequate for tryptic digestion of myoglobin. The digestion products were characterized by MALDI-MS. This rapid enzymatic digestion allowed the entire time for identification of proteins to be greatly reduced. Furthermore, specific proteins present in trace quantities were enriched from the sample on the magnetite beads and could be rapidly isolated from the sample by employing an external magnetic field. These multiple roles of magnetite beads, as the absorber for microwave irradiation, the concentrating probe, and the agent for unfolding proteins, contributed to their capability of accelerating microwave-assisted enzymatic digestion. We also demonstrated that trypsin immobilized magnetite beads were suitable for use in microwave-assisted enzymatic digestion. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

33847685920	Semi-quantitative determination of cationic surfactants in aqueous solutions using gold nanoparticles as reporter probes	Concentrations of cationic surfactants in aqueous solutions have been estimated on the basis of changes in the color of gold nanoparticles, used as reporter probes. We have shown that the colors of gold nanoparticles with anionic protective groups on their surfaces shift from red to indigo/purple and then back to red in a range of cationic surfactant solutions in which concentrations vary from very low to above the theoretical CMCs. The color changes occur near the theoretical CMCs, presumably because the presence of surfactant micelles in the solution prevents the gold nanoparticles from aggregating. We have used gold nanoparticles as reporter probes to determine the concentrations of cationic surfactants in products such as hair conditioners, which often contain large amounts of alkyltrimethylammonium halides. Although this approach can only provide an estimate, it can be performed simply by addition of a given amount of gold nanoparticles to a series of diluted solutions, without the need for instruments or labor-intensive procedures.

34447619866	A multispot DNA chip fabricated with mixed ssDNA/oligo (ethylene glycol) self-assembled monolayers for detecting the effect of secondary structures on hybridization by SPR imaging	A simple surface modification procedure is utilized to construct a multispot DNA chip for the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging measurements in this investigation to observe the influence of DNA secondary structures on hybridization. To prepare a multispot DNA chip, thiolated single-stranded oligonucleotides (1 μM) mixed with oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) alkanethiol (50 μM) were immobilized onto a gold surface. The composition of mixed ssDNA/OEG has been reported. In investigating the effect of secondary structures on hybridization, complementary DNA sequences were injected into the SPR system to interact with the immobilized ssDNA/OEG spots at two different temperatures. The experimental results demonstrated the method is applicable to provide an easy and rapid way of making multispot DNA chips for the detection of DNA hybridization. The results also showed that increasing the DNA hybridization temperature from 27 to 32 °C can reduce the interference of secondary structures on the hybridization. The binding amounts of different DNA spots were in good agreement with those observed from the theoretical predictions based on their potential to form secondary structures. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

35348914818	Gaseous adsorption of carbon tetrachloride onto carbon nanofiber arrays prepared by template-assisted synthesis	Adsorption of carbon tetrachloride onto aligned carbon nanofiber (CNF) arrays, prepared by a template-assisted synthesis, in vapor phase is conducted in the present study. Porous structure analysis indicated that various pore size distributions of the CNF arrays are found to vary with their tubular sizes. The increasing tubular size is accompanied by a decreasing micropore fraction as well as a vapor-phase adsorption capacity. Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models were employed to analyze the equilibrium adsorption data. The surface accessibility of CNF arrays, i.e., adsorption capacity per surface area, was found to decrease with the pore size, according to these models. It is suggested on the basis of the present work that the micropore fraction of CNFs plays an important role in determining the adsorption coverage. Both the equilibrium constant and free energy for the vapor-phase adsorption increase with the micropore proportion, indicating that the micropores act as a high-energy site for adsorption of carbon tetrachloride. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

40949154432	Synthesis and electrochemical characterization of carbon nanotubes decorated with nickel nanoparticles for use as an electrochemical capacitor	Attachment of nickel nanoparticles on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was conducted to explore the influence of Ni loading on the electrochemical capacitance of MWCNT electrodes. A chemical impregnation leaded to homogeneously disperse Ni particles onto the surface of MWCNTs, and the Ni particles were found to be an average size of 30-50 nm. The capacitive behavior of the MWCNT electrodes was investigated in 6 M KOH, by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge cycling, and ac electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. CV measurements showed that the Faradaic current was found to increase with the Ni coverage, indicating that the presence of Ni would enhance the pseudocapacitance through the redox process. Equivalent circuit analysis indicated that both of electrical connection and charge transfer resistances accounted for the major proportion of the overall resistance and were found to decrease with the amount of nickel. A linearity relationship between the total capacitance and the Ni population reflected that each Ni particle exhibits an identical electrochemical activity in enhancing the electrochemical capacitance. The overall electrochemical capacitance (including double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance) of Ni-MWCNT electrode can reach a maximum of 210 F/g over 500 cycles. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

58849130250	Modeling of biofilm in the water distribution system	In order to understand the growth of biofilm and to serve as the basis of cleaning the water distribution pipeline, this study used a multi-attachment dynamic model to simulate the growth of microorganisms' attachment to the pipe wall. The model had considered attachment, detachment, and propagating factors. The attachment and detachment factors are divided into "cell to cell" and "cell to substratum". Factors for biofilm growth included two possibilities, which was "lateral growth" and "vertical growth". Data set of the biofilm biomass from a laboratory scale water distribution system was measured. The data and the model simulation curves were compared so as to justify the performance of the model. The results show that several sets of parameters could be identified. From the simulation of biofilm biomass in the pipeline, the microbial growth related with the incubation time. Due to nutrients being restricted, the biomass of biofilm in the water distribution system did not continue to grow and reached a maximum at about Day 40. From the simulation results, it was suggested the time of cleaning the water distribution pipeline be shortened to one or two months. The model was applied to simulate the tap water biofilm in the pipeline of Kaohsiung city, the second largest in Taiwan with 1.5 million population. The results revealed various levels of risks and the proportionality between the biomass in the water and the growth rate of biofilm. However, most households had the purifying facility of a reverse osmosis system. From the simulation, the facility proved its effectiveness for preventing the intervention of bacteria from the biofilm formation in the distribution pipelines. © IWA Publishing 2008.

77954539152	Assessing the cancer risk associated with arsenic-contaminated seafood	Tens of millions of people worldwide ingest excessive amounts of arsenic (As) through drinking water and food. The dietary intake of seafood is the major As exposure route in humans and can cause As-related adverse health effects including cancers. The aim of this study was to quantify potential cancer risks of As exposure for children and adults through seafood consumption. By coupling the age-specific physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and a Weibull-based dose-response function, a more accurate estimate of urinary arsenic metabolites could be achieved to better characterize potential cancer risks. The simulation results show that the proportion of inorganic As, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in human urine are estimated to total 6.7, 26.9, and 66.4% for children, and 6.2, 27.4, and 66.4% for adults, respectively.

77954188307	Susceptibility-weighted imaging for the evaluation of large cavernous malformation: A case report	The diagnosis of a large cavernous malformation may be challenging because its imaging appearance is variable. Here we reported a 22-year-old man with a large mass in left side temporal lobe. Computed tomography showed a high density intra-axial mass with perifocal edema in left side temporal lobe. Cystic component, a tiny calcified spot and partial contrast enhancement of this lesion were also noted. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed this mass was measured about 4.9 x 4.0 x 4.2 cm in size. Intra-tumoral hemorrhage was noted on T1-weighted images. On T2-weighted images, the peripheral hypointense rim around this mass was shown, which also appeared clearly on susceptibility-weighted images. Surgical excision was performed and pathology confirmed the diagnosis of cavernous malformation. Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a magnetic resonance technique that exploits the magnetic susceptibility differences of various tissues, such as blood, iron and calcification. Because of its high degree of sensitivity in identifying venous structures and blood products, it can help to confirm the diagnosis of cavernous malformation in patients presenting with cerebral hemorrhage.

77954242963	Influence of oxidation level on capacitance of electrochemical capacitors fabricated with carbon nanotube/carbon paper composites	Gaseous oxidation of carbon papers (CPs) decorated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with varying degrees of oxidation was conducted to investigate the influence of surface oxides on the performance of electrochemical capacitors fabricated with oxidized CNT/CP composites. The oxidation period was found to significantly enhance the O/C atomic ratio on the composites, and the increase in oxygen content upon oxidation is mainly contributed by the formation of C Oand C-O groups. The electrochemical behavior of the capacitors was tested in 1MH2SO4 within a potential of 0 and 1V vs. Ag/AgCl. Both superhydrophilicity and specific capacitance of the oxidized CNT/CP composites were found to increase upon oxidation treatment. A linearity increase of capacitance with O/C ratio can be attributed to the increase of the population of surface oxides on CNTs, which imparts excess sites for redox reaction (pseudocapacitance) and for the formation of double-layer (double-layer capacitance). The technique of ac impedance combined with equivalent circuit clearly showed that oxidized CNT/CP capacitor imparts not only enhanced capacitance but also a low equivalent series resistance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

46549084448	WSSV infection activates STAT in shrimp	Although the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is usually involved in antiviral defense, a recent study suggested that STAT might be annexed by WSSV (white spot syndrome virus) to enhance the expression of a viral immediate early gene in infected shrimps. In the present study, we clone and report the first full-length cDNA sequence for a crustacean STAT from Penaeus monodon. Alignment and comparison with the deduced amino acid sequences of other STATs identified several important conserved residues and functional domains, including the DNA binding domain, SH2 domain and C-terminal transactivation domain. Based on these conserved sequences, a phylogenetic analysis suggested that shrimp STAT belongs to the ancient STAT family, while the presence of the functional domains suggested that shrimp STAT might share similar functions and regulating mechanisms with the well-known STATs isolated from model organisms. Real-time PCR showed a decreased transcription level of shrimp STAT after WSSV infection, but a Western blot analysis using anti-phosphorylated STAT antibody showed an increased level of phosphorylated (activated) STAT in the lymphoid organ of shrimp after WSSV infection. We further show that a primary culture of lymphoid organ cells from WSSV-infected shrimp resulted in activated STAT being translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This report provides experimental evidence that shrimp STAT is activated in response to WSSV infection. Our results support an earlier finding that WSSV does not disrupt JAK/STAT pathway, but on the contrary benefits from STAT activation in the shrimp host. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

45849127582	Fabrication and superhydrophobicity of fluorinated carbon fabrics with micro/nanoscaled two-tier roughness	Superhydrophobic carbon fabric with micro/nanoscaled two-tier roughness was fabricated by decorating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto microsized carbon fibers, using a catalytic chemical vapor deposition and subsequent fluorination surface treatment. The superhydrophobic surfaces are based on the regularly ordered carbon fibers (8-10 μm in diameter) that are decorated by CNTs with an average size of 20-40 nm. The contact angle of water significantly increases from 148.2 ± 2.1° to 169.7 ± 2.2° through the introduction of CNTs. This confirms that the wettability of carbon fabric changes from hydrophobicity to superhydrophobicity due to structural transformation. This finding sheds light on how the two-tier roughness surface induces superhydrophobicity of rough surfaces, and how the presence of CNTs reduces the area fraction of a water droplet in contact with the carbon surface with two-tier roughness. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

49149103688	Liquid crystal alignment on plasma beam scanned alkylsiloxane self-assembled monolayers	The octadecyl-trimethoxysiloxane self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibit better uniformity and smoothness on hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films than on indium tin oxide glasses. The liquid crystal alignment on the SAM/a-C:H can be greatly improved by Ar plasma beam scanning. The pretilt angle increases abruptly with Ar plasma beam scanning time within 5 s and reaches a maximum value of about 5° at a longer scanning time. The surface roughness of SAM slightly increases from 0.10 to 0.13 nm after Ar plasma beam scanning. This implies that bond breaking occurs on the SAM surface during the plasma beam scanning. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and X-ray photoemission spectroscope data indicate that plasma beam scanning can sputter off the CH2 bonds in the alkyl chain of SAM. The amount of oxygen on the SAM surface increases after plasma beam scanning and the increase of oxygen is attributed to the formation of C-O bonds during air exposure after plasma beam scanning. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society.

The virus causes high mortality and leads to heavy stress on shrimps. In response to a variety of stresses, living organisms express particular sets of genes such as HSPs. In this study, a HSP21 gene, categorized into the small heat shock protein (smHSP) family, of shrimp Penaeus monodon was identified by annotating the EST databases established from WSSV-infected and WSSV-uninfected shrimp. The shrimp HSP21 gene was 555 bp in length. The thermal aggregation assay showed that the HSP21 had chaperone activity. The result of real-time PCR indicated that HSP21 was constitutive and inducible and was highly expressed in almost all organs such as the epithelium, gill, stomach, midgut, lymphoid organ, hepatopancreas, nervous tissue and heart, but less expressed in haemolymph. However, HSP21 gene showed down-regulation after WSSV infection. It suggests that gene regulation of HSP21 was seriously affected by WSSV. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

58349102516	A lifetime aware approach to service selection in mobile ad hoc networks	Service oriented architecture is expected to be implemented as an effective way for mobile ad hoc communications and collaboration in ubiquitous computing environments. Much effort has been devoted on the service discovery protocols, while fewer works focus on the problem of service selection. The approaches proposed in previous works of service selection are mostly hop based approaches which aim at reducing the average response time. However the network lifetime which measures the durability of the network is also of great importance and should be paid more attention. In this paper, we first present a definition of the network lifetime from the aspect of the service oriented architecture. Then, a heuristic approach to service selection which focuses on optimizing the network lifetime is proposed. Experiments results prove the approach can significantly prolong the network lifetime while at the same time achieve comparably short average response time. © 2008 IEEE.

During composite service execution, the execution path for composite service is very important because of its significant influence on network overhead and the percentage of failure. In this paper, we study the execution path selection problem, which focuses on selecting a short path. The short path means small amount hops the request travels during execution. Based on nodes' locations, request source estimates the hop count between two nodes and then selects a short path for execution. The simulation results show the path selected by our approach almost has the same performance as the theoretical shortest path both on the path length and the percentage of failure, especially in mobile environments. Moreover, our approach performs better than the existing service selection approach both in the percentage of failure and average path length, especially in the network with high mobility and sparse service distribution. © 2008 IEEE.

58449114398	Dynamic monitor based service recovery for composite service in MANETs	Service composition has been introduced in MANETs to utilize the copious distributed resource. Composite service execution is crucial in service composition. Due to the mobility of nodes, service execution failure happens frequently and thus, service recovery is important for composite service execution. Moreover, caused by the decentralized network characters, the decentralized execution model is suitable for mobile ad hoc network. However, the decentralized execution model exerts more difficulties on service recovery. In this paper, we propose a dynamic monitor based service recovery strategy for a decentralized execution architecture with which no centre node exists during the execution process. With this strategy, each service provider plays the role as the monitor for the next service's execution. After accomplishing an atomic service, corresponding provider sends an ACK back to this service's monitor. As shown in the simulation, Our recovery strategy can be aware of the service failure early and can restart service just from the point of that failed atomic service thus greatly reduces the failure rate and the response time. © 2008 IEEE.

61349104695	A biotic ligand model-based toxicodynamic approach to predict arsenic toxicity to tilapia gills in cultural ponds	Farming of tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus is an important aquacultural activity in Taiwan. Due to the elevated arsenic (As) concentration in pond water, it is important to assess the bioavailability and toxicity of As to tilapia for protection of aquatic life and human health. In the present study, we developed a biotic ligand model (BLM)-based toxicodynamic approach to dynamically predict both acute and chronic effective concentrations of As to tilapia in two tilapia farms located at Pudai and Chiangchun counties in southwestern Taiwan. Parameters revealed in the mechanistic model were obtained by fitting this model to the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic data from our previous laboratory experiments. Based on our extended BLM concepts, the site-specific water effect ratios and ambient water quality criteria can be determined with known water chemistry. The proposed methodology was capable of bridging the gap between laboratory toxicity bioassays and field investigations. With respect to risk assessments, our research may also provide an useful means of generating and adjusting the site-specific ambient water quality criteria. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The core-shell polyhedrons started with the growth of single-crystalline Zn polyhedrons, nucleated on a Si substrate, and the ZnO layers were formed on the surface of the Zn polyhedrons upon the oxidation treatments. The thickness of the oxide layers could be controlled precisely by adjusting the temperature during the oxidizing process. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and focus ion beam show various polyhedrons were grown with different crystallographic orientations vertical to the Si substrate and exhibit special mechanical properties in tolerating strain induced by the lattice mismatch between Zn and Si. The strain energy as well as the surface and interfacial energy determine the number ratio of different polyhedrons on Si(111) and Si(001), and a thermodynamic model was proposed to explain the mechanism. Room-temperature cathodoluminescence measurements show that the Zn/ZnO core-shell polyhedrons exhibit tunable ultraviolet emissions and controllable green emission with different oxidation conditions, which were ascribed to the surface and strain effect. The growth of various Zn polyhedrons on Si provides evidence for understanding strain induced substrate effects and distinguishing strain tolerance between metal and oxide nanostructures. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

62849096205	Bioavailability links mode of action can improve the long-term field risk assessment for tilapia exposed to arsenic	The objective of this paper was to develop a mechanistic-based framework to explicitly incorporate the factors controlling the bioavailability, toxicodynamics and mode of action to enhance predictive ability of arsenic (As) toxicity to protect the health of farmed tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. We linked the biotic ligand model and damage assessment model to develop a toxicokinetic model for elucidating the site-specific temporal changes of As bioavailability and to characterize how the fish regulate the metal toxicity. We built a bioavailability-mode of action-based growth toxicity model by linking a bioenergetic growth model and damage assessment model to predict how the As affects on the tilapia growth in the entire life span in site-specific field ecosystems. Here we show that the proposed model well describes the water-chemistry-dependent toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics variations of As to tilapia. We selected two local tilapia farms with different water chemistries located at southwestern Taiwan coast region to implement the proposed algorithm to predict the risk of As exposure. Results indicate that the growth toxicity of O. mossambicus in Taihsi is more sensitive than that in Peimen. We found that the effect of ion competition on the As bioavailability and their ecotoxicological effects on tilapia are more obvious in Taihsi comparing with that in Peimen. We suggested that the proposed bioavailability- and mode of action-based framework can be used to capture the biological response and regulation of tilapia to As exposures. It is applicable for a site-specific and long-term ecotoxicological risk assessment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

67349282254	Synthesis of graphene on silicon carbide substrates at low temperature	A method for the synthesis of millimeter-scaled graphene films on silicon carbide substrates at low temperatures (750 °C) is presented herein. Ni thin films were coated on a silicon carbide substrate and used to extract the substrate's carbon atoms under rapid heating. During the cooling stage, the carbon atoms precipitated on the free surface of the Ni and formed single-layer or few-layer graphene. The result shows that the number of graphene layers might be further controlled by appropriate process conditions. In contrast to the epitaxial graphene synthesis on single crystal silicon carbide, the graphene prepared here are continuous over the entire Ni-coated area, and can be stripped from the substrate much more easily for further characterization. The large-scaled, low temperature and transferable features of our method suggest the potential for future graphene-based applications. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

67049167412	Discovering and selecting reliable service in mobile ad hoc networks	Service is accepted as an effective way for mobile nodes' communication and collaboration in MANETs. Many efforts have been spent on service discovery and selection, but few works study reliable service discovery and selection. Furthermore, since the dynamic nature of MANETs and limited energy of nodes lead to a high probability of service failure in MANETs, it is necessary to select a reliable service for executing. In this paper, we propose a reliable service discovery and selection approach (RSD&S). To achieve high reliability of service, it adopts link expiration time prediction and hybrid selection. The former is based on node's location; the later is based on path expiration time, residual energy and hop count. Furthermore, we propose a reliable service discovery and selection approach with pruning (RSD&SWP). It improves RSD&S on network performance through pruning the redundant reply.

67649211779	Single crystalline film on glass for thin film solar cells	A simple Ge-on-glass metal-oxide-semiconductor solar cell has been demonstrated by wafer bonding and smart-cut. Since single crystalline Ge is directly bonded on glass, the crystalline substrate is not necessary. The metal-oxide-semiconductor structure can be easily fabricated without n and p dopant diffusion or implantation. The reason for low efficiency is discussed, and then the optimized structures are designed by simulation. An outstanding enhancement on efficiency can be achieved with the Si/Ge/Si structure. The best performance can be achieved by optimization of the position of the Ge layer, the thickness of the Ge layer, and the number of the Ge layers. The efficiency of the thin film Si/Ge/Si solar cell with single layer of 30-nm-thick Ge outside the depletion region reaches 15.9%, as compared to the control Si sample of 11.8%. Based on the simulation and technologies, high efficiency thin film solar cells can be demonstrated in the future. Copyright © 2009 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

Phosphopeptide enrichment was rapid when subjecting these systems to microwave heating for 1 min; the probe-target species, which were readily isolated through magnetic separation, were then analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). Only signals for phosphopeptides were present in the resulting mass spectra. The detection limit for monophosphopeptide was as low as 5 fmol.

67649394134	Super water- and oil-repellencies from silica-based nanocoatings	This study develops a one-step coating technique to synthesize super water- and oil-repellent silica-based coatings without any additional low-surface energy treatment. Surface topography observation showed that stacking of spherical silica nanoparticles of 20 nm diameter forms primary surface roughness. The atomic ratio of fluorine to silicon in the silica coating plays the crucial role in affecting water- and oil-repellencies, i.e., an optimal ratio of F/Si: 2.13 for the best water-repellency (168.1°) and oil-repellency (165.2°). The Cassie-Baxter model analyzes that the combined effect of silica sphere stacking and surface fluorination contributes a high area fraction of water and ethylene glycol droplet in contact with air, leading to stable water- and oil-repellencies. Such multifunctional nanocoating through the one-step fabrication imparts a variety of promising potentials for the engineering of polymeric or flexible substrates with superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

68749097174	Contact angle hysteresis and work of adhesion of oil droplets on nanosphere stacking layers	Surface repellency of liquid droplets with different surface tensions (23.4-73.2 mN/m) on nanostructured surfaces built of one- and two-tier silica sphere stacking surfaces were investigated, and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) and work of adhesion were analyzed. It was shown that the binary nano- and sub-micrometer-scaled roughened surfaces exhibited better repellency toward oil drops with surface tension of 30 mN/m, and the CAH behavior strongly depended on both liquid types and density of three-phase contact line. This improvement of hysteresis from the two-tier texture is attributed to the facts that (i) the arrangement of submicrometer spheres generates a primary roughness that allows air cushion in the texture and (ii) the deposition of nanospheres creates a large number of point contact fashion to repel the oil penetration, reducing the length of the liquid-solid contact line (i.e., Cassie state). The existing air layer tends to impart the fraction of vapor-solid contact, which decreases the kinetic barrier of drop movement. Incorporated with the Young-Duprè equation, it has shown a linear relationship between the difference between cosines of advancing and receding angles and the work of adhesion. Accordingly, it reveals that the adhesion of solid-oil contact interface is reduced due to the design of surface topography. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

69749084388	Risk factors and impact of nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in the adult intensive care unit: a case-control study	During a nine-year study period, 96 episodes of nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) due to Acinetobacter baumannii were identified in the adult intensive care units (ICUs) of Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital. Seventy-seven (80.2%) of these were available for matching in terms of age, sex, primary diagnosis of ICU admission, ICU ward, and disease severity. Univariate analysis showed that central venous catheter use, ventilator use, prior A. baumannii colonisation, and respiratory and cardiovascular organ failure were significantly associated with acquiring A. baumannii BSI in the ICU. By multivariate analysis, only prior A. baumannii colonisation [odds ratio (OR): 3.81; P < 0.001] and cardiovascular failure (OR: 2.24; P = 0.04) were identified as independent risk factors. The lower respiratory tract (32/77; 41.6%) was the most frequent source of infection, followed by intravascular catheters (13/77; 16.9%). Cumulative survival curves for patients with A. baumannii BSI and control patients showed no significant difference (30 day crude mortality: 29.9% and 27.3%, respectively; P = 0.916). However, the mean length of ICU and hospital stay and mean hospital cost of patients with A. baumannii BSI significantly increased, with an estimated 8.7 days excess length of ICU stay, 19.1 days excess hospital stay, and US $8480 extra hospital costs.

68049123109	A study of ontology-based risk management framework of construction projects through project life cycle	The process knowledge assets make a substantial contribution to the risk management (RM) for contractors in the construction phase. To effectively reuse these assets, knowledge extraction becomes a significant research area. This paper was designed to explore an approach to conduct knowledge extraction by establishing project risk ontology. Specifically, the study proposed the ontology-based risk management (ORM) framework to enhance the RM performance by improving the RM workflow and knowledge reuse. The ORM framework facilitated the identification, analysis, and response of project risks. This study validated the ORM framework through a case demonstration. Through the implementation and application, the results demonstrated that the ORM framework was able to apply to the RM workflow for contractors, and more importantly, it greatly increased the effectiveness of project RM. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Change in intrinsic viscosity is used as the parameter to elucidate the causes of changes in the hydrodynamic volume of chitosan molecules in these solutions. Results show that the intrinsic viscosity of chitosan decreases in acetic acid or in malic acid over storage time. These decreases are more pronounced in acetic acid solution than in malic acid solution, more significant in higher temperature than in lower temperature solutions, and greater in solutions without NaCl than in solutions containing higher NaCl. The decrease in intrinsic viscosity can perhaps be attributed to the compounded effects of compaction of the chitosan molecules and/or acidic degradation during storage. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

68149163407	Online detection of waterborne bioavailable copper by valve daily rhythms in freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea	Freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, a surrogate species in metal toxicity testing, is a promising bioindicator of impairment in aquatic ecosystems. Little is known, however, about the relationship between clam valve daily rhythmic response and metal bioavailability related to a metal biological early warning system (BEWS) design. The purpose of this study was to link biotic ligand model (BLM)-based bioavailability and valve daily rhythm in C. fluminea to design a biomonitoring system for online in situ detection of waterborne copper (Cu). We integrated the Hill-based dose-time-response function and the fitted daily rhythm function of valve closure into a constructed programmatic mechanism. The functional presentation of the present dynamic system was completely demonstrated by employing a LabVIEW graphic control program in a personal computer. We used site-specific effect concentration causing 10% of total valve closure response (EC10) as the detection threshold to implement the proposed C. fluminea-based Cu BEWS. Here our results show that the proposed C. fluminea -based BEWS could be deliberately synthesized to online in situ transmit rapidly the information on waterborne bioavailable Cu levels under various aquatic environmental conditions through monitoring the valve daily rhythmic changes. We suggested that the developed C. fluminea-based dynamic biomonitoring system could assist in developing technically defensible site-specific water quality criteria to promote more efficient uses in water resources for protection of species health in aquatic environments. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

68149168205	Approximate reliability-based design with general geotechnical models by stochastic simulation	Traditionally, geotechnical engineers have practised design approaches based on safety factors to account for uncertainties, owing to their simplicity. More recently, reliability-based design approaches have emerged as a more reasonable and rigorous way of handling uncertainties. If the functional relationship between reliability and safety factor can be found, it is then possible to achieve reliability-based design with the traditional safety-factor approach. However this functional relationship, in general, does not exist. This research proves a sufficient condition for the existence of such relationship. Moreover, a theorem is derived to determine the functional relationship between reliability and safety factor with stochastic simulations. The proposed framework is so general that it is applicable to arbitrarily complex geotechnical systems with arbitrarily high-dimensional uncertainties, and no lognormal or Gaussian assumption is required. Two simulated examples of reliability-based design are used to verify the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is quite promising.

70349440879	A novel air index scheme for twig queries in on-demand XML data broadcast	Data broadcast is an efficient way for information dissemination in wireless mobile environments, and on-demand XML data broadcast is one of the most important research issues in this area. Indexing XML data on wireless channel is critical for this issue since energy management is very important in wireless mobile environments. Previous works have focused on air index schemes for single path queries. In this paper, we propose a novel air index scheme that builds concise air indexes for twig queries in on-demand XML data broadcast. We adopt the Document Tree structure as the basic air index structure for twig queries and propose to prune redundant structures of the basic Document Tree indexes to reduce the energy consumption. Then we propose to combine all the pruned indexes into one which can eliminate structure redundancy among the indexes to further reduce the energy consumption. Our preliminary experiments show that our air index scheme is very effective and efficient, as it builds concise air indexes and supports twig queries without losing any precision. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

High dielectric constant associated with ceramic process is able to make the antenna further smaller. Multilayer structure in the ceramics is designed in order to create multi-mode which consequently generates a wideband to meet the need of DVB-H reception.

However, GPS receivers cannot reject high power interference. Therefore, interference suppression research has become an important issue. In this paper, we use Overlapped Fast Fourier Transform (OFFT) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) approaches to remove possible interferences. Single tone and frequency modulation (FM) interferences are used to test proposed approaches. Through software simulation, we find that OFFT and HHT can successfully suppress single tone interference. But only HHT method can annihilate FM interference.

71249105482	Robust adaptive fuzzy control for nonlinear uncertain systems with unknown dead-zone and unknown upper bound of uncertainties	In this paper, a robust adaptive fuzzy control for a class of nonlinear uncertain systems preceded by an unknown dead-zone and with unknown upper bound of uncertainties is developed. The dead-zones are quite commonly encountered in many systems (e.g., DC servosystem, robot, and machine tools), are usually poorly known, and may severely limit the performance of control. In addition, the system uncertainties (e.g., parameter variations, or external load, unmodeled dynamics) often exist. Therefore, the controllers are required to deal with the robust stability and performance of the systems with unknown dead-zone and in the presence of uncertainties, whose upper bound is generally unknown. In the beginning, an adaptive dead-zone compensation is employed to improve system performance. Then the unknown system functions and the unknown upper bound of system uncertainties are respectively approximated by fuzzy logic systems with unknown weights. The unknown bounds caused by the learning error of the slope of dead-zone and the system functions are also tackled by an extra learning law. The above weights are all on-line learned to provide for the controller design. Moreover, the projection terms in these learning laws are designed such that the boundedness of the learning weight can be assured. ©2009 IEEE.

71349085260	Abnormal diagnosis of Emergency Department triage explored with data mining technology: An Emergency Department at a Medical Center in Taiwan taken as an example	Triage helps to classify patients at emergency departments to make the most effective use of resources distributed. What is more important is that accuracy in carrying out triage matters greatly in terms of medical quality, patient satisfaction and life security. As the numbers of patients in emergency departments increase, learning from the examples of abnormal diagnosis of triage in order to make modifications, constitutes a significant issue. The researcher worked with the Emergency Department of a Taiwan Medical Center to build a model to view abnormal diagnoses in the database from the establishment of a flow path and the selection of parameters for sampling. Data on patients were derived from the database. Two-stage cluster analysis (Ward's method and K-means) and decision tree analysis were made on 501 abnormal diagnoses in an emergency department. It was found that nursing personnel make more frequent triage diagnoses than physicians do. Most of abnormal diagnoses stems from patients rather than the diagnosis on the day. Pulse and temperature have greater distinction. The researcher proposes seven correlation laws based on confidence and support proportions, derived from sample point conforming to correlation law that abnormal diagnosis is most likely in diseases of pneumonia and cirrhosis, etc. Through data mining technology, the researcher's triage expert system is written in simulation. After periodic updates, it can improve the system and education training without the influence of the subjective factor. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chem. 2003, 75, 6191). In a somewhat related study, we have employed CNTs produced by using NaH-treated anodic aluminum oxide (Na@AAO) as a reactive template as the assisting matrix for MALDI analysis upon the addition of high concentrations of citrate buffer. Our results indicate that the mass range can be extended to ca. 12,000 Da and that alkali metal adducts of analytes are effectively reduced. Furthermore, we have employed citric acid-treated CNTs as affinity probes to selectively concentrate traces of analytes from aqueous solutions. High concentrations of salts and surfactants in the sample solutions are also tolerated. This approach is very suitable for the MALDI analysis of small proteins, peptides, and protein enzymatic digest products. © 2004 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.

By using a simple inverted-L feeding strip to capacitively excite the shorted T-monopole, two wide operating bands at about 900 and 1900 MHz, respectively, to cover GSM850/900 and GSM1800/1900/UMTS operations are obtained. The antenna is an all-printing structure, with no external matching circuit on the system circuit board or lumped circuit elements embedded in the antenna required for size reduction or bandwidth enhancement. The antenna is hence easy to fabricate at low cost and is especially suited for thin-profile mobile phone applications. The occupied area (less than 400 mm2) of the antenna printed on the system circuit board of the mobile phone in this study is among the smallest for the internal uniplanar printed antenna capable of penta-band WWAN operation that have been reported. Details of the proposed antenna are described, and the obtained results, including its SAR (specific absorption rate) study, are presented and discussed. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

74449089053	Assessing the arsenic-contaminated rice (Oryza sativa) associated children skin lesions	The purpose of this study was to assess the potential risk of children skin lesions from arsenic-contaminated rice (Oryza sativa) consumption in West Bengal (India). Published age- and gender-specific skin lesions data in West Bengal were reanalyzed and incorporated into a Weibull dose-response model to predict children skin lesion prevalence. Monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) levels in urine was used as a biomarker that could be predicted from a human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. This study integrated arsenic contents in irrigation water, bioaccumulation factors of paddy soil, cooking methods, and arsenic bioavailability of cooked rice in gastrointestinal tract into a probabilistic risk model. Results indicated that children aged between 13 and 18 years might pose a relative higher potential risk of skin lesions to arsenic-contaminated cooked rice (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.18 (95% CI 1.12-2.15)) than those of 1-6 years children (ORs = 0.98 (0.85-1.40)). This study revealed the need to consider the relationships between cooking method and arsenic in cooked rice when assessing the risk associated with children skin lesions from rice consumption. This study suggested that arsenic-associated skin lesions risk from arsenic-contaminated rice consumption would be reduced significantly by adopting traditional rice cooking method (wash until clean; rice:water = 1:6; discard excess water) as followed in West Bengal (India) and using water containing lower arsenic (e.g., <10 μg L

This report summarizes the SMART data from 1 of the study centers from 2002 to 2006. Methods: 492 Gram-negative isolates were collected from 482 patients with IAI. Susceptibilities of these isolates to 12 antimicrobial agents were determined using the broth microdilution method. Results: Enterobacteriaceae comprised 68.3% of the isolates (n = 336). The 4 main species were Klebsiella spp. (n = 129; 26.2%), Escherichia coli (n = 122; 24.8%), Enterobacter spp. (n = 36; 7.3%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (n = 35; 7.1 %). The commonest glucose non-fermentative GNB were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 46; 9.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 35; 7.1 %). Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production was detected in 70 Enterobacteriaceae isolates (70/336; 21%). The ESBL phenotype was exhibited by 23% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26% of E. coli, and 19% of Enterobacter spp. The highest rate of ESBL production was found in 2005 for E. coli (38%) and in 2003 for Klebsiella spp. (38%) and Enterobacter spp. (40%). The incidence of ESBL-producing isolates declined in 2005 and 2006. Low susceptibility rates of E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin (58%) and levofloxacin (64%) were noted. Ertapenem (99%), imipenem (99%), and amikacin (94%) were the most potent agents against Enterobacteriaceae spp. Conclusion: Continuous surveillance is crucial to monitor the trend of antimicrobial resistance patterns among GNB isolated from IAI. © 2009 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

Without the diffusion steSi-C bonds are partially formed in the as-carburized layer on Si(100). The ratio of C-C bonds to Si-C bonds is about 7:3, which can be lowered to about 1:9 after the diffusion step at 1350°C for 5 min or at 1300°C for 7 min according to C 1s core level spectra. The residual C-C bonds cannot be removed, which is associated with an irregular atomic arrangement (amorphous) located either at the 3C-SiC/Si(100) interface or at the intersection of twin boundaries in the 3C-SiC buffer layer based on the lattice image taken by transmission electron microscope. The diffusion step helps the formation of Si-C bonds more completely and results in a SiC buffer layer of high quality formed on Si(100) before the growth step. However, twins and stacking faults still appear in the 3C-SiC buffer layer after the diffusion step. The formation mechanism of the 3C-SiC buffer layer is proposed and discussed. © 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

The superhydrophobic surfaces are based on the regularly ordered carbon fibers (8-10 μm in diameter) that are decorated by CNTs with an average size of 20-40 nm. The contact angle of water significantly increases from 148.2 ± 2.1° to 169.7 ± 2.2° through the introduction of CNTs. This confirms that the wettability of carbon fabric changes from hydrophobicity to superhydrophobicity due to structural transformation. This finding sheds light on how the two-tier roughness surface induces superhydrophobicity of rough surfaces, and how the presence of CNTs reduces the area fraction of a water droplet in contact with the carbon surface with two-tier roughness.

We tested present model and triggering mechanisms by carrying out a series of modeling experiments where we used periodic pulses and sine-wave as featured exposures. Our results indicate that changes in the dominant frequencies and pulse timing can shift the safe rate distributions for tilapia, but not for that of freshwater clam. We found that tilapia increase bioenergetic costs to maintain the acclimation during pulsed and sine-wave exposures. Our ability to predict the consequences of physiological variation under time-varying exposure patterns has also implications for optimizing species growing, cultivation strategies, and risk assessment in realistic situations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials & methods: Lysozyme is an enzyme that is capable of hydrolyzing the cell walls of bacteria. In this study, we demonstrated the generation of functional Au NCs by using lysozyme as the sequester and the reducing agent for Au precursors at 40°C. In addition, to shorten the reaction time, the reaction was conducted under microwave irradiation within a short period of time for the first time. Results: The bioactivity of the lysozyme on the Au NCs was retained. Therefore, the as-prepared lysozyme-Au NCs with desirable fluorescence feature were successfully employed to be broad-band labeling agents for pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the lysozyme-Au NCs can be used to effectively inhibit the cell growth of notorious antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including pan-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Conclusion: The potential of employing the lysozyme-Au NCs for bacterial labeling and as antimicrobial agents is expected. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

This internal distributed LC matching circuit has an equivalent layout as the conventional external high-pass LC matching circuit with lumped elements; both are effective in tuning the antenna's lower band bandwidth. In addition, the antenna with the proposed internal distributed LC matching circuit, in this study, can lead to much widened bandwidths in both the antenna's lower and upper bands to cover the 698-960 and 1710-2690 MHz bands, respectively. That is, eight-band LTE/WWAN operation can be achieved. Results of the proposed antenna with the internal distributed LC matching circuit are presented. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77955171507	Transferability of rice SSR markers to bamboo	Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are widely applied in studies of plant molecular genetics due to their abundance in the genome, codominant nature, high repeatability, and transferability in cross-species applications. To investigate the possibility of applying rice SSR markers in bamboo, we selected 120 rice SSR markers that are evenly distributed on rice chromosomes and assessed these for their transferability to 21 different bamboo species. A total of 4847 bands of 2196 alleles were obtained from 82 SSR markers that were able to amplify products in the bamboo genome; the transferability was 68. 3%. Seven markers specifically amplified individual bamboo species and are consequently valuable markers for species identification. SSR markers located on rice chromosome 7 and 1 showed the highest and lowest transferability, respectively to the bamboo genome. SSR markers located on some regions of the rice chromosomes could not be amplified in bamboo, suggesting that regional divergence occurred between rice and bamboo during evolution. A dendrogram was constructed. The dendrogram classified bamboo species into two major groups which coincided with rhizome type, runner, and clumper. The results of this study demonstrate that rice SSR markers can be a valuable source of markers for those genomes lacking useful marker systems. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77957593466	Neural network classifier with entropy based feature selection on breast cancer diagnosis	The aim of this research is to combine the feature selection (FS) and optimization algorithms as the optimal tool to improve the learning performance like predictive accuracy of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset classification. An ensemble of the reduced data patterns based on FS was used to train a neural network (NN) using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to devise the appropriate NN training weighting parameters, and then construct an effective Neural Network classifier to improve the Wisconsin Breast Cancers' classification accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that the accuracy and AROC improved emphatically, and the best performance in accuracy and AROC are 98.83% and 0.9971, respectively. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77957680095	Predicting bioavailability and bioaccumulation of arsenic by freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea using valve daily activity	There are many bioindicators. However, it remains largely unknown which metal-bioindicator systems will give the reasonable detection ranges of bioavailable metals in the aquatic ecosystem. Various experimental data make the demonstration of biomonitoring processes challenging. Ingested inorganic arsenic is strongly associated with a wide spectrum of adverse health outcomes. Freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, one of the most commonly used freshwater biomomitoring organisms, presents daily activity in valve movement and demonstrates biotic uptake potential to accumulate arsenic. Here, a systematical way was provided to dynamically link valve daily activity in C. fluminea and arsenic bioavailability and toxicokinetics to predict affinity at arsenic-binding site in gills and arsenic body burden. Using computational ecotoxicology methods, a valve daily rhythm model can be tuned mathematically to the responsive ranges of valve daily activity system in response to varied bioavailable arsenic concentration. The patterned response then can be used to predict the site-specific bioavailable arsenic concentration at the specific measuring time window. This approach can yield predictive data of results from toxicity studies of specific bioindicators that can assist in prediction of risk for aquatic animals and humans. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79951517084	The storage stability of chitosan/tripolyphosphate nanoparticles in a phosphate buffer	The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of initial size and pH of the solution on the changes in size of chitosan/tripolyphosphate (CS/TPP) nanoparticles stored in a phosphate buffer at 25 °C. The size decreased with increasing pH of the storage phosphate buffer. The initial sizes of the nanoparticles themselves also affected storage stability - the larger ones decreased in size, however the smaller ones increased their size in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.5 at 25 °C for 10 days due to protonation or deprotonation effects on the chitosan molecules. The changes of nanoparticle sizes are classified into instantaneous, aging, and swelling/aggregation stages over the storage time of 97 days. Mechanisms for these size changes are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0036396817	Transcriptional analysis of the DNA polymerase gene of shrimp white spot syndrome virus	The white spot syndrome virus DNA polymerase (DNA pol) gene (WSSV dnapol) has already been tentatively identified based on the presence of highly conserved motifs, but it shows low overall homology with other DNA pols and is also much larger (2351 amino acid residues vs 913-1244 aa). In the present study we perform a transcriptional analysis of the WSSV dnapol gene using the total RNA isolated from WSSV-infected shrimp at different times after infection. Northern blot analysis with a WSSV dnapol-specific riboprobe found a major transcript of 7.5 kb. 5′-RACE revealed that the major transcription start point is located 27 nucleotides downstream of the TATA box, at the nucleotide residue A within a CAGT motif, one of the initiator (Inr) motifs of arthropods. In a temporal expression analysis using differential RT-PCR, WSSV dnapol transcripts were detected at low levels at 2-4 h.p.i., increased at 6 h.p.i., and remained fairly constant thereafter. This is similar to the previously reported transcription patterns for genes encoding the key enzyme of nucleotide metabolism, ribonucleotide reductase. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the DNA pols from three different WSSV isolates form an extremely tight cluster. In addition, similar to an earlier phylogenetic analysis of WSSV protein kinase, the phylogenetic tree of viral DNA pols further supports the suggestion that WSSV is a distinct virus (likely at the family level) that does not belong to any of the virus families that are currently recognized. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

83655188391	Control of synthesis and optical properties of DNA templated silver nanoclusters by varying DNA length and sequence	We have used a simple method to prepare five fluorescent Ag nanoclusters (NCs) through the NaBH<inf>4</inf>-mediated reduction of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions in the presence of various DNA scaffolds. The emission intensities and wavelengths (536-644 nm) of the as-prepared DNA-Ag NCs were dependent on the sequence and length of the DNA scaffold. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the DNA-Ag NCs revealed that different numbers of Ag atoms (2-6 atoms) were present per DNA scaffold, depending on the number and position of the cytosine bases. Using the oligonucleotide 5′-CCC(TTCC)<inf>2</inf>TT(CCAA) <inf>2</inf>CCC-3′ (DNA<inf>TAr2</inf>) as the scaffold, we obtained DNA<inf>TAr2</inf>-Ag NCs exhibiting a quantum yield (Φ<inf>f</inf>) of 61% at 608 nm; these NCs were stable in the presence of the tested thiols, Cl <sup>-</sup> ions and DNase I. Because of their strong fluorescence and stability, the DNA<inf>TAr2</inf>-Ag NCs were highly selective and sensitive for the detection of Hg<sup>2+</sup> ions [linear range: 2.5-50 nM; limit of detection (signal-to-noise ratio = 3): 0.9 nM]. We validated the practicality of this probe through analyses of several water samples spiked with Hg <sup>2+</sup> ions (10 nM); the recoveries were 98-118%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

84863010931	A new tri-band bandpass filter for Gsm, wimax and ultra-wideband responses by using asymmetric stepped impedance resonators	In this paper, a design of new tri-band bandpass filter for the application of GSM (1.8 GHz), WiMAX (2.7 GHz) and UWB (3.3- 4.8 GHz) is proposed. The first two narrow passbands are created, and the bandwidth of the third passband can be tuned by properly selecting the impedance ratio (R) and physical length ratio (u) of the asymmetric stepped-impedance resonator. To improve passband performance and form the UWB passband, a U-shape defected ground structure and extra extended coupling lines are integrated with the asymmetric SIR. Due to the three transmission zeros appearing near the passband edges, the band selectivity of the proposed filter is much improved. The filter was fabricated, and the measured results have a good agreement with the full-wave simulated ones.

0041474628	Reducing the alkali cation adductions of oligonucleotides using sol-gel-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry	The alkali cation adductions of oligonucleotides dramatically degrade MALDI mass spectra and even affect the detection limit. Desalting is generally involved in MALDI sample preparation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid (DABA) and 3,5-DABA as the MALDI matrix for oligonucleotide analysis. Furthermore, sodium ion adducts of oligonucleotides were simultaneously reduced in the mass spectra when DABA was used as the MALDI matrix and sol-gel material was used as the sample support. However, depositing the sample on the sample support was very difficult, and the lack of homogeneity of analytes/matrix distribution on the sample support also led the analyte signals to be revealed only in "sweet spots". Alternatively, DABA was doped into sol-gel materials to generate homogeneous DABA/sol-gel hybrid film. The DABA/sol - gel hybrid film was used as the sample substrate to assist the desorption/ionization of analytes. The analyte signals were evenly found on the sample substrate. The sodium ion adductions of oligonucleotides were also effectively suppressed. The sample preparation used in this approach resembles that used in the authors' previous study, involving sol - gel-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SGALDI) mass spectrometry (Lin, Y.-S. ; Chen, Y.-C. Anal. Chem. 2002, 74, 5793-5798.) The SGALDI approach was demonstrated to be effective in assisting the desorption/ionization of peptides and small proteins. Herein, the SGALDI material, DABA/sol - gel hybrid material, was successfully applied to oligonucleotide analysis, and good-quality mass spectra were obtained without extra desalting. Additionally, the presence of 0.1% SDS in the oligonucleotide sample solution was tolerated without degrading the mass spectra. The largest detectable molecular size for oligonucleotides was 72 mer. The detection limit for 24 mer of oligonucleotide was 20 fmol.
