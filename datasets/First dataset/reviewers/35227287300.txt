The observed dimuon invariant mass distribution is consistent with the Standard Model background-only hypothesis in the 120-150GeV search range. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.5GeV, the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 7.0 (7.2) times the Standard Model expectation.

84929403808	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel at √s = 8 TeV with ATLAS	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections are presented for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 8TeV. The analysis is performed in the H → γγ decay channel using 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The signal is extracted using a fit to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum assuming that the width of the resonance is much smaller than the experimental resolution. The signal yields are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution. The pp → H → γγ fiducial cross section is measured to be 43.2 ±9.4 (stat.) <sup>+3.2</sup><inf>−2.9</inf> (syst.) ±1.2 (lumi) fb for a Higgs boson of mass 125.4 GeV decaying to two isolated photons that have transverse momentum greater than 35% and 25% of the diphoton invariant mass and each with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.37. Four additional fiducial cross sections and two cross-section limits are presented in phase space regions that test the theoretical modelling of different Higgs boson production mechanisms, or are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Differential cross sections are also presented, as a function of variables related to the diphoton kinematics and the jet activity produced in the Higgs boson events. The observed spectra are statistically limited but broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.

84938558391	Search for long-lived, heavy particles in final states with a muon and multi-track displaced vertex in proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV with the ATLAS detector	Many extensions of the Standard Model posit the existence of heavy particles with long lifetimes. In this Letter, results are presented of a search for events containing one or more such particles, which decay at a significant distance from their production point, using a final state containing charged hadrons and an associated muon. This analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.4 fb<sup>-1</sup> collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector operating at the Large Hadron Collider. Results are interpreted in the context of R-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios. No events in the signal region are observed and limits are set on the production cross section for pair production of supersymmetric particles, multiplied by the square of the branching fraction for a neutralino to decay to charged hadrons and a muon, based on the scenario where both of the produced supersymmetric particles give rise to neutralinos that decay in this way. However, since the search strategy is based on triggering on and reconstructing the decay products of individual long-lived particles, irrespective of the rest of the event, these limits can easily be reinterpreted in scenarios with different numbers of long-lived particles per event. The limits are presented as a function of neutralino lifetime, and for a range of squark and neutralino masses. © 2013 CERN.

The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.12fb<sup>-1</sup> of s=7TeV proton-proton collisions. The diphoton invariant mass (m<inf>γγ</inf>) spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model background. In the large extra dimension scenario of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, the results provide 95% CL lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale between 2.27 and 3.53 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used.

In the scenario of direct slepton production, if the sleptons decay directly into the lightest neutralino, left-handed slepton masses between 85 and 195 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a 20 GeV neutralino.

In a sample of lead-lead collisions at √sNN=2.76TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 7 μb<sup>-1</sup>, ATLAS has measured jets with a calorimeter system over the pseudorapidity interval |η|<2.1 and over the transverse momentum range 38<p<inf>T</inf><210GeV. Jets were reconstructed using the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm with values for the distance parameter that determines the nominal jet radius of R=0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. The centrality dependence of the jet yield is characterized by the jet "central-to-peripheral ratio," R<inf>CP</inf>. Jet production is found to be suppressed by approximately a factor of two in the 10% most central collisions relative to peripheral collisions. R<inf>CP</inf> varies smoothly with centrality as characterized by the number of participating nucleons. The observed suppression is only weakly dependent on jet radius and transverse momentum. These results provide the first direct measurement of inclusive jet suppression in heavy ion collisions and complement previous measurements of dijet transverse energy imbalance at the LHC. © 2013 CERN.

The search is based on 4.7 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp collisions at s=7TeV recorded in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Data are analyzed in the lepton+jets final state, characterized by a high-transverse-momentum isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum and at least three jets. The analysis strategy relies on the substantial boost of the W bosons in the t't̄' signal when mt'≳400GeV. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed and the result of the search is interpreted in the context of fourth-generation and vector-like quark models. Under the assumption of a branching ratio BR(t<sup>'</sup>→Wb)=1, a fourth-generation t<sup>'</sup> quark with mass lower than 656GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. In addition, in light of the recent discovery of a new boson of mass ~126GeV at the LHC, upper limits are derived in the two-dimensional plane of BR(t<sup>'</sup>→Wb) versus BR(t<sup>'</sup>→Ht), where H is the Standard Model Higgs boson, for vector-like quarks of various masses. © 2012 CERN.

84938558485	Search for FCNC single top-quark production at √s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	A search for the production of single top-quarks via flavour-changing neutral-currents is presented. Data collected with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of √s=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb<sup>-1</sup>, are used. Candidate events with a semileptonic top-quark decay signature are classified as signal- or background-like events by using several kinematic variables as input to a neural network. No signal is observed in the neural network output distribution and a Bayesian upper limit is placed on the production cross-section. The observed upper limit at 95% confidence level on the cross-section multiplied by the t→Wb branching fraction is measured to be σqg→t×B(t→Wb)<3.9 pb. This upper limit is converted using a model-independent approach into upper limits on the coupling strengths κ<inf>ugt</inf>/Λ<6.9{dot operator}10<sup>-3</sup> TeV<sup>-1</sup> and κ<inf>cgt</inf>/Λ<1.6{dot operator}10<sup>-2</sup> TeV<sup>-1</sup>, where Λ is the new physics scale, and on the branching fractions B(t→ug)<5.7{dot operator}10-5 and B(t→cg)<2.7{dot operator}10-4. © 2012 CERN.

No excess of events was observed above the Standard Model prediction and model-dependent 95% confidence level exclusion limits are set. In the context of a generalised model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking with a bino-like lightest neutralino of mass above 50 GeV, gluinos (squarks) below 1.07 TeV (0.87 TeV) are excluded, while a breaking scale Λ below 196 TeV is excluded for a minimal model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. For a specific model with one universal extra dimension, compactification scales 1/R<1.40 TeV are excluded. These limits provide the most stringent tests of these models to date. © 2012 CERN.

The Higgs boson mass ranges 112.9-115.5 GeV, 131-238 GeV and 251-466 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level (CL), while the range 124-519 GeV is expected to be excluded in the absence of a signal.

84938558499	Evidence for the associated production of a W boson and a top quark in ATLAS at √s = 7 TeV	This Letter presents evidence for the associated production of a W boson and a top quark using 2.05 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp collision data at s=7TeV accumulated with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The analysis is based on the selection of the dileptonic final states with events featuring two isolated leptons, electron or muon, with significant transverse missing momentum and at least one jet. An approach based on boosted decision trees has been developed to improve the discrimination of single top-quark Wt events from background. A template fit to the final classifier distributions is performed to determine the cross-section. The result is incompatible with the background-only hypothesis at the 3.3σ level, the expected sensitivity assuming the Standard Model production rate being 3.4σ. The corresponding cross-section is determined and found to be σ<inf>Wt</inf>=16.8±2.9(stat)±4.9(syst)pb, in good agreement with the Standard Model expectation. From this result the CKM matrix element |Vtb|=1.03-0.19+0.16 is derived assuming that the Wt production through |V<inf>ts</inf>| and |V<inf>td</inf>| is small. © 2012 CERN.

84925725354	Search for strong production of supersymmetric particles in final states with missing transverse momentum and at least three b-jets at √s = 8 TeV proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector	This paper reports the results of a search for strong production of supersymmetric particles in 20.1 fb <sup>-1</sup> of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the LHC.

These measurements are obtained using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.5 fb<sup>−1</sup>, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011. The data are corrected for detector effects so that cross-sections are presented at the particle level. Cross-sections are measured up to 5TeV dijet mass using jets reconstructed with the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm for values of the jet radius parameter of 0.4 and 0.6. The cross-sections are compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations by NLOJet++ corrected to account for non-perturbative effects. Comparisons with POWHEG predictions, using a next-to-leading-order matrix element calculation interfaced to a partonshower Monte Carlo simulation, are also shown. Electroweak effects are accounted for in both cases. The quantitative comparison of data and theoretical predictions obtained using various parameterizations of the parton distribution functions is performed using a frequentist method. In general, good agreement with data is observed for the NLOJet++ theoretical predictions when using the CT10, NNPDF2.1 and MSTW 2008 PDF sets. Disagreement is observed when using the ABM11 and HERAPDF1.5 PDF sets for some ranges of dijet mass and half the rapidity separation. An example setting a lower limit on the compositeness scale for a model of contact interactions is presented, showing that the unfolded results can be used to constrain contributions to dijet production beyond that predicted by the Standard Model.

Multijet distributions corresponding to (4N-4) variables that span the N-body parameter space are found to be well described by the QCD calculations for inclusive three-jet, four-jet, and five-jet events. The agreement between data, QCD matrix element calculations, and QCD parton shower Monte Carlo predictions suggests that 2→2 scattering plus gluon radiation provides a good first approximation to the full LO QCD matrix element for events with three, four, or even five jets in the final state. © 1996 The American Physical Society.

In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium.© 2010 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

Results on the detector operation, timing performance, electronics noise, and gain stability are presented. High energy deposits from radiative cosmic muons and beam splash events allow to check the intrinsic constant term of the energy resolution. The uniformity of the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter response along η (averaged over Φ) is measured at the percent level using minimum ionizing cosmic muons. Finally, studies of electromagnetic showers from radiative muons have been used to cross-check the Monte Carlo simulation.

84862275706	Rapidity gap cross sections measured with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √s =7 TeV	Pseudorapidity gap distributions in proton-proton collisions at √s = 7 TeV are studied using a minimum bias data sample with an integrated luminosity of 7.1 μb<sup>−1</sup>. Cross sections are measured differentially in terms of Δη<sup>F</sup>, the larger of the pseudorapidity regions extending to the limits of the ATLAS sensitivity, at η = ±4.9, in which no final state particles are produced above a transverse momentum threshold p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf>. The measurements span the region 0 < Δη<sup>F</sup> < 8 for 200 MeV < p<sup>cut</sup><inf>T</inf> < 800 MeV. At small Δη<sup>F</sup>, the data test the reliability of hadronisation models in describing rapidity and transverse momentum fluctuations in final state particle production. The measurements at larger gap sizes are dominated by contributions from the single diffractive dissociation process (pp →Xp), enhanced by double dissociation (pp → XY) where the invariant mass of the lighter of the two dissociation systems satisfies M<inf>Y</inf> < 7 GeV. The resulting cross section is dσ/dΔη<sup>F</sup> ≈1 mb for Δη<sup>F</sup> > 3. The large rapidity gap data are used to constrain the value of the Pomeron intercept appropriate to triple Regge models of soft diffraction. The cross section integrated over all gap sizes is compared with other LHC inelastic cross section measurements.

The observed distributions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and multiplicity are corrected to hadron level in a model-independent way within well-defined phase-space regions. The distribution of the production ratio of Λ̄ to Λ baryons is also measured. The results are compared with various Monte Carlo simulation models. Although most of these models agree with data to within 15% in the KS0 distributions, substantial disagreements are found in the Λ distributions of transverse momentum. © 2012 CERN.

84863116044	A study of the material in the ATLAS inner detector using secondary hadronic interactions	The ATLAS inner detector is used to reconstruct secondary vertices due to hadronic interactions of primary collision products, so probing the location and amount of material in the inner region of ATLAS. Data collected in 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC, with a minimum bias trigger, are used for comparisons with simulated events. The reconstructed secondary vertices have spatial resolutions ranging from ∼ 200μm to 1 mm. The overall material description in the simulation is validated to within an experimental uncertainty of about 7%.

Events are selected with a single lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum and at least four jets of which at least one jet is identified as coming from a b-quark. A kinematic fit is used to reconstruct the tt event topology. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The measured value of AC is AC =−0.019±0.028 (stat.)±0.024 (syst.), consistent with the prediction from the MC@NLO Monte Carlo generator of AC = 0.006±0.002.

The tt events are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two identified b-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central rapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto is presented as a function of this threshold for four different central rapidity interval definitions. An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each rapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are corrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models implemented in MC@NLO, POWHEG, ALPGEN and SHERPA. The experimental uncertainties are often smaller than the spread of theoretical predictions, allowing deviations between data and theory to be observed in some regions of phase space.

Light scalar top quarks are searched for in events with two opposite-sign leptons (e, μ), large missing transverse momentum and at least one jet in the final state. No excess over Standard Model expectations is found, and the results are interpreted under the assumption that the light scalar top decays to a b-quark in addition to an on-shell chargino whose decay occurs through a virtual W boson. If the chargino mass is 106 GeV, light scalar top-quark masses up to 130 GeV are excluded for neutralino masses below 70 GeV.

A specific benchmark model is considered where all the fermion couplings to the Higgs boson are set to zero and the bosonic couplings are kept at the Standard Model values (fermiophobic Higgs model).

No deviation from the standard model expectation is observed in 4.5 fb<sup>-1</sup> (20.3 fb<sup>-1</sup>) of 7 (8) TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment. Assuming the standard model rate for ZH production, an upper limit of 75%, at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio to invisible-particle decay modes of the Higgs boson at a mass of 125.5 GeV. The limit on the branching ratio is also interpreted in terms of an upper limit on the allowed dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section within a Higgs-portal dark matter scenario. Within the constraints of such a scenario, the results presented in this Letter provide the strongest available limits for low-mass dark matter candidates. Limits are also set on an additional neutral Higgs boson, in the mass range 110 <mH <400 GeV, produced in association with a Z boson and decaying to invisible particles.

Fourteen correlators are measured using a standard event-plane method and a scalar-product method, and the latter method is found to give a systematically larger correlation signal. Several different trends in the centrality dependence of these correlators are observed. These trends are not reproduced by predictions based on the Glauber model, which includes only the correlations from the collision geometry in the initial state. Calculations that include the final-state collective dynamics are able to describe qualitatively, and in some cases also quantitatively, the centrality dependence of the measured correlators. These observations suggest that both the fluctuations in the initial geometry and the nonlinear mixing between different harmonics in the final state are important for creating these correlations in momentum space. © 2014 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

84914140238	Search for long-lived neutral particles decaying into lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at √s= 8TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict neutral particles that decay into final states consisting of collimated jets of light leptons and hadrons (so-called “lepton jets”). These particles can also be long-lived with decay length comparable to, or even larger than, the LHC detectors’ linear dimensions. This paper presents the results of a search for lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of √s= 8TeV in a sample of 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> collected during 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Limits on models predicting Higgs boson decays to neutral long-lived lepton jets are derived as a function of the particle’s proper decay length.

84914179451	Search for top squark pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum in (Formula presented.)= 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	The results of a search for top squark (stop) pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum are reported. The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb<sup>−1</sup>. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is taken to be the lightest neutralino which only interacts weakly and is assumed to be stable. The stop decay modes considered are those to a top quark and the LSP as well as to a bottom quark and the lightest chargino, where the chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a W boson. A wide range of scenarios with different mass splittings between the stop, the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are considered, including cases where the W bosons or the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and neutralinos are addressed using a set of phenomenological models of supersymmetry. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. A stop with a mass between 210 and 640 GeV decaying directly to a top quark and a massless LSP is excluded at 95% confidence level, and in models where the mass of the lightest chargino is twice that of the LSP, stops are excluded at 95% confidence level up to a mass of 500 GeV for an LSP mass in the range of 100 to 150 GeV. Stringent exclusion limits are also derived for all other stop decay modes considered, and model-independent upper limits are set on the visible cross-section for processes beyond the Standard Model.

Differential cross sections for the tq and t¯q processes are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute value of the rapidity of t and t¯, respectively. The analyzed data set was recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59fb-1. Selected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets. The cross sections are measured by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the output distributions of neural networks. The resulting measurements are σ(tq)=46±1(stat)±6(syst)pb, σ(t¯q)=23±1(stat)±3(syst)pb, Rt=2.04±0.13(stat)±0.12(syst), and σ(tq+t¯q)=68±2(stat)±8(syst)pb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The uncertainty on the measured cross sections is dominated by systematic uncertainties, while the uncertainty on Rt is mainly statistical. Using the ratio of σ(tq+t¯q) to its theoretical prediction, and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |Vtb|蠑|Vts|,|Vtd|, we determine |Vtb|=1.02±0.07.

84919401685	Search for nonpointing and delayed photons in the diphoton and missing transverse momentum final state in 8 TeV pp collisions at the LHC using the ATLAS detector search for nonpointing and delayed photons in ... G. Aad et al.	A search has been performed, using the full 20.3fb-1 data sample of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, for photons originating from a displaced vertex due to the decay of a neutral long-lived particle into a photon and an invisible particle. The analysis investigates the diphoton plus missing transverse momentum final state, and is therefore most sensitive to pair production of long-lived particles. The analysis technique exploits the capabilities of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter to make precise measurements of the flight direction, as well as the time of flight, of photons. No excess is observed over the Standard Model predictions for background. Exclusion limits are set within the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models, with the lightest neutralino being the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle and decaying into a photon and gravitino with a lifetime in the range from 250 ps to about 100 ns.

84920136557	Measurement of the muon reconstruction performance of the ATLAS detector using 2011 and 2012 LHC proton–proton collision data	This paper presents the performance of the ATLAS muon reconstruction during the LHC run with pp collisions at √s=7–8 TeV in 2011–2012, focusing mainly on data collected in 2012. Measurements of the reconstruction efficiency and of the momentum scale and resolution, based on large reference samples of (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) decays, are presented and compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Corrections to the simulation, to be used in physics analysis, are provided. Over most of the covered phase space (muon (Formula presented.) GeV) the efficiency is above 99% and is measured with per-mille precision. The momentum resolution ranges from 1.7% at central rapidity and for transverse momentum (Formula presented.) GeV, to (Formula presented.) at large rapidity and (Formula presented.) GeV. The momentum scale is known with an uncertainty of 0.05% to 0.2% depending on rapidity. A method for the recovery of final state radiation from the muons is also presented.

84920268886	Measurement of distributions sensitive to the underlying event in inclusive Z-boson production in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	A measurement of charged-particle distributions sensitive to the properties of the underlying event is presented for an inclusive sample of events containing a Z-boson, decaying to an electron or muon pair. The measurement is based on data collected using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb-1. Distributions of the charged particle multiplicity and of the charged particle transverse momentum are measured in regions of azimuthal angle defined with respect to the Z-boson direction. The measured distributions are compared to similar distributions measured in jet events, and to the predictions of various Monte Carlo generators implementing different underlying event models.

84919880597	Measurement of the (Math presented.) and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector	The inclusive top quark pair (Formula presented.) pair in the final state. The measurement was performed with the 2011 7 TeV dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 (Formula presented.)-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated systematic uncertainties. The cross-section was measured to be: (Formula presented.)where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, knowledge of the integrated luminosity and of the LHC beam energy. The results are consistent with recent theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. Fiducial measurements corresponding to the experimental acceptance of the leptons are also reported, together with the ratio of cross-sections measured at the two centre-of-mass energies. The inclusive cross-section results were used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the theoretically predicted cross-section on (Formula presented.) GeV. By looking for an excess of (Formula presented.) production with respect to the QCD prediction, the results were also used to place limits on the pair-production of supersymmetric top squarks (Formula presented.) with masses close to the top quark mass, decaying via (Formula presented.) to predominantly right-handed top quarks and a light neutralino (Formula presented.), the lightest supersymmetric particle. Top squarks with masses between the top quark mass and 177 GeV are excluded at the 95 % confidence level.

84919918864	Electron and photon energy calibration with the ATLAS detector using LHC Run 1 data	This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration achieved with the ATLAS detector using about 25 fb-1 of LHC proton–proton collision data taken at centre-of-mass energies of (Equation Present) and 8 TeV. The reconstruction of electron and photon energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms. The response of the calorimeter layers is equalised in data and simulation, and the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic showers is exploited to estimate the passive material in front of the calorimeter and reoptimise the detector simulation. After all corrections, the Z resonance is used to set the absolute energy scale. For electrons from Z decays, the achieved calibration is typically accurate to 0.05 % in most of the detector acceptance, rising to 0.2 % in regions with large amounts of passive material. The remaining inaccuracy is less than 0.2–1 % for electrons with a transverse energy of 10 GeV, and is on average 0.3 % for photons. The detector resolution is determined with a relative inaccuracy of less than 10 % for electrons and photons up to 60 GeV transverse energy, rising to 40 % for transverse energies above 500 GeV.

0542440981	Jet pseudorapidity distribution in direct photon events in pp̄ collisions at √s=1.8 TeV	We present the first measurement of the jet pseudorapidity distribution in direct photon events from a sample of pp̄ collisions at √s= 1.8 TeV, recorded with the Collider Detector at Fermilab. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that these events are primarily from hard quark-gluon Compton scattering, qg→qγ, with the final state quark producing the jet of hadrons. The jet pseudorapidity distribution in this model is sensitive to parton momentum fractions between 0.015 and 0.15. We find that the shape of the measured pseudorapidity distribution agrees well with next-to-leading order QCD calculations.

84924040652	Search for supersymmetry in events with four or more leptons in s =8TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	Results from a search for supersymmetry in events with four or more leptons including electrons, muons and taus are presented. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to 20.3fb-1 of proton-proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider at s=8TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector. Signal regions are designed to target supersymmetric scenarios that can be either enriched in or depleted of events involving the production of a Z boson. No significant deviations are observed in data from standard model predictions and results are used to set upper limits on the event yields from processes beyond the standard model. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles are obtained. In R-parity-violating simplified models with decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle to electrons and muons, limits of 1350 and 750 GeV are placed on gluino and chargino masses, respectively. In R-parity-conserving simplified models with heavy neutralinos decaying to a massless lightest supersymmetric particle, heavy neutralino masses up to 620 GeV are excluded. Limits are also placed on other supersymmetric scenarios.

84924420466	Measurement of differential production cross-sections for a Z boson in association with b-jets in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: Measurements of differential production cross-sections of a Z boson in association with b-jets in pp collisions at √ = 7 TeV are reported. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb<sup>−1</sup> recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Particle-level cross-sections are determined for events with a Z boson decaying into an electron or muon pair, and containing b-jets. For events with at least one b-jet, the cross-section is presented as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum and rapidity, together with the inclusive b-jet cross-section as a function of b-jet transverse momentum, rapidity and angular separations between the b-jet and the Z boson. For events with at least two b-jets, the cross-section is determined as a function of the invariant mass and angular separation of the two highest transverse momentum b-jets, and as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum and rapidity. Results are compared to leading-order and next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.

84925620206	Search for pair and single production of new heavy quarks that decay to a Z boson and a third-generation quark in pp collisions at (Formula presented.) TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: A search is presented for the production of new heavy quarks that decay to a Z boson and a third-generation Standard Model quark. In the case of a new charge +2/3 quark (T ), the decay targeted is T → Zt, while the decay targeted for a new charge −1/3 quark (B) is B → Zb. The search is performed with a dataset corresponding to 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of pp collisions at (Formula presented.) TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Selected events contain a high transverse momentum Z boson candidate reconstructed from a pair of oppositely charged same-flavor leptons (electrons or muons), and are analyzed in two channels defined by the absence or presence of a third lepton. Hadronic jets, in particular those with properties consistent with the decay of a b-hadron, are also required to be present in selected events. Different requirements are made on the jet activity in the event in order to enhance the sensitivity to either heavy quark pair production mediated by the strong interaction, or single production mediated by the electroweak interaction. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and lower limits are derived on the mass of vector-like T and B quarks under various branching ratio hypotheses, as well as upper limits on the magnitude of electroweak coupling parameters.
