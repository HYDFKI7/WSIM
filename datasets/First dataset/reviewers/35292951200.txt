8844254026	Study on continuous cooling transformation and hot rolled dual-phase treatment for 09CuPCrNiMoNb weathering steel	The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of austenite undeformed and deformed were constructed by means of a combined method of dilatometry and metallography for 09CuPCrNiMoNb weathering steel. The CCT diagram of deformed austenite is characterized by a bay between the ferrite-pearlite transformation and the bainitic transformation, but this bay is of the half-open-window type. At the other hand, the ferrite transformation range is very wide, which provides a wide velocity window. Both the special features of the deformed austenite CCT diagram provide a basic condition for production of hot-rolled dual phase steel. Based on the CCT diagram of deformed austenite of experiment steel, the technology of hot rolled dual-phase treatment was established and simulated on a thermal simulation testing machine. Dual-phase microstructure of ferrite and martensite with some bainite phase was obtained.

29144438484	Continuous cooling transformation of deformed austenite in weathering steel	The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of deformed and undeformed austenite of weathering steel were constructed by means of a combined method of dilatometry and metallography. In the CCT diagram of deformed austenite, the transformation zone of ferrite is very wide, which provides a wide "velocity window".

Additionally, the transformation zone of bainite is sealed up at the right side. All these special features of the deformed austenite CCT diagram provide a basic condition for production of hot-rolled dual phase steel.

The diagram exhibits an elongated polygonal ferrite C-curve with a delayed pearlite start and a metastable austenite gap between the polygonal ferrite and pearlite regions and between the ferrite and bainite regions. For this experimental steel, it is possible to obtain a dual-phase microstructure directly by hot rolling and appropriate cooling. Based on the diagram, the technical process of a hot-rolled dual-phase treatment was established and simulated using a thermal simulation testing machine.

33748989798	Mechanism of cracking resistance of hardfacing specimens of steel 5CrNiMo improved by rare earth oxide	The cracking morphology of the hardfacing specimens taken from steel 5CrNiMo was observed. Meanwhile, the residual stress fields were measured and simulated. Based on experiment mentioned above, the improved structure and modified inclusion in hardfacing Metal with rare earth (RE) oxide were analyzed. The results show that, the hardfacing crack is initiated from the coarse dendritic crystal grain boundary, inclusions and coarse austenite grain boundary in the HAZ and propagated by the residual stress existing in the center of the hardfacing Metal and HAZ. The primary columnar grain structure can be refined by adding RE oxide in the coating of the electrode. The inclusion in the hardfacing Metal can be modified as well. Meanwhile, if the martensite transformation temperature is decreased, the largest value of the residual tensile stress in the dangerous region can be reduced.

33747380557	Numerical simulation of temperature field and stress field of medium carbon steel before and after hardfacing	The residual stress field of hot roller steel 60Cr-MnMo after hardfacing was measured by using X-ray stress analysis. From temperature simulation results, the temperature distribution of specimen and temperature curve at different location of the specimen at different time can be obtained, which can represent the whole process of temperature variation during hardfacing. When the hard-facing time is 16 sec, the temperature at different location of the specimen is very different. When hardfacing process is finished, the heat spread quickly to other directions. Up to 180 sec, the temperature is similar to each other between center and surface of the specimen, the temperature distribution of the whole specimen is uniform. The highest temperature appears near the lower surface. Comparison between the simulated results of the residual stress fields with measured ones shows that there is a good agreement with each other, which proves this model is effective. According to this model, the stresses at different time during cooling after hardfacing was simulated too by using the temperature field mentioned above. The results show that the tensile stress at the dangerous location appears at the interface, change of stress between the mutation is great.

33750829211	Effect of hot deformation on phase transformation kinetics of 86CrMoV7 steel	The time-temperature-transformation (TTT) and continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of 86CrMoV7 steel with and without hot deformation were constructed by means of dilatometry, metallography and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that the pearlite and bainite transformations of 86CrMoV7 steel can be promoted and the microstructure can be refined by hot deformation. The undissolved carbides associated with hot deformation increase the inhomogeneity of carbon distribution in deformed austenite. The inhomogeneities of the austenite increase the number of nucleation sites for pearlite and bainite, and promote pearlite and bainite formation, which result in refinement of both the pearlite and bainite microstructures. In contrast, the undissolved carbides do not play a direct role on the pearlite and bainite transformation of 86CrMoV7 steel in the absence of hot deformation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The composite was PEEK 19.63wt%, stainless steel fiber 7.57 wt%, carbon fiber 10.97 wt%, cashew 6.51 wt% and fillers 55.33%. The molding process was blending for about 30 seconds at higher speed, pre-heating at the temperature of 80°C for 30min, molding at 320°C and pressure 35Mpa for 3min/mm, then post-curing at the temperature of 80°C for 30min, 150°C for30min, 270°C for 30min, 320°C for 180min.

The SEM morphology study showed that the wear mechanism was particle abrasion at low temperature but adherence abrasion as well as particle abrasion occurred at higher temperature. The cohesive strength of the composite and the heat-resistant property of resin matrix were the key factors affected wear loss. The abrasion depended on the strength of transformed films and matrix.

Meanwhile, by using the finite element method (FEM), it was simulated to be based on the stress-strain curves of single-phase martensite and ferrite steels; then the measured result was compared with the simulated one. Effective factors such as the volume fraction of martensite and the yield stress ratio between martensite and ferrite in duplex weathering steel are discussed in this work.

The friction and wear mechanism was analyzed through observing the worn surface morphology by scanning electron microscope (SEM) at different temperatures, and is further confirmed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectrometry (IR) analysis. The results showed that the developed materials have stable friction coefficients and lower wear ratio. The wear mechanism is that the particle abrasion occurs at low-temperature, the adherence abrasion and particle abrasion take place at the temperature between 200 and 350 °C. The transferred layer is formed, and big debris particles of lath-shape and sheet-shape are found on the worn surface. The thermal degradation of the PEEK does not occur until its temperature rises to higher than 350 °C. The stainless steel and carbon fibers bind strongly with the matrix and have good abrasive resistance, improving stability of the friction coefficients of the materials. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that the microstructure of the strip is characterized by full recrystallized ferrite, of about 30 μm in grain size, and small amount of pearlite. Compared with the strip produced by conventional austenite rolling, the yield strength of the ferrite rolled strip was lower by about 20%, with same elongation and strain hardening exponent. The plastic strain ratios were 0.76, 0.35 and 0.70 in transverse direction, longitudinal direction, and 45° direction respectively. The dynamic strain aging of low carbon steel is the main reason of low plastic strain ratios value of the ferrite rolled strip.

The results show that a high weldability of the X120 pipeline steel can be exhibited after once welding thermal cycle. When the welding line energy is 40 kJ/ cm, the high impact toughness and rigidity in the CGHAZ (coarse grain heat affected zone) can be obtained. During double-face welding, when the reheating peak temperature of twice welding thermal cycle is 1200 °C the microstructure of HAZ is composed of the lath martensite and granular bainite, and the austenite grain is refined, so the comprehensive mechanical properties at HAZ can be obtained. When the reheating peak temperature of twice welding thermal cycle is 800 °C which is at the α-γ two phase region, or 1000 °C which is higher than that at α-γ two phases region, local brittle zone can be found in the CGHAZ after twice welding thermal cycle. When the peak temperature is 800 °C the reason for the embrittlement of HAZ is the net microstructure formed in grain boundary. When the peak temperature is 1000 °C the embrittlement reason is the large M/A islands in granular bainite obtained during the cooling process.

The results showed that the PEEK composites exhibited stable friction coefficient and lower wear ratio. The wear mechanism is that the particle abrasion occurs at low temperature, the adherence abrasion and particle abrasion take place at the temperature between 200-350°C as revealed through wear morphology and wear debris analysis. The thermal degradation of PEEK does not occur until its temperature rises to higher than 350°. The stainless steel and carbon fibres bind strongly with the matrix PEEK and may be responsible for improving stability of the friction coefficients of the materials. Surface film, transition layer and matrix composed the superficial structure of friction material after wear test. Two kinds of surface film structures are formed; one is cystiform microstructure with PEEK matrix surrounded by single or multicrystal powder of fillers; the other is meshwork generated by resin base and friction fillings.

For five of the steels (B, C, D, E and F), since there is a metastable austenite gap completely open or half-open between the ferrite and the bainite transformation regions, it is possible to obtain dual-phase microstructure directly by hot-rolling and appropriate cooling. Hot deformation increased the transformation start temperature Ar3 significantly, enlarged the polygonal ferrite transformation temperature range, and shortened the gestation period of pearlite and polygonal ferrite transformation. Mo effectively retards the bainite and the pearlite transformations, elevates the pearlite-finish temperature, and induces the metastable austenite gap formed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The low-angle grain boundary exhibits an effect on dislocation motion, however, no significant effect on crack propagation is observed. The massive ferrite and non-equiaxial ferrite transformed by massive transformation mechanism in acicular ferrite microstructure make pipeline steel have high toughness.

The results indicate that the optimal contents of alloying elements in welding wires can improve the low-temperature impact toughness of weld metals because the proeutectoid ferrite and bainite formations can be suppressed, and the fraction of acicular ferrite increases. However, the contents of alloying elements need to vary along with the welding heat input. With the increase in welding heat input, the contents of alloying elements in welding wires need to be increased accordingly. The microstructures mainly consisting of acicular ferrite can be obtained in weld metals after four-wire submerged arc welding using the wires with a low carbon content and appropriate contents of Mn, Mo, Ti-B, Cu, Ni, and RE, resulting in the high low-temperature impact toughness of weld metals. © 2009 University of Science and Techonogy Beijing.

Especially, the shaft lining's additional strain in failure and during formation grouting period was obtained, which points out the curve characters before fracture, in failure, after fracture, in process of formation grouting, in grouting rest and after grouting. Through the comparison analysis of the data it has found that the shaft lining will fracture at strain accumulated to a certain degree when the formation consolidates. The shaft lining's fracture makes the strain weak, and the formation grouting makes the shaft lining's strain to the full extent. The in-site monitoring data has indicated that the exiting additional force induces the fracture of shaft lining and also showed that the formation grouting in the surrounding soil can make the shaft lining safer. The strain characters and the results are useful for the shaft lining's fracture forecast. © 2009.

72649087234	Effects of contents of Nb and C on hot deformation behaviors of high Nb X80 pipeline steels	The behavior of the flow deformation and the effects of contents of Nb and C on deformation behaviors of high Nb X80 pipeline steels during hot compression deformation were studied by thermal simulation test. The content of solid solution Nb was quantificationally studied during the reheating and hot deformation process, and the effects of change of solid solution Nb in steels on hot deformation behaviors were discussed. The results show that the contents of Nb and C have great effects on the flow stress behaviors of high Nb X80 pipeline steels. When the C content in steels is constant, the recrystallization activation energy increases from 387 to 481 kJ/mol with increasing the Nb from 0.082% to 0.13% (mass fraction). However, the effect of Nb is correlative to the C content, i.e. w(Nb)/w(C). When w(Nb)/w(C) decreases from 3.61 to 2.18, the recrystallization activation energy decreases from 481 to 434 kJ/mol. © 2009 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

74049098975	Influence of thermal cycle on impact toughness of HAZ of high-Nb pipeline steel	The effects of welding thermal cycle on impact toughness of coarse grain heat affected zone(HAZ)of two kinds X80 pipeline steels, namely Mn-Mo-Nb steel and high-Nb HTP pipeline steels, were investigated by means of welding thermal simulation on Gleeble-3500 simulator. The results show that the impact toughness of HAZ of two kind pipeline steels decreases with welding line energy increase. While at same welding line energy, the impact toughness of HAZ of high-Nb steel is higher than that of Mn-Mo-Nb steel. The reason is that some undissolved Nb( CN)particles in high-Nb restrain the austenite grain growth,which ensures that the small and uniform austenite grain size can be obtained at higher welding line energy.

78650178834	Investigation on cracking mechanism of austenite stainless steel during in situ tension in transmission electron microscope	Twin-roll strip casting technology is a new one to produce austenite stainless steel strip directly. However, during this process, the cracking occurs usually on the surface of the steel strip. The technique of in situ tension in transmission electron microscope was used to observe and analyze the crack initiation and propagation in austenite stainless steel produced by twin-roll strip casting technology in this work. The results show that the crack initiates in dislocation free-zone firstly and then propagates along the direction vertical to the tensile force. The crack may propagate in continuous propagation way and discontinuous one respectively. When the shear stress on the close-packing face and the normal stress on the secondary close-packing face are at the same side of the tensile force, the cracks propagate continuously. However, when the shear stress on the close-packing face and the normal stress on the secondary close-packing face are in two sides, the cracks propagate discontinuously. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sequentially, the PTT diagrams were obtained, and static recrystallization activation energy was calculated. Furthermore, the effects of Nb and C content on strain-induced NbC precipitation and static recrystallization were discussed. The results confirm the faster kinetics of precipitation and its retarded recrystallization in the case of higher Nb pipeline steel, and that the recrystallization is easier in low Nb pipeline steel in comparison to the case of high Nb steel. However, the effects of Nb on strain-induced precipitation and static recrystallization were associated with the Nb/C ratio. The precipitation start time (Ps) of strain-induced NbC is delayed in lower Nb/C ratio pipeline steel. It is suggested that the reduced supersaturation of Nb can result in the delay of precipitation of strain-induced NbC carbides forming in the low Nb/C ratio steel.

The complex phase transformations were treated by analyzing the expansion coefficient evolution of steel 40Cr and the finite element method (FEM) was used to build the thermal-elastic-plastic simulation model based on ANSYS software. Then the internal stress fields of steel 40Cr during the quenching process were simulated. The mechanical parameters used in internal stress numerical simulation were measured by using a Gleeble-3500 thermal/mechanical simulator (DSI, Poestenkill, NY). The residual internal stress field of the oil-quenched specimen was measured by using an X-305A X-ray stress analyzer. The simulated behaviors fit well with the experimental data, which indicates that the model is practical to be used in the simulation of quenched specimens and helpful to understand the evolution of the internal stress during quenching process.

In this work, a thermal/mechanical simulator was used in conjunction with the Anand model to obtain the stress-strain curves for a high chromium steel associated with different temperature/strain rate pairs. The finite element software, ANSYS, was used to simulate the stress-strain behavior of a high chromium steel during casting at the strain rates of 1, 0.1, and 0.01 1/s, and to validate the Anand model. The results show that the high-temperature deformation is mainly plastic and the von Mises stresses are small, the stresses introduced at elevated temperatures have little effect on the residual stress fields, and the simulation of the mechanical behavior of steels using an elastic-plastic model at low temperatures during cooling is acceptable. © ASM International.

Then, its continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram was determined with Gleeble-3500 thermo-mechanical simulator. Furthermore, the effects of heat treatment technology on its microstructure and mechanical property were investigated, and the technology parameters of the heat treatment were optimized. The results show that the acicular ferrite and/or bainite transformations are promoted, the polygonal ferrite and pearlite transformation are restrained, because proper amount of alloying elements were added into the new steel. Therefore, the strength of this new steel is improved markedly, even if the cooling rate is lower, which ensure the higher strength distribution along cross section of the heavy wall thickness.

82255192451	Quantitative research on effects of Nb on hot deformation behaviors of high-Nb microalloyed steels	The hot deformation behaviors of six high-Nb steels were investigated by hot compression methods on a Gleeble-3500 thermo-mechanical simulator. The amount of Nb in solution and/or in precipitates of the specimens deformed at different conditions was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The effects of dissolved Nb and precipitates on hot deformation behavior were discussed. The results show that Nb cannot be completely dissolved in the high-Nb steels during the reheating process, and the undissolved precipitates do not influence the dynamic recrystallization due to their larger size. Moreover, the undissolved precipitates more effectively influence the peak stress instead of peak strain. Strain induced precipitation occurs during the hot deformation process. However, the precipitates cannot delay the dynamic recrystallization because of the longer induction period. The deformation activation energy presents a perfect linear correlation as a function of the amount of Nb in solutions, and each addition of Nb by 1 wt% would lead to an increase of the deformation activation energy by 1599.9 ± 137.7 kJ/mol. © 2011.

The results show that Nb cannot completely dissolve during the reheating processes in the high Nb steels. The undissolved precipitates act as heterogenous nucleation sites for the precipitates induced by the strain, and prolong the strain-induced precipitation start time shown in the stress relaxation curves. The strain-induced precipitation start time is linearly related to the content of supersaturated Nb (the difference between dissolved Nb content after soaking and dissolved Nb content in equilibrium at corresponding deformation temperature). Increasing the content of supersaturated Nb can shift the nose of the precipitation C-curve to shorter time and higher temperatures. The effect of content of supersaturated Nb on precipitation increases along with the decrease of temperature. The softening ratio is linear with dissolved Nb content before the strain-induced precipitation and with precipitable Nb content after the strain-induced precipitation. The precipitates induced by strain have more strong retarding effect on the static recrystallization than the solid solution of Nb atoms. However, with the increase of the average precipitate radius, the retarding effect of precipitate rapidly decreases. © 2012.

The result shows that the impact toughness of CGHAZ of all kinds of pipeline steels decrease with the increase of welding input energy. While, under the same welding input energy, the values of impact toughness of CGHAZ of high-Nb steels are higher than that of conventional Mn-Mo-Nb steels. By increasing the amount of alloyed elements, the embrittlement inclining of CGHAZ is weakened, and the highest value of impact toughness of CGHAZ can be obtained at higher welding input energy. The austenite grain growth was restrained by some undissolved NbC particles remained in high-Nb steels, which ensures small and uniform austenite grain, furthermore, the higher impact toughness was obtained.

However, Nb can be presented either as solute in solution, where it is thought to exhibit a strong solute drag effect, or as NbC precipitates, which are thought to be effective at pinning grain boundaries. Therefore, it is very important to quantitatively measure Nb in solution or in NbC precipitates. A quantitative analysis method of Nb in solution and in precipitates was proposed. The test procedure involved chemical dissolution, filtration and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopic (ICP-AES) analysis. The amount of Nb in solution in Nb-microallyed steels under different treatment conditions was evaluated. The results show that the niobium and carbon contents in steels have a great effect on niobium dissolution kinetics. The solute Nb is more effective to retard dynamic recrystallization, while the NbC precipitates are more effective to inhibit static recrystallization.

The results show that the chemical compositions and welding process parameters have significant effects on the microstructure and properties of HAZ. With increase of the cooling rate, the amount of microstructure transformed at lower temperature increases, and the microstructure becomes finer, furthermore, the strength and toughness of HAZ show a rising trend. Within the range of the peak temperature from 600 to 1350. °C, there are two brittle zones and one major strength weakening zone in HAZ, especially for high-Nb added Cr steel, weaken of HAZ is very serious. Effects of the key chemical elements such as Mo, Cr and Nb on microstructure transformation of HAZ have been discussed. Although these three alloy system steels in this work display good weldability, the Mn-Mo-Nb and/or Mn-Cr-Mo-Nb steels show better combination of strength and toughness of HAZ compared with the Mn-Cr-Nb steels. Therefore, for high-Nb steels, it is necessary to add suitably Mo to improve the toughness and strength of HAZ, especially, increase the strength. © 2013.

The results show the grain size decreases remarkably with the decrease of the deformation temperature. The deformation temperature and spinning temperature have a little effect on the amount of ferrite and hardness; however, the volume temperature and cooling rate have a great effect on the amount of ferrite and hardness. With the increase of spinning temperature, volume temperature and cooling rate, the amount of ferrite increase and hardness decrease. However, with the increase of deformation temperature, the amount of ferrite and hardness decreased because of coarsened microstructure. Based on the results, a relationship between processing parameters and amount of ferrite and hardness was established.

84888079352	Investigation on grain refinement and precipitation strengthening applied in high speed wire rod containing vanadium	To obtain necessary information for the simulation of high speed wire production process, the effect of grain refinement and precipitation strengthening on two high speed wire rod steels with different vanadium and nitrogen contents was investigated by continuous cooling transformation (CCT) characteristics. CCT curves were constructed by the dilatometer test and microscopic observation. Results showed that the formation of intra-granular ferrite (IGF) could refine grain remarkably and accelerate the ferrite transformation. Schedules for high speed wire production process focused on the effect of cooling rate. Ferrite grain was refined by increasing cooling rate and the formation of IGF. The microhardness calculation revealed that the steels were strengthened mostly by a combined effect of grain refinement and precipitation hardening. Degenerated pearlite was observed at lower transformation temperature and the fracture morphology changed from cementite lamellar to nanoscale cementite particle with increasing cooling rate. Based on the analysis above, an optimal schedule was applied and the microstructure and microhardness were improved. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84889690079	Compressive properties of closed-cell aluminum foams with different contents of ceramic microspheres	In this paper, closed-cell aluminum foams with different kinds and contents of ceramic microspheres are obtained using melt-foaming method. The distribution and the effects of the ceramic microspheres on the mechanical properties of aluminum foams are investigated. The results show that both kinds of ceramic microspheres distribute in the foams uniformly with part in the cell wall matrix, some in adhere to the cell wall surface and part embed in the cell wall with portion surface exposed to the pores. Ceramic microspheres have an important effect on the yield strength, mean plateau stress, densification strain and energy absorption capacities of aluminum foams. Meanwhile, the content of ceramic microsphere in aluminum foams should be controlled in order to obtain good combination of compressive strength and energy absorption capacity. The reasons are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84890017577	Effect of Nb on mechanical properties of HAZ for High-Nb X80 pipeline steels	The mechanical properties of heat affected zone (HAZ) of two commercial high-Nb X80 grade pipeline steels with different alloy elements were investigated using thermal simulation performed on a Gleeble-3500 thermal simulator. The results showed that the high-Nb steels have excellent weldability. Embrittlement regions appear in coarse grain heat affected zone (CGHAZ) and intercritically heat affected zone (ICHAZ); Softening region appears in fine-grain heat affected zone (FGHAZ), and the strength here was even lower than 555 MPa as required in the standard. Meanwhile, with the increase of heat input, the strength and the toughness of HAZ of steel with high Nb, C and lower alloy decrease notably. Therefore, take into account the welding procedure during manufacture of weld pipe, suitable amount of alloy elements, such as Cr, Ni, Cu, Mo and so on, is necessary for high Nb X80 heavy-thick steel plate. © 2013 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.

84891508032	Effects of induction heat treatment on austenitic transformation, microstructure and mechanical properties of pipeline steels	The effects of heating rate, heating temperature and cooling rate on the microstructures and mechanical properties of four pipeline steels for high frequency electric resistance welded pipe have been studied by using a Gleeble-3500 thermo-mechanical simulator. The results show that the heating rates have an effect on austenizing phase transformation temperature (Ac1 and Ac3). It shows that there is a linear relationship between heating rate and austennizing temperature (Ac1 and Ac3) in the range of tested heating rate. With the heating temperature increasing, the strength property goes up, on the contrary, the strength begins to go down when the heating temperature exceeds 900 °C, then a lowest strength point appears on 925 °C in the testing scope. As the further increase of the heating temperature, the strength goes up again. Moreover, the cooling rate has a great effect on the microstructure and the mechanical properties. With the decrease of cooling rate, the strength decrease significantly, meanwhile, the microstructure becomes coarse, even the banded structure can be found. As the conclusion, the optimum heating temperature is 950 °C, and cooling rate is from 8.5 to 13 °C/s. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84893136824	Effect of silicon on recrystallisation of V-Ti microalloyed steel	The dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) and static recrystallisation (SRX) behaviours of three V-Ti microalloyed steels were studied by the analysis of the true stress-strain curves and the stress relaxation curves under different deformation conditions. The results of DRX showed that deformation activation energy Qdef, peak stress and peak strain increased, as a result of the solute strengthening and dragging effect due to Si. The results of SRX showed that Si increased the SRX activation energy QSRX. The solute retardation parameter for static recrystallisation of Si was calculated. Based on the SRX results, to quantify the drag effect of Si and V, a new model was proposed to describe the time for 50% recrystallisation (t0·5), which was tested and verified by previously published data on similar steels. Precipitation during recrystallisation could lead to a lower value of the Avrami exponent. © 2014 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

84894806278	A study on abrasion properties of friction plate for clutch disc	A semi-metallic phenolic resin-based friction material was developed for friction facing on clutch Disc in Tunnel Boring Machine. The friction coefficients of the developed material was between 0.3620.392 and had better stability an d lower degradation at more than 250°C. The wear loss was lower below 200°C and similar above 200°C to that of asbestos material. The mechanical properties were equivalent to that of asbestos material .The developed friction plates were used in Tunnel Boring Machine and their wear loss (0.57mm) was smaller than that of asbestos friction facings (2.63mm). The developed friction materials are suitable for clutch Disc either in normal or in sliding conditions. At the initial friction stage, debris was product of friction and the main wear mechanism was particle abrasion. Within 150°C and 250°C, the abrasion depended on the strength of transformed films and matrix . Above 250°C, the cohesive strength of the composite and the heat-resistant property of resin matrix were the key factors affected wear loss. Copyright © 2006 Frontiers of Design and Manufacturing.

84896310091	Microstructure and conductive characteristics of carbon black/silicone rubber conductive composites	The microstructure and conductive characteristics of carbon black/silicone rubber conductive composites were studied. The composites based on insulating silicone rubber filled witch conductive nano carbon black particles had a conductive property. The resistivity of the composites under different carbon black content relationship was obtained and when carbon black mass fraction was greater than 4%, the electrical conductivity were better. The carbon black particles which were not uniform rules appear as two kinds of structure-"aggregate" and "chain" which connects with "aggregate" according to SEM images. The "aggregate" and "chain" were simplified to "large particles" structures which can be deformed and the carriers transfer between the "large particles" through mutual contact and the tunneling effect; assumptions, the conductive model was to establish.

84899446462	3D numerical simulation on thermal flow coupling field of stainless steel during twin-roll casting	The surface crack and lateral crack of the AISI 304 stainless steel thin strip produced by twin-roll casting were observed. The temperature at the center of outlet during twin-roll-casting process was determined by infrared thermometer. In order to avoid the surface cracks of the casting strip, the thermal flow coupling field of AISI 304 stainless steel during twin-roll-casting process was simulated by a 3D fluid-structure coupling model. According to the simulation result, the effect of the casting speed on thermal flow field was analyzed and the process parameters were optimized. Moreover, by studying heat flux curves, the heat transfer mechanism between molten pool and roll was analyzed. The results show that, with the increase of the casting speed, the temperature of the molten pool increases and the solidification point moves toward the outlet. Meanwhile, the whirlpool above gets larger. Based on the solidification front position, the optimized process parameters are 1500 °C and 0.37 m/s. The heat transfer mechanism between molten pool and roll contains direct contacting heat transfer and air gap heat transfer. © ASM International.

84902012816	Quantitative research on dissolving of Nb in high Nb microalloyed steels during reheating	The accurate prediction of soluble Nb content during reheating is helpful for the design of chemical composition and reheating parameters for Nb-containing steels. The dissolution behavior of Nb in high Nb microalloyed steels was investigated. The results show that Nb does not entirely dissolve for high Nb microalloyed steels containing Ti after holding at 1300 °C for 3 h. The soluble Nb content increases with the decrease of C content and/or the increase of Nb content in steels. Moreover, an expression has been established to describe the amount evolution of soluble Nb in high Nb microalloyed steels during reheating and the validity of this expression has also been verified by experiment. © 2014 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.

84905749000	The force sensing properties of carbon black/silicone rubber conductive composites thin-film sample in the negative temperature	The force sensing properties of carbon black/silicone rubber conductive composites thin film were tested in the negative temperature. The results showed that the sample has excellent tension-sensitive characteristics even when the temperature reaches -35°C. The resistance of sample increases with tensile deformation (the tensile strain up to 20%), and there is a good linear relationship between the resistance and strain. The sample showed consistent force sensitive nature under different negative temperature conditions. With the increase of carbon content, the stability of the sample becomes better, but the sensitivity is reduced accordingly. The carbon black/silicone rubber conductive composites thin-film adapt to the tensile deformation test in negative temperatures and at large strain, and the linearity and stability are better.

84906535426	Simulation study on the centrifugal casting wet-type cylinder liner based on ProCAST	The casting defects that appear the inside surface of a wet-type cylinder liner (WTCL), such as macrosegregation and shrinkage holes, are important factors that affect the quality of the WTCL produced by centrifugal casting. To reduce these defects, a model of centrifugal casting WTCL based on the ProCAST software was constructed in this study, and the simulated result was used to optimize the casting process. The temperature field of the casting WTCL was simulated based on actual solidification, and the solidification process and casting defect were analyzed. Results show that the simulated temperature field is in accordance with the actual process and the casting defects appear in the final solidification zone and inside the sub-surface near the thick-wall side. These defects were later revealed on the surface after machining. The factors that affect the temperature field and the solidification process, such as the cooling-down method, mold structure, coating material, and coating structure, were also analyzed. Based on these analyses, an improved method was proposed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84909964756	The sensing repeatability test of carbon black/silicone rubber conductive composites	The tensile and compressive sensing repeatability were tested for carbon black/silicone rubber thin-film samples produced with the method of solvent process. The results of tensile test showed that the resistance-tensile strain curves of the each formulation sample had better repeatability(the maximum strain reached about 24%). The repeatability of C4 and C6 sample was worse slightly than the C8~C18 sample's, the reason was the conductive network inside of the composites was not stable when the carbon content was less than 6%. The results of compression test showed that the pressure-sensitive of the composites also had repeatability(the maximum pressure reached about 15 MPa). Overall, the tensile and compression sensitivity of carbon black/silicone rubber composites have a better reproducibility and linearity in a wide range of tensile strain and stress.

1042304382	A study on the dual-phase treatment of weathering steel 09CuPCrNi	Dual-phase treatment processes, the resultant microstructures and the corresponding mechanical behavior and properties of weathering steel 09CuPCrNi have been studied. The results show that the microstructures of weathering steel 09CuPCrNi after intercritical quenching are characterized by an irregular distribution of island-shaped martensite in the matrix of equi-axed ferrite grains. Favorable mechanical properties and cold formability can be obtained through the intercritical quenching at 780 °C. The dual-phase-treated steel is superior in weldability to the as-received hot-rolled steel and its atmospheric corrosion resistance is better than that of the original. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
