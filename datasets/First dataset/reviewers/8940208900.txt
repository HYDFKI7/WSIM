84927155641	Hydrogen diffusion coefficient in liquid metals evaluated by solid-gas eutectic unidirectional solidification	Based on the solid-gas eutectic unidirectional solidification technique and the principle of unidirectional solidification of single-phase alloy, a new method for evaluating the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in liquid metals was proposed. Taking Cu-H<inf>2</inf> system for example, the influences of argon partial pressure and superheat degree of melt on the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in liquid metal were studied and the predicted values were similar to each other. The obtained temperature-dependent equation for diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in liquid copper is comparable with experimental data in literature, which validates the effectiveness of this method. The temperature-dependent equations for diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in liquid Mg, Si and Cu-34.6%Mn alloy were also evaluated by this method, along with the values at the melting point of each metal and alloy.

84927528602	Pore structure of unidirectional solidified lotus-type porous silicon	Abstract Lotus-type porous silicon with elongated pores was fabricated by unidirectional solidification under pressurized hydrogen. Porosity, pore diameter, and pore length can be adjusted by changing solidification speed and hydrogen pressure. The porosity of the ingot is nearly constant under different solidification speeds, but decreases with the increase of hydrogen pressure. The overall porosities of ingots fabricated at different hydrogen pressures were evaluated through a theoretical model. Findings are in good agreement with experimental values. The average pore diameter and pore length increase simultaneously while the average pore aspect ratio changes slightly with the decreases of solidification speed and hydrogen pressure. The average pore length is raised from 7 to 24 mm and the pore aspect ratio is raised from 8 to 20 respectively with the average pore diameter promoted by about 0.3 mm through improving the superheat degree of the melt from 200 to 300 K.

In the common centrifugal casting condition, the free solidification constriction of HSS roll was difficult, that accelerated the crack source expanding. The appearance of mesosphere solidification and shaft direction solidification was unfavorable to obtain compact roll structures that accelerated the roll to produce crack.

We developed a Gasar apparatus to have successfully prepared lotus-type porous Mg samples. Effects of technological parameters, including preheating temperature of cast mold and gas pressure, on gas-hole rate, gas-hole size and gas-hole distribution in the lotus-type porous Mg were investigated.

16344371966	Intelligent evaluation of melt iron quality by pattern recognition of thermal analysis cooling curves	The quality of an iron melt which refers to the soundness of melting and subsequent treatments of the melt can be identified and recognized with its thermal analysis cooling curve. To compare two cooling curves, both the separating distance of the two curves and the shape similarity of the curves should be considered. A comprehensive parameter Ω can be used to identify the difference of the two cooling curves. When Ω is at minimum, the two curves must be the closest couple among all cooling curves. It is found that the difference of every feature related to melt iron quality converges to zero when the value of Ω approaches zero. Two databases of grey and nodular cast irons have been set up, in which the thermal analysis cooling curves, composition, microstructure and mechanical properties are included. For the prediction of nodularity of ductile irons, an accuracy of 5% is realized if the value of Ω of the two matching cooling curves is less than 2 °C. This method is self-adaptive to the production condition and has been adopted in several foundries. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modification of the Fe-V-W-Mo alloy is effectively achieved through the addition of suitable amount of RE, which refines the prior-austenite grains and eutectic structure.

By use of the developed 'Gasar' apparatus, lotus-type porous magnesium samples have been fabricated successfully, and the effects of the preheating temperature of the mold and the gas pressures on the porosity, the pore nucleation, the mean pore size and distribution were also studied in the paper. The results show that enhancing of the preheating temperature of the mold can effectively eliminate the pore-free skin in the lateral part of the ingot. With increasing of hydrogen pressure, the porosity and the mean diameter of the pores will be increased and the uniformity of the size distribution of the pores will be improved.

The experiments indicated that the volume fraction and carbon content of retained austenite are low at lower austempering temperatures, and with the increasing of the austempering temperature the volume fraction and carbon content of retained austenite increase gradually within the 240-400°C of austempering temperature. It has been also found that at the beginning of austempering transformation, the volume fraction and carbon content of retained austenite is relatively low and with the extending of the austempering time, the volume fraction and carbon content of retained austenite increase gradually.

The experiment results show that a large a mount of compounds with high-melting point is formed in HSCS after modification. Those high-melting point compounds are very effective in prompting heterogeneous nucleation of austenite and refining the austenite grain of HSCS. At the same time, the addition of modifier increases the degree of supercooling of the steel prompting nucleation of austenite and refining the grains. By modification, the dendrite grain turns into the equiaxed grain after austempering heat treatments. The volume fraction of blocky retained austenite of HSCS decreases remarkably from 31. 9% without modification to 5. 5% after RE/V/Ti multi-modification, and the size of blocky retained austenite also decreases.

The plane strain fracture toughness of the steel in room temperature and ambient atmosphere has been examined. The microstructure was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and optical metallography and correlated to the fracture toughness of the steel.

The results show that the addition of Sr has no remarkable effect on the grain refinement of the alloys, but the addition of B reduces the effective content of Sr in the melt Al-7Si alloys and thus decreases the modification level of Al-7Si alloys. Based on these, the relationship between the shape of solidification segment in the cooling curve and the features of melt hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys has been studied by computer-aided cooling curve analysis. It is indicated that both the grain size difference and the modification level difference converge to zero when the comprehensive parameter Ω, which expresses the difference between cooling curves, approached to zero. The shape of the solidification segment in the cooling curve can characterize the features of the Al-7Si alloy melt by combined addition of B and Sr. Based on a database established from a large amount of experimental results, it is possible that the on-line prediction of modification level of eutectic Al-7Si can be realized.

But the same process is not viable for aluminium. Theoretical and experimental analysises showed this problem is related to that the absolute quantity of hydrogen dissolved in aluminium melt is too small and the solidification rate of Al-H system in the Gasar process is too slow to maintain the eutectic growth of metal solid phase and gas phase and to form lotus-type porous structure.

34447256840	Controlling melt quality of compacted graphite iron	A melt quality evaluation system, based on the pattern recognition of the thermal analysis cooling curves and database technique, has been developed to evaluate the modification level and predict the graphite morphology in compacted graphite iron (CGI). It is verified that when the comprehensive difference parameter Ω, which presents the difference between two cooling curves, approaches to zero, the differences of corresponding graphite morphology indexes, such as nodularity (N), converge to zero. Therefore, when a cooling curve matching with the measuring one can be searched out from the database, the corresponding indexes can be used to evaluate or predict the modificaiton level of the measuring CGI melt. When the modification level is not qualified for the castings according to the predicting result, corrections are performed with the cored-wire injection vermicularizing method. The modification level responds sensitively to the amount of cored-wire vermicularizing agent and it is possible to determine the appropriate amount of cored-wire agent needed according to the initiative and target nodularities under the circumstance of this study. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

34447311634	The critical processing conditions for directional solidification of solid/gas eutectics	Among all the processing parameters which affect porous structure obtained by directional solidification of a solid/gas (e.g. metal/hydrogen) eutectic (Gasar), the gas pressure above melts and the superheating temperature of melts are the most observable and easily governed because they directly control the amount of hydrogen saturated in melts. The critical processing conditions for hydrogen to escape and for formation of lotus-type porous structure have been deduced through theoretical analysis and calculation. The results show that both the superheating temperature and the argon partial pressure should have moderate values, viz. with given partial pressures of hydrogen and argon, the superheating temperature should be bigger than the threshold of formation of lotus-type structure and smaller than that of hydrogen to escape; however, with given superheat degree and hydrogen partial pressure, the argon partial pressure should be bigger than the threshold of hydrogen to escape and smaller than that of formation of lotus-type porous structure. These conclusions were verified by the experimental results of lotus-type porous Mg and will contribute to the fabrication of high-quality regular porous metals by Gasar process.

34548158754	Study on bubble nucleation in liquid metal	The nucleation mechanism of gas bubbles in melts was studied theoretically by three representative models, namely the homogeneous nucleation in liquid metal, heterogeneous nucleation on the flat surface or in conic pits of refractory inclusions, under the assumption that the state of the system's Gibbs free energy change being maximal is the critical state of bubble nucleation. Introducing the contact angle and considering the effect of interfacial tension on bubble morphology, the following conclusions can be drawn: the critical nucleation radius of bubbles in the three models is the same, which will be reduced with increasing gas pressure above the liquid metal. The diameter of embryo bubbles, which is also the minimum pore size in lotus-type porous metal ingots, has a magnitude of micrometers under the common pressure of 0.1-1.0 MPa for the Gasar process. For heterogeneous bubble nucleation in conic pits of inclusions, there exists an optimal cone apex angle corresponding to the smallest volume of the embryo bubble, which is independent of gas pressure above liquid metals and increases with the increase of the contact angle. For alumina inclusion in Mg, Al, Fe, Ni and Cu melts, the optimal apex angles are 8.0°, 19.5°, 20.6°, 42.7° and 51.5°, respectively. Among these three bubble nucleation models, homogeneous nucleation is the most difficult, heterogeneous nucleation in conic pits of inclusions is the easiest, and heterogeneous nucleation on the flat surface of inclusions is intermediate.

But when the Sr addition is at a higher level, the modification level sustains at the initial period of holding time, and then decreases with the holding time. The results of modification level assessment show that the modification level difference converges to zero when the comprehensive parameter, which expresses the difference between cooling curves, approaches to zero. The whole shape of the solidification segment of a thermal analysis cooling curve can token the eutectic silicon modification level of the Al-7Si alloy melt. The modification level can be precisely assessed by comparison of the cooling curve of the melt to be evaluated with those in a database to find the one most similar to it. Based on a database established from a large amount of experimental results, the on-line prediction of eutectic modification level of Al-7Si alloy melt has been realized. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34248652156	Morphology of retained austenite and its effects on the mechanical properties of high silicon cast steel	The microstructure and morphology of retained austenite of austempered high silicon cast steel after various austempering combinations are investigated by TEM, and the volume fraction of retained austenite is measured by XRD method. The experimental results indicate that the retained austenite presented at the isothermal transformation temperature has two typical morphologies, film shaped and blocky morphologies. There is K-S orientation relationship between the film shaped retained austenite and bainite ferrite. The film shaped retained austenite is favorable to improve strength and toughness of the cast steel, but the blocky retained austenite has poor mechanical stability and thus is detrimental to the mechanical properties of the steel.

41049088692	Melt Quality Evaluation of Ductile Iron by Pattern Recognition of Thermal Analysis Cooling Curves	The melt quality of ductile iron can be related to the melt's thermal analysis cooling curve. The freezing zone of the thermal analysis cooling curve was found to indicate the melt quality of the ductile iron. A comprehensive difference parameter, Ω, of the thermal analysis cooling curves was found to be related to the properties of ductile iron melts such as composition, temperature, and graphite morphology. As Ω approached 0, the thermal analysis cooling curves were found to come together with all the properties indicating melt quality about the same. A database of thermal analysis cooling curves related to the properties of the ductile iron melts was set up as a basis for a method to accurately evaluate the melt quality of ductile iron by pattern recognition of thermal analysis cooling curves. The quality of a ductile iron melt can then be immediately determined by comparing its thermal analysis cooling curve freezing zone shape to those in the database. © 2008 Tsinghua University Press.

84925498207	Effect of orifice geometry on bubble formation in melt gas injection to prepare aluminum foams	The bubble formation process at submerged orifices with different geometry is investigated in the preparation of aluminum foams by gas injection method. The bubble profile on a horizontal plate is calculated by quasi-static analysis through Laplace equation. The bubble formation process is then distinguished into three stages: nucleation stage, growth stage and detachment stage in wetting and less wetting conditions based on the force balance analysis. In addition, the bubble size at high Reynolds number is obtained by considering the contribution of buoyancy, pressure force, inertial force, drag force and surface tension based on the three stages of bubble formation. The bubble size is confirmed to be sensitive to the equivalent contact angle, which consists of two terms including the contact angle and the wedge angle. Therefore, the wedge angle is introduced in the design of gas outlet orifices for the purpose of decreasing bubble size generated. The experimental study is conducted at three different types of stainless steel orifices under constant gas flow rates (0.05–2 L/min). It is clarified that the orifice geometry and the orifice size are both responsible for the cell size of aluminum foams. The experimental results for three different types of orifices show a consistent trend with the theoretical predictions at various gas flow rates. In the design of orifices to generate small bubbles in the melt, the wedge angle that coordinates with the contact angle is thus suggested.

The shortcut melting process contributes to a higher undercooling tendency of base iron, and the extent of this tendency depends on other processing parameters such as ratio of charges, fluctuation in composition, superheating temperature and holding time, etc. When the shortcut melting process is used in the production of grey cast iron, there are no essential differences, with subsequent proper inoculation, in the microstructure and mechanical properties of castings compared with the conventional medium frequency Induction melting process. Inoculation is a very effective method to alleviate and/or eliminate the negative effect when the shortcut melting process Is used. © 2007 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd.

During the solidification of metal/gas eutectic, the evolution of gas pores makes the volume of the solidifying metal expand, which leads to severe melt convection in front of the solidification interface in the bidirectional solidification process. The experimental results of Mg H system show that during the solidification, the transverse convection in front of the solidifying interface will affect the growth direction of the gas pores, promote gas bubble escaping, and degrade the uniformity of gas pore distribution. By properly designing the structure of the casting mould and choosing appropriate processing parameters, the above harmful transverse convection can be depressed or limited to a lower level, and high quality radial- type porous magnesium with uniform pore distribution can be obtained.

During the bidirectional solidification of metal-gas eutectics, the volume of the solidifying metal expands due to the evolution of gas pores. This volume expansion leads to a severe transverse convection in front of the solidification interface. This paper studies the effect of solidification condition on porosity, pore size and distribution, and the depression and/or elimination of transverse convection. The results show that during the solidification, the transverse convection in front of the solidifying interface will affect the growth direction of the gas pores, promote gas bubble escaping, and degrade the uniformity of gas pore distribution. These effects of convection are influenced by the structure of casting mould. By properly designing the structure of the casting mould, the severe transverse convection in front of the solidification interface can be depressed or limited to a lower level, and high quality radial- type porous magnesium with uniform pore distribution can be obtained. © 2009 W.

The porous pure Mg indicates better corrosion resistance than that of compact pure Mg in SBF at 37 °C. The compressive yield strength of compact and porous pure Mg is (110.3 ± 8.5) MPa and (23.9 ± 4.9) MPa before immersion test, and porous pure Mg exhibits slower decay in compressive yield strength with the extension of immersion period than that of compact pure Mg. With larger exposed surface area, porous pure Mg shows higher Mg concentration in the extract than that of compact pure Mg, which leads to a higher osmotic pressure to cells and might affect its indirect cytotoxicity assay result, but is still within the Grade I RGR value (no toxicity), implying the feasibility as potential tissue engineering scaffold. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The variation of pore growth direction, pore distribution, and pore size were studied. In addition, by observing the microstructure on the transverse and longitudinal sections, it was found that the oriented pores could be formed with a cellular and columnar dendritic solidification mode if the cellular and primary dendrite arm spacing were much less than the pore diameter, which increases with the decrease of solidification velocity.

78650373586	Foam stability criterion in gas injection foaming process of aluminum	By the analysis of foam stability mechanism in the gas injection aluminum foaming process, the particle coverage ratio on gas/liquid interface is suggested as the criterion of foam stability for considering the effect of both particle amount and wettability on the foam stability. Critically stable foaming experiments with different particle amount, different particle size and different particle wettability are performed. The criterion is proved to be true by measuring particle coverage ratio on critically stable foam cell wall under different conditions. A model of critical particle coverage ratio on gas/liquid interface is established, and a criterion equation is deduced which contains the volume percentage of ceramic particle, the immersion depth of gas injection nozzle, diameter of particle, critical particle coverage ratio on gas/liquid interface, adsorption coefficient of particles by the bubble and particle wettability. Based on the criterion equation, the product of particle volume percentage and the immersion depth should be greater than a certain critical value for foam stability. This critical value depends on particle diameter, critical gas/liquid interface coverage ratio, adsorption coefficient of particles and wettability. Therefore, this model is useful for selecting the main parameters in foaming process. © 2010 Journal of Machanical Engineering.

The results show that the pore structure is primarily dependent on the solidification mode (planar, columnar cellular, columnar dendritic, equiaxed dendritic), which is controlled by the solidification process. By numerical simulation, it is noted that along with solidification, the solidification mode of the alloy transforms from cellular to columnar dendritic and finally to equiaxed dendritic. Through increasing melt temperature and mold preheating, the range of equiaxed dendrite could be decreased, which helps to extend the region of oriented pore structure. © 2011 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The effect of the gas chamber volume on bubble size and the formula for calculating the bubble size under low and intermediate gas flow rate are summarized. It is found that with the decreasing of the gas chamber volume the pore size of the aluminum foams decreases apparently by using a chamber adjustable gas supplying system. Based on the experimental data, suitable correction factors for calculating the pore size of the aluminum foams in the gas injection foaming process are presented. The experimental results also show that the aluminum foams with small pores can be fabricated by the gas injection device with more orifices when the gas chamber volume keeps a constant. To explain this phenomenon, the conception of "effective gas chamber volume" is proposed, which is defined as the quotient of the apparent volume divided by the number of the effective orifices. The values calculated with the effective gas chamber volume and the correction factors presented in this paper agree with the experimental data. © 2011 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

The sound absorption properties of aluminum foams with different porosities in as-received state and with drilling holes of 1.1 mm diameter were investigated. The results show that the aluminum foams in as-received state with no back cavity do not possess high sound absorbability, while setting up a back cavity behind the foam can improve the sound absorbability according to some permeable structures existing inside the aluminum foam; the noise reduction coefficients of the aluminum foams with 0.5%-1.0% holes area ratio and 60-80 mm thick back cavity are above 0.42, which are about twice more than that of the aluminum foam in as-received state with no back cavity. The sound absorption coefficients of the aluminum foams with drilling holes comply with the characteristics of Helmholtz-type resonators when a back cavity exists. But they are affected by the structure of the drilling holes, the permeable structures derived from inherent defect inside the aluminum foam and the small openings on the cells formed by drilling process.

No carbide would precipitate in the structure. The experimental results also indicate that a full ausferrite structure could be obtained by austempering the steel with a silicon content around 2.64%. Lower silicon would result in the formation of martensite, and excessive silicon would cause proeutectoid ferrite in the structure. The full ausferrite structure has high strength, toughness and hardness. With the increasing of silicon content, the strength decreases, the hardness keeps unchanged and the toughness firstly increases to a maximum value and then decreases.

The simulated results show that Brownian motion is an important factor influencing the coarsening process.

In order to simplify the heat transfer analysis, a fin model was introduced into the theoretical study on heat transfer performance of directionally solidified porous copper heat sink. The heat transfer performance of porous copper heat sink was also tested by experiments, and it was found that experimental values are far less than theoretical predicted ones. That is because the structure of porous copper might deviate from its ideal structure, such as, some pores are not penetrated, and the distribution of pore size and pore location is not uniform. After the model was modified by introducing area ratio of penetrating pores and mean diameter of penetrating pores, the theoretical results were consistent with the experimental results. Thus the analytical method based on the fin model in this paper can be used to predict the heat transfer performance of directionally solidified porous copper heat sink. According to the theoretical analysis, porous copper used for heat sink with excellent heat transfer performance should have the following porous structure: the pore diameter is 0.1-0.6 mm, the porosity is 30%-70%, the height of porous copper is more than 4 mm when its length along the direction of pore axis is 20 mm. © Copyright.

The cooling curve segment of the primary freezing stage (from the freezing temperature of primary aluminum to the freezing temperature of aluminum-silicon eutectic) is used for identification, and the relationship between the cooling curve-segment and the grain size (refining efficiency) is established using the relational database. The prediction of Al-7Si alloy refinement efficiency is realized by the pattern recognition of cooling curve based on the database. The experimental results show that when the comprehensive deviation parameter Ω which characterizes the similarity between two cooling curves approaches zero, the grain size difference converges to zero. Under a given solidification condition, the grain refinement efficiency can be precisely estimated by comparing the cooling curve of the melt with those cooling curves in the database to find out the most matching one.

This method is self-adaptive to the production condition and has been put into application in several foundries. © 2003 Maney Publishing.

84896515483	Toughness improvement of austempered boron alloyed high silicon ferrous alloy	Austempered boron alloyed high silicon cast alloy is a new kind of wear resistant material which chemical composition comes from that of the high silicon cast steel with right amount of boron. It takes eutectic borides as the hard phase instead of eutectic carbides. The common microstructure of this alloy is comprised of dendritic matrix and interdendritic eutectic borides which mostly distributed in a form of continuous network at grain boundaries in the as-cast condition. Lamellar pearlite and certain amount of ferrite around the borides can be found in the matrix. According to the previous work of the authors, the impact toughness of the alloy is relatively low due to the formation of continuous network borides at grain boundaries which can deteriorate the toughness. In this paper, the austempered boron alloyed high silicon cast alloy was developed with modification with Ti and removing of Cr and Mo in the alloys, the impact toughness could increase from 4 J/cm2 to 30 J/cm2 while the hardness keeps unchanged. The alloy with modification exhibits obvious grain refining in borides, improved the morphology of boride into discontinuous network and small particles.

84896259939	Simulation on heat transfer performance of directionally solidified porous copper heat sink	Porous copper fabricated by unidirectional solidification of metal-gas eutectic can be used to manufacture a special kind of micro-channel heat sink. A three dimensional model is developed to investigate the heat transfer in porous copper heat sink. However the experimental results of heat transfer performance are far less than the simulation results. That is mainly because some of the pores are nonpenetrative. When the simulation model is modified by taking the penetration ratio into account the experimental results are consistent with the simulation results. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84899701718	Hybrid porous metal of nano-micro double size and regular-random bimodal	A hybrid porous metal with nano-micro double scale pore size and regular-random bimodal porous structure has been fabricated by unidirectional solidification of a lotus-type alloy followed by dealloying treatment to the base alloy. The base alloy selected is a Cu-Mn binary alloy. The lotus-type porous Cu-Mn alloy with straight pores of several hundred micrometers in diameter was manufactured by unidirectional solidification with a mould casting process. Dealloying treatment was then done to the lotus-type porous structure of Cu-Mn alloy. The solid Cu-Mn alloy wall of the lotus-type porous structure was transformed to random porous structure of dozens to hundreds nanometers. The influence of corrosion parameters, such as the current and time in electrochemical corrosion, temperature and corrosion agent in chemical corrosion, on the nano-porous structure formed has been studied systematically.

84901018702	Microstructures and mechanical properties of austempered Fe-C-Si-B alloy	A new type of Fe-C-Si-B alloy was developed. The investigation on microstructure details and the mechanical properties were performed for different austempering combinations. The results indicated that the Fe-C-Si-B alloy comprises ferrite, pearlite and interdendritic eutectic borides in as-cast condition. The distribution of eutectic boride with a chemical formula of M2B (M represents Cr, Fe, Mn or Mo) and is much like that of carbide in high chromium white cast iron. Pure ausferrite structure that is consisted of bainitic ferrite and carbon-riched retained austenite can be obtained by austempering treatment to the Fe-C-Si-B alloy. No carbide would precipitate in the structure and there is not any morphology change of borides. The hardness of the Fe-C-Si-B alloy decreases with increasing of the austempering temperature, and decreases greatly in at the early stages (within 5 to 10 min) of austempering transformation. The transformation is almost finished after about 5 to 10 min when thehardness of the alloy does not change anymore. The Fe-C-Si-B alloy is a new kind of wear resistance material with bright application prospect. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84902197264	Fabrication of Gasar made from Cu-24 wt.% Mn alloy	Unidirectionally solidified porous Cu-24 wt.% Mn alloy is prepared by the Gasar process, using mold casting equipment under various conditions. The experimental process demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating a Gasar structure for alloys with a wide solidification temperature range, as well as a columnar dendritic structure. The effects of melt temperature, initial mold temperature, and partial gas pressures on the pore structure and microstructure of an alloy matrix were investigated. The growth and interruption of directional pores were analyzed based on the solidification mode to determine whether the fine-grained region atop directional pores stunted the growth of Gasar pores. © Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co.

84907088276	Effect of withdrawing rate on pore morphology of lotus-type porous copper produced by single-mold gasar technique	A single mold Gasar process was developed to fabricate lotus-type porous copper with long and straight pores. The effects of withdrawing rate on the solidification front shape, pore morphology and average solidification rate of porous copper ingots were investigated through experimental study and Procast simulation. The results show that the solidification front shape evolves from convex to planar, then to concave with increasing withdrawing rate. In this work, 1.0 mm/s is an appropriate rate for planar solidification front. In this case, all of the gas pores grow along the axial direction (parallel to the withdrawing direction) and the pores' straightness is the best. The average porosities of copper ingots are constant and independent of the withdrawing rate. But the average pore diameter and penetration ratio of gas pores decreased with increasing withdrawing rate.

84907193617	Effect of contact angle on bubble formation at submerged orifices	This paper presents a theoretical model and experimental results of the generation of bubbles due to the injection of a constant flow rate of gas through an orifice submerged in liquid. The bubble formation process can be identified into three distinct stages termed (1) nucleation stage, (2) growth stage, and (3) detachment stage by analyzing the evolution of interface equilibrium and force balance conditions. Influence of contact angle on bubble formation at each stage is quantitatively elucidated. Experimental investigations in the preparation process of aluminum foams by gas injection method were conducted, and the generated bubble size was measured. The theoretical prediction of the present model suits well with the experimental results when a contact angle of 30° is introduced. The present model covers a wide range of contact angle (θ < 90°) at different gas flow rates and orifice radii in both aqueous and metallic systems.

84907219216	Influence of the solidification temperature range on Gasar structures made from Cu-Mn alloys	In this study, the influence of the solidification temperature range of an alloy system on Gasar structures is investigated from the aspect of solidification mode and mushy zone length. The solidification mode and mushy zone length for various Cu - Mn alloys during unidirectional solidification are predicted by theoretical analysis. The calculated data indicate that it is reasonable, possible, but difficult to fabricate porous Cu-34.6 wt.% Mn, Cu-24 wt.% Mn, and Cu- 46.6 wt.% Mn alloys by the Gasar process, respectively. Accordingly, lotus-type porous Cu-34.6 wt.% Mn alloy with regularly oriented pores was prepared and solidified with a cellular structure. Porous Cu-24 wt.% Mn alloy with directional pores could be fabricated, solidifying with a columnar dendritic structure. Porous Cu-46.6 wt.% Mn alloy with irregular large pores was obtained, and solidified with an equiaxed dendritic structure.

84916205220	Modeling and simulation of structural formation of porous aluminum in Gasar solidification	The solid/gas eutectic unidirectional solidification process is a new kind of technology fabricating the lotus-type porous structure. Besides having the properties of large specific surface area, excellent sound absorption, penetrating performance etc. of traditional porous materials, the particularity of the lotus-type porous structure makes it has extraordinary mechanical and thermal properties. There is a great potential for lotus-type porous aluminum in the field of lightweight engineering and heat dissipation of chip owing to its low density, outstanding corrosion resistance and high thermal conductivity. However, the fabrication of lotus-type porous aluminum has always been more difficulty than other metals. Until porous aluminum with excellent pore structure was fabricated under very small solidification rates (0.008~0.015 mm/s) and high superheat degrees of melt (240~340 K), the proper processing parameters were recognized to be essential for the coupled growth of solid/gas phases for Al-H

84919644134	Fabrication of lotus-type porous micro-channel copper by single-mold Gasar technique	A single-mold Gasar technique was developed to produce lotus-type porous micro-channel copper with uniform porous structure. In this paper the effect of withdrawal rate on the solid/liquid interface morphology and the corresponding porous structure was systematically investigated, especially the pore morphology, pore growth direction, porosity, and pore diameter of porous copper ingots. In addition, a temperature field simulation was carried out based on ProCast software to investigate the shape and movement velocity of the solidifying solid/liquid interface. The experimental results show that the solidification interface changes from convex to planar, then to concave shape with an increase in withdrawal rate. The average porosities of copper ingots are constant and independent of the withdrawal rate. The average pore diameter decreases with an increase in withdrawal rate.

0348233157	Formation mechanism of microstructure of melt spun Al-In immiscible alloys	Immiscible alloys are attractive for their valuable physical and mechanical properties. In this paper, the Al-In immiscible alloy was prepared by the melt spinning process and its morphological evolution was studied at various indium contents. The results show that the morphologies of the matrix phase depend on the indium content. Different morphologies lead to different distributions of the second phase particles. Due to a particular solidification mechanism of immiscible alloys, even under the melt spinning rapid solidification condition, it is still impossible to produce homogeneous Al-In hypomonotectic alloy ribbons. But for Al-In hypermonotectic alloys, there is almost no segregation of the second phase throughout the cross section of the ribbons. Al-7In, Al-12In, Al-17.5In and Al-30In are used in the experiment.
