21844451106	Personal recognition with ear biometrics	Research of ear recognition technology, as well as its application, is a new subject in the field of biometrics recognition. The earlier research has shown that human ear is one of the representative human biometrics with uniqueness and stability. The paper discusses the feasibility and characteristics of ear recognition firstly, and presents recent research outcomes on 2D and 3D based ear image recognition and ear print recognition. The 2D ear recognition has the following two approaches: feature-based methods such as pure geometry methods, neural networks and force field transformation etc. and holistic methods such as PCA and moment invariants. The 3D ear detection and ear recognition are carried out with range images. The ear print recognition is mostly used in forensic research. Furthermore, the authors bring forward some essential aspects of this technology including description and extraction of era features, processing of partially occluded ear images and deformed ear images, the methods for recognition and ear detection, and the construction of ear database. The ear recognition is believed to be a promising branch in personal identification either by itself or combining with other biometrics recognition.

33746536729	Ear feature extraction combining the shape feature of outer ear with the structure feature of inner ear	A ear recognition method was proposed which combines the shape feature of outer ear contour with the structural feature of inner ear. The longest axis of auricle contour, which is the line crossing through the two points that have the longest distance on auricle contour, was firstly extracted after edge detection. Then least squares fitting polynomials were used to approximate the auricle curves. The coefficients of the polynomial functions were taken as the feature vector of outer ear contour. The longest axis intersects with the inner ear curves at several points. The ratio of the section length between the intersection points to the longest axis acts as the feature vector of inner ear. Owe to relevant invariability of the longest axis, the feature vectors extracted in the method are invariant to scale, parallel move and rotation. Experiment results prove robustness of this method.

33847387076	A highly accurate method for parameter estimation	The problems of signal detection and parameter estimation are of fundamental importance in detection and recognition of weak target. The typical problem is the measurement of the harmonic signal parameter in the noise. In traditional theory, the processing method is based on uniformly sampling and all the data have the same effect. This paper presents a novel theory to deal with the problem, which treats the data in a different way. The novel method is based on the sub-sampling technique. The position of the new sampling data is not regular in source sequence, but they have the same feature that they are affected by noise less seriously than those that are deserted. Since the new data is not uniformly sampled, the traditional estimation algorithm will be modified and a novel algorithm is discussed to deal with the sub-sampling data. The method presented in the paper offer the higher accuracy of the estimation, because the sub-sampling data have higher SNR. Computer simulations are used to obtain the parameter estimation performance results. Results obtained by this new method are compared with traditional FFT method, and the parameters obtained by new method are more accurate.

84877290345	A generation method of carpet pattern based on topology configuration	Traditional fabric patterns generally contain certain basic elements which are characteristically distributed. However, the existing pattern generation methods based on characteristics and examples preserve neither the integrity of elements and structures in pattern, nor the information of styles and levels, such as distribution characteristics. Thus, taking Xinjiang carpet design as an example, an auto-generating method of patterns based on topological structure is presented. By interactively identifying patterns with different perception layers to serve as templates and extracting elements of the same class accurately by template-matching algorithm, pattern topological structure is generated. Then, appropriate patterns are extracted after the design of selection rules. Finally, the matrix mark method is used to embed the pattern. The experimental results show that the method not only solves the overlapping problem of pattern elements, but also generates beautifully-layered patterns that can express the composition, element image and color of the fabric prints, which can meet the design requirements of style inheritance.

46449108845	Delay analysis of single-hop communication in wireless sensor networks with mobile sink	In wireless sensor networks where the sink is mobile, a node can conveniently hold an information packet until the sink comes closer. This allows to both decrease the number of wireless hops required to deliver the information to the sink and reduce energy consumption. Thus, mobility of sinks can be an effective way to minimize energy consumption. However, with the increasing energy efficiency in sensor networks, the source-to-sink delay in data dissemination may be not acceptable for the application. In this paper we propose an analytical model to calculate the source-to-sink delay in single-hop wireless sensor networks. And the model can easily extend to evaluate the data dissemination to mobile sink in multihop wireless sensor networks. We verify the model through simulation and change the parameters to evaluate their effects. Numerical results show that the analytical framework of source-to-sink delay is accurate. © 2007 IEEE.

To preserve spatial information, region decomposition is an essential step in face recognition for local feature based methods. In this paper, a new region decomposition method is proposed based on Cellular Neural Network (CNN). This method, called Face Penta-Chotomy (FPC), can be factorized into two parts. First, a stable facial region is extracted by a CNN template. Then other four regions are depicted according to the stable facial region and facial proportion. The local binary pattern (LBP) is adopted as the region descriptor. This method is evaluated by conducting experiments on the Yale face database B and ORL database. Besides, it compared with six state-of-the-art methods.

67349246257	Improvement of empirical mode decomposition under low sampling rate	Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a new data analysis method which depends on the exact location of the extrema in the signal. Therefore, the available EMD algorithm only works under high sampling rate in order to find the extrema exactly. Fourier interpolation has been used to solve the problem. This paper discusses the error expression of Fourier interpolation and derives its error upper bound for general band-limited signals, which implies Fourier interpolation yields errors especially near the boundary when the signal is non-integer-period sampled. Motivated by this, a hybrid extrema estimation algorithm based on Fourier interpolation is proposed. Simulation results show that the hybrid algorithm is efficient in improving the performance of the EMD under low sampling rate. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There are two main contributions: 1) a novel phase difference measure is defined; 2) new encoding rules to mirror Gabor phase difference information are designed. Because of them, this method describes Gabor phase difference more precisely than the conventional LGPDP. Moreover, it could discard useless information and redundancy produced near quadrant boundary, which commonly exist in LGPDP. It is shown that the proposed method brings higher discriminative ability to Gabor phase based pattern.

This paper introduces a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm called Neighbor Graph Embedding Fisher Discriminant Analysis (NGEFDA) to overcome the shortcoming of FDA. Firstly, construct two neighbor graphs called within-class neighbor graph and between-class neighbor graph by class label to model the local geometrical structure of underlying manifold. Then, FDA is extended by defining local within-class scatter matrix and local between-class scatter matrix based on above mentioned two neighbor graph. Finally, a linear transformation matrix which maps the data points to a subspace is obtained by making local within-class scatter 'minimized' and between-class scatter 'maximized'. This linear transformation optimally preserves both the local neighbor information and discriminant information. Experiment results show NGEFDA algorithm is superior to some classical and recently presented algorithm. © 2011 Binary Information Press.

79952524856	Descriptor learning based on fisher separation criterion for texture classification	This paper proposes a novel method to deal with the representation issue in texture classification. A learning framework of image descriptor is designed based on the Fisher separation criteria (FSC) to learn most reliable and robust dominant pattern types considering intra-class similarity and inter-class distance. Image structures are thus be described by a new FSC-based learning (FBL) encoding method. Unlike previous handcraft-design encoding methods, such as the LBP and SIFT, supervised learning approach is used to learn an encoder from training samples. We find that such a learning technique can largely improve the discriminative ability and automatically achieve a good tradeoff between discriminative power and efficiency. The commonly used texture descriptor: local binary pattern (LBP) is taken as an example in the paper, so that we then proposed the FBL-LBP descriptor. We benchmark its performance by classifying textures present in the Outex-TC-0012 database for rotation invariant texture classification, KTH-TIPS2 database for material categorization and Columbia-Utrecht (CUReT) database for classification under different views and illuminations. The promising results verify its robustness to image rotation, illumination changes and noise. Furthermore, to validate the generalization to other problems, we extend the application also to face recognition and evaluate the proposed FBL descriptor on the FERET face database. The inspiring results show that this descriptor is highly discriminative. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Simulation results show that not only this approach has a simpler architecture for the optical MSK transmitter, and but also the optical MSK generated has better performance. © 2012 SPIE.

84860689523	Moving pattern-based forecasting model of a class of complex dynamical systems	Considering the existence of uncertainty of complex dynamical systems, in contrast to traditional modeling approach to characterizing dynamical systems in Euclidean space, the dynamics of complex industrial processes is characterized by the move of operating condition patterns in pattern moving space. First, the operating condition patterns of complex dynamical systems are partitioned into C pattern classes constructing pattern moving space, and then pattern class variable characterizing the movement of operating condition patterns in pattern moving space is defined. Each pattern class characterized (quantified) by an interval-valued number can be considered as the "calibration" in pattern moving space. For modeling the move of pattern class variable in pattern moving space, interval autoregression model (IAR) is defined and applied to modeling the movement of pattern class variable in pattern moving space. Finally, Experimental results are then presented that indicate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach. © 2011 IEEE.

84862831588	An optical continuous phase FSK modulation scheme with an arbitrary modulation index over long-haul transmission fiber link	This paper presents an optical continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) modulation scheme with an arbitrary modulation index. The detailed principle on the optical CPFSK generation is derived and analyzed, which includes the special case of the minimum-shift keying (MSK) with a modulation index h = 1/2. The differential detection and the coherent detection of CPFSK are also depicted. The performances of the four kinds of the optical CPFSK modulated system with a 40 Gb/s modulation rate whose modulation index are h = 1/2, h = 2/3, h = 3/4 and h = 1 are simulated via the spectral efficiency and the receiver sensitivity over fiber link respectively. In addition, comparison with the differential phase shift keying (DPSK) is taken. Through the calculation of the spectral efficiency of each modulation formats, CPFSK has higher spectral efficiency than DPSK with the same optical devices. The transmission performances of our CPFSK over the fiber link change better as the modulation index increases under the condition of the first order dispersion of the fiber link is completely compensated. Through simulations, a 1200 km transmission distance can be achieved with a modulation index h = 1. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84862926485	Feature extraction in fingerprint of medicinal herbs via EMD and fractal technique	The wavelet fractal features of fingerprint of medicinal herbs based on wavelet transform has anti-jamming property against the change of sample concentration. However, the recognition rate based on wavelet fractal features is not satisfied when fingerprint of medicinal herbs has some slight changes of concentrations, the number of peak and peak drift of sample are processed in specially situation. In this paper, we put forward the conception of fractal feature of chromatographic profile of medicinal herbs using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMF) from high to low frequency, and establish a novel method to extract fractal feature of chromatographic profile of medicinal herbs. We obtain some sub modes through the chromatographic profile of medicinal herbs by EMD, and then by using fractal theory, we achieve the fractal dimensions of each mode. We apply it to the recognition of the fingerprints of glycyrrhiza. Experiments show that EMD fractal features have better recognition rate than that of the traditional ones in case of the concentration-change, i.e. the number of peak and peak drift of sample have slight changes. © 2011 IEEE.

84867967518	3D facial gender classification based on multi-angle LBP feature	Facial gender classification is a challenging topic, and it's still not perfect until now. In this paper, we propose a series of methods of gender classification based on three-dimension faces. Automatic front-pose adjustment is needed through local region iterative closest point (ICP) registration firstly; then we do pitching rotating and extract multi-angle LBP features from depth thumbnail map in different viewing angles; at last, we use support vector machine (SVM) classifier to do training and prediction. This algorithm has been experimented on CASIA database, and for the neutral faces in this database, we can get a highest correct classification rate of 98.374%.

84868600426	Multilinear local discriminant analysis using adaptive neighborhood graph construction	In this paper we introduce a novel supervised dimensionality reduction technique called multilinear local discriminant analysis, which can preserve the local geometrical and discriminant structure of data with tensor representation. Firstly, we adaptively choose the neighbors of the sample and construct within-class and between-class neighborhood graph based on sample density and similarity. Then, define the local within-class and between-class scatter matrix measured in tensor metric. Ultimately iteratively gain optimal subspace by k-mode optimization, which maximize the local within-class scatter and at the same time minimize the between-class scatter by unfolding the tensor along different tensor direction. Experimental results on ORL face database validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.

84871367384	Theorem to generate independently and uniformly distributed chaotic key stream via topologically conjugated maps of tent map	This paper proposes a theorem to generate chaotic key stream from topologically conjugated maps of Tent Map. In this theorem, the condition for topological conjugation between Tent Map and a class of chaotic maps is first determined. Then, the chaotic attractor of the maps is divided into 2 n unequal subintervals, the chaotic orbit is sampled once in n time iteration, and, finally, the independently and uniformly distributed 2 n phase key stream is obtained. The theoretical and numerical analyses show that the chaotic key stream generated by the proposed theorem successfully is independent and uniform, has a certain complex degree close to the maximum approximate entropy for 2

84871054455	Moving pattern measured by interval number for modeling and control	On the basis of our previous work on moving pattern-based modeling and control method for a class of complex production processes, we propose using the interval number as the measure of the pattern class variable, and develop a new modeling and control method of the moving pattern measured by the interval number. In this approach, using K-means clustering algorithm, the long-time collection of patterns in operating conditions is clustered into C pattern classes to build a scaled space of patterns. To describe the motion of patterns, we introduce the interval autoregressive model with exogenous input (IARX). With the IARX model, we develop the control model and the control algorithm for the pattern class variable. Practical experimental results are presented for demonstrating the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach of modeling and control.

84871649307	Pattern moving trajectory: A new dynamics description method	For a class of complex production process systems, a dynamics description method based on moving pattern is proposed. Different from traditional modelling methods, the definition of moving pattern is presented and the dynamics of system is directly described by the moving law of working condition pattern rather than differential equation or state space model. First, based on the actual run status data, 'pattern moving space' is constructed by a clustering algorithm. Then a variable called pattern class variable (which has statistical characteristic) is defined in this space to describe the moving of pattern. The prediction model based on pattern class variable is also constructed. This prediction model is different from the existing statistical modelling methods though they have the same structure formally. At last, one practical example of sintering process illustrates that the proposed strategy might provide satisfactory results without prior knowledge of the systems.

84872373569	Data-driven pattern moving and generalized predictive control	In this paper, a generalized predictive control method based on pattern recognition technique is proposed for a class of uncertain complex systems with statistical characteristics. The system dynamics is described by working condition pattern moving rather than output equation or state space model. First, working condition data are collected around the nominal operating condition to construct "pattern moving space". The space can be updated on-line. Then "pattern class variable" is defined in this space and the prediction model based on this new variable is also constructed. At last, the generalized predictive control method is also given. This method can identify the optimal controller's parameters directly by the prediction equations and input/output data. And it can avoid many intermediate operations for online solving Diophantine equations. Some simulations based on the actual run status data collected from sintering process of Anyang iron and steel plant are given to verify the effectiveness. © 2012 IEEE.

84874091682	An efficient view-point invariant detector and descriptor	Many computer vision applications need keypoint correspondence between images under different view conditions. Generally speaking, traditional algorithms target applications with either good performance in invariance to affine transformation or speed of computation. Nowadays, the widely usage of computer vision algorithms on handle devices such as mobile phones and embedded devices with low memory and computation capability has proposed a target of making descriptors faster to computer and more compact while remaining robust to affine transformation and noise. To best address the whole process, this paper covers keypoint detection, description and matching. Binary descriptors are computed by comparing the intensities of two sampling points in image patches and they are matched by Hamming distance using an SSE 4.2 optimized popcount. In experiment results, we will show that our algorithm is fast to compute with lower memory usage and invariant to view-point change, blur change, brightness change, and JPEG compression. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84874264831	Pattern recognition: An alternative to dynamics description	For a class of complex production process systems, difficult even impossible to construct exact model, we give a pattern recognition method to describe the system dynamics. Different from traditional pattern-based control methods, we use the categorical characterization of the temporal trends of working condition pattern to capture the system dynamics. First, the actual run status data is collected and a statistical space mapping clustering algorithm is given to partition these data into some pattern classes. Then a variable we called pattern class variable is defined to describe the variation law of pattern class over time. A new Petri nets is constructed as the prediction model based on pattern class variable rather than state variable or output variable. Simulations are given to show that the proposed method might provide the satisfied results for the practical applications without having the exact mathematical models. © 2012 IEEE.

84876065026	Neighborhood graph embedding based local adaptive discriminant projection	As a dimensionality reduction algorithm, Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA) is faced with two problems: (1) how to select the favorable neighborhood size which may have effect on the optimal projection direction and (2) the neglect of neighborhood relationships between samples of different classes. In order to overcome the drawback of LFDA, a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm called neighborhood graph embedding based Local Adaptive Discriminant Projection (LADP) is proposed in this paper. First, LADP adaptively estimates within-class and between-class neighborhood set according to samples , distribution and similarity. Then local weighted matrices are defined depending on the neighborhood size. Ultimately optimal embedding subspace is gained by maximizing local between-class scatter and minimizing local within-class scatter. LADP can preserve both local information and discriminant information. The experimental results of the toy example and real-word data validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

84877685094	Binary keypoint descriptor for accelerated matching	Efficient extraction of key points from images is a hot topic in computer vision and forms many applications. We propose a kind of binary descriptor which is invariant to rotation, viewpoint change, blur change, brightness change, and JPEG compression. To best address the whole process, this paper covers key point detection, description and matching. Orientations of the interest points are estimated by the Haar-wavelet responses to achieve rotation invariance. Binary descriptors are computed by comparing the intensities of two points in the overlapping sampling pattern on image patches. At last, binary descriptors are matched by Hamming distance which can be done very fast on SSE instruction set of modern CPUs such as Core i7 processor. We use coarse-to-fine strategy to accelerate the matching of key point. In the experiment results, we will show that our descriptor is fast and robust. © 2012 IEEE.

One example is given to show that the established chaotic system does not converge into zero in each parameter due to its nonlinear characteristic. Another example with different initial values and lengths of sequence is illustrated, in which the chaotic key stream generated by the proposed theorem is independently and uniformly distributed chaotic system and can successfully satisfy the randomness requirements in Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS PUB 140-2) and National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-22 (NIST SP800-22) test.

84885051956	Occluded face recognition based on dictionary learning and sub-classifier fusion	Facial recognition is a challenging area of research due to difficulties with robust face recognition (FR) under occlusion and sparse representation-based classification (SRC) only focusing on face global features. To solve these issues, we proposed an occluded FR method based on dictionary learning for sparse representation and sub-classifiers fusion (LSSRC), which efficiently combines local and overall characteristics of face images. First, we partitioned continuous but non-lapped blocks of the face by multi-resolution blocking. Then, for each block, SRC was used for feature extraction and face classification. We established a sub-block dictionary and conducted K-SVD dictionary learning, established sub-classifiers and determined weight. Finally, we conducted sub-classifier fusion recognition using voting rules with weight. Results using the AR and YaleA database showed that our algorithm achieved superior recognition performance to the existing sparse representation classification occluded FR method. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

Firstly, the paper introduces a fast algorithm to the theorem in [24] which can generate an IID chaotic key stream from a class of topologically conjugate maps of Tent Map. Secondly, an image encryption method is proposed, including the confusion and diffusion process as follows two steps: first the position of pixels in an image is confused by employing the pre-random sequence produced from chaotic value sort transformation; then the image pixel is encrypted by the IID key stream through XOR operation. Finally, the experiment is illustrated to prove that the proposed image encryption method is valid, and the algorithm can be used in the actual image encryption. © 2013 Binary Information Press.

84908428665	Channel capacity analysis of the generalized spread spectrum watermarking in audio signals	Spread spectrum is the modulation technique which is recently used to embed the watermark in audio signals. However, the channel capacity of the spread spectrum watermarking has not been investigated in detail. In this paper the channel capacity analysis of the generalized spread spectrum watermarking (GSSW) scheme is presented, the theoretical capacity expression of the binary watermark is derived, and an approximate expression for the demand of engineering application is also presented. The optimum parameter values for channel capacity are obtained, and it is concluded that the maximum capacity of the GSSW scheme is larger than that of the traditional spread spectrum scheme because the host signal information is used in the embedded procedures.
