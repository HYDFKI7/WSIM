84933057073	Simulating Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Sichuan Grassland Net Primary Productivity Using the CASA Model and in Situ Observations	Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator for grassland resource management and sustainable development. In this paper, the NPP of Sichuan grasslands was estimated by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. The results were validated with in situ data. The overall precision reached 70%; alpine meadow had the highest precision at greater than 75%, among the three types of grasslands validated. The spatial and temporal variations of Sichuan grasslands were analyzed. The absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR), light use efficiency (ε), and NPP of Sichuan grasslands peaked in August, which was a vigorous growth period during 2011. High values of APAR existed in the southwest regions in altitudes from 2000 m to 4000 m. Light use efficiency (ε) varied in the different types of grasslands. The Sichuan grassland NPP was mainly distributed in the region of 3000-5000 m altitude. The NPP of alpine meadow accounted for 50% of the total NPP of Sichuan grasslands.

33947216570	Synthesis of multi-block copolymer and its compatibilization to the blends of poly(ether ether ketone) with thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer	A multiblock copolymer (BCP) containing amorphous poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) and thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (TLCP) segments was synthesized. The chemical structure and properties of BCP were characterized by fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), gel permeation chromatograms (GPC), thermogravimetry analysis, polar light microscope (PLM), and solubility test respectively. BCP can dissolve in chloroform because of soluble PAEK block bonded with TLCP block, which was insoluble. The peak of the original PAEK oligomer was no more present in the GPC traces of the block copolymer. These facts indicated that polymer synthesized should be copolymers of the two components rather than blends. A single T

37349122844	Dye-templating nonsurfactant synthesis of mesoporous silica	Following a three-stepped reaction, a novel nonsurfactant method was established to synthesize mesoporous silica using dye Basic Fuchsin (BF) as template, and using m-xylenediisocyanate (m-XDI) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) as bridging molecules. The first step is to form the intermediate product (namely XA) of m-XDI and APTES. The second step is to form the intermediate product (namely XAD) of XA and dye BF. The third step is the hydrolysis and condensation of siloxane to construct mesopores. Due to the plane structure of dye BF, it was linked with hydrolyzed siloxane precursors to form mesopores. As expected, mesoporous structure could be formed only when the XA to dye molar ratio was set to 3:1. The synthesized mesoporous silica had narrow pore size distribution centered at 3.56 nm and high surface area of 716 m

77954780184	Evaluation of hyperspectral indices for chlorophyll-a concentration estimation in Tangxun lake (Wuhan, China)	Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a major indicator of water quality which is harmful to human health. A growing number of studies have focused on the derivation of Chl-a concentration information from hyperspectral sensor data and the identification of best indices for Chl-a monitoring. The objective of this study is to assess the potential of hyperspectral indices to detect Chl-a concentrations in Tangxun Lake, which is the second largest lake in Wuhan, Central China. Hyperspectral reflectance and Chl-a concentration were measured at ten sample sites in Tangxun Lake. Three types of hyperspectral methods, including single-band reflectance, first derivative of reflectance, and reflectance ratio, were extracted from the spectral profiles of all bands of the hyperspectral sensor. The most appropriate bands for algorithms mentioned above were selected based on the correlation analysis. Evaluation results indicated that two methods, the first derivative of reflectance and reflectance ratio, were highly correlated (R

84867055833	Dynamic drought-remote sensing monitoring in north China from 2008 to 2009	Drought is one of natural disasters that threaten agricultural development in China as well as around the world. Remote sensing has become an important and effective technology for the monitoring of soil moisture and drought. The everlasting drought that occurred extensively in north China from October 2008 to February 2009 had impacted seriously on the growth of winter wheat. This paper classifies the drought into five levels by anomaly vegetation index ( AVI ) and anomaly water index ( AWI ) based on 8 day composite MODIS ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectivity data and land water content measurements, and then monitors the occurrence and development of drought continuously. Results indicate that the drought has become more severe since October 2008 , and in late January 2009, drought is the most serious. The study also shows that AWI is more sensitive and accurate to reflect the degree of drought than AVI.

84897513224	Evaluating the marginal land resources suitable for developing bioenergy in Asia	Bioenergy from energy plants is an alternative fuel that is expected to play an increasing role in fulfilling future world energy demands. Because cultivated land resources are fairly limited, bioenergy development may rely on the exploitation of marginal land. This study focused on the assessment of marginal land resources and biofuel potential in Asia. A multiple factor analysis method was used to identify marginal land for bioenergy development in Asia using multiple datasets including remote sensing-derived land cover, meteorological data, soil data, and characteristics of energy plants and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A combined planting zonation strategy was proposed, which targeted three species of energy plants, including Pistacia chinensis (P. chinensis), Jatropha curcas L. (JCL), and Cassava.

43949086010	Hydrothermal preparation of visible-light-driven N-Br-codoped TiO 2 photocatalysts	Using a facile hydrothermal method, N-Br-codoped TiO 2 photocatalyst that had intense absorption in visible region was prepared at low temperature (100 o C), through a direct reaction between nanocrystalline anatase TiO 2 solution and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed the existence of N-Ti-N, O-Ti-N-R, Ti 3+ (attribute to the doped Br atoms by charge compensation), and TiO x N y species, indicating the successful codoping of N and Br atoms, which were substituted for lattice oxygen without any influence on the crystalline phase of TiO 2. In contrast to the N-doped sample, the N-Br-codoped TiO 2 photocatalyst could more readily photodegrade methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation. The visible-light catalytic activity of thus-prepared photocatalyst resulted from the synergetic effect of the doped nitrogen and bromine, which not only gave high absorbance in the visible-light range, but also reduced electron-hole recombination rate.

63849123973	An updating system for the gridded population database of china based on remote sensing, GIS and spatial database technologies	The spatial distribution of population is closely related to land use and land cover (LULC) patterns on both regional and global scales. Population can be redistributed onto geo-referenced square grids according to this relation. In the past decades, various approaches to monitoring LULC using remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been developed, which makes it possible for efficient updating of georeferenced population data. A Spatial Population Updating System (SPUS) is developed for updating the gridded population database of China based on remote sensing, GIS and spatial database technologies, with a spatial resolution of 1 km by 1 km. The SPUS can process standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS L1B) data integrated with a Pattern Decomposition Method (PDM) and an LULC-Conversion Model to obtain patterns of land use and land cover, and provide input parameters for a Population Spatialization Model (PSM). The PSM embedded in SPUS is used for generating 1 km by 1 km gridded population data in each population distribution region based on natural and socio-economic variables. Validation results from finer township-level census data of Yishui County suggest that the gridded population database produced by the SPUS is reliable. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.

Although EOS provides some kinds of VI data derived from AQUA/MODIS, residual noise still exists for the reason of cloud contamination, atmospheric variability, and some effect. Hence, the VI data is always discontinuity both in space and time, which is the main reason of the following errors. We reconstruct the MOD13A2-EVI time-series data from the year of 2001 to 2007 based on savitzky-golay filter using IDL. The reconstructed EVI data reduces the effect of cloud and some abnormal noises, makes the data more unanimous in space and more steady between years.

74949110865	Characterization of a dre-binding transcription factor from Asparagus (Asparagus Officinalis L.) and its overexpression in arabidopsis resulting in salt-and drought-resistant transgenic plants	A new full-length cDNA encoding an AP2/EREBP domain-containing transcription factor named AoDREB was isolated from Asparagus officinalis L. using the RACE-PCR method. It is a homolog to the dehydrationresponsive element binding protein (DREB) and classified to the A6 subgroup of the DREB subfamily. Using the yeast one-hybrid system, we conducted a DRE binding assay and demonstrated that AoDREB can bind the DRE element specifically. A transcriptional activity assay showed that AoDREB is a transcription factor capable of activating expression of the reporter gene in yeast. RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of the AoDREB gene is induced under 20% PEG and high salinity stress, whereas no obvious response to low temperature was observed. Overexpression of AoDREB in transgenic Arabidopsis caused no growth retardation and induced stronger expression of the target genes, including RD29A and COR15A, than in wild type, resulting in increased tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis to drought and high salinity. These results suggest that introduction of an exogenous AoDREB into plants is an effective way to improve plant drought and salinity tolerance. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

The viscosity and density of the synthetic DIL were measured. Tribological properties of this dicationic ionic liquid as a new kind of promising lubricant for a steel/steel contact were investigated on an Optimal SRV friction and wear tester.

The lubricating mechanism of the ionic liquid was proposed. The experimental data showed that this dicationic ionic liquid possessed some advantages, e.g. relatively high viscosity index and low pour point. And the synthetic dicationic ionic liquid showed excellent tribological behavior and was superior to PAO4 in terms of friction-reduction and load-carrying capacity.

Regional spatially representative data of observed SVP are not currently available. However, an excellent correlation has been found between SVP and precipitable water vapor (PWV) with many previous works. Based on the correlation analysis between satellite derived PWV data moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric profile product dataset and daily mean SVP data calculated from 37 ground-based meteorology stations measurements in Haihe River Basin of North China, an operational scheme for estimating daily SVP with satellite derived PWV data was proposed in this study. The accuracy of the approach was evaluated through comparisons with in situ measurements. The explained variance is 0.838 with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 2.912 hPa. The results indicated that the proposed method is an effective way to obtain SVP data at a regional scale. © 2010 Academic Journals.

78650626151	Assessment of bioenergy potential on marginal land in China	Bioenergy developed from energy plants will play a more and more important role in future energy supply. Much attention has been paid to energy plants in recent years. As China has fairly limited cultivated land resources, the bioenergy development may mainly rely on the exploitation of marginal land. This study focused on the assessment of marginal land resources and bio-fuel potential in China using newly acquired data and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A multi-factor analysis method was adopted to identify marginal lands for bioenergy development in China, with data of several main types of energy plants on the eco-environmental requirements and natural habits employed. A combined planting zonation strategy was proposed, which was targeted for five species of energy plants including Helianthus tuberous L., Pistacia chinensis, Jatropha curcas L., Cassava and Vernicia fordii. The results indicated that total area of marginal land exploitable for development of energy plants on a large scale was about 43.75 million ha. If 10% of this marginal land was fully utilized for growing the energy plants, the production of bio-fuel would be 13.39 million tons. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The formation and surface properties of the films were analyzed by means of ellipsometric thickness measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscope. Meanwhile, the adhesive and nano-tribological behaviors of the films were tested by a homemade colloidal probe, and a ball-on-plate tribometer was used to evaluate their micro-tribological performances in the reciprocating mode. As a result, the dual-layer films show enhanced micro/nano-tribological properties as compared to single-component ionic liquid films coated directly on the silicon surfaces, which is ascribed to synergic effect of the steady self-assembled underlayer as a load-carrying phase and the proper amount of flowable ionic liquid fraction with self-replenishment property. Hopefully, the novel dual-layer ultrathin films based on fluorine-free ionic liquids and self-assembled monolayer produced in the present work might find promising applications in the lubrication of micro-electromechanical systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80053056766	Filling gaps in vegetation index measurements for crop growth monitoring	Vegetation index (VI) derived from satellite data is a key indicator for researches on crop type identification, growth monitoring and yield forecasting. However, due to the influences of the disturbance factors including the cloud contamination, atmospheric variability and bi-directional effects, the time series VI data are always with significant fluctuations. Such limitations greatly constrain the further application of time-series VI data. How to reconstruct high-quality time-series VI data has become a challenge especially for regional study. In this study, an operational method based on Savitzky-Golay filter was adopted for reconstructing MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from 2000 to 2008 in the Haihe River Basin in North China. The reconstructed EVI time-series dataset was analyzed together with land-use map and evapotranspiration data. It is found that this method can significantly reduce the containments of clouds and some other abnormal noises, and can greatly improve the quality of EVI time-series dataset both in space and time. It is also noted that this approach shows limitations for some small built-up lands dotted in vegetation land. We discuss the possible reasons in further research. © 2011 Academic Journals.

83055163741	A novel optical aerosol detector utilizing an optic fiber with conductive polymer coating	The detection of atmospheric aerosol particles is becoming an important issue in many fields such as environmental science, occupational medicine, semiconductor industry and material science. In the present paper, we utilized the conductive polymer, polypyrrole (PPy), as a sensitive membrane for detecting aerosol particles optically. A polymer optical fiber reflectance probe is constructed by depositing the PPy nanofilm at the end face of the fiber. The sensor principle relies on the change in the refractive index of the PPy nanofilm upon its interaction with aerosol nanoparticles and on the electrostatic induction between aerosol particles and the PPy nanofilm, which leads to a change in the reflected intensity. For preliminary evaluation of optical aerosol detector, three types of aerosol particles, NaCl, black carbon (BC) and polystyrene latex (PSL), are selected. The fabricated fiber optic reflectance probe using the PPy nanofilm shows distinct variations in the reflected light intensity depending on the type of aerosol particle and its properties. The proposed sensing approach may promote the use of conductive polymers in optical techniques for the detection of atmospheric aerosols. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84855784220	Bioenergy potential from crop residues in China: Availability and distribution	The accurate estimate of the availability of crop residue resources is very important for the development of bioenergy in China, a large agricultural nation. Previous efforts to evaluate the bioenergy potential from converting straws to energy were mainly based on agricultural statistical data on the provincial/county level. Straw yield calculations generated by most of those works significantly overstate the amount of crop straws for ignoring environmental requirement and harvest constrain. The paper presents a GIS-based approach for the assessment of the availability and distribution of crop residues in China, taking into account a number of conservation issues: resources (total amount, spatial and temporal distribution), economy (transportation costs), environment, and technology. All data are converted into unified geographic unit (100 m × 100 m pixels), and integrated analysis is implemented with GIS software. The results indicate that considering conservation requirements, the production of net available crop residues is about 505.5 million tons per year. The bioenergy potential is about 253.7 million tons standard coal per year (7.4 EJ/year), which account for 8.27% of total energy consumption of the country in 2009.

Chlorophyll is one of the important inland water quality parameters, while existing models of chlorophyll concentration extraction from remote sensing data are limited to some spatiotemporal study sites. To monitor chlorophyll concentration by remote sensing in the Tangxun Lake of Wuhan, field-observed data and reflectivity spectrum were used to study the chlorophyll concentration. First, the field-observed reflectivity spectrum curve of the water body in Tangxun Lake was analyzed. Second, correlation analysis was taken to get the most suitable bands from the three algorithms of single band method, first differential method, and the method of spectral reflectivity ratio at different bands, and constructed related models for Tangxun Lake. Last, the accuracy of three models was compared and the most suitable model to monitor chlorophyll concentration in Tangxun Lake by remote sensing was obtained. For the extraction of chlorophyll concentration in Tangxun Lake, the first differential method and the method of spectral reflectivity ratio at different bands are better than the single band method.

Due to the complexity of the water cycle, accurate estimation of WUE at the regional scale is a challenging task. Here we presented a framework of relative water use efficiency (RWUE). According to the linkage between RWUE and land use types, assessment of WUE at a regional scale could be performed operationally. This approach was evaluated in a study area, Tuhai-Majia Basin, North China. Based on remote sensing-derived evapotranspiration (ET) and land use data, regional WUE were assessed accordingly. The mean RWUE of agriculture, ecosystem and total basin in 2005 was 60.12, 30.07 and 62.5%, respectively. Spatial analysis showed that the agricultural WUE played the dominant role in water-saving of the study area; water management of unused land (RWUE of 2005 was 5.46%), especially wetland protection and other unused land development, will contribute significantly to ecological RWUE improvement. Temporal analysis indicated that there was considerable inter-annual variability in RWUE time series profiles. The agricultural interlude period might be important for enhancing WUE in the Tuhai-Majia Basin. In general, the results indicated that the RWUE-based method was an efficient and simple method to evaluate WUE at regional scale. © IWA publishing 2012.

The temporal variations of the NDVI were analyzed during the whole growing season, and thus the principle of the interaction between NDVI profile and the growing status of crops was discussed. As a case in point, the relationship between integral NDVI and winter wheat yield of Henan Province in 1999 had been analyzed. By putting integral NDVI values of 60 sample counties into the winter wheat yield-integral NDVI coordination, scattering map was plotted. It demonstrated that integral NDVI had a close relation with winter wheat yield. These relation could be described with linear, cubic polynomial, and exponential regression, and the cubic polynomial regression was the best way. In general, NDVI reflects growing status of green vegetation, so crop monitoring and crop yield estimation could be realized by using remote sensing technique on the basis of time serial NDVI data together with agriculture calendars.

84866852930	A Simple Semi-Automatic Approach for Land Cover Classification from Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery	Land cover data represent a fundamental data source for various types of scientific research. The classification of land cover based on satellite data is a challenging task, and an efficient classification method is needed. In this study, an automatic scheme is proposed for the classification of land use using multispectral remote sensing images based on change detection and a semi-supervised classifier. The satellite image can be automatically classified using only the prior land cover map and existing images; therefore human involvement is reduced to a minimum, ensuring the operability of the method. The method was tested in the Qingpu District of Shanghai, China. Using Environment Satellite 1(HJ-1) images of 2009 with 30 m spatial resolution, the areas were classified into five main types of land cover based on previous land cover data and spectral features. The results agreed on validation of land cover maps well with a Kappa value of 0.79 and statistical area biases in proportion less than 6%. This study proposed a simple semi-automatic approach for land cover classification by using prior maps with satisfied accuracy, which integrated the accuracy of visual interpretation and performance of automatic classification methods. The method can be used for land cover mapping in areas lacking ground reference information or identifying rapid variation of land cover regions (such as rapid urbanization) with convenience. © 2012 Jiang et al.

84875279871	Tribological properties of crown-type phosphate ionic liquids as lubricating additives in rapeseed oils	The friction and wear properties of rapeseed oils with different concentrations and crown-type phosphate ionic liquids were studied by an Optimol SRV oscillating friction and wear tester. Crown-type phosphate ionic liquids have better solubility than conventional ionic liquids in rapeseed oils. The tribological test results showed that the crown-type phosphate ionic liquids as lubricating additives in rapeseed oil exhibited better tribological performance than the base oil for steel/steel friction pair under various loads. It is noted that the friction pair showed the least friction coefficient and wear volume when the concentration of ionic liquids was 1 wt.%. The better tribological properties of friction pair should be attributed to the effective boundary films formed in the worn surface, on various tribochemical products, organometallic products and iron oxides.

84876267683	Evaluating the spatio-temporal variation of China's offshore wind resources based on remotely sensed wind field data	Wind resource assessment in coastal areas is an important concern to develop offshore wind power. The high complexity of coastal environment entails the need for new tools that can describe the spatial variability of wind. In this paper, a distribution study of offshore wind power in China using QuikSCAT Level-2 satellite measurements at a 0.5-degree horizontal resolution was performed. Based on long-term information of daily average wind field, the paper gives an overview of the spatio-temporal distribution of wind resources in China's coastal regions. The results indicate that China has significant offshore wind energy development potential. The total offshore wind energy potential at 10 m in China is approximately 660 GW. The coastal region along Fu Jiang Province has the best wind resource compared with other parts of China's offshore regions. An integrated analysis was made by combining the offshore wind farm plans of coastal provinces with the spatio-temporal characteristics of the wind resource, and suggestions are presented accordingly. We find that the use of wind estimates from satellite data potentially leads to a more refined wind resource analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84879509445	Assessment of the biomass energy potentials and environmental benefits of Jatropha curcas L. in Southwest China	Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) is believed to be the most promising tree species used to produce biodiesel in China. Due to its abundant marginal land resource and good meteorological conditions, Southwest China is the major region to develop JCL. With Southwest China being taken as the study area in this paper, multi-factor comprehensive analysis is used to identify marginal land resources suitable to JCL plantation and make suitability assessment, thus obtaining their spatial distribution, suitability degree and total amount. With life cycle analysis (LCA), the life cycle net energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction capacity of marginal land resources with different suitability degrees used to produce biodiesel are investigated. Based on the research results, the life cycle model is expanded to obtain the potentiality of total net energy production and greenhouse gas emission reduction of large-scale plantation of JCL in southwest China. The results show that the area of land resources suitable and moderately suitable for JCL plantation is 1.99×10

84880527238	Tribological properties of crown-type phosphate ionic liquid as additive in poly(ethylene glycol) for steel/steel contacts	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to design the crown-type phosphate ionic liquid additive which can dissolve in poly(ethylene glycol) (shortened to PEG) completely, and evaluate the tribological properties as additive in PEG for steel/steel contacts. Design/methodology/approach - To improve the solubility and the tribological performance of ionic liquid additive in PEG, the crown-type phosphate ionic liquid additive was prepared. The tribological properties of the crown-type phosphate ionic liquid additive in PEG were evaluated at different concentrations and rubbing frequencies on an Optimol SRV oscillating friction and wear tester. The morphology and chemical compounds of the wear scars were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Findings - The experimental results show that the crown-type phosphate ionic liquid additive applied in based oil exhibits better tribological properties for steel/steel contacts at different loads, concentrations and rubbing frequencies. It could improve the anti-wear ability and reduce the friction coefficients as the increased concentration. By the SEM and XPS analysis, it is found that there were the effective boundary lubricant films in the worn surface. The boundary films were composed of various tribochemical products, ferric oxide, ferric phosphate and pyrophosphate, together with the absorbed films. Originality/value - Compared with the poor miscibility of some ionic liquid in PEG, the crown-type phosphate ionic liquid additive can dissolve in PEG perfectly. It can improve the anti-wear ability and reduce the friction coefficient of PEG at different concentrations and rubbing frequencies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

84880545533	Tribological behaviors of novel crown-type phosphate ionic liquids as lubricants for steel/aluminum contacts	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to synthesize a novel kind of crown-type phosphate ionic liquids with better tribological properties for steel/Al system. The anions of crown-type phosphate ionic liquids contain no F element, which are non-corrosive to metal. Design/methodology/approach - To improve the tribological properties of ionic liquid lubricants for the extremely difficult system of the steel-against-aluminum metal couple, novel crown-type phosphate ionic liquids were prepared. The tribological properties of the crown-type phosphate ionic liquids were evaluated at different loads and frequencies on an Optical SRV oscillating friction and wear tester. The morphology and chemical compounds of the wear scars were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Findings - Compared with conventional ionic liquids, the novel crown-type phosphate ionic liquids prepared in the present work exhibit a more excellent anti-wear ability for steel/Al2024 contact at different loads and frequencies. By the morphological analysis with SEM, less debris was observed in the worn surface lubricated with crown-type phosphate ionic liquids, though more debris was observed when lubricated with LB106 and LP106. By the XPS analysis, boundary lubrication film composed of aluminum (III) oxide, organometallic compounds, and silicon aluminum phosphate were found in the worn surface. Namely, the tribological behaviors of the crown-type phosphate ionic liquids could be attributed to their stronger adsorption and tribochemical interactions with the Al alloys. Research limitations/implications - Because of the higher mean friction coefficients of crown-type phosphate ionic liquids in the research, researchers are encouraged to modify their structure for better tribological properties. Practical implications - The crown-type phosphate ionic liquid exhibited better anti-wear performance for steel/aluminum contact than the conventional ionic liquids containing F element. This will expand the application of high strength aluminum alloys. Originality/value - The phosphate ionic liquid is a non-corrosive liquid and would not cause metal corrosion. Also, the tribological properties of crown-type phosphate ionic liquid with steel/aluminum contact are better than that of conventional ionic liquids. By the designing of molecular structure, new phosphate ionic liquids will exhibit excellent tribological properties: lower wear volume and lower friction coefficient. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

84880198070	A Kalman filter-based method for reconstructing GMS-5 global solar radiation by introduction of In situ data	Solar radiation is an important input for various land-surface energy balance models. Global solar radiation data retrieved from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS-5)/Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) has been widely used in recent years. However, due to the impact of clouds, aerosols, solar elevation angle and bidirectional reflection, spatial or temporal deficiencies often exist in solar radiation datasets that are derived from satellite remote sensing, which can seriously affect the accuracy of application models of land-surface energy balance. The goal of reconstructing radiation data is to simulate the seasonal variation patterns of solar radiation, using various statistical and numerical analysis methods to interpolate the missing observations and optimize the whole time-series dataset. In the current study, a reconstruction method based on data assimilation is proposed. Using a Kalman filter as the assimilation algorithm, the retrieved radiation values are corrected through the continuous introduction of local in-situ global solar radiation (GSR) provided by the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System (Daily radiation dataset_Version 3) which were collected from 122 radiation data collection stations over China. A complete and optimal set of time-series data is ultimately obtained. This method is applied and verified in China's northern agricultural areas (humid regions, semi-humid regions and semi-arid regions in a warm temperate zone). The results show that the mean value and standard deviation of the reconstructed solar radiation data series are significantly improved, with greater consistency with ground-based observations than the series before reconstruction. The method implemented in this study provides a new solution for the time-series reconstruction of surface energy parameters, which can provide more reliable data for scientific research and regional renewable-energy planning. © 2013 by the authors.

84881344263	Water quality and light absorption attributes of glacial lakes in Mount Qomolangma region	As they are products of glacier movement, the water body composition and water quality attributes of glacial lakes have distinct characteristics compared with inland lakes. Although satellite remote sensing provides an effective approach to monitor water quality, lack of in-situ measurement data on the status and environment surrounding glacial lakes presents a major constraint in relating satellite data to water quality indicators. This study presents findings of a preliminary investigation into water quality attributes of 3 glacial lakes in the Mount Qomolangma region. Suspended particulate matter (SPM), light absorption attributes of phytoplankton, nonalgal particles (NAP), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured. The suspended substance concentration varies markedly from 0-320 mg/L. This is considered to reflect differing stages of lake development. The chlorophyll concentration is much lower than that found for inland lakes, as landscapes that surround these high altitude lakes have almost no vegetation growth. The phytoplankton and CDOM concentration depend on long-term stability of lake slopes. Given the lack of exogenous and endogenous inputs in the Qomolangma region, CDOM in glacial lakes is significantly lower than in inland lakes. These preliminary findings could support efforts to appraise estimates of water quality parameters using remotely sensed images. © 2013 Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The outputs of the models are detailed with a higher resolution than those in traditional WUP evaluation. Evapotranspiration (ET), which can be retrieved from remote sensing images, is regarded as the water consumption at the basin scale. The gridded GDP and ecosystem service value (ESV) are derived as indices of economic and ecological profits respectively. This method is applied in the Tuhai Majia Basin, North China. Agriculture is both economically and ecologically fundamental in the study area. The economic WUP of the whole basin (4.87 Yuan/m

84881506885	Targeting mineral resources with remote sensing and field data in the Xiemisitai area, West Junggar, Xinjiang, China	The Xiemisitai area, West Junggar, Xinjiang, China, is situated at a potential copper mineralization zone in association with small granitic intrusions. In order to identify the alteration zones and mineralization characteristics of the intrusions, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Quickbird data of the study area were evaluated in mapping lithological units, small intrusions, and alteration zones. False color composites of the first principal component analyses (PCA1), PCA2, and PCA4 in red (R), green (G), and blue (B) of the ETM+ image, and relevant hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) color model transformations, were performed. This led to the identification of lithologic units and discrimination of granitic intrusions from wall-rocks. A new geological map was generated by integrating the remote sensing results with two internally published local geologic maps and field inspection data. For the selected region, false color composites from PCA and relevant HSI-transformed images of the Quickbird data delineated the details of small intrusions and identified other unknown similar intrusions nearby. Fifteen separate potash-feldspar granites and three separate hornblende biotite granites were identified using ETM+ and Quickbird data. The principal component analysis-based Crosta technique was employed to discriminate alteration minerals. Some of the mapped alteration zones using the Crosta technique agreed very well with the known copper deposits. Field verification led to the discovery of three copper mineralizations and two gold mineralizations for the first time. The results show that the PCA and HSI transformation techniques proved to be robust in processing remote sensing data with moderate to high spatial resolutions. It is concluded that the utilized methods are useful for mapping lithology and the targeting of small intrusion-type mineral resources within the sparsely vegetated regions of Northwest China. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84881051614	Dynamic monitoring of drought using HJ-1 and MODIS time series data in northern China	From early November 2008 to February 2009, lack of rainfall led to severe drought in northern China. More than 9.3 million ha of wheat in six major crop production provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, and Shaanxi, were hit by drought. Supported by Chinese HJ-1 satellite images together with NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, dynamic monitoring of the drought was conducted. HJ-1 CCD data with 30-m resolution were used to identify cropland information. Spatial-temporal variation of drought was detected using Vegetation Index and Water Index time series data derived from MODIS visible, infrared, and short-wave infrared bands. The influences of drought were classified into five levels based on MODIS-derived 8-day composite Anomaly Water Index (AWI) and field survey data. The results indicated that the drought deteriorated beginning in November 2008 and became most serious in late January 2009. HJ-1 data together with MODIS data proved to be valuable data sources for monitoring soil moisture and drought at a both regional and national scale. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84885399835	Spatiotemporal variation of surface water quality for decades: A case study of Huai River System, China	Characterization of spatiotemporal variation of water quality is a basic environmental issue with implications for public health in China. Trends in the temporal and spatial distribution of water quality in the Huai River System (HRS) were analyzed using yearly surface water quality data collected from 1982 to 2009. Results showed that the water quality of the main stream deteriorated in the 1990s and early 2000s but has been ameliorated since 2005. The sections that were classified as severely polluted from the monitoring data were located largely in the middle reach. The water quality of HRS fluctuated during the period 1997-2009; it has improved and stabilized since 2005. In terms of spatialized frequency of serious pollution, heavily polluted regions were mostly concentrated in the area along several tributaries of the Ying, Guo and New Sui Rivers as well as the area north of Nansi Lake. These regions decreased from 1997 to 2009, especially after 2005. Our analysis indicated that water pollution in HRS had a close relation with population and primary industry during the period 1997-2009, and implied that spatiotemporal variation of surface water quality could provide a scientific foundation for human health risk assessment of the Huai River Basin. © IWA Publishing 2013.

84885943819	Study on association between spatial distribution of metal mines and disease mortality: A case study in Suxian District, South China	Metal mines release toxic substances into the environment and can therefore negatively impact the health of residents in nearby regions. This paper sought to investigate whether there was excess disease mortality in populations in the vicinity of the mining area in Suxian District, South China. The spatial distribution of metal mining and related activities from 1985 to 2012, which was derived from remote sensing imagery, was overlapped with disease mortality data. Three hotspot areas with high disease mortality were identified around the Shizhuyuan mine sites, i.e., the Dengjiatang metal smelting sites, and the Xianxichong mine sites. Disease mortality decreased with the distance to the mining and smelting areas. Population exposure to pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source. The risk of dying according to disease mortality rates was analyzed within 7-25 km buffers. The results suggested that there was a close relationship between the risk of disease mortality and proximity to the Suxian District mining industries. These associations were dependent on the type and scale of mining activities, the area influenced by mining and so on. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84886617025	Effective Key Parameter Determination for an Automatic Approach to Land Cover Classification Based on Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery	The classification of land cover based on satellite data is important for many areas of scientific research. Unfortunately, some traditional land cover classification methods (e.g. known as supervised classification) are very labor-intensive and subjective because of the required human involvement. Jiang<etal>et al</etal>. proposed a simple but robust method for land cover classification using a prior classification map and a current multispectral remote sensing image. This new method has proven to be a suitable classification method; however, its drawback is that it is a semi-automatic method because the key parameters cannot be selected automatically. In this study, we propose an approach in which the two key parameters are chosen automatically. The proposed method consists primarily of the following three interdependent parts: the selection procedure for the pure-pixel training-sample dataset, the method to determine the key parameters, and the optimal combination model. In this study, the proposed approach employs both overall accuracy and their Kappa Coefficients (KC), and Time-Consumings (TC, unit: second) in order to select the two key parameters automatically instead of using a test-decision, which avoids subjective bias. A case study of Weichang District of Hebei Province, China, using Landsat-5/TM data of 2010 with 30 m spatial resolution and prior classification map of 2005 recognised as relatively precise data, was conducted to test the performance of this method. The experimental results show that the methodology determining the key parameters uses the portfolio optimisation model and increases the degree of automation of Jiang et al.'s classification method, which may have a wide scope of scientific application. © 2013 Wang et al.

The resulting CdS/PCA-PAEK nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, confirming the formation of CdS quantum dots (QDs) with small particle size. The results of PL measurement showed that the nanocomposite exhibited distinct luminescence properties. Furthermore, the effects of reaction time, CdS/PCA-PAEK ratio, and Cd2+/thiourea ratio on the PL of CdS QDs were also investigated. Thus, a novel simple route was successfully developed for synthesizing nanohybrids based on QDs and high-performance polymers with incorporated carboxylic moiety. © The Author(s) 2013.

Malignant tumors caused by esophageal cancer, and the relationship to environmental factors has been the focus of many public health studies. This study applied spatial analysis to ascertain the relationship between water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality rates nationwide. We employed two datasets, including a national investigation of esophageal cancer rates and distribution, and national water quality grades in China's primary rivers and lakes. Esophageal cancer data were grouped based on different water quality grades, which included a scaled buffer distance from rivers and lakes. Non-parametric correlation analyses were performed to examine the presence or absence of the following correlations: (i) esophageal cancer mortality and buffer distance from rivers and lakes; and (ii) esophageal cancer mortality and water quality grade values. The present study revealed a significant positive correlation between widespread water pollution and esophageal cancer mortality nationwide; and a significant negative correlation between esophageal cancer mortality, and buffer distance from rivers and lakes. © 2014 Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84892377955	Assessment of rapeseed-based biodiesel potential on winter fallowing fields in the middle and lower reaches of Changjiang River, China	The development of bio-energy is one of the keys to solve global energy crisis and climate changes. With the characteristics of wide adaptive range and similar chemical composition as that of diesel, rapeseed has been regarded as an important raw material for the development of biodiesel in Europe and other regions. The middle and lower reaches of Changjiang River is the traditional main region of rape in China. The growing area in the 7 provinces reached 4 million ha annually. Due to the progress of urbanization and related policies, large quantities of fields in these areas are left idle in winter. The use of these rich land resources for the growing of rape in biodiesel development can contribute to alleviating the energy crisis without affecting the national food security. In light of this, the paper put forward a method for comprehensive assessment of rapeseed-based biodiesel potential in this region. Firstly, the areas of winter fallowing fields were extracted by combining use of remote sensing imagery and in situ phenology data. The result indicated that the area of winter fallowing fields in the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang River in 2010 was 5.47×10

84892890308	Calculating the burden of disease of avian-origin H7N9 infections in China	Objective: A total of 131 cases of avian-originated H7N9 infection have been confirmed in China mainland from February 2013 to May 2013. We calculated the overall burden of H7N9 cases in China as of 31 May 2013 to provide an example of comprehensive burden of disease in the 21st century from an acute animalborne emerging infectious disease. Design: We present an accurate and operable method for estimating the burden of H7N9 cases in China. The main drivers of economic loss were identified. Costs were broken down into direct (outpatient and inpatient examination and treatment) and indirect costs (cost of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and losses in the poultry industry), which were estimated based on field surveys and China statistical year book. Setting: Models were applied to estimate the overall burden of H7N9 cases in China. Participants: 131 laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases by 31 May 2013. Outcome measure: Burden of H7N9 cases including direct and indirect losses. Results: The total direct medical cost was ¥16 422 535 (US$2 627 606). The mean cost for each patient was ¥10 117 (US$1619) for mild patients, ¥139 323 (US$22 292) for severe cases without death and ¥205 976 (US$32 956) for severe cases with death. The total cost of DALYs was ¥17 356 561 (US $2 777 050). The poultry industry losses amounted to ¥7.75 billion (US$1.24 billion) in 10 affected provinces and ¥3.68 billion (USD$0.59 billion) in eight nonaffected adjacent provinces. Conclusions: The huge poultry industry losses followed live poultry markets closing down and poultry slaughtering in some areas. Though the proportion of direct medical losses and DALYs losses in the estimate of H7N9 burden was small, the medical costs per case were extremely high (particularly for addressing the use of modern medical devices). A cost-effectiveness assessment for the intervention should be conducted in a future study.

84894086531	An improved indicator of simulated grassland production based on MODIS NDVI and GPP data: A case study in the Sichuan province, China	Grassland monitoring is important for both global change research and regional sustainable development. Gross primary production (GPP) is one of the key factors for understanding grass growing conditions. Methods for estimating GPP are plentiful, and the light use efficiency (LUE) model based on remote sensing data is widely used. The MODIS GPP product, which is employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is calculated using the LUE model and the surface reflection data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Terra/Aqua satellite.

84899553423	Evaluating energy benefit of Pistacia chinensis based biodiesel in China	To be an alternative to fossil fuel, biodiesel should provide a positive energy benefit and a sustainable energy income. Based on the principles of Life Cycle Analysis and using the energy benefits of exploiting Pistacia chinensis in China as a case study, this paper presents a quantitative evaluation of the energy consumed throughout the six-phase life cycle process, which includes planting, fruit transport, oil production, biodiesel production, biodiesel transport and biodiesel combustion. The results show that during the life cycle process, the total energy consumption of the biodiesel production and transformation phase is the greatest and that energy consumption during the plantation phase second greatest. The results indicated that the potential maximum gross annual production is approximately 162.19 billion MJ per year for suitable land and 117.20 billion MJ per year for lands classified as fairly suitable, which could produce 6.35 million t of biodiesel. Considering the net energy production and output potential for P. chinensis based biodiesel at the provincial level, Yunnan Province has the most amount of production potential, while Beijing City has the least amount of production potential. The annual output value created by P. chinensis based bio-fuel is 3007.83 million Yuan in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the exceptional adaptability and reproductive ability of this species have led to its extensive dispersal into other habitats, where it has had a negative impact on native species and threatens the local mangrove and mudflat ecosystems. To obtain the distribution and spread of Spartina alterniflora, we collected HJ-1 CCD imagery from 2009 and 2011 and very high resolution (VHR) imagery from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The invasion area of Spartina alterniflora was 357.2 ha in 2011, which increased by 19.07% compared with the area in 2009. A field survey was conducted for verification and the total accuracy was 94.0%. The results of this paper show that VHR imagery can provide details on distribution, progress, and early detection of Spartina alterniflora invasion. OBIA, object based image analysis for remote sensing (RS) detection method, can enable control measures to be more effective, accurate, and less expensive than a field survey of the invasive population. © 2014 Huawei Wan et al.

84904091758	Assessment of the GHG reduction potential from energy crops using a combined LCA and biogeochemical process models: A review	The main purpose for developing biofuel is to reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, but the comprehensive environmental impact of such fuels is not clear. Life cycle analysis (LCA), as a complete comprehensive analysis method, has been widely used in bioenergy assessment studies. Great efforts have been directed toward establishing an efficient method for comprehensively estimating the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential from the large-scale cultivation of energy plants by combining LCA with ecosystem/biogeochemical process models. LCA presents a general framework for evaluating the energy consumption and GHG emission from energy crop planting, yield acquisition, production, product use, and postprocessing. Meanwhile, ecosystem/biogeochemical process models are adopted to simulate the fluxes and storage of energy, water, carbon, and nitrogen in the soil-plant (energy crops) soil continuum. Although clear progress has been made in recent years, some problems still exist in current studies and should be addressed. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art method for estimating GHG emission reduction through developing energy crops and introduces in detail a new approach for assessing GHG emission reduction by combining LCA with biogeochemical process models. The main achievements of this study along with the problems in current studies are described and discussed. © 2014 Dong Jiang et al.

84904788321	Spatialoral variation of marginal land suitable for energy plants from 1990 to 2010 in China	Energy plants are the main source of bioenergy which will play an increasingly important role in future energy supplies. With limited cultivated land resources in China, the development of energy plants may primarily rely on the marginal land. In this study, based on the land use data from 1990 to 2010(every 5 years is a period) and other auxiliary data, the distribution of marginal land suitable for energy plants was determined using multi-factors integrated assessment method. The variation of land use type and spatial distribution of marginal land suitable for energy plants of different decades were analyzed. The results indicate that the total amount of marginal land suitable for energy plants decreased from 136.501 million ha to 114.225 million ha from 1990 to 2010. The reduced land use types are primarily shrub land, sparse forest land, moderate dense grassland and sparse grassland, and large variation areas are located in Guangxi, Tibet, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. The results of this study will provide more effective data reference and decision making support for the long-term planning of bioenergy resources.

84904498774	Surface water deficiency zoning of China based on surface water deficit index (SWDI)	China's economic and social development is severely restricted by regional water deficiency, and the determination of water deficiency level in different regions is an important basis of water resource management. In this study, we zoned 32 provinces of China into five surface water deficiency levels based on surface water deficit index derived from the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-2C images. The result shows that China is facing serious water shortage crisis with only 15.44% of total area without water deficiency, which is located in the south and southeast coast. More than 60% of total area of China suffered from severe or extremely water deficiency, which are mainly distributed in western and northern regions. Jingjinji area (namely Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province), which is a special region with high amount of gross domestic product and relative abundant water resources, is suffering from severe water deficiency. It revealed that water resources were interacted with regional development and water management should consider local conditions. To Jingjinji area, water management should focus on adjustment of industrial structure, urban expansion control and scientific water resources allocation. In general, the surface water deficit index based water deficiency zoning will be of significant value to be applied in water resources management at regional scales. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

84905673029	Microstructure evolution and enhanced tribological properties of cu-doped WS2 films	To improve the tribological properties of WS2 film both in vacuum and in humid air conditions, its microstructure was optimized by doping different concentrations of Cu via radio frequency co-sputtering method. The film microstructure and composition were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was verified that Cu was presented in amorphous phase in the WS2 matrix and could also induce amorphization and densification of the composite films gradually. The film microstructure changed from coarse columnar platelet structure at low Cu content (0-5.8 at.%) to transition structure with two separate layers at increased Cu content (11.5-16.2 at.%) and to a featureless structure at high Cu content (above 24.4 at.%). The mechanical and tribological properties of films were evaluated using the scratch tester and ball-on-disk tribometer, respectively. It was found that the incorporation of a suitable content of Cu dopant could significantly improve the film toughness, but excess amount of Cu dopant lead to high brittleness. All the composite films exhibited much lower wear rate and longer wear life than those of pure WS2 film both in vacuum and in humid air conditions. The wear mechanisms were proposed after correlating the mechanical performance with film microstructure. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

84907228851	Drought analysis of the Haihe river basin based on GRACE terrestrial water storage	The Haihe river basin (HRB) in the North China has been experiencing prolonged, severe droughts in recent years that are accompanied by precipitation deficits and vegetation wilting. This paper analyzed the water deficits related to spatiotemporal variability of three variables of the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) data, precipitation, and EVI in the HRB from January 2003 to January 2013. The corresponding drought indices of TWS anomaly index (TWSI), precipitation anomaly index (PAI), and vegetation anomaly index (AVI) were also compared for drought analysis. Our observations showed that the GRACE-TWS was more suitable for detecting prolonged and severe droughts in the HRB because it can represent loss of deep soil water and ground water. The multiyear droughts, of which the HRB has sustained for more than 5 years, began in mid-2007. Extreme drought events were detected in four periods at the end of 2007, the end of 2009, the end of 2010, and in the middle of 2012. Spatial analysis of drought risk from the end of 2011 to the beginning of 2012 showed that human activities played an important role in the extent of drought hazards in the HRB.

84912074891	Lithological discrimination of the mafic-ultramafic complex, Huitongshan, Beishan, China: Using ASTER data	The Beishan area has more than seventy mafic-ultramafic complexes sparsely distributed in the area and is of a big potential in mineral resources related to mafic-ultramafic intrusions. Many mafic-ultramafic intrusions which are mostly in small sizes have been omitted by previous works. This research takes Huitongshan as the study area, which is a major district for mafic-ultramafic occurrences in Beishan. Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data have been processed and interpreted for mapping the mafic-ultramafic complex. ASTER data were processed by different techniques that were selected based on image reflectance and laboratory emissivity spectra. The visible near-infrared (VNIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR) data were transformed using band ratios and minimum noise fraction (MNF), while the thermal infrared (TIR) data were processed using mafic index (MI) and principal components analysis (PCA). ASTER band ratios (6/8, 5/4, 2/1) in RGB image and MNF (1, 2, 4) in RGB image were powerful in distinguishing the subtle differences between the various rock units. PCA applied to all five bands of ASTER TIR imagery highlighted marked differences among the mafic rock units and was more effective than the MI in differentiating mafic-ultramafic rocks. Our results were consistent with information derived from local geological maps. Based on the remote sensing results and field inspection, eleven gabbroic intrusions and a pyroxenite occurrence were recognized for the first time. A new geologic map of the Huitongshan area was created by integrating the results of remote sensing, previous geological maps and field inspection. It is concluded that the workflow of ASTER image processing, interpretation and ground inspection has great potential for mafic-ultramafic rocks identifying and relevant mineral targeting in the sparsely vegetated arid region of northwestern China.
