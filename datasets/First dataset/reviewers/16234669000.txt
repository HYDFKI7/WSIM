84936071605	Impact of full duplex on resource allocation for small cell networks	In this paper, a study of the effect of full duplex on resource allocation for small cell network is presented. In our model, both the macro-base station and femtocell access point operate in full-duplex where users attempt to connect either to the base station or the femtocell access point. A resource allocation problem is formulated to adjust the base station and the femtocell access point transmitting powers to maximize the downlink channel capacity while guaranteeing the uplink channel QoS by maintaining a certain channel capacity. In addition, a solution algorithm using the interior point method is proposed. Our results show that depending on the interference conditions, it can be decided when it is preferable to employ full-duplex and when it is more advantageous to use half-duplex.

84946686185	Cooperative spectrum sensing for full-duplex cognitive radio networks	Recent studies have proposed a novel 'listen-and-talk' (LAT) protocol for cognitive radio, in which secondary users (SUs) can sense and access the spectrum simultaneously with the assistance of full-duplex techniques. In this paper, we consider a LAT based cognitive radio network (CRN) consisting of SUs equipped with two antennas, and study the cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) problem to improve sensing perfor-mance. We derive the analytical miss detection and false alarm probabilities of the system, and make comparison with the traditional 'listen-before-talk' (LBT) CSS. Theoretical analysis and simulation results verify the proposed CSS method. Results indicate that when the secondary transmit power is low, the LAT CSS outperforms the LBT one in the secondary throughput. We also find out that there exists a transmit power-throughput tradeoff, and an optimal secondary transmit power can be designed to maximize the achievable throughput for the CRNs.

84946688668	Zero-determinant strategy for power control of small cell network	Small cell technology has received much attention to improve the energy efficiency while keeping high quality of service of indoor users. However, as the small cell and macrocell share the spectrum resource, the interference may be serious. In this paper, we consider the small cell base station (SBS) and macrocell base station (MBS) as two players in the iterated game, where both players are able to choose continuous transmit power to control the interference and improve the utility of their own users. Due to the limitation of the backhaul for small cells, the small cell users want to ensure quality of service of macro cell users. Developed from the zero-determinant method, we propose a zero-determinant strategy for the SBS to unilaterally control the utility of macrocell user (MU) at the guaranteed value whatever the power control strategy of MBS is. Simulation results show the maximum utility of the small cell user (SU) can be achieved while the basic service of the MU is guaranteed.

84946692058	Cost-efficient residential load scheduling in smart grid	To improve the economical efficiency of the residential electricity consumption, in this paper we introduce a novel concept of cost efficiency-based residential load scheduling framework. The cost efficiency is defined as a ratio of consumer's total consumption benefit and its total electricity payment during a certain period. We develop a cost-efficient load scheduling algorithm for the demand-side's day-ahead bidding process based on a fractional programming approach. We found that the proposed scheduling algorithm can effectively reflect and affect user's consumption behavior and achieve the optimal cost-efficient energy consumption profile. For practical consideration, we also take into account the service fee in calculating the cost-efficiency in practical smart grid applications, and analyse its effect on the cost efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly improves consumer's cost efficiency compared with the conventional payoff maximization algorithm. It also shows that a higher service fee will considerably decrease the cost efficiency.

77954602623	Joint relay selection and analog network coding using differential modulation in two-way relay channels	In this paper, we consider a general bidirectional relay network with two sources and $N$ relays when neither the source nodes nor the relays know the channel-state information (CSI). A joint relay-selection and analog-network coding using differential modulation (RS-ANC-DM) is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the two sources employ differential modulations and transmit the differential modulated symbols to all relays at the same time. The signal received at the relay is a superposition of two transmitted symbols, which we call analog network-coded symbols. Then, a single relay that has minimum-sum symbol error rate (SER) is selected out of $N$ relays to forward the ANC signals to both sources. To facilitate the selection process, in this paper, we also propose a simple suboptimal MinMax criterion for relay selection, where a single relay that minimizes the maximum SER of two source nodes is selected. Simulation results show that the proposed MinMax selection has almost the same performance as the optimal selection but is much simpler. The performance of the proposed RS-ANC-DM scheme is analyzed, and a simple asymptotic SER expression is derived. The analytical results are verified through simulations. © 2006 IEEE.

79951944721	Satellite-based spectrum sensing for dynamic spectrum sharing in ground-located CRNs	In the paper, we propose a novel satellite-based spectrum sensing method for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) using multibeam antennas in large-scale coverage ground areas. Our objective is to achieve the dynamic spectrum sharing easily in both temporal and geographical dimensions, such that the primary networks and the CRNs can better coexist. By simple linear transformation and energy detection at the satellite multibeam receiver, spectrum sensing can be simultaneously performed for multiple cells. This approach overcomes the limitations of the traditional sensing method, which therefore considerably improves the spectrum utilization. To verify the efficiency of the proposed approach, theoretical expressions of the average probabilities of miss detection and false alarm are derived. Simulation results show that the satellite-based spectrum sensing method is very efficient for the CRNs in large-scale scenarios under different conditions (equivalent signal-to-noise ratio, threshold, antenna beam pattern, etc.). In addition, the proposed sensing method provides a new vision on the large-scale dynamic spectrum sharing system design to effectively integrate the terrestrial and the satellite communication systems for the future CRN development. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

80052249706	Joint subcarrier and power allocation for multiuser OFDM systems using distributed auction game	In this paper, we investigate resource allocation issue in a multiuser OFDM cellular network. Each user in the network intends to obtain a higher rate from the BS for its own data transmission (e.g., pictures or videos downloading), but the total transmission resource is limited at the BS. Thus, we formulated this resource allocation problem as an auction game, where the BS acts as the auctioneer and the users are the bidders. We then propose a novel joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm using distributed auction game, in order to allocate the limited subcarriers and power effectively and maximize the total transmission rate subject to an overall power constraint with low-complexity and fairness. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed auction-based algorithm. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84866605417	Joint access control and subchannel allocation scheme for ofdma femtocell network using a truthful mechanism	Femtocells are low-power cellular base stations that can improve indoor coverage and offload data traffic from the macrocell network. Nevertheless, access control that has strong impacts on interference mitigation is still an important issue for the femtocell network. In this paper, we consider a two-tier orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) femtocell network that contains one macrocell base station (MBS), several femtocell access points (FAPs) and femtocell user equipments (FUEs). In particular, FUEs can get better service by selecting FAPs properly according to their reported channel information and pay for the resource they use. However, since channel information is private, FUEs cannot know the truth. So FAPs have incentive to report exaggerated information to win greater opportunity to be selected by FUEs and gain more payments. We propose a joint access control and subchannel allocation (JACSA) scheme to solve the truth-telling problem and provide a suboptimal subchannel allocation solution. Further analysis shows that by adding a transfer payment to each FAP, the maximum expected total payment can only be obtained when all FAPs report the true information. Moreover, the subchannel allocation solution can achieve near optimal performances with low computational complexity compared with the optimal subchannel allocation (OSA) scheme.

84867812901	Superimposed training-based channel estimation for MIMO relay networks	We introduce the superimposed training strategy into the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) one-way relay network (OWRN) to perform the individual channel estimation at the destination. Through the superposition of a group of additional training vectors at the relay subject to power allocation, the separated estimates of the source-relay and relay-destination channels can be obtained directly at the destination, and the accordance with the two-hop AF strategy can be guaranteed at the same time. The closed-form Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived for the estimation of two sets of flat-fading MIMO channel under random channel parameters and further exploited to design the optimal training vectors. A specific suboptimal channel estimation algorithm is applied in the MIMO AF OWRN using the optimal training sequences, and the normalized mean square error performance for the estimation is provided to verify the Bayesian CRLB results. © 2012 Xiaoyan Xu et al.

59849124076	Approximate maximum likelihood serial decision-feedback equaliser and Tomlinson-Harashima pre-equalisation	Joint transmitter and receiver design problem for frequency-selective, time-invariant fading channels are studied. The authors first propose a simple approximate maximum likelihood serial decision-feedback equaliser (A-ML-SDFE) through DFE, a Gaussian approximation, a pre-whitening filter and a matched filter. Secondly, assuming full channel knowledge available at the transmitter side, the authors perform pre-equalisation in a downlink scenario by moving the decision-feedback part of the A-ML-SDFE to the transmitter. The proposed A-ML-SDFE achieves much better performance than linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) and MMSE-DFE with a lower complexity. The pre-equaliser further improves the system performance at low signal-to-noise ratio with a reduced receiver complexity. © 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

67349153313	Comparative analysis of quality of service and memory usage for adaptive failure detectors in healthcare systems	Failure detection (FD) is an important issue for supporting dependability in distributed healthcare systems to guarantee continuous, safe, secure, and dependable operation, and often is an important performance bottleneck in the event of node failure. FD can be used to manage the health status of communication for delivering telemedicine services, and then to help distributed healthcare system reduce fatal accident rate and increase the reliability and safety of systems. Ensuring acceptable quality of service (QoS) is made difficult by the relative unpredictability of the network environment. In this paper, first, we compare QoS metrics of several adaptive FDs, discuss their properties and their relation, and then propose one optimization over the existing methods, called tuning adaptive margin failure detector (TAM FD), which significantly improves QoS, especially in the aggressive range and when the network is unstable. Second, we address the problem of most adaptive schemes, namely their need for a large window of samples. So we also analyze the impact of memory size on the performance of FDs, and then prove that the presented scheme is designed to use a fixed and very limited amount of memory for the distributed system. Our experimental results over several kinds of networks (Cluster, WiFi, LAN, Intercontinental WAN) show that the properties of the existing adaptive failure detectors, and demonstrate that the optimization is reasonable and acceptable. Furthermore, the extensive experimental results show what is the effect of memory size on the overall QoS of each adaptive failure detector. For our TAM FD, the effect of window size on their QoS is very small and can be negligible. © 2006 IEEE.

66449121064	Approximate ML decision-feedback block equalizer for doubly selective fading channels	To effectively suppress intersymbol interference (ISI) at low complexity, in this paper, we propose an approximate maximum-likelihood decision-feedback block equalizer (A-ML-DFBE) for doubly selective (frequency- and time-selective) fading channels. The proposed equalizer design makes efficient use of the special time-domain representation of multipath channels through a matched filter, a sliding window, a Gaussian approximation, and a decision feedback. The A-ML-DFBE has the following features: 1) It achieves a performance that is close that to that of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) and significantly outperforms minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based detectors. 2) It has substantially lower complexity than conventional equalizers. 3) It easily realizes complexity and performance tradeoff by adjusting the length of the sliding window. 4) It has a simple and fixed-length feedback filter. The symbol error rate (SER) is derived to characterize the behavior of the A-ML-DFBE and can also be used to find the key parameters of the proposed equalizer. In addition, we further prove that the A-ML-DFBE obtains full multipath diversity. © 2009 IEEE.

70349173787	A hybrid relay selection scheme using differential modulation	In this paper, we propose a hybrid relay selection (HRS) scheme in a general cooperative network using differential modulation. In the HRS scheme, when the destination decodes successfully, the relay nodes will remain silent. Otherwise, optimal relay node has to be determined to make an additional transmission. In this process, all the relays are divided into two groups, referred to as an amplify-and-forward (AAF) relay group and a decode-and-forward (DAF) relay group depending on whether they can decode correctly or not. The relay, which has the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination, will be selected from both AAF and DAF relay groups. Simulation results show that the proposed relay selection scheme significantly outperforms the conventional AAF selection in terms of both frame error rate (FER) and throughput, and these performance gains considerably grow as the number of relay nodes increases. © 2009 IEEE.

73149094095	Differential coding for non-orthogonal space-time block codes with non-unitary constellations over arbitrarily correlated rayleigh channels	In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder for differentially encoded full-rank square nonorthogonal space-time block codes (STBCs) using unitary or non-unitary signal constellations, which is also applicable to full-ranked orthogonal STBC (OSTBC). As the receiver is jointly optimized with respect to the channel and the unknown data, it does not require any knowledge of channel power, signal power, or noise power to decode the signal, and the decision is purely based on two consecutively received data blocks. We analyze the effect of channel correlation on the performance of the proposed system in Rayleigh fading channels. Assuming a general correlation model, an upper bound of the pair-wise error probability (PEP) of the differential OSTBCs is derived. An approximate bound of the PEP for the differential nonorthogonal STBCs is also derived. We propose a precoder designing criterion for differential STBC over arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh channels. Precoding improves the system performance over the correlated Rayleigh MIMO channels. Our precoded differential codes differ from the previously proposed precoder designs for differential OSTBC in the following ways: 1) We propose a precoder design for arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh channels, whereas the previous work considers only for transmit correlation. 2) The previous work is only applicable to the OSTBCs with PSK constellations, whereas our precoder is applicable to any type of full-rank square STBCs with unitary and non-unitary signal constellations. © 2006 IEEE.

74549205175	Double-differential orthogonal space-time block codes for arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh channels with carrier offsets	The presence of carrier offsets in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels is an important practical and theoretical problem. Double-differential coding is a technique which allows the receiver to decode the data without any channel or carrier offset knowledge. We propose a double-differential (DD) coding scheme which is applicable to square orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) using M-PSK constellation. The main advantages of our proposed DD coding scheme are: 1) The previously proposed DD codes are applicable only to the specific class of space-time block codes which follow the diagonal unitary group property, whereas our DD coding is applicable to any square OSTBC. 2) We propose a suboptimal decoder which preserves the linear decoding property of the OSTBC. 3) A theoretical analysis is performed to find a pairwise error probability (PEP) upper bound of the proposed doubledifferential orthogonal space-time block codes (DDOSTBC). 4) In order to improve the performance of DDOSTBC over the arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh channels we propose a precoder which minimizes an upper bound of the PEP. The proposed DDOSTBC are able to achieve higher coding gain than the similar rate existing DD coding scheme. In addition, the proposed precoded DDOSTBC achieves performance gain for correlated channels as compared to the unprecoded DDOSTBC. © 2006 IEEE.

77952081122	QoS-aware packet forwarding in MIMO sensor networks: A cross-layer approach	Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming increasingly important since significant performance enhancement can be realized. In this paper, we propose a packet forward strategy for MIMO sensor networks by jointly considering channel coding, rate adaptation, and power allocation. Each sensor node has multiple antennas and uses orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBC) to exploit both spatial and temporal diversities. The objective is to determine the optimal routing path that achieves the minimum symbol error rate (SER) subject to the source-to-destination (S-D) energy consumption constraint. This SER-based quality-of-service (QoS) aware packet forwarding problem is formulated into the framework of dynamic programming (DP). We then propose a low-complexity and near-optimal approach to considerably reduce the computation complexity, which includes state space partition and state aggregation techniques. Simulations indicate that the proposed protocol significantly outperforms traditional algorithms. Further still, the performance gain increases with tighter S-D energy constraint. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold is designed in comparison with the instantaneous SNR to determine if the frame can be decoded correctly or not. The relays that decode correctly will choose decode-and-forward (DF) protocol and be included in the DF relay group. The rest will employ amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol and be included in the AF relay group. Then, among all the relays in the AF and DF relay groups, the one that realizes the maximum destination SNR will be finally selected as the optimal relay. The performance of the proposed THS scheme is analyzed, and a simple asymptotic SER and FER expressions are derived. The analytical results are verified through simulations.

We investigate secure communications of this two-way relay scenario using physical layer security. Specifically, we treat the relay node as an eavesdropper from whom the information transmitted by the sources needs to be kept secret, despite the fact that its cooperation in relaying this information is essential. We first find that a non-zero secrecy rate is indeed achievable in this two-way relay network even without external jammers. Further still, with the help of friendly jammers who can transmit jamming signals to distract the malicious relay, a positive gain of the secrecy rate can be realized. In order to obtain the maximum secrecy rate, we define and then analyze an optimization problem.

79960609240	Enforce truth-telling in wireless relay networks for secure communication	To ensure security in data transmission is one of the most important issues for wireless relay networks. In this paper, we consider a cooperative network, consisting of one source node, one destination node, one eavesdropper node, and a number of relay nodes. Specifically, the source selects several relay nodes which can help forward the signal to the corresponding destination to achieve the best security performance. However, the relay nodes may have the incentive not to report their true private channel information in order to get more chance to be selected and gain more payoff from the source. We employ a self-enforcing truth-telling mechanism into the network to solve this cheating problem. By adding a transfer payoff to the total payoff of each selected relay node, we prove that each relay node would get its maximum expected payoff only when it tells the truth to the source. And then, an optimal secrecy capacity of the network can be achieved. Simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed mechanism. © 2011 IEEE.

The SU pairs share the same frequency band with a primary user (PU) by satisfying the interference power constraint, and the eavesdropper can listen to all the frequency bands. Our goal is to maximize the sum secrecy rate of the SU pairs and meanwhile preserve fairness by suitably allocating the power of the relay station (RS). We introduce a sequential second price auction as the mechanism. Specifically, the total power of the RS is divided into several homogeneous units and auctioned off in sequence, with each round a typical second price auction. First, we formulate the value of each power unit for each SU pair, which is fundamental in the proposed auction, and then based on this auction we construct an efficient searching algorithm, which leads to only one equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed game achieves promising performance in the total secrecy rate, total revenue, and fairness under randomness of terminal location and the time-varying nature of wireless channels. © 2011 IEEE.

80052147389	Feedback control game for channel state information in wireless networks	It has been well recognized that channel state information (CSI) feedback is important for dowlink transmissions of closed-loop wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the CSI feedback rate control problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic framework, where a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with a number of co-channel mobile stations (MS) through a minimum mean square error (MMSE) precoder. Specifically, we present a non-cooperative feedback-rate control game with price (NFCP) over orthogonal feedback channels with a total bandwidth constraint. The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback minus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback rate, subject to an overall bandwidth constraint. The existence of the Nash equilibrium of such a game is investigated. Simulation results show that the distributed game approach results in close optimal performance compared with the centralized scheme. © 2011 IEEE.

80051756389	Sleeping management for scalable topology control in wireless sensor networks	Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important instrument to realize wireless monitoring and control in various application fields. Energy conservation are crucial for WSNs to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, we study sleeping management schemes which can efficiently control the network topology and significantly reduce the energy consumption by selectively turning off the radios of abundant sensor nodes. Based on the observation that a Matérn Hard-core Process (MHP) could thin out evenly distributed nodes from a dense graph, we propose Backbone Energy Efficient Sleeping (BEES) management scheme, whose central idea is to generate and maintain the backbone by simulating MHPs. There are three attractive features of BEES: (i) the backbone size could be conveniently scaled according to the practical requirements; (ii) the backbone is energy efficient in the point of view of packet forwarding (or routing); (iii) the construction of backbone is robust to possible ranging errors, which ensures the feasibility and reliability in practice. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of BEES. Numerical results indicate that, compared with two existing sleeping management schemes, BEES provides about 30% wider range of scalability, consumes about 13% less routing energy, and achieves 11% ∼ 20% longer network lifetime under different traffic loads.

80052165426	Joint relay and jammer selection for secure two-way relay networks	In this paper, we investigate joint relay and jammer selection in two-way cooperative networks, consisting of two sources, a number of intermediate nodes, and one eavesdropper, with secrecy constraints. Specifically, the proposed algorithms select two or three intermediate nodes to enhance security against the malicious eavesdropper. The first selected node operates in the conventional relay mode and assists the sources to deliver their data to the corresponding destinations via the amplify-and-forward protocol. The second and third nodes are used in different communication phases as jammers in order to create intentional interference upon the eavesdropper node. Firstly, we find that in a topology where the relay and jamming nodes are randomly and sparsely distributed, the proposed schemes with cooperative jamming outperforms the conventional non-jamming schemes within a certain transmitted power regime. We also find that, in the scenario in which the intermediate nodes gather as a close cluster, the jamming schemes may be less effective than their non-jamming counterparts. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid scheme to switch between jamming and non-jamming modes. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis that the hybrid switching scheme further improves the secrecy rate. © 2011 IEEE.

80052174337	Distributed coalition formation of relay and friendly jammers for secure cooperative networks	In this paper, we investigate cooperation of conventional relays and friendly jammers subject to secrecy constraints for cooperative networks consisting of one source node, one corresponding destination node, one malicious eavesdropper node, and several intermediate nodes. In order to obtain a higher secrecy rate, the source selects one conventional relay and several friendly jammers from the intermediate nodes to assist message transmission, and in return, it needs to make a payment. Each intermediate node here has two possible identities to choose, i.e., to be a conventional relay or a friendly jammer, which results in a direct impact on the final utility of the intermediate node. After the intermediate nodes determine their identities, they seek to find optimal partners forming coalitions, which improves their chances to be selected by the source and thus to obtain the payoffs in the end. We formulate this cooperation as a coalitional game with transferable utility and also study its properties. Furthermore, we define a Max-Pareto order for comparison of the coalition value, based on which we employ the merge-and-split rules. We also construct a distributed merge-and-split coalition formation algorithm for the defined coalition formation game. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed coalition formation algorithm. © 2011 IEEE.

80052177691	Relay selection for bi-directional amplify-and-forward wireless networks	In this paper, we propose a relay selection amplify-and-forward (RS-AF) protocol in general bi-directional relay networks with two sources and N relays. In the proposed scheme, the two sources first transmit to all the relays simultaneously, and then a single relay will be selected to broadcast the received signals back to both sources to achieve a minimum sum symbol error rate (SER). To facilitate the selection process, we propose sub-optimal Max-Min criterions, where a single relay which minimizes the maximum SER of two source nodes will be selected. Simulation results show that the proposed Max-Min selection approaches can obtain comparable performance as the optimal selection with a reduced-complexity. We also present simple asymptotic SER expressions and make comparison with the conventional all-participate amplify-and-forward (AP-AF) relaying scheme. The analytical results are verified through simulations. To improve the system performance, optimum power allocation (OPA) between the sources and the relay is determined based on the analytical results. Simulations indicate that the proposed RS-AF scheme with OPA yields considerable performance improvement over an equal power allocation (EPA) scheme. © 2011 IEEE.

84555178433	A feedback rate control game using sequential second price auction for channel state information and intercell interference in wireless networks	It has been well recognized that the capacity of a wireless system is usually limited because of intracell interference and intercell interference (ICI), and many technologies have been used to combat against them in different systems. Here, we consider a closed-loop wireless network with a limited feedback rate. In such networks, channel state information (CSI) feedback has become a well recognized technique that significantly increases the down link capacity by suppressing interference. However, the existing work typically focuses more on discussing each individual mobile station (MS) rather than modeling the interactions among self-interested users in the network level. In addition, the ICI is always not considered. To this end, we propose an alternative approach to investigate CSI and ICI simultaneously in one feedback control problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic framework, in which a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with a number of co-channel MSs through a linear precoder with the co-channel cells around. Specifically, we present a feedback-rate control game using sequential second price auction, in which the feedback rate is divided into homogeneous units and auctioned off sequentially among the MSs, and for each MS the feedback rate is optimized between CSI and ICI in order to gain the largest channel capacity. Our goal is to find a productive and justified mechanism to distribute the total feedback rate, which brings not only a good performance in the sum channel capacity but also a preservation in fairness among the MSs. Simulation results show that the proposed game achieves promising performance in both efficiency and fairness under randomness of terminal location and the time-varying nature of wireless channels. © 2011 IEEE.

84855466709	Non-cooperative feedback-rate control game for channel state information in wireless networks	It has been well recognized that channel state information (CSI) feedback is of great importance for dowlink transmissions of closed-loop wireless networks. However, the existing work typically researched the CSI feedback problem for each individual mobile station (MS), and thus, cannot efficiently model the interactions among self-interested mobile users in the network level. To this end, in this paper, we propose an alternative approach to investigate the CSI feedback-rate control problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic framework, in which a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with a number of co-channel MSs through linear precoder. Specifically, we first present a non-cooperative feedback-rate control game (NFC), in which each MS selects the feedback-rate to maximize its performance in a distributed way. To improve efficiency from a social optimum point of view, we then introduce pricing, called the non-cooperative feedback-rate control game with price (NFCP). The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback minus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback-rate. The existence of the Nash equilibrium of such games is investigated, and two types of feedback protocols (FDMA and CSMA) are studied. Simulation results show that by adjusting the pricing factor, the distributed NFCP game results in close optimal performance compared with that of the centralized scheme. © 2012 IEEE.

84855692669	Joint optimization of power, packet forwarding and reliability in MIMO wireless sensor networks	In this paper, we study the reliable packet forwarding in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBC) techniques. The objective is to propose a cross-layer optimized forwarding scheme to maximize the Successful Transmission Rate (STR) while satisfying the given end-to-end power consumption constraint. The channel coding, power allocation, and route planning are jointly considered to significantly improve the transmission quality in terms of STR. The joint optimization design is formulated as a global deterministic optimization and also a local stochastic optimization issues. It is found that the stochastic optimization approach can effectively model, analyze, and solve the routing problem. In order to substantially reduce the implementation complication of the global optimization, we propose a lowcomplexity distributed scheme. The determination of relaying nodes and power budgets are decoupled, i.e. performing route planning and power allocation separately. We have shown that the result in the distributed scheme is able to provide sufficiently accurate predication of the global optimization. In addition, the proposed scheme can clearly reduce the Symbol Error Rate (SER) and achieve higher STR compared with two existing energy-efficient routing protocols, in which no joint design is considered. © The Author(s) 2010.

84860561074	Secondary users cooperation in cognitive radio networks: Balancing sensing accuracy and efficiency	Cooperative spectrum sensing is a promising technique in cognitive radio networks by exploiting multi-user diversity to mitigate channel fading. Cooperative sensing is traditionally employed to improve the sensing accuracy while the sensing efficiency has been largely ignored. However, both sensing accuracy and efficiency have very significant impacts on the overall system performance. In this article, we first identify the fundamental trade-off between sensing accuracy and efficiency in spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. Then, we present several different cooperation mechanisms, including sequential, full-parallel, semi-parallel, synchronous, and asynchronous cooperative sensing schemes. The proposed cooperation mechanisms and the sensing accuracy-efficiency trade-off in these schemes are elaborated and analyzed with respect to a new performance metric achievable throughput, which simultaneously considers both transmission gain and sensing overhead. Illustrative results indicate that parallel and asynchronous cooperation strategies are able to achieve much higher performance, compared to existing and traditional cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

However, most of the existing IA schemes require global channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter to design precoding vectors, which causes a large amount of feedback bits. To reduce the feedback overhead, in this paper, we model the evolution and dynamic behavior of the CSI feedback rate control problem using the evolutionary game theory over orthogonal feedback channels with a total bandwidth constraint. The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback minus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback rate, subject to an overall bandwidth constraint. Then, an algorithm for the implementation of the evolution process is also presented. The proposed game-theoretic framework for modeling the interactions among the feedback of multiple users can be used to efficiently control the CSI feedback amount while achieving fairness among all the mobile receivers. © 2011 IEEE.

Specifically, we regard the intermediate relay as an eavesdropper from which the information transmitted by the sources needs to be kept confidential, despite the fact that its cooperation in relaying this information is essential. We first indicate that a nonzero secrecy rate is indeed achievable in this two-way untrusted relay system even without the help of external friendly jammers. As for the system with friendly jammers, after further analysis, we can obtain the secrecy rate of the sources can be effectively improved by utilizing proper jamming power from the friendly jammers. Then, we formulate a Stackelberg game between the sources and the friendly jammers as a power control scheme to achieve the optimized secrecy rate of the sources, in which the sources are treated as the sole buyer and the friendly jammers are the sellers. In addition, the optimal solutions of the jamming power and the asking prices are given, and a distributed updating algorithm to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium is provided for the proposed game.

The pairwise error probability (PEP) and block error rate (BLER) of the DDSTC-ANC scheme are analyzed. Exact and simplified PEP expressions are derived, which can be used for power allocation between the source and relay nodes. The analytical results are verified through simulations. © 2012 IEEE.

84881579656	Overlapping coalitional games for collaborative sensing in cognitive radio networks	Collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) has been shown to be able to highly improve the performance of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. However, most existing works focused on either centralized approaches that rely on a global fusion center, thus requiring significant overhead, or on distributed approaches that rely on disjoint coalitions of secondary users (SUs) in which an SU can only cooperate with a single, selected coalition, hence limiting the performance gains of CSS. In this paper, a novel, coalition-based approach to CSS is proposed in which an SU can share its sensing results with more than one coalition. The problem is formulated using a novel class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalitional games, which enables the SUs to decide, in a distributed manner, on the number of coalitions in which they wish to cooperate, depending on the associated benefit and cost tradeoffs. To solve this game, a novel, distributed algorithm is proposed using which the SUs can self-organize into a stable overlapping coalitional structure. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance in terms of both the average probability of misdetection and the convergence time, relative to the noncooperative case and the state-of-art cooperative CSS with non-overlapping coalitions. © 2013 IEEE.

In this paper, we investigate cell selection problem in a two-tier femtocell network that contains a micro base station (MBS) and several femtocells with different access methods and coverage areas. We propose the evolutionary game model to describe the dynamics of the cell selection process and consider the evolutionary equilibrium as the solution. In order to achieve the evolutionary equilibrium, we introduce the reinforcement learning algorithm that can help distributed individual users make selection decisions independently. With their own knowledge of the past, the users can learn to achieve the evolutionary equilibrium without complete knowledge of other users. Finally, the performance of the evolutionary game and reinforcement learning algorithm is analyzed, and simulation results show the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

84881592559	Joint scheduling and resource allocation for device-to-device underlay communication	Device-to-device (D2D) communication as an underlay to cellular networks can bring significant benefits to users' throughput. However, as D2D user equipments (UEs) can cause interference to cellular UEs, the scheduling and allocation of channel resources and power to D2D communication need elaborate coordination. In this paper, we propose a joint scheduling and resource allocation scheme to improve the performance of D2D communication. We take network throughput and UEs' fairness into account by performing interference management. Specifically, we develop a Stackelberg game framework in which we group a cellular UE and a D2D UE to form a leader-follower pair. The cellular user is the leader, and the D2D UE is the follower who buys channel resources from the leader. We analyze the equilibrium of the game, and propose an algorithm for joint scheduling and resource allocation. Finally, we perform computer simulations to study the performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

84881596589	Overlapping coalition formation games for cooperative interference management in small cell networks	In this paper, we study the problem of cooperative interference management in an OFDMA two-tier small cell network. In particular, we propose a new approach for allowing the small cells to cooperate, so as to optimize their sum-rate, while cooperatively satisfying their maximum transmit power constraints. Unlike existing works which assume that only disjoint groups of cooperative small cells can emerge, we formulate the small cells' cooperation problem as an overlapping coalition formation game. In this game, each small cell base station can choose to participate in one or more cooperative groups (or coalitions) simultaneously, so as to optimize the tradeoff between the benefits and costs associated with cooperation. We study the properties of the proposed game and we show that it exhibits negative externalities due to interference. Then, we propose a novel decentralized algorithm that allows the small cell base stations to interact and self-organize into a stable overlapping coalitional structure. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm results in a notable performance advantage in terms of the total system sum-rate, relative to the noncooperative case and the classical algorithms for coalitional games with non-overlapping coalitions. © 2013 IEEE.

By considering the femtocell base station (BS) as the auctioneer and the femtocell users as the bidders, we formulate this problem as an auction game, which aims at minimizing the total power radiated by the femtocell BS and guaranteeing the throughput requirement of the femtocell. Moreover, we propose a novel auction-based distributed algorithm, which can simultaneously allocate the power and subchannel resource through the auction game and achieve the near optimal performance with low computational complexity. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate our proposed algorithm can effectively allocate power and frequency while obtaining a good performance of throughput requirement and power consumption. © 2012 IEEE.

However, the allocation of radio resources and power to D2D communication needs elaborate coordination, as D2D communication causes interference to cellular networks. In this paper, we propose a novel joint radio resource and power allocation scheme to improve the performance of the system in the uplink period. Energy efficiency is considered as our optimization objective since devices are handheld equipments with limited battery life. We formulate the the allocation problem as a reverse iterative combinatorial auction game. In the auction, radio resources occupied by cellular users are considered as bidders competing for D2D packages and their corresponding transmit power. We propose an algorithm to solve the allocation problem as an auction game. We also perform numerical simulations to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.

84883448132	Dynamic popular content distribution in vehicular networks using coalition formation games	Driven by both safety concerns and commercial interests, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have recently received considerable attentions. In this paper, we address popular content distribution (PCD) in VANETs, in which one large popular file is downloaded from a stationary roadside unit (RSU), by a group of on-board units (OBUs) driving through an area of interest (AoI) along a highway. Due to high speeds of vehicles and deep fadings of vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) channels, some of the vehicles may not finish downloading the entire file but only possess several pieces of it. To successfully send a full copy to each OBU, we propose a cooperative approach based on coalition formation games, in which OBUs exchange their possessed pieces by broadcasting to and receiving from their neighbors. Simulation results show that our proposed approach presents a considerable performance improvement relative to the non-cooperative approach, in which the OBUs broadcast randomly selected pieces to their neighbors as along as the spectrum is detected to be unoccupied. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

84883462421	Wideband channel modeling and intercarrier interference cancellation for Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication systems	In this paper, we propose a new regular-shaped geometry-based stochastic model (RS-GBSM) for non-isotropic scattering wideband multiple-input multiple-output vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) Ricean fading channels. By correcting the unrealistic assumption widely used in current RS-GBSMs, the proposed model can more practically study the impact of the vehicular traffic density on channel statistics for different time delays. From the proposed model, we derive the Doppler power spectral density (PSD) and find that highly dynamic Doppler spectrum appears for V2V channels. Excellent agreement is achieved between the derived Doppler PSD and measured data, demonstrating the utility of the proposed model. To combat the intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by highly dynamic Doppler spectrum in real orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based V2V systems, this paper proposes a new type of ICI cancellation scheme, named as precoding based cancellation (PBC) scheme. The proposed scheme can be easily implemented into real V2V systems with the same ICI mitigation performance as the current best ICI cancellation scheme that has high complexity. To further improve the performance of the proposed PBC scheme, a new phase rotation aided (PRA) method, namely constant PRA (CPRA) method, is proposed. Compared with the existing PRA method, the CPRA method has better performance and much less implementation complexity. Therefore, the proposed PBC scheme with the CPRA method is the best ICI cancellation scheme for real V2V systems. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

84884841690	Truthful mechanisms for secure communication in wireless cooperative system	To ensure security in data transmission is one of the most important issues for wireless relay networks, and physical layer security is an attractive alternative solution to address this issue. In this paper, we consider a cooperative network, consisting of one source node, one destination node, one eavesdropper node, and a number of relay nodes. Specifically, the source may select several relays to help forward the signal to the corresponding destination to achieve the best security performance. However, the relays may have the incentive not to report their true private channel information in order to get more chances to be selected and gain more payoff from the source. We propose a Vickey-Clark-Grove (VCG) based mechanism and an Arrow-d'Aspremont- Gerard-Varet (AGV) based mechanism into the investigated relay network to solve this cheating problem. In these two different mechanisms, we design different transfer payment functions to the payoff of each selected relay and prove that each relay gets its maximum (expected) payoff when it truthfully reveals its private channel information to the source. And then, an optimal secrecy rate of the network can be achieved. After discussing and comparing the VCG and AGV mechanisms, we prove that the AGV mechanism can achieve all of the basic qualifications (incentive compatibility, individual rationality and budget balance) for our system. Moreover, we discuss the optimal quantity of relays that the source node should select. Simulation results verify efficiency and fairness of the VCG and AGV mechanisms, and consolidate these conclusions. © 2013 IEEE.

Here, we formulate the spectrum allocation problem as a multi-object auction and introduce the mechanisms of sequential first price auction (SFPA) and sequential second price auction (SSPA), where for each mechanism, the optimal bidding strategy is analyzed and the corresponding algorithm is given. Simulation results show that both the proposed algorithms cost only 25% ∼ 35% feedback overhead, but achieve about 95% total transmission rate (with SSPA having a slightly better performance), compared with the optimal algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

Due to fast speeds and deep fading, some file packets might be lost during the vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) broadcasting stage. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach to allow the OBUs to exchange data and complement the missing packets. Specifically, we introduce a coalitional graph game to model the cooperation among OBUs and propose a coalition formation algorithm to implement the P2P approach. Moreover, cognitive radio (CR) is utilized for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) transmissions so that the P2P approach does not require additional bandwidth. Simulation results show that the proposed approach performs better under various conditions, relative to the noncooperative approach, in which the OBUs share no information and simply respond to any data request from other OBUs. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

84888098994	A differential feedback scheme exploiting the temporal and spectral correlation	Channel state information (CSI) provided by a limited feedback channel can be utilized to increase system throughput. However, in multiple-input-multiple- output (MIMO) systems, the signaling overhead realizing this CSI feedback can be quite large, whereas the capacity of the uplink feedback channel is typically limited. Hence, it is crucial to reduce the amount of feedback bits. Prior work on limited feedback compression commonly adopted the block-fading channel model, where only temporal or spectral correlation in a wireless channel is considered. In this paper, we propose a differential feedback scheme with full use of the temporal and spectral correlations to reduce the feedback load. Then, the minimal differential feedback rate over a MIMO time-frequency (or doubly)-selective fading channel is investigated. Finally, the analysis is verified by simulation results. © 2013 IEEE.

84888119208	Relay selection for bidirectional AF relay network with outdated CSI	Most previous works on relay selection (RS) of bidirectional relay networks typically assume perfect channel state information (CSI). However, outdated CSI, which is caused by the time variation of channels, cannot be ignored in the practical system, and it will deteriorate performance. In this paper, the effect of outdated CSI on the performance of bidirectional amplify-and-forward (AF) RS is investigated. The optimal single-RS scheme in minimizing the symbol error rate (SER) is revised by incorporating the outdated channels. The analytical expression of the end-to-end SER is derived in a closed form, along with the asymptotic SER expression in a high SNR. All the analytical expressions are verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The analytical and simulation results reveal that once CSI is outdated, the diversity order degrades to one from full diversity. Furthermore, a multiple-RS scheme is proposed, which is a feasible solution to compensate the diversity loss caused by outdated CSI. © 2013 IEEE.

In this paper, we propose a novel resource allocation scheme to improve the performance of D2D communication. Battery lifetime is explicitly considered as our optimization goal. We first formulate the allocation problem as a non-cooperative resource allocation game in which D2D UEs are viewed as players competing for channel resources. Then, we add pricing to the game in order to improve the efficacy, and propose an efficient auction algorithm. We also perform simulations to prove efficacy of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

Specifically, we formulate a coalitional game with transferable utility, in which each user intends to maximize its own utility and has the incentive to cooperate with other users to form a strengthened user group that can increase the opportunity to win its preferred spectrum resources. Furthermore, we propose a distributed merge-and-split based coalition formation algorithm based on a new defined Max-Coalition order to effectively process the resource allocation problem.

Due to the high speeds, the OBUs may not finish downloading a large file within the limited time for vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) communication and a peer-to-peer (P2P) network consisting of OBUs out of the RSU coverage can be constructed for completing the file delivery process. However, due to fast and unpredictable topological changes of the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), the static methods in traditional P2P networks can be inefficient. We model this problem as a coalition formation game with transferable utilities, and propose a coalition formation algorithm that converges into a Nash-stable partition adapting to environmental changes. Based on this algorithm, we further propose a distributed scheme for the overall PCD problem. Simulation results show that our scheme presents a considerable performance improvement relative to the non-cooperative case using the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). © 2013 IEEE.

84891356300	Energy efficiency of large scale MIMO systems with transmit antenna selection	In this paper, we perform transmit antenna selection to improve the energy efficiency of large scale MIMO systems. We first derive a good approximation of the distribution of the mutual information in this antenna selection system. It shows that channel hardening phenomenon is still retained as full complexity with a large number of available antennas, though the number of actually used antennas can be small. Then, we use this closed-form expression to assess the energy efficiency performance. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the energy efficiency in two different cases: 1) the circuit power consumption is comparable to or even dominates the transmit power, and 2) the circuit power can be ignored due to high transmit power. The theoretical analysis indicates that there exists an optimal number of selected antennas less than the number of the total available antennas to maximize the energy efficiency in the first case, whereas in the second case, the energy efficiency is maximized when all the available antennas are used. All the analytical results are verified through computer simulations. © 2013 IEEE.

We first develop a bidirectional transmission scheme using NC where the information exchange in a two-way multihop relay network with the arbitrary number of hops can be completed in four transmission phases. As a result, the maximum achievable throughput does not decrease as the number of hops increases. To overcome the error propagation in the multihop transmission with decode-and-forward (DF) protocol in wireless fading channels, a selective NC scheme is proposed. In addition, we apply differential modulation in the proposed scheme to avoid channel estimation in the multihop networks. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed, and a closed-form frame error rate (FER) expression is derived. It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both FER performance and network throughput compared to the conventional multihop DF scheme in TWRNs.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to investigate the EE for wireless communication networks through controlling the channel state information (CSI) in the feedback link, in which a number of multiple-antenna mobile transmitters exchange information with their corresponding mobile receivers using linear precoding for interference reduction. Specially, we formulate this EE maximization problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic framework, and propose a two-level Stackelberg-type CSI feedback control game (SCFC) to balance the bandwidth and power consumptions in a distributed manner. The existence of the equilibriums of such games is proved, and the convergence behavior is investigated. Simulation results show that by adjusting the pricing factor, the proposed distributed SCFC game effectively improves the EE performance. © 2013 IEEE.

84891530440	Weighted amplify-and-forward relay selection with outdated channel state information	Relay selection (RS) is a promising technique in the cooperative communications, which can achieve full diversity with the best relay when the channel state information (CSI) is perfect. However, the performance of conventional RS degrades greatly, once CSI is outdated. To compensate the performance loss caused by the outdated CSI, we propose the weighted RS scheme, in which a deterministic weight factor is introduced in the selection process. The performance bound of outage probability for the weighted RS is derived and verified, along with the asymptotic expression. Based on the analytical expression, the optimal weight factor in minimizing the outage probability is obtained. Simulation results reveal that when the CSI is outdated, the proposed RS with the optimal weight factor yields the significant performance gain over the conventional RS, especially in high signal-to-noise ratio. © 2012 IEEE.

An innovative resource allocation scheme is proposed to improve the performance of mobile peer-to-peer, i.e., device-to-device (D2D), communications as an underlay in the downlink (DL) cellular networks. To optimize the system sum rate over the resource sharing of both D2D and cellular modes, we introduce a reverse iterative combinatorial auction as the allocation mechanism. In the auction, all the spectrum resources are considered as a set of resource units, which as bidders compete to obtain business while the packages of the D2D pairs are auctioned off as goods in each auction round. We first formulate the valuation of each resource unit, as a basis of the proposed auction. And then a detailed non-monotonic descending price auction algorithm is explained depending on the utility function that accounts for the channel gain from D2D and the costs for the system. Further, we prove that the proposed auction-based scheme is cheat-proof, and converges in a finite number of iteration rounds. We explain non-monotonicity in the price update process and show lower complexity compared to a traditional combinatorial allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm efficiently leads to a good performance on the system sum rate.

84898966793	Turning interference weakness into PHY security enhancement for cognitive radio networks	Traditionally, the transmitting power of secondary users (SUs) in the cognitive radio (CR) network is limited under a certain threshold, since it is harmful for primary user's (PU) channel capacity. However, when it comes to PU's secrecy capacity, the transmitting power may be either harmful or beneficial. On one hand, the attendance of SUs in the CR network can be threatened to PU's main channel and decreases PU's secrecy capacity. On the other hand, the signals transmitted by SUs can also decrease the wire-tap channel capacity, and therefore improves PU's secrecy capacity. In order to find the tradeoff, by modeling this scenario as a coalition formation game, we apply the 'merge' and 'split' algorithm to select the appropriate SUs which are beneficial to PU's secrecy capacity. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.

D2D communication can use either one-hop transmission (i.e. D2D direct communication) or multi-hop clusterbased transmission (i.e. in D2D local area networks). The D2D devices can compete or cooperate with each other to reuse the radio resources in D2D networks. Therefore, resource allocation and access for D2D communication can be treated as games. The theories behind these games provide a variety of mathematical tools to effectively model and analyze the individual or group behaviors of D2D users. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the resource allocation problems for D2D communication.

We model the channels as line-of-sight (LoS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ones and focus on the channel eigenvalue characterization when the Rayleigh distance criterion cannot be fulfilled due to limited physical sizes of the transmitter and receiver. We first derive explicit expressions for some channel eigenvalues at certain discrete system settings. Asymptotic analyses are then developed when the antenna numbers at the transmitter and receiver or the distance between them goes to infinity. Based on these analytical results, the maximum eigenvalue and the effective multiplexing distance (EMD) of the E-band channel are investigated, where EMD is defined as the end-to-end distance at which the channel can support a certain number of simultaneous spatial streams at a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We analytically show that the EMD for a given number of parallel signal transmissions is mainly determined by the product of the aperture sizes of the transmit and receive ULAs. Numerical results are provided to validate the analyses. © 2014 IEEE.

However, the quality and quantity of the sensed data uploaded by the users are not always satisfying due to the lack of incentives for users to participate. In this paper, we design an incentive mechanism in which the users can get satisfying rewards from the platform by efficiently allocating their resources, and meanwhile, the platform can achieve a relatively high social welfare. Specifically, to solve the resource allocation problem in the incentive mechanism, we consider a cooperative game model with overlapping coalitions, in which the smartphone users can self-organize into the overlapping coalitions for different sensing tasks. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm that converges to a stable outcome in which no user has the motivation to change its current resource allocation so as to increase its individual payoff unilaterally.

84904489238	Radio resource allocation for full-duplex OFDMA networks using matching theory	Wireless radio links are generally half-duplex, i.e., they can either transmit or receive in a single channel but not both simultaneously. To achieve single band simultaneous bidirectional communication, full-duplex radio links are recently utilized in wireless networks. Adoption of OFDMA scheme in the full-duplex radio links has also stimulated new research interest to improve the wireless networks' transmission rate even further [1]. Typically, a full-duplex OFDMA network consists of a common base station (BS), and multiple users as transmitters (TXs) and receivers (RXs). To achieve a satisfying sum-rate in the network, the TXs and RXs need to be properly paired into separate transceiver units, and a suitable subcarrier should be assigned to each transceiver unit. The BS also allocates proper power level to each transceiver unit such that the rate performance of the whole network is maximized. Due to the combinatorial nature of pairing multiple TXs, RXs, and subcarriers, and also the complexity of optimal power allocation to each subcarrier-transceiver pair, resource allocation in such a full-duplex OFDMA network can be very challenging. © 2014 IEEE.

To decrease the total delay, the authors in [1] proposed a cluster-based D2D network in which files are transmitted from the BS to several cluster-heads, and then shared inside each cluster through D2D communication. Distributed caching is another option to enhance the transmission rate by precaching files to users, with which mobile users with the same interest can share files directly through D2D communication [2]. However, most of the current studies on D2D-based file sharing schemes typically assume that all users are separated in non-overlapping communities that each user can only select one sort of files, and ignore the social relations among mobile users. When considering heterogeneous but overlapping interests of users, how to utilize social ties for multi-file sharing with minimum delay is still a challenging problem. To this end, we propose a graph based social aware algorithm in which cellular links and D2D links are established according to social ties and social contributions of users for efficient multi-file dissemination. © 2014 IEEE.

But, due to the irregular topology of smart meter networks and various types of data traffic of electrical appliances, the data aggregation to the heads and associated spectrum allocation become quite challenging. To solve these problems, we first analyze the relationship between the system performance and the cost of network construction. By using coalition formation game theory, we propose a practical strategy in optimizing channel allocation and cluster-heads deployment. The proposed algorithms are verified through computer simulations. © 2014 IEEE.

84906996552	Joint relay and antenna selection for full-duplex AF relay networks	In this paper, we propose a joint relay and antenna selection scheme in general full-duplex (FD) relay networks with one source, one destination and N FD amplify-and-forward (AF) relays. Each FD relay is equipped with two antennas, one for receiving and one for transmitting. We consider a joint antenna and relay selection scheme to optimize the end-to-end error performance. In the proposed scheme, each relay adaptively selects the transmit antenna and receive antenna based on the instantaneous channel conditions, and the optimal single relay with the optimal Tx/Rx antenna configuration is selected to optimize the end-to-end performance of the system transmission. This is in contrast to the conventional pure FD relay selection, where the Tx and Rx FD antenna of each relay are fixed. The proposed scheme achieves an extra space diversity due to the antenna selection at the relay nodes, and considerably improves the system performance compared to the conventional FD relay selection. Furthermore, closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average symbol error rate (SER) are derived. The analytical results are verified by the computer simulations. Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional full-duplex relay selection scheme with fixed relay Tx and Rx antennas. © 2014 IEEE.

84907000757	Millimeter wave wireless transmissions at E-band channels with uniform linear antenna arrays: Beyond the Rayleigh distance	In this paper, we study the point-to-point E-band millimeter wave wireless channel with uniform linear antenna arrays (ULAs) deployed at both link ends and present an analytical approach to characterize the channel behavior. We first derive explicit expressions for some channel eigenvalues at certain discrete system settings. The asymptotic behavior and the effective multiplexing distance (EMD) of the E-band channel are then investigated, where the latter is defined as the end-to-end distance at which the channel can support a certain number of spatially independent streams at finite signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We analytically show that the EMD for a given number of parallel signal transmissions is mainly determined by the product of the aperture sizes of the transmit and receive ULAs. This finding provides useful insights into the design of practical multi-gigabits wireless communication systems over E-band. © 2014 IEEE.

84907003865	Radio resource allocation for physical-layer security in D2D underlay communications	Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have been proposed recently to improve the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider physical-layer security in D2D communication as an underlay to cellular networks with an eavesdropper. Benefiting from the underlaid spectrum reuse, D2D users can contribute to the system secrecy capacity, while D2D users may interfere the cellular users and decrease their secrecy capacity. We formulate this problem as a matching problem in the weighted bipartite graph and introduce the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm to provide the optimal solution. Simulation results show that the system secrecy capacity can be greatly improved by introducing D2D communications underlaying cellular networks. © 2014 IEEE.

84915749970	SDN based uniform network architecture for future wireless networks	Cellular networks and WLAN are the two popular wireless network structures in current wireless network systems. Cellular networks support seamless coverage and high-speed mobility, while its data bandwidth is limited. On the other hand, WLAN support high bandwidth data transmission with local coverage area and walking-speed mobility. A new wireless architecture combining the advantages of both cellular and WLAN has been the people's objective all along. In this paper, we propose a uniform wireless network architecture (U-WN) trying to achieve this goal, based on the spirit of software defined networking. Specifically, based on our analysis on the characteristics of wireless networks, we propose special designs for SDN architecture and investigate the detailed design of both controller and the nodes in the network. Furthermore, the possible applications and potential directions of U-WN are also discussed, which sheds lights on the opportunities and challenges brought by SDN to current wireless networks. We believe that the U-WN architecture opens new improvement space for wireless networks and our paper moves an important step towards the future wireless networks.

84924388408	Zero-determinant strategy in cheating management of wireless cooperation	Cooperation of resource sharing among wireless users and network operators has been widely studied in wireless communication. However, during the resource sharing, because of the weak communication signals or cheating strategies, each participant of the cooperation may sometimes stop its cooperative behavior unilaterally. Such behavior causes non-cooperation, resulting in unsatisfying quality of services for all participants. In this paper, we model the resource sharing between two participants as an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. Based on the applications of wireless cooperations, we define the participant who is responsible to maintain the high social welfare as the administrator of cooperation (AoC), and the other rational selfish participant as the regular participant of cooperation (PoC). Then, we propose a zero-determinant strategy for the AoC, and find the maximum social welfare that the AoC can maintain regardless of the strategy of PoC. Simulation results show that when the AoC applies the proposed zero-determinant strategy, the high social welfare can be maintained, and both AoC and PoC receive better performances than those of noncooperation.
