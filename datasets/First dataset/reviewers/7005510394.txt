15744381897	Human nectin-like 1, a novel membrane protein interacting with protein 4.1 R	Human nectin-like 1 (NECLl) full-length cDNA was cloned by bioinformatics method when searching for candidate membrane proteins interacting with members of protein 4.1 family. The cytoplasmic and extracellular regions of NECLl were expressed in and purified from E. coli, and the polyclonal antibody was produced. Interaction between the cytoplasmic region of NECLl and the 30 kD membrane binding domain of protein 4.1 on red blood cell (4.1R) was demonstrated by IAsys-biosensor system and GST pull-down experiment. Results of biotin-labeled peptide ELISA further demonstrated the key amino acids for the binding. The interaction research of NECLl's cytoplasmic domain provides basis for further study of the functions of NECLl in nervous system.

16644384470	Polymorphisms in PLIN and hypertension combined with obesity and lipid profiles in han Chinese	The current study investigated the association between PLIN polymorphisms and the combination of hypertension and obesity (HO) and the related clinical features. The polymorphisms 1237 (T/C), 1243 (C/T), and 1323 (C/G) were genotyped in 503 cases with HO and 511 unrelated controls. No associations between polymorphism 1237 (T/C) or 1243 (C/T) and HO were found. However, total cholesterol (TC) levels were significantly different among genotypes of polymorphism 7243 (p = 0.023, power = 0.55). In male cases, 1243T carriers (TT + CT) had higher TC, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels compared with CC homozygote carriers (5.23 ± 0.88 vs. 4.98 ± 0.90, p = 0.024; 1.13 ± 0.23 vs. 1.07 ± 0.22 mM, p = 0.034; 3.3 ± 0.78 vs. 3.11 ± 0.80, p = 0.03, respectively).

17844395201	The liver-enriched transcription factor CREB-H is a growth suppressor protein underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma	We have previously characterized transcription factor LZIP to be a growth suppressor targeted by hepatitis C virus oncoprotein. In search of proteins closely related to LZIP, we have identified a liver-enriched transcription factor CREB-H. LZIP and CREB-H represent a new subfamily of bZIP factors. CREB-H activates transcription by binding to cAMP responsive element, box B, and ATF6-binding element. Interestingly, CREB-H has a putative transmembrane (TM) domain and it localizes ambiently to the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteolytic cleavage that removes the TM domain leads to nuclear translocation and activation of CREB-H. CREB-H activates the promoter of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. This activation can be further stimulated by cAMP and protein kinase A. CREB-H transcript is exclusively abundant in adult liver. In contrast, the expression of CREB-H mRNA is aberrantly reduced in hepatoma tissues and cells. The enforced expression of CREB-H suppresses the proliferation of cultured hepatoma cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the liver-enriched bZIP transcription factor CREB-H is a growth suppressor that plays a role in hepatic physiology and pathology. © The Author 2005.

18344386776	Crystal structure of the catalytic domain of a human thioredoxin-like protein: Implications for substrate specificity and a novel regulation mechanism	Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous dithiol oxidoreductase found in many organisms and involved in numerous biochemical processes. Human thioredoxin-like protein (hTRXL) is differentially expressed at different development stages of human fetal cerebrum and belongs to an expanding family of thioredoxins. We have solved the crystal structure of the recombinant N-terminal catalytic domain (hTRXL-N) of hTRXL in its oxidized form at 2.2-Å resolution. Although this domain shares a similar three-dimensional structure with human thioredoxin (hTRX), a unique feature of hTRXL-N is the large number of positively charged residues distributed around the active site, which has been implicated in substrate specificity. Furthermore, the hTRXL-N crystal structure is monomeric while hTRX is dimeric in its four crystal structures (reduced, oxidized, C73S and C32S/C35S mutants) reported to date. As dimerization is the key regulatory factor in hTRX, the positive charge and lack of dimer formation of hTRXL-N suggest that it could interact with the acidic amino-acid rich C-terminal region, thereby suggesting a novel regulation mechanism.

20044365647	Luciferase assay for the functional analysis of HIV Tat and LTR in gene expression	A series of LTR deletion-directed Luc expression plasmids were constructed and transfected into Jurkat cells with or without a Tat-producing expression vector. Luciferase activity was measured to analyze the effect of Tat and LTR on gene expression. The results show that there are negative regulatory elements in the LTR upstream from the -158 position. It is demonstrated that trans-activation of Tat may enhance significantly the level of LTR-directed gene expression. The data suggest that the enhancer sequences in LTR and the binding protein NF- κ B may play an important role in both high-level LTR mediated transcription and Tat trans-activation.

These constructs were controlled by a deleted HIV-1 LTR spanning from - 158 to +80. The cotransfection of these polyTAR plasmids with pLTR-Luc and pS-Tat inhibited the trans-activation of HIV-1 Tat protein as much as 90% in human lymphocytic Jurkat cells. The inhibition of trans-activation is dependent upon the numbers of tandem TAR transcribed.

20144389794	An autosomal genomic scan for loci linked to type 2 diabetes in northern Han Chinese	We report the results of a genome-wide scan conducted in 219 individuals from 34 large multiplex nuclear pedigrees from the northern Han Chinese population at an average resolution of about 10 cM. Nonparametric two-point and multipoint linkage analyses were performed to detect evidence of linkage with type 2 diabetes in this study. On chromosome 1 four regions showed evidence of linkage with type 2 diabetes in northern Han Chinese. Of these regions a marker D1S193 (73 cM) showed evidence of linkage (two-point nonparametric linkage 2.409), and another region (around 190 cM) was a replication of several other studies performed in different ethnic populations. Evidences of linkage have been confirmed by typing additional markers (average distance 1-5 cM) flanking these two positive regions on chromosome 1. We also found indication of linkage with type 2 diabetes on chromosomes 2, 10, 12, 18, 20, and 22 by two-point linkage analyses. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

21044445300	Nectin-like molecule 1 is a protein 4.1N associated protein and recruits protein 4.1N from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane	Nectins are immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules that participate in the organization of epithelial and endothelial junctions. Sharing high homology with the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155), nectins were also named poliovirus receptor-related proteins (PRRs). Four nectins and five nectin-like molecules have been identified. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of human and mouse nectin-like molecular 1 (NECL1). Human and mouse NECL1 share 87.3% identity at the amino acid level. NECL1 contains an ectodomain made of three immunoglobulin-like domains, and a cytoplasmic region homologous to those of glycophorin C and contactin-associated protein. RNA blot and in situ hybridization analysis showed that NECL1 predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, mainly in neuronal cell bodies in a variety of brain regions including the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In vitro binding assay proved the association of NECL1 with protein 4.1N. NECL1 localizes to the cell-cell junctions and recruits protein 4.1N to the plasma membranes through its C-terminus, thus may regulate the function of the cell-cell junction. We propose that the NECL1 and protein 4.1N complex is involved in the morphological development, stability, and dynamic plasticity of the nervous system. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

22344455805	Comparative and functional genomic analyses of the pathogenicity of phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris	Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris (Xcc) is the causative agent of crucifer black rot disease, which causes severe losses in agricultural yield world-wide. This bacterium is a model organism for studying plant-bacteria interactions. We sequenced the complete genome of Xcc 8004 (5,148,708 bp), which is highly conserved relative to that of Xcc ATCC 33913. Comparative genomics analysis indicated that, in addition to a significant genomic-scale rearrangement cross the replication axis between two IS1478 elements, loss and acquisition of blocks of genes, rather than point mutations, constitute the main genetic variation between the two Xcc strains. Screening of a high-density transposon insertional mutant library (16,512 clones) of Xcc 8004 against a host plant (Brassica oleraceae) identified 75 nonredundant, single-copy insertions in protein-coding sequences (CDSs) and intergenic regions. In addition to known virulence factors, full virulence was found to require several additional metabolic pathways and regulatory systems, such as fatty acid degradation, type IV secretion system, cell signaling, and amino acids and nucleotide metabolism. Among the identified pathogenicity-related genes, three of unknown function were found in Xcc 8004-specific chromosomal segments, revealing a direct correlation between genomic dynamics and Xcc virulence. The present combination of comparative and functional genomic analyses provides valuable information about the genetic basis of Xcc pathogenicity, which may offer novel insight toward the development of efficient methods for prevention of this important plant disease. ©2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

22944463801	Paraoxonase gene cluster variations associated with coronary heart disease in Chinese Han women	Background: The oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein in the artery wall is currently believed to be central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Paraoxonase (PON1), an enzyme located on high-density lipoprotein (HDL), can prevent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxidation at a certain extent. Recent studies show two other members of paraoxonase gene family, PON2 and PON3, possess antioxidant properties similar to PON1. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of PON gene cluster on coronary heart disease (CHD) in Chinese Han women. Methods: Seven polymorphisms including PON1 -107C > T, -162G > A, -831G > A, R160G, Q192R, PON2 SS311C, and PON3 -133C > A were genotyped in 184 female patients with CHD and 239 female controls. The plasma PON1 activity toward phenylacetate was determined in 50 cases and 50 controls randomly selected. Results: The plasma PON1 activities were significantly lower in cases than in controls. Individual SNP analysis showed that cases had significantly higher frequencies of PON1 -107T, -831G and PON2 311S alleles than controls. The genotype distributions of -107C > T were also significantly different between two groups. The odds ratios for the development of CHD were 1.66 for -107TC carriers and 2.0 for -107TT carriers, compared with -107CC carriers. Haplotype analyses showed that the distributions of haplotypes comprised of PON1 -107C > T and PON2 S311C were significantly different between cases and controls, with cases having higher frequency of T-S haplotype (44.8% vs. 36.3%, P = 0.013). The T-S haplotype remained significantly associated with CHD after adjusting environmental risk factors (P = 0.0069). Conclusions: This association study suggested that lower plasma PON1 activity increased the risk of CHD in Chinese woman, which may be mediated by the higher frequency of -107T allele in cases. Haplotype analyses indicated that there might be some synergistic effects between the PON1 -107C > T and PON2 S311C polymorphisms.

21944445095	Transcriptional regulation of neuronal-specific gene expression	The differentiating of neurons and other distinct cell types during embryonic development requires the selective activation or repressing of many different sets of genes. Gene expression patterns in neurons are modulated by multiple extracellular and intracellular stimuli. The transcriptional regulation of individual gene is mediated by small DNA sequences such as silencer and enhancer, and the expression pattern can be determined by the integration of the effects of a very large number of these cis-acting elements. These DNA elements either activate or repress promoter activity depending upon the nature of the transcription factors that bind to them. It is possible that there are different regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in the nerve system.

23244456864	Identification of functional genetic variants in Cyclooxygenase-2 and their association with risk of esophageal cancer	Background & Aims: Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is implicated in many steps of cancer development. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the COX-2 promoter might contribute to differential COX-2 expression and subsequent interindividual variability in susceptibility to cancer. This study sought to identify functional SNPs in the COX-2 promoter and evaluated their effects on the risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: Thirty individual DNA samples were sequenced to search for SNPs, and the function of the SNPs was examined by a set of biochemical assays. Genotypes and haplotypes were analyzed in 1026 patients and 1270 controls, and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression. Results: Three SNPs, -1290A→G, -1195G→A, and -765G→C, were identified; the frequencies of variant alleles were 0.04, 0.51, and 0.02, respectively. The -1195G→A change creates a c-MYB binding site and displays a higher promoter activity. The -1195A-containing haplotypes had significantly increased luciferase expression and COX-2 messenger RNA levels in esophageal tissues compared with the -1195G-containing counterparts. A case-control analysis showed a 1.72-fold (95% CI, 1.35-2.20) and 2.24-fold (95% CI, 1.59-3.16) excess risk of developing ESCC for the -1195AA or -765CC genotype carriers compared with noncarriers. A greater risk of developing ESCC was observed for A

28544440091	Genome dynamics and diversity of Shigella species, the etiologic agents of bacillary dysentery	The Shigella bacteria cause bacillary dysentery, which remains a significant threat to public health. The genus status and species classification appear no longer valid, as compelling evidence indicates that Shigella, as well as enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, are derived from multiple origins of E.coli and form a single pathovar. Nevertheless, Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 causes deadly epidemics but Shigella boydii is restricted to the Indian subcontinent, while Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei are prevalent in developing and developed countries respectively. To begin to explain these distinctive epidemiological and pathological features at the genome level, we have carried out comparative genomics on four representative strains. Each of the Shigella genomes includes a virulence plasmid that encodes conserved primary virulence determinants. The Shigella chromosomes share most of their genes with that of E.coli K12 strain MG1655, but each has over 200 pseudogenes, 300∼700 copies of insertion sequence (IS) elements, and numerous deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions. There is extensive diversity of putative virulence genes, mostly acquired via bacteriophage-mediated lateral gene transfer. Hence, via convergent evolution involving gain and loss of functions, through bacteriophage-mediated gene acquisition, IS-mediated DNA rearrangements and formation of pseudogenes, the Shigella spp. became highly specific human pathogens with variable epidemiological and pathological features. © The Author 2005.

2942718813	Lipoprotein lipase gene is in linkage with blood pressure phenotypes in Chinese pedigrees	To elucidate the mechanism of lipid metabolism in the genesis of essential hypertension (EH), we linked blood pressure (BP) phenotypes with the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene. Variance component and sib-pair linkage models were used to test the relationship of the polymorphisms in the LPL gene region and EH in 148 Chinese hypertensive families. Linkage evidence with systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) was observed in a total population of 148 pedigrees with seven flanking microsatellite markers of the LPL gene, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 2.68 and a maximum multipoint LOD score (MLS) of 2.37 for SBP and a maximum MLS of 1.54 for DBP. Suggestive linkage results around this region were also obtained in northern and southern subsets by geographic distribution. In addition, quantitative-transmission/disequilibrium-test analyses showed that there was linkage between DBP and two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the LPL gene. This is the first report of linkage between LPL gene and DBP in the Chinese population. The LPL gene itself might explain our results or the LPL gene region might harbor some genes to explain the observed results to some degree and might contribute to the variation of BP in the Chinese population. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

33745000313	Association study with 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 11 candidate genes for hypertension in Chinese	Essential hypertension is considered to be a typical complex disease with multifactorial etiology, which leads to inconsistent findings in genetic studies. One possibility of failure to replicate some single-locus results is that the underlying genetics of hypertension are not only based on multiple genes with minor effects but also on gene-gene interactions. To test this hypothesis, a case-control study was constructed in Chinese subjects, detecting both single locus and multilocus effects. Eleven candidate genes were selected from biochemical pathways that have been implicated in the development and progression of hypertension, and 33 polymorphisms were evaluated in 503 hypertension patients and 490 age- and gender-matched controls. Single-locus associations, using traditional logistic regression analyses, and multilocus associations, using classification and regression trees and multivariate adaptive regression splines, were both explored in this study. Final models were selected using either Bonferroni correction or cross-validation. Three polymorphisms, TH*rs2070762, ADRB2*Q27E, and GRK4*A486V, were found to be independently associated with essential hypertension in Chinese subjects. In addition to these individual predictors, a potential interaction of CYP11B2-AGTR1 is also involved in the etiology of hypertension. These findings support the multigenic nature of the etiology of essential hypertension and propose a potential gene-gene interactive model for future studies. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.

China, as one of the six member states, takes a region between 3pter and D3S3397 of the human chromosome 3 as its share of this historic project, referred as "Beijing Region". The complete sequence of this region comprises of 17.4 megabasepairs (Mb) with an average GC content of 42% and an average recombination rate of 2.14 cM/Mb. Within Beijing Region, 122 known and 20 novel genes are identified, as well as 42607 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Comprehensive analyses also reveal: (i) gene density and GC-content of Beijing Region are in agreement with human cytogenetic maps, i.e. G-minus bands are GC-rich and of a high gene density, whereas G-plus bands are GC-poor and of a relatively low gene density; (ii) the average recombination rate within Beijing Region is relatively high compared with other regions of chromosome 3, with the highest recombination rate of 6.06 cM/Mb in the subtelomeric area; (iii) it is most likely that a large gene, associated with the mammary gland, may reside in the 1.1 Mb gene-poor area near the telomere; (iv) many disease-related genes are genetically mapped to Beijing Region, including those associated with cancers and metabolic syndromes. All make Beijing Region an important target for in-depth molecular investigations with a purpose of medical applications. Copyright by Science in China Press 2005.

33748919323	Identification and characterization of selenoprotein K: An antioxidant in cardiomyocytes	Selenoprotein K (SelK) is a newly identified selenoprotein. We showed that selenium incorporation into SelK was dependent on the 3′UTR of SelK mRNA. Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) RNA binding assays demonstrated that human SBP2 bound to the SelK SECIS element through the conserved non-Watson-Crick base pair quartet but not the AAT motif. Examination of the expression pattern revealed that human SelK mRNA was highly expressed in heart. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that SelK localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Using SelK recombinant adenovirus, we found that overexpression of SelK attenuated the intracellular reactive oxygen species level and protected cells from oxidative stress-induced toxicity in cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicated that SelK is a novel antioxidant in cardiomyocytes and is related to the regulation of cellular redox balance. © 2006 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Methods: A case-control study design was applied. Common polymorphisms of 45T/G and 276G/T were genotyped by PCR product sequencing in 484 cases with HO and 502 controls with normal blood pressure and BMI < 25. Results: The genotype and allele frequencies of 45T/G, 276G/T, and haplotype defined by the two variants in cases did not differ from those in controls. The means of blood pressure, BMI and waist-hip ratio did not differ among genotypes of the two polymorphisms and haplotypes. Among lipid profiles, only serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower in T allele carriers than that in non-T carriers after adjusting possible confounding factors (1.21 vs 1.32 mmol/L, P=0.0001). Conclusion: Polymorphisms of 45T/G and 276G/T in APM1 gene are not associated with hypertension or obesity, or their clinical features in Chinese Han population. Common polymorphism of 45T/G might be associated with serum HDL-C levels in Chinese. Copyright © 2006 by China CDC.

33749436095	Dok5 is substrate of TrkB and TrkC receptors and involved in neurotrophin induced MAPK activation	Tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family receptors are a group of high affinity receptors for neurotrophin growth factors, which have pivotal functions in many physiological processes of nervous system. Trk receptors can dimerize and autophosphorylate upon neurotrophin stimulation, then recruit multiple adaptor proteins to transduct signal. In this report, we identified Dok5, a member of Dok family, as a new substrate of TrkB/C receptors. In yeast two-hybrid assay, Dok5 can interact with intracellular domain of TrkB and TrkC receptor through its PTB domain, but not with that of TrkA receptor. The interaction was then confirmed by GST pull-down assay and Co-IP experiment. Dok5 co-localized with TrkB and TrkC in differentiated PC12 cells, providing another evidence for their interaction. By using mutational analysis, we characterized that Dok5 PTB domain bound to Trk receptor NPQY motif in a kinase-activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, competition experiment indicated that Dok5 competed with N-shc for binding to the receptors at the same site. Finally, we showed that Dok5 was involved in the activation of MAPK pathway induced by neurotrophin stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that Dok5 acts as substrate of TrkB/C receptors and is involved in neurotrophin induced MAPK signal pathway activation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, mouse reticulon 3 (mRTN3) is cloned and its expression pattern in a variety of tissues is investigated. Three alternatively spliced transcripts of 1.8, 2.8 and 4.2 kb are revealed by Northern blotting hybridization. The 1.8 and 2.8 kb transcripts are expressed in many tissues. The 2.8 kb transcript has a high level in brain and the 4.2 kb transcript is only found in brain. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis indicated its high expression in non-glial cells in some particular region of mouse central nervous system, such as hippocampus, sub-thalnmus nucleus, thalamus nucleus and cerebrum cortex.

33845628178	NSPc1 is a cell growth regulator that acts as a transcriptional repressor of p21Waf1/Cip1 via the RARE element	The mammalian polycomb group proteins play an important role in cell cycle control and tumorigenesis. Nervous system polycomb 1 (NSPc1) is a newly identified transcription repressor, highly homologous with PcG protein Bmi-1. In this article, we showed that NSPc1 could promote tumor cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that NSPc1 did not affect the expression levels of most Cyclin-depentent kinases (CDK) inhibitors except for p21Waf1/Cip1. Repression activity assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA pulldown assays all verified that NSPc1 represses the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 by binding to the (-1357 to -1083) region of the p21Waf1/ Cip1 promoter in vivo, and the repression effect is dependent on the retinoid acid response element (RARE element) within the above region of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter. Further analysis showed that NSPc1 could compete the RARE element site with RA receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that NSPc1 has a positive role in tumor cell growth by down-regulating p21Waf1/Cip1 via the RARE element, which directly connects transcriptional repression of PcGs to CDKIs and RA signaling pathways. © 2006 Oxford University Press.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition on mucosal cellularity and gut function. In addition, enterocyte gene expression of two relevant systems was also characterized and related to the structural and functional changes that occurred. Male Wistar rats underwent a 60% small bowel resection and jugular vein characterization and were randomized into two groups. The control group (n = 10) received a standard intravenous nutritional solution and the study group (n = 10) received a similar solution but enriched with alanylglutamine dipeptide. After 7 days blood was taken for amino acid analysis, and bowel was harvested to determine mucosal morphology and expression of mucosal cell glutaminase and IGF-I mRNA. Mesentery lymphnodes were cultured to determine the presence of bacteria and thus access bacteria translocation. Serum glutamine concentration and mucosal architecture were maintained in the study group compared to the controls. Seventy percent of lymphnodes were cultured positive in control vs. only 20% in the study group (P < 0.05). Jejunal mucosal glutaminase and ileum mocusal IGF-I mRNA increased twofold and threefold respectively compared to control animals. Parenteral nutrition supplemented with alanyl-glutamine dipeptide supports mucosal cellularity and regional immune function in rodents following intestinal resection. These alterations are associated with enhanced enterocyte expression of glutaminase and IGF-I. These changes may facilitate the structural and functional alterations which were observed in the glutamine treated animals.

39449086135	A novel method for high accuracy sumoylation site prediction from protein sequences	Background: Protein sumoylation is an essential dynamic, reversible post translational modification that plays a role in dozens of cellular activities, especially the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic stability. Currently, the complexities of sumoylation mechanism can not be perfectly solved by experimental approaches. In this regard, computational approaches might represent a promising method to direct experimental identification of sumoylation sites and shed light on the understanding of the reaction mechanism. Results: Here we presented a statistical method for sumoylation site prediction. A 5-fold cross validation test over the experimentally identified sumoylation sites yielded excellent prediction performance with correlation coefficient, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy equal to 0.6364, 97.67%, 73.96% and 96.71% respectively. Additionally, the predictor performance is maintained when high level homologs are removed. Conclusion: By using a statistical method, we have developed anew SUMO site prediction method - SUMOpre, which has shown its great accuracy with correlation coefficient, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. © 2008 Xu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

3843065381	Evolution and migration history of the Chinese population inferred from Chinese Y-chromosome evidence	Y-chromosomes from 76 Chinese men covering 33 ethnical minorities throughout China as well as the Han majority were collected as genetic material for the study of Chinese nonrecombinant Y-chromosome (NRY) phylogeny. Of the accepted worldwide NRY haplogroups, three (haplogroups D, C, O) were significant in this sample, extending previous assessments of Chinese genetic diversity. Based on geographic, linguistic, and ethnohistorical information, the 33 Chinese ethnical minorities in our survey were divided into the following four subgroups: North, Tibet, West, and South. Inferred from the distribution of the newfound immediate ancestor lineage haplogroup O*, which has M214 but not M175, we argue that the southern origin scenario of this most common Chinese Y haplogroup is not very likely. We tentatively propose a West/North-origin hypothesis, suggesting that haplogroup O originated in West/North China and mainly evolved in China and thence spread further throughout eastern Eurasia. The nested cladistic analysis revealed in detail a multilayered, multidirectional, and continuous history of ethnic admixture that has shaped the contemporary Chinese population. Our results give some new clues to the evolution and migration of the Chinese population and its subsequence moving about in this land, which are in accordance with the historical records.

58849153216	DIXDC1 promotes retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation and inhibits gliogenesis in P19 cells	Human DIXDC1 is a member of Dishevelled-Axin (DIX) domain containing gene family which plays important roles in Wnt signaling and neural development. In this report, we first confirmed that expression of Ccd1, a mouse homologous gene of DIXDC1, was up-regulated in embryonic developing nervous system. Further studies showed that Ccd1 was expressed specifically in neurons and colocalized with early neuronal marker Tuj1. During the aggregation induced by RA and neuronal differentiation of embryonic carcinoma P19 cells, expressions of Ccd1 as well as Wnt-1 and N-cadherin were dramatically increased. Stable overexpression of DIXDC1 in P19 cells promoted the neuronal differentiation. P19 cells overexpressing DIXDC1 but not the control P19 cells could differentiate into Tuj1 positive cells with RA induction for only 2 days. Meanwhile, we also found that overexpression of DIXDC1 facilitated the expression of Wnt1 and bHLHs during aggregation and differentiation, respectively, while inhibited gliogenesis by down-regulating the expression of GFAP in P19 cells. Thus, our finding suggested that DIXDC1 might play an important role during neurogenesis, overexpression of DIXDC1 in embryonic carcinoma P19 cells promoted neuronal differentiation, and inhibited gliogenesis induced by retinoic acid. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

58149383268	Disruption of nectin-like 1 cell adhesion molecule leads to delayed axonal myelination in the CNS	Nectin-like 1 (Necl-1) is a neural-specific cell adhesion molecule that is expressed in both the CNS and PNS. Previous in vitro studies suggested that Necl-1 expression is essential for the axon-glial interaction and myelin sheath formation in the PNS. To investigate the in vivo role of Necl-1 in axonal myelination of the developing nervous system, we generated the Necl-1 mutant mice by replacing axons 2-5 with the LacZ reporter gene. Expression studies revealed that Necl-1 is exclusively expressed by neurons in the CNS. Disruption of Necl-1 resulted in developmental delay of axonal myelination in the optic nerve and spinal cord, suggesting that Necl-1 plays an important role in the initial axon-oligodendrocyte recognition and adhesion in CNS myelination.

0034917248	ASH2L: Alternative splicing and downregulation during induced megakaryocytic differentiation of multipotential leukemia cell lines	Drosophila ash2 is a member of the trxG gene super family, some human homologues of which are involved in hematopoiesis and leukemia. We report here the identification of the human homologue of Drosophila ash2 and its alternative splicing isoform, ASH2L1 and ASH2L2. ASH2L proteins are 60% homologous to Drosophila ash2. ASH2L also has a zinc finger motif (C2C2) although it is not identical to that in ASH2. Expression profile analysis showed that the amount of ASH2L transcripts is extremely high in fetal liver, testis, and leukemia cell lines with erythroid and megakaryocytic potential such as K562, Hel, and Dami. We treated these cells with differentiation inducers phorbol ester and hemin. We found that ASH2L is downregulated rapidly and dramatically in K562, Hel, and Dami cells during phorbol ester induced differentiation with megakaryocytic features. However, its expression is maintained at a high level during erythroid differentiation of K562 cells induced with hemin. These results suggest that ASH2L plays a role in hematopoiesis and is associated with some special kinds of leukemia.

46349105014	Cooperation between EZH2, NSPc1-mediated histone H2A ubiquitination and Dnmt1 in HOX gene silencing	An intricate interplay between DNA methylation and polycomb-mediated gene silencing has been highlighted recently. Here we provided evidence that Nervous System Polycomb 1 (NSPc1), a BMI1 homologous polycomb protein, plays important roles in promoting H2A ubiquitination and cooperates with DNA methylation in HOX gene silencing. We showed that NSPc1 stimulates H2A ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro through direct interaction with both RING2 and H2A. RT-PCR analysis revealed that loss of NSPc1, EZH2 or DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), or inhibition of DNA methylation in HeLa cells de-represses the expression of HOXA7. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that NSPc1, EZH2 and Dnmt1 bind to the promoter of HOXA7, which is frequently hypermethylated in tumors. Knockdown of NSPc1 results in significant reduction of H2A ubiquitination and DNA demethylation as well as Dnmt1 dissociation in the HOXA7 promoter. Meanwhile Dnmt1 deficiency affects NSPc1 recruitment and H2A ubiquitination, whereas on both cases EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation remains unaffected. When EZH2 was depleted, however, NSPc1 and Dnmt1 enrichment was abolished concomitant with local reduction of H3K27 trimethylation, H2A ubiquitination and DNA methylation. Taken together, our findings indicated that NSPc1-mediated H2A ubiquitination and DNA methylation, both being directed by EZH2, are interdependent in long-term target gene silencing within cancer cells. © 2008 The Author(s).

48949106092	Proteomic analysis of ubiquitinated proteins in normal hepatocyte cell line Chang liver cells	Post-translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifiers is one of the most important mechanisms regulating a wide range of cellular processes in eukaryotes. Through mediating 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of substrates, the covalent modification of proteins by multiple Ub (ubiquitination) can regulate many different cellular functions such as transcription, antigen processing, signal transduction and cell cycle. To better understand ubiquitination and its functions, proteomic approaches have been developed to purify and identify more protein substrates. The S5a subunit of the 26S proteasome binds to poly-Ub chains containing four or more Ub. In this study, immobilized GST-S5a fusion protein was used to affinity-purify ubiquitinated proteins from Chang liver cells. The purified proteins were then identified with multi-dimensional LC combined with MS/MS. Eighty-three potential ubiquitination substrates were identified. From these proteins, 19 potential ubiquitination sites on 17 potential substrates were determined. These potential ubiquitination substrates are mainly related to important cellular functions including metabolism, translation and transcription. Our results provide helpful information for further understanding of the relationship between ubiquitination machinery and different cell functions. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

48049101685	MiR-9 regulates the expression of CBX7 in human glioma	Objective: To detect the expression of CBX7 in human glioma and investigate the potential regulatory effect of abnormally expressed microRNAs on CBX7 expression. Methods: Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were applied to detect the expression pattern of CBX7 in 2 human normal brain tissues, 9 glioma tissues, and 3 glioma cell lines. Miranda algorithm and Ensemble Machine Learning algorithm were combined to predict miRNAs that target human CBX7. The expression of miR-9 in those tissues and cell lines were detected by real-time PCR. After miR-9 overexpression in 293ET and miR-9 knock-down in T98G, luciferase assay and Western blot were used to confirm the effect of miR-9 on CBX7 expression. MTT assay and flow cytometry were applied to detect the effect of miR-9 knockdown on T98G cells. Results: No obvious difference in the CBX7 mRNA level between normal and tumor tissues was observed, while the protein level of CBX7 was abrogated or markedly reduced in glioma tissues and cell lines. Several miRNAs including miR-9 may target CBX7 by bioinformatics prediction. MiR-9 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. In 293ET cell, luciferase activity of CBX7-3'UTR reporter was decreased to 24% after miR-9 overexpression. After miR-9 knock-down in T98G cell, the luciferase activity was increased by 1.8 fold and there was no change of CBX7 mRNA, while the protein level of endogenous CBX7 was significantly increased. The number of survival T98G cells increased and cells in G1 phase decreased after miR-9 knock-down. Conclusion: In human glioma, CBX7 is down-regulated by the inhibition of miR-9 at posttranscriptional level.

48049122415	Effect of NECL1 on the proliferation of T98G glioma cell line	Objective: To study the regulation role of tumor suppressor NECL1 on the proliferation of glioma cell line. Methods: We detected the expression level of NECL1 in human normal brain tissue and glioma cell lines using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. T98G cell line in which NECL1 was silent and whose transfection efficiency was relatively high as target cell was chosen, and the effect of NECL1 on the proliferation of T98G cell line in vitro was detected by using cell growth curve, flow cytometry, and Hoechst staining. Results: NECL1 was abrogated or markedly reduced in 6 glioma cell lines. When NECL1 was overexpressed in T98G cell line, the cell growth rate obviously decreased and the number of apoptotic cells remarkably increased when compared with the control group. Conclusion: NECL1 may inhibit the proliferation of T98G cells by inducing its a poptosis.

48049123060	Role of cell adhesion molecules Necl1 in synaptogenesis in primary cultured rat neurons	Objective: To study the role of cell adhesion molecules Necl1 in synaptogenesis in primary cultured neurons. Methods: Semi-quantitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression pattern of Necl1 in the neuronal differentiation cell model in vitro. Western blot was performed to detect the expression pattern of Necl1 in primary cultured rat neurons and in purified synaptosome. Immunofluoresence was used ta detect the synapse formation in primary neurons and in 293 cells coculture and to detect the density of synapses in primary neuron with ectopic expression of Necl1. Results: Necl1 expression increased after retinoic acid (RA) induction in SH-SY5Y and P19 cells. The increase of Necl1 expression was consistent with the days of primary neurons culture in vitro, and Necl1 partly localized in synaptosome. The overexpression of Necl1 in 293 cells induced the synapse formation between cocultured 293 cells and neurons. Ectopic expression of Necl1 in primary neurons increased the density of synapses. Conclusion: Necl1 plays an important role in neuronal synapse formation.

49649086769	A functional intronic variant in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene confers risk of essential hypertension in the Northern Chinese Han population	The TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, and is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension, but the relationship of its variants with hypertension has not been extensively studied. We designed a case-controlled study consisting of 503 HT (hypertensive) individuals and 490 NT (normotensive) individuals matched by region, age and gender to systematically investigate the association between the TH gene and hypertension. Based on the HapMap and dbSNP (where SNP is single nucleotide polymorphism) data, four SNPs, rs6356 A > G, rs6357 G > A, rs2070762 T > C and rs1800033 A > G in the TH gene were selected for genotyping. Rs1800033 was not polymorphic in our study population. No significant differences were observed for distributions of rs6356 and rs6357 between the HT and NT groups. However, both the genotype and allele frequencies of rs2070762 showed significant differences between cases and controls (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005 respectively). In haplotype analysis, a total of eight haplotypes were observed in the entire population and the overall frequency distributions differed significantly between the HT and NT groups. Specifically, haplotype A-A-C (rs6356-rs6357-rs2070762) occurred only in the HT group and A-G-C occurred more commonly in HT subjects than in NT subjects (P = 0.003 and P = 0.013 respectively). Compared with the most common haplotype A-G-T, the adjusted OR (odds ratio) was 1.83 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.20-2.79; P = 0.0049] for haplotype G-G-C and 20 (P < 0.0001) for the haplotype A-A-C. Functional analysis showed that the C allele of rs2070762 functioned as an enhancer in the absence of binding by unidentified transcriptional repressor(s). These results provide evidence for an association of the functional intronic rs2070762 with essential hypertension. © The Authors.

53149083350	CLOCK/BMAL1 regulates human nocturnin transcription through binding to the E-box of nocturnin promoter	Nocturnin has been identified as a clock-controlled gene based on its rhythmic expression and night-time peak of transcript level in Xenopus retina. Further studies show that the widespread expression and rhythmicity of nocturnin mRNA level parallel the expression of clock genes. In Xenopus, nocturnin transcription is regulated by cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) binding the nocturnin element (NE). However, mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of nocturnin transcription in human cells is unknown at present. In this study, we demonstrated that the transcription of human nocturnin gene displayed circadian oscillations in Huh7 cells (a human hepatoma cell line) and was regulated by CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer via the E-box of nocturnin promoter. In addition, E-box2 is more efficient than E-box1 in the regulation of CLOCK/BMAL1 on nocturnin transcription in vitro. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.

55949114921	MicroRNA-21 down-regulates the expression of tumor suppressor PDCD4 in human glioblastoma cell T98G	MicroRNAs have been linked to different cancer-related processes. The microRNA miR-21 appears to function as an anti-apoptosis factor in glioblastomas. However, the functional target genes of miR-21 are largely unknown in glioblastomas. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was used to identify miR-21 target sites in various genes. Luciferase activity assay showed that a number of genes involved in apoptosis, PDCD4, MTAP, and SOX5, carry putative miR-21 binding sites. Expression of PDCD4 protein correlates inversely with expression of miR-21 in a number of human glioblastoma cell lines such as T98G, A172, U87, and U251. Inhibition of miR-21 increases endogenous levels of PDCD4 in cell line T98G and over-expression miR-21 inhibits PDCD4-dependent apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that miR-21 expression plays a key role in regulating cellular processes in glioblastomas and may serve as a target for effective therapies. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

5544266920	Cloning and identification of PHF2 cDNA and its alternatively spliced transcripts	Genes encoding proteins with PHD (plant homeodomain) finger motif (C4HC3) are highly conserved from Arabidopsis to Homo sapiens. One of the major functions of these genes is regulating the expression of homeotic genes during the stage of embryonic development. They play a role in cell-cycle and cell differentiation and seem to be related with some human malignant diseases, such as leukemia. A human placenta cDNA library has been screened with cDNA probe amplified by PCR. The PCR primers have been designed according to the M96 (a mouse gene encoding a protein with PHD domain) homologous data in dbEST. A 2.1 kb insert fragment in a positive cDNA clone has been isolated and sequenced. This new full-length cDNA is named PHF2 (GenBank Acc: AF052205). The putative protein composed of 567 aa has two typical PHD fingers at its N-terminus. Meanwhile it is identified that there are several alternatively spliced transcripts of PHF2 in different human tissues through the PCR amplification, Northern blot hybridization and analysis of genomic DNA structure.

0035436349	Confirmation of susceptibility gene loci on chromosome 1 in Northern China Han families with type 2 diabetes	Objective To confirm previous effort to identify type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes in a Northern Chinese population by conducting a new genome scan with both an increased number of type 2 diabetes families and a new set of microsatellite markers within the previously localized regions. Methods A genome scan method was applied. After multiplexed PCR, electrophoreses, genescan and genotyping analysis, we obtained size information for all loci , and then a further study was done by both parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis to investigate the P values and Z values of these loci. Results We surveyed 34 microsatellite markers which distributed within 5 regions along chromosome 1, and a total of 12 000 genotypes were screened. Evidence of linkage with diabetes was identified for 8 of the 34 loci. All P values of the 8 loci were lower than 0.05, and the highest Z value was 2.17. A very interesting finding is that all 5 markers at the p- terminal 1p36.3-1 p36.23 region, spanning a long range of 16.9 cM, were identified to have a low P value of less than 0.05, which suggests that this region may contain multiple susceptibility genes. Regions 4 and 5 also confirmed the previous findings, and we narrowed these two regions to a 2.7 cM and 2.5 cM regions, respectively. Conclusions We further confirmed the results gained in the previous genome-wide scan using an increased number of NIDDM families and a new set of microsatellite markers lying within the initially localized regions. The fact that all 5 loci at the p- terminal region displayed a low P value of less than 0.05 suggests that more than 1 susceptibility gene may reside in this region.

0035800752	Inhibition of LZIP-mediated Transcription through Direct Interaction with a Novel Host Cell Factor-like Protein	Host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) is a cellular transcriptional coactivator which coordinates the assembly of enhancer complex through direct interactions with viral and cellular trans-activators such as VP16, Oct-1, LZIP, and GA-binding protein. These interactions are mediated by the β-propeller domain comprising the first 380 residues of HCF-1 with six kelch repeats. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel HCF-like kelch repeat protein, designated HCLP-1. HCLP-1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein which is composed almost entirely of a six-bladed β-propeller. HCLP-1 selectively interacts with LZIP but not with VP16. The physical interaction between HCLP-1 and LZIP leads to the repression of the LZIP-dependent transcription. The HCLP-1-binding domain of LZIP maps to residues 109-315, which contain the bZIP DNA-binding motif. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrates that HCLP-1 indeed interferes with the binding of LZIP to its DNA target. Thus, HCLP-1 serves a transcriptional co-repressor function mediated through its inhibitory interaction with the LZIP transcription factor. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for transcriptional regulation by HCF-like proteins.

0035701258	Identification and characterization of FTSJ2, a novel human nucleolar protein homologous to bacterial ribosomal RNA methyltransferase	Cellular RNAs in eukaryotes undergo extensive post-transcriptional modifications, but as yet only a few RNA-modifying enzymes have been identified and characterized. Here we report on the cloning of FTSJ2, a novel human gene encoding a putative RNA methyltransferase. FTSJ2 shares significant sequence homology with FtsJ/RrmJ, a recently identified Escherichia coli 23S rRNA uridine-2′-O-methyltransferase. FTSJ2 belongs to a new family of evolutionarily conserved S-adenosylmethionine-binding proteins. The gene FTSJ2 is located on chromosome 7p22 between MAD1L1 and NUDT1. It is 8 kb in length, spanning three exons. Northern blot analysis revealed that the FTSJ2 transcripts are abundant in skeletal muscle, placenta, and heart, as well as in cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that FTSJ2 protein localizes to the nucleolus. Our results suggest that FTSJ2 is likely a nucleolar RNA methyltransferase involved in eukaryotic RNA processing and modification.

0036753934	Identification of novel protein-coding genes from human fetal hippocampus ESTs database	We presented a procedure to identify novel protein-coding genes from human fetal hippocampus ESTs database generated in our previous study. The protocol is involved in searching the GenBank non-redundant (nr) protein database with ESTs coding regions query. We used ESTScan program to detect and reconstruct coding regions in the ESTs sequence data. With almost 10,000 raw ESTs analyzed, 4,061 coding regions were extracted. The corresponding amino acid sequences were then searched against the GenBank nr-protein databases; all the similarity hits were parsed in a homology analysis workbench. 22 ESTs were identified as the "seed" ESTs, which might be the fragment of the novel protein-coding genes. Indeed, further analysis of these ESTs in full-length cDNA cloning in silico, as well as the mapping information in UCSC and the added experimental proof, verified the effectiveness of the strategy. Taking advantage of rare ESTs resources, and the effective strategy, we would explore more novel genes in the human genome. [The ESTs sequence data described in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank data library (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST) under accession nos. BM174886-958, BM259607-9; and the full length cDNA sequence can be obtained in http://www.chgb.org.cn/hippocampus.htm].

Twelve polymorphisms were additionally investigated for association with CHD in 474 male patients and 475 controls. Univariate analyses showed the cases had significantly higher frequencies of PON1 192Q allele, 160R allele, - 162A allele, and PON2 311C allele than were seen in the controls. Logistic regression analyses revealed only the PON1 R160G and -162G/A polymorphisms remained significantly associated with CHD (P=0.0054 and P=0.0002). Haplotype analyses for various polymorphism combinations additionally confirmed the results of individual polymorphism analyses. Only the frequencies of haplotypes containing - 162A allele were significantly higher, whereas only the frequencies of haplotypes containing 160G allele were significantly lower in cases than in controls in various polymorphism combinations. Conclusions - This extensive association study has identified the PON1 - 162G/A and R160G polymorphisms to be independently associated with CHD in Chinese Han population and warrants additional study to elucidate the biological mechanism.

0037331534	Linkage analysis of 2q14-q23 and 5q32 with blood pressure quantitative traits in Chinese sib pairs	Objectives: Several genome-wide scans recently accomplished in the ethnic Chinese revealed a number of candidate loci possibly contributing to essential hypertension, and some appeared to be replicable in 2q14-q23 and 5q32. The current study aimed to examine the linkage of qualitative and blood pressure quantitative traits in essential hypertension with these genomic regions in a large sample of Chinese hypertensive families. Methods: We performed a genetic analysis on 148 randomly ascertained families containing 328 affected sib pairs, grouped into two geographically distinct subsets. Five highly informative microsatellite markers (D2S151, D2S142, D5S2090, D5S413 and D5S2013) were genotyped, and linkage analyses were performed with different genetic models. Results: We did not observe consistent evidence for excess allele sharing identity by descent in either of the qualitative or the quantitative test. However, higher LOD scores were found at D5S2013 in North Group subset with Haseman-Elston and maximum likelihood (ML) variance (no dominance variance, NDV) algorithms. With the ML (NDV) algorithm, the LOD was 1.410 for diastolic blood pressure at this locus, although this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: These findings provide no evidence to support a significant linkage of 2q14-q23 or 5q32 with essential hypertension or blood pressure quantitative traits in the ethnic Chinese, and indicate the aetiologic diversity and complexity of hypertension. Previous reports implied 2q14-q23 or β

0037154765	cDNA cloning, chromosomal localization and expression pattern analysis of human LIM-homeobox gene LHX4	LHX4 gene is a member of the LIM-homeobox gene family and plays a critical role in the development of motor neurons. We have isolated a cDNA of human LHX4 from a library of the adult human spinal cord. Its sequence is 92% homologous to that of the mouse Lhx4. The genomic structure of the LHX4 gene and its chromosomal localization were determined. The gene was mapped on human chromosome 1q 24.1-1q 24.3 and composed of six exons. The homeodomain was encoded by two exons, exons 4 and 5. The first LIM domain was coded by exon 2, and the second by exon 3. Human MTE Array was used to study the expression profile of LHX4 in 72 human tissues. The expression was specific in the CNS including the fetal brain, the spinal cord, and the cerebral cortex. In situ hybridization of the adult rodent CNS showed the abundant expression of LHX4 in the cerebral cortex and motor neurons of the spinal cord. Our results suggest that LHX4 may play a role in the CNS, especially the neocortex and the spinal cord, and provide a basis to investigate potential involvement of the LHX4 gene in human diseases. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

0037464546	Unique physiological and pathogenic features of Leptospira interrogans revealed by whole-genome sequencing	Leptospirosis is a widely spread disease of global concern. Infection causes flu-like episodes with frequent severe renal and hepatic damage, such as haemorrhage and jaundice. In more severe cases, massive pulmonary haemorrhages, including fatal sudden haemoptysis, can occur. Here we report the complete genomic sequence of a representative virulent serovar type strain (Lai) of Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae consisting of a 4.33-megabase large chromosome and a 359-kilobase small chromosome, with a total of 4,768 predicted genes. In terms of the genetic determinants of physiological characteristics, the facultatively parasitic L. interrogans differs extensively from two other strictly parasitic pathogenic spirochaetes, Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi, although similarities exist in the genes that govern their unique morphological features. A comprehensive analysis of the L. interrogans genes for chemotaxis/motility and lipopolysaccharide synthesis provides a basis for in-depth studies of virulence and pathogenesis. The discovery of a series of genes possibly related to adhesion, invasion and the haematological changes that characterize leptospirosis has provided clues about how an environmental organism might evolve into an important human pathogen.

0041343159	Association between genetic variation of CACNA1H and childhood absence epilepsy	Direct sequencing of exons 3 to 35 and the exon-intron boundaries of the CACNA1H gene was conducted in 118 childhood absence epilepsy patients of Han ethnicity recruited from North China. Sixty-eight variations have been detected in the CACNA1H gene, and, among the variations identified, 12 were missense mutations and only found in 14 of the 118 patients in a heterozygous state, but not in any of 230 unrelated controls. The identified missense mutations occurred in the highly conserved residues of the T-type calcium channel gene. Our results suggest that CACNA1H might be an important susceptibility gene involved in the pathogenesis of childhood absence epilepsy.

0141829712	Protein kinase C/ζ (PRKCZ) gene is associated with type 2 diabetes in Han population of North China and analysis of its haplotypes	Aim: To identify the susceptible gene (s) for type 2 diabetes in the prevousely mapped region, 1p36.33-p36.23, in Han population of North China using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to analyze the haplotypes of the gene (s) related to type 2 diabetes. Methods: Twenty three SNPs located in 10 candidate genes in the mapped region were chosen from public SNP domains with bioinformatic methods, and the single base extension (SBE) method was used to genotype the loci for 192 sporadic type 2 diabetes patients and 172 normal individuals, all with Han ethical origin, to perform this case-control study. The haplotypes with significant difference in the gene (s) were further analyzed. Results: Among the 23 SNPs, 8 were found to be common in Chinese Han population. Allele frequency of one SNP, rs436045 in the protein kinase C/ζgene (PRKCZ) was statistically different between the case and control groups (P<0.05). Furthermore, haplotypes at five SNP sites of PRKCZ gene were identified. Conclusion: PRKCZ gene may be associated with type 2 diabetes in Han population in North China. The haplotypes at five SNP sites in this gene may be responsible for this association.

10744228976	Variation near the region of the lipoprotein lipase gene and hypertension or blood pressure levels in Chinese	Essential hypertension (EH) is a common late-onset disease that exhibits complex genetic heterogeneity. Human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a rate-limiting enzyme that regulates the catabolism of triglycerides (TG) and chylomicrons (CM). Since dyslipidemia is a common finding in hypertensive patients, the LPL gene is a logical candidate gene that could contribute to the development of hypertension. Using linkage analysis in 148 Chinese hypertensive families, we identified a region of linkage with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that consisted of a 10.6-cM interval defined by markers D8S1145, D8S261, and D8S282 on chromosome 8, which maps between 31 to 41.6 cM from the 8p-telomere contained LPL gene, with statistically significant p values for the marker D8S261 (p=0.0021 for SBP, and p=0.0395 for DBP). In the qualitative-trait linkage analysis, evidence for linkage between the marker D8S1145 and EH was found (p=0.0286). The transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT/S-TDT) also supported a significant linkage-disequilibrium of the allele 3 of D8S261 with EH (χ

10744231760	Structural Basis for the Specific Recognition of RET by the Dok1 Phosphotyrosine Binding Domain	Dok1 is a common substrate of activated protein-tyrosine kinases. It is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to receptor tyrosine activation and interacts with ras GTPase-activating protein and Nck, leading to inhibition of ras signaling pathway activation and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun activation, respectively. In chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, it has shown constitutive phosphorylation. The N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Dok1 can recognize and bind specifically to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of receptors. Here we report the crystal structure of the Dok1 PTB domain alone and in complex with a phosphopeptide derived from RET receptor tyrosine kinase. The structure consists of a β-sandwich composed of two nearly orthogonal, 7-stranded, antiparallel β-sheets, and it is capped at one side by a C-terminal α-helix. The RET phosphopeptide binds to Dok1 via a surface groove formed between strand β5 and the C-terminal α-helix of the PTB domain. The structures reveal the molecular basis for the specific recognition of RET by the Dok1 PTB domain. We also show that Dok1 does not recognize peptide sequences from TrkA and IL-4, which are recognized by Shc and IRS1, respectively.

0842313081	Overexpression of human reticulon 3 (hRTN3) in astrocytoma	Neuroendocrine-specific protein (NSP) reticulons (RTN) are endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein complexes, which are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and identified as markers for neuroendocrine differentiation. At least 4 different RTN genes have been identified in mammals, but in most cases, the functions of the encoded proteins except mammalian RTN4-A and RTN4-B are still elusive. In the present study, the expression of human reticulon 3 (hRTN3) in a variety of tissues was investigated. Northern blotting hybridization revealed higher expression of hRTN3 in normal brain and some endocrine-related organs such as thyroid relative to other non-endocrine organs. Twelve surgical specimens meeting the histological criteria for astrocytoma grade II, III, and IV were investigated by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, which demonstrated the overexpression of hRTN3 in astrocytoma tumor cells, while in non-cancerous brain tissues hRTN3 was mainly expressed in neurons and almost no signals in glia cells could be detected. The differential expression of hRTN3 between astrocytoma and non-cancerous tissue may provide insight into the progress of astrocytoma.

11144303653	NSPc1, a mainly nuclear localized protein of novel PcG family members, has a transcription repression activity related to its PKC phosphorylation site at S183	Nervous system polycomb 1 (NSPc1) shares high homology with vertebrate PcG proteins Mel-18 and Bmi-1. The mRNA of NSPc1 is highly expressed in the developmental nervous system [Mech. Dev. 102 (2001) 219-222]. However, the functional characterization of NSPc1 protein is not clear. In the present study, using Western blotting technique, we aimed to describe the distributions of NSPc1 protein in rat tissues and cell lines. The subcellular localization of NSPc1 was examined in HeLa and SH-SY5Ycell lines, and its transcriptional repression activity was examined in COS-7 cell line. We found that the NSPc1 protein was localized mainly in the nucleus. NSPc1 remarkably repressed the transcription. Most interestingly, both the C-terminal of NSPc1 and two phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal, especially the PKC phosphorylation site at S183, were important in mediating transcription repression. Taken together, results from our study suggest that NSPc1, as a typical PcG family member, has powerful transcriptional repression ability, which may be related to the PKC signaling pathway. © 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

12844251215	-717A>G polymorphism of human C-reactive protein gene associated with coronary heart disease in ethnic Han Chinese: The Beijing atherosclerosis study	Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD). We report here on the association between gene coding for CRP and CHD in the ethnic Han population of China. For this purpose two polymorphisms of -717A>G and +2147A>G of the CRP gene were identified by direct sequencing of genomic DNA derived from 48 randomly selected patients and these were further investigated for associations with CHD in 619 male patients and 615 age-matched male normal controls. The frequency of A allele carriers of -717A>G polymorphism was significantly higher in patients than in controls by univariate analysis. After controlling for other risk factors the association between this polymorphism and CHD remained significant by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Individuals carrying the -717A allele had an approx. 6.8-fold higher risk of developing CHD (odds ratio 6.84 compared with those not carrying this allele). Haplotype analysis confirmed the results of individual polymorphism analyses. However, the resolution of effect size is poor, which may be due to the deficiency in sample size of this study. Neither polymorphism was observed to have an influence on serum CRP level. Since the frequency difference between CHD cases and controls for the -717A allele carriers is only 2.28%, and homozygosity for -717G occurs in only 1.78% of subjects, -717 A>G polymorphism is not a major determinant of population genetic risk of CHD in the Chinese population. The association of this polymorphism with CHD supports the belief that carriers of -717A allele of the CRP gene are genetically predisposed to CHD in the Chinese Han population, and it remains possible that this polymorphism is in disequilibrium with one as yet unidentified functional polymorphism in the vicinity. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

13444254364	Linkage analysis of chromosome 1 with essential hypertension and blood pressure quantitative traits in Chinese families	Several recent studies have linked human chromosome 1p to essential hypertension (EH) or blood pressure (BP) levels. In an independent population of 148 hypertensive families from China we tested these findings. Thirty highly informative microsatellite markers spanning about 284 cM were genotyped. Qualitative linkage analysis was conducted using non-parametric linkage analysis implemented within the GENEHUNTER 2.0 software, whereas quantitative analysis was performed with the variance-component method integrated in the S.O.L.A.R. 1.7.4. software with an additional Haseman-Elston method using the SAGE/SIBPAL2 program. We observed suggestive linkage between D1S2890 (1p31, 80.9 cM) and hypertension using the multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis (NPL = 2.19, P = 0.01). In the quantitative analysis we didn't observe a significant excess of identity-by-descent allele sharing between the systolic blood pressure levels and the markers. However, the D1S207 microsatellite marker (1p21) which is located about 107 cM from the telomere of 1p showed weak linkage evidence with the diastolic blood pressure levels (LOD = 1.42). These findings suggest linkage of 1p31 with essential hypertension in the ethnic Chinese, and provide a potential clue for future studies involving candidate genes for hypertension. © University College London 2004.
