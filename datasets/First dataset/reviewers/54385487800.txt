9444267706	Method for controlling groove depth and duty cycle of rectangular photoresist gratings	Rectangular photoresist gratings can be fabricated by taking advantage of the nonlinearity of photoresist. For rectangular gratings the task of controlling groove profile is simplified to controlling the duty cycle and groove depth. By monitoring diffraction intensity of latent image in photoresist in real time, the optimal exposure dose can be determined. Then, by observing characteristic behavior of the development-monitoring curve, the development process can be stopped at the moment when photoresist at the groove troughs is completely etched away. Therefore, rectangular grooves with clean troughs can be obtained; meanwhile the groove depth is kept equal to the initial photoresist thickness. Further development will reduce the duty cycle. It has been proven reliable by experiments and theoretical analysis. For gratings with 1200 lp/mm groove spacing, the groove depth up to 1 μm has been controlled accurately in authors' present fabrication, and the duty cycle value obtained is in the range 0.2 to 0.6. The experimental results demonstrate that good controllability of groove profiles depends on good fringe stability of the laser interference patterns.

16644394026	In-situ end-point detection during ion-beam etching of multilayer dielectric gratings	An in-situ end-point detection technique for ion-beam etching is presented. A laser beam of the same wavelength and polarization as those in the intended application of the grating is fed into the vacuum chamber, and the beam retro-diffracted by the grating under etching is extracted and detected outside the chamber. This arrangement greatly simplifies the end-point detection. Modeling the grating diffraction with a rigorous diffraction grating computer program, we can satisfactorily simulate the evolution of the diffraction intensity during the etching process and consequently, we can accurately predict the end-point. Employing the proposed technique, we have reproducibly fabricated multilayer dielectric gratings with diffraction efficiencies of more than 92%.

17644363317	Group-theoretic approach to the enhancement of the Fourier modal method for crossed gratings: C<inf>2</inf> symmetry case	A new formulation of the Fourier modal method for crossed gratings with symmetry considerations is established by using the group-theoretic approach that we have developed recently. Considering crossed gratings with the C<inf>2</inf> symmetry (invariance after rotation about the normal of the mean grating plane through angle π), we present in detail the construction of the new algorithm, illustrate the improved computation efficiency, and discuss its application. It is shown theoretically and numerically that when the grating is Littrow mounted and the truncated reciprocal lattice of the diffracted field also has the C<inf>2</inf> symmetry, the maximum effective truncation number of the algorithm is doubled and the computation time is reduced by a factor of 4. The time saving factor is increased to 8 for the special case of normal incidence. © 2005 Optical Society of America.

19844377002	In-situ monitoring during ion-beam etching of multilayer dielectric gratings: Simulation and experiment	Utilizing the in-situ monitoring scheme, we obtained the relationship between diffraction efficiency and etching time under different ion beam conditions. Since the distribution of photoresist is found to be changing innegligible during etching and causes difficulties in determining the end-point, it becomes necessary to consider the photoresist effect on the diffraction efficiency. Taking into account the influence of the etch ratio of photoresist to hafnia, we simulated the efficiencies of the reflected -1st-order diffraction (-1st-order Littrow mount, λ=1064nm, TE polarization) as functions of etched depth. Though the midway evolution of the grating profile is complicated, the main features of the simulated curves agree very well with those of the experimental monitoring curves. With this knowledge, by in-situ monitoring the diffraction intensity, we can obtain good estimates of the etched depth and the erosion progress of the photoresist mask, which are of great help to determine the etching end-point and suitable working parameters of the etcher, and so as to achieve much better cost-efficiency. Employing the proposed in-situ monitoring scheme, multilayer dielectric gratings with retroreflected efficiency approaching 100% were fabricated.

22844434095	Group-theoretic approach to enhancing the Fourier modal method for crossed gratings with one or two reflection symmetries	The Fourier modal method for crossed gratings that have one or two reflection symmetries is reformulated by use of the group-theoretic approach that we developed recently. With this approach, a crossed-grating problem in a general Littrow mounting is decomposed into several symmetrical basis problems in which the symmetry relations of the electromagnetic fields (namely, the symmetry modes of the grating) are used to reduce the total computation cost. Owing to the systematic nature of the approach, the new formulation is succinct and the conclusions are also general. Theoretical and numerical results show that with the new formulation the computation time is reduced by a factor from 4 to 64 in different cases, and the memory occupation is also saved by 1/2 or 3/4. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the new algorithm and verify the theoretically predicted computation efficiency. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

0001280515	Symmetries of cross-polarization diffraction coefficients of gratings	In a recent paper [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 16, 1108 (1999)] Logofǎtu et al. demonstrated by experimental and numerical evidence that the 0th-order cross-polarization (s top and p to s) reflection coefficients of isotropic, symmetrical, surface-relief gratings in conical mount are identical. Here an analytical proof is given to show that the observed identity is merely a manifestation of the electromagnetic reciprocity theorem for the 0th-order diffraction of symmetrical gratings. The above result is further generalized to bianisotropic gratings, to the 0th-order cross-polarization transmission coefficients, and to the mth-order reflection and transmission coefficients when the wave vector of the incident plane wave and the negative of the wave vector of the mth reflected order are symmetrical with respect to the plane perpendicular to the grating grooves. © 2000 Optical Society of America.

23344439951	Measurement of duty cycles of photoresist grating masks made on top of multilayer dielectric stacks	We present a novel and nondestructive method for measuring the duty cycles (ratio of ridge width to period) of submicrometer rectangular photoresist gratings made on top of multilayer dielectric stacks. The method exploits the fact that the effective index of the leaky mode that has a strong evanescent tail in the cladding changes with the duty cycle of the grating situated at the interface between the top dielectric layer and the cladding. By comparing measured coupling angles of the leaky mode with a theoretical or experimentally calibrated relationship between coupling angles and duty cycle, one can determine the duty cycle of the grating. This method is applicable even when the grating period is less than the measurement wavelength. It is simple because it does not require any power measurement. Most importantly, it is virtually independent of groove depth. The physical principle of the method and the results of experimental verification are presented. © 2005 Optical Society of America.

27744512697	Design and experimental study of a harp-shaped single span cable-stayed bridge	This paper presents issues in the design concept, analysis, and test results of a harp-shaped single span cable-stayed bridge, Hongshan Bridge, located in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. The bridge has a 206 m span, with a pylon inclined at 58° from the horizontal and 13 pairs of parallel cable stays without a back stay. This paper discusses the design approach for the main components of the bridge. Emphasis will be put on the following three aspects. First, the weight of the pylon and all dead loads of the main girder in addition to part of the live loads must be in a balanced condition. Second, the main girder should be an orthotropic steel-concrete composite box girder because of the superior safety and weight reduction of this type of structure. Third, the cable stays should be anchored at the neutral axis of the pylon to prevent the development of high secondary moments caused by other anchor approaches. Furthermore, based on results from tests carried out on three models, namely, scaled full model tests in a scale of 1:30, scaled section model tests in a scale of 1:6, and wind tunnel tests, the following four key issues were studied: (1) the local stability of orthotropic steel-concrete composite box girder subjected to combined bending and axial loads; (2) the characteristics under loads of 13-m-long cantilever beams; (3) the safety of the bridge under some other dangerous conditions; and (4) the characteristics of wind resistance and wind tunnel testing. ©ASCE.

27844491481	Group-theoretic approach to enhancing the Fourier modal method for crossed gratings of plane group p3	The Fourier modal method for crossed gratings is reformulated by use of a group-theoretic approach when the grating structures, according to plane crystallography, are of plane group p3. By exploiting the structural symmetries of the grating, i.e. the invariance of grating pattern after rotations about the normal of the mean grating plane through angles n(2π/3), a general diffraction problem with asymmetrical incidence is decomposed into three so-called symmetrical basis problems whose field distributions are the symmetry modes of the grating. Then by solving the symmetrical basis problems instead of the original problem, we reduce the memory occupation and time consumption in numerical computation to 1/3 and 1/9 of those of the original formulation, respectively, if the truncated reciprocal lattice of the diffracted field also has the symmetry of the grating structure. For the special case of normal incidence, the reduction factor can be further reduced to 2/27. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the new formulation. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

31344470125	Phase constraint for the waves diffracted by lossless symmetrical gratings at Littrow mount	The energy conservation of grating diffraction is analyzed in a particular condition of incidence in which two incident waves reach a symmetrical grating from the two sides of the grating normal at the first-order Littrow mounting. In such a situation the incident waves generate an interference pattern with the same period as the grating. Thus in each direction of diffraction, interference occurs between two consecutive diffractive orders of the symmetrical incident waves. By applying only energy conservation and the geometrical symmetry of the grating profile to this problem it is possible to establish a general constraint for the phases and amplitudes of the diffracted orders of the same incident wave. Experimental and theoretical results are presented confirming the obtained relations. © 2006 Optical Society of America.

33644554226	Method of making mosaic gratings by using a two-color heterodyne interferometer containing a reference grating	We propose and demonstrate a two-color heterodyne interferometric method for making a perfect mosaic of two planar gratings that can substitute for a single and larger grating without introducing wavefront aberration at any wavelength. The lateral and longitudinal phase errors are separated and eliminated by use of two wavelengths in the interferometry. The accuracy of the phase difference measurement is improved by this heterodyne scheme. The method ensures that the lateral gap between the two subaperture gratings is an integer multiple of the grating period. For a pair of 0.72 μm period gratings we experimentally achieved a lateral alignment error of less than 1% of the grating period. © 2006 Optical Society of America.

32544443760	Experimental research on the creep behavior of twice prestressed concrete beam	Due to the greater additional stress of prestressing, many serious problems - such as the camber of straight beam being too large, curved beam going crosswise, and columns of rigid beam bridge cracking frequently occurred in the prestress tensioning process of medium or short span prestressed concrete beam bridge. To solve these problems, a new type of twice prestress technology was innovatively proposed in this work. Through theoretical and experimental comparison between this new structure and the traditional prestressed structure, it was found that the application of prestressing twice can significantly improve the mechanical and deformational performance of the low height beam in the construction process and also for long-term use. In addition, a theoretical solution to calculate creep strain and deformation due to twice prestressed with respect to time t were derived in this paper. Finally, the work concluded that this new structure will make it a bright application perspective for the medium and short span prestressed beam bridge to control the deformations.

In the new formulation, a crossed-grating problem is first decomposed into eight so-called symmetrical basis problems whose field distributions are the symmetry modes (four non-degenerate and the other four doubly degenerate) of the grating. Then by using the symmetry relations of the symmetry modes, we solve the symmetrical basis problems with simplification and superpose their solutions to get the solution of the original problem. It is shown that when the grating is at the (-2 s , - 2 t )th Littrow mountings ( s and t are both integers), the memory occupation in computation can be saved by 5/6 and the total computation cost is reduced to 1/48, 1/50.8, or 1/108 of the original one, depending on the incident angles.

33745759210	Controlling the duty cycle of photoresist gratings by setting the guided-wave coupling angles in monitoring of photoresist development	A new technique for controlling the duty cycle (ratio of ridge width to period) of photoresist gratings made on top of a multilayer dielectric stack is studied. It is used in conjunction with the real-time monitoring technique during photoresist development, and based on the principle that the effective refractive index of the leaky mode that has a strong evanescent tail in the cladding varies with the duty cycle of the grating situated at the interface between the top dielectric layer and the cladding. By applying the relationship of the coupling angle and duty cycle, a desired duty cycle can be obtained by terminating development when the leaky mode is excited under a preset incident angle. The experimental results showed that the duty cycle of the resulting grating can be adjusted by changing the incident angle. The work preliminarily establishes the feasibility of the technique. Experimental setup and procedure are presented, and the error sources and their influences are discussed.

33749489348	Cable anchorage structure of self-anchored suspension bridge	Self-anchored suspension bridge, in the span range of 100 m to 400 m, has been recognized as a cost-effective and favorable scheme in urban areas, due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to geological and topographic conditions. The Sanchaji bridge is a self-anchored suspension bridge with a main span of 328 m. The main cables are secured to the stiffening girders via steel anchor boxes, to ensure the strength, stiffness, stability and load transfer of the cable-girder connection. The design of cable-girder anchorage structure has become one of the most critical issues for self-anchored suspension bridges. Three cable anchorage systems, i.e. concrete anchorage, deck anchorage and loop cable anchorage systems are summarized, and their advantages, disadvantages and serviceability are investigated. A 3-D FEM analysis of the anchorage zone and a large scale (1:3.2) model test are carried out to verify the safety and reliability of the cable anchorage system. The calculation and test results indicate that the stresses of the anchorage structure are in the range of 70 MPa to 130 MPa under the design load, and below 200 MPa with 1.6 times overload. The findings reported in the present paper may provide a guideline for design of the cable anchorage structure of the self-anchored suspension bridge.

We adjust the relative attitude and position of the two sub-aperture gratings to produce Airy disk diffraction patterns in both wavelengths. In our experiment, the repeatability of in-plane rotation adjustment was 2.35 μrad and that of longitudinal adjustment was 0.11 μm.

34248385773	Using symmetries of grating groove profiles to reduce computation cost of the C method	This work reduces the computation cost of the C method by taking into account the symmetries of grating grooves. All one-dimensionally periodic, single-interface, surface-relief gratings are classified into five categories according to the symmetries of the planar periodic curves describing the interface. The five categories are reflection symmetry, inversion symmetry, reflection-translation symmetry, complete symmetry (i.e., simultaneous existence of all three aforementioned symmetries), and no symmetry. Reductions of the eigenvalue problem in the C method are first carried out in real space and then in Fourier space by taking advantage of the four types of symmetries. The reflection-translation symmetry can be used without any restriction on the incident angle, but the other symmetries require a Littrow mounting; simultaneous use of the reflection-translation symmetry with any other symmetry further requires an even-order Littrow mounting. The types of eigenfunctions to be solved and boundary conditions to be matched, as well as the time reduction ratios in solving the eigenvalue problem, are given for all possible combinations of groove symmetries and incident configurations. The time reduction ratios range from 1/4 to 1/64. © 2007 Optical Society of America.

34347217906	Concept, design, and construction of cable-stayed bridges without backstays	Hongshan Bridge is a harp-shaped cable-stayed bridge without backstays, located in Changsha. The behaviors of this type of bridge are different from those of the conventional cable-stayed bridge, which make some particularity on structural details and construction method. The newly constructed and in-service cable-stayed bridges without backstays are summarized. The weight balance relationship between pylon and girder and the criterion on determining the angles of pylon and cables are expounded in detail. It is found that the suitable inclination angle of pylon can be obtained via optimizing the cost of pylon and cables and reducing the influence of the weight error on the mechanical characteristics of pylon. The structural type and cross section of the main girder, the special structural details and the construction procedure of the Hongshan Bridge are presented. It is concluded that the steel-concrete composite spine girder structure is advantageous in satisfying the mechanical characteristics of the bridge. The special structural design for the two ends of the main span can ensure smooth transfer of forces between the pylon and the girder and between the main span and the auxiliary span. Moreover, the pre-bending prestressing method is capable of effectively improving the performance of the concrete deck in the transverse direction.

40049095703	Methods for increasing sidewall steepness of reactive ion-beam etched, sub-micrometer-period gratings	Modern application of sub-micrometer-period gratings often requires the grating profile to be rectangular with steep sidewalls. By comparing cross sections of gratings made by reactive ion-beam etching in two etchers equipped with different types of ion-beam sources, we find that the divergence of ion-beam strongly influences the sidewall steepness of sub-micrometer-period gratings fabricated by using reactive ion-beam etching. All conditions being equal, a smaller divergence angle renderes higher sidewall steepness. The divergence angle of the two-grid Kaufman ion-beam source that is widely used in China at present is typically larger than 13% limiting the attainable sidewall angle of gratings in etched fused silica to be only 77°, unless a special measure is taken. Using such an ion-beam source, we experimented with three etching methods (rotation-tilt method, alternate-tilt method and metallic-mask recoating method), and increased the sidewall angle of sub-micrometer-period fused silica gratings to 86°, 86° and 82°, respectively. Two mechanisms by which the ion-beam divergence affects the sidewall steepness are considered; the shrinkage rate of the mask's sidewalls and the difference between the ion fluxes at the bottom and the top of the grooves. The roles of these two mechanisms in the three etching methods are also explained.

49549085279	Numerical simulation and experimental demonstration of error compensation between recording structure and use structure of flat-field holographic concave gratings	A flat-field holographic concave grating can be the only optical element in a spectrometer. If the mutually compensating roles of the concave grating and the spectrometer are taken into account, the difficulty of fabricating concave grating can be reduced. When the holographic method is used to make concave gratings, it is very difficult to fix precisely the spatial distances between the two recording points and the vertex of concave gratings. In like manner, it is also difficult to fix precisely the location of the entrance slit or the CCD in using concave gratings in spectrometers. In other words, during the fabrication stage and the end-use stage of concave gratings, there are inevitable errors between the practical system structure parameters and the theoretical ones. The authors name them fabrication structure errors and end-use structure errors, respectively. Numerical simulation indicates that these two classes of errors will seriously deteriorate the spectral image quality. At present, there are few references describing the elimination of the fabrication and end-use errors of concave gratings. In this paper, a concave grating used in a compact chromatograph is analyzed as an example. By performing numerical simulations that take both fabrication structure parameters and end-use structure parameters into consideration, we found that in a large neighborhood around the design point, the two sets of parameters can mutually compensate. This means that even both sets are away from the optimized design points, as long as proper compensations are made, the spectral image quality of the spectrometer can be as good as designed. In other words, on the one hand, for a specific concave grating that has been made with some fabrication structure errors, we can move the CCD to find an appropriate location where the spectral image quality is as good as designed; On the other hand, for a decided end-use system which has some end-use structure errors, we can adjust the fabrication structure to make concave gratings that will generate good spectral images in this end-use system. The experiment results show that this method is an effective way to adjust the optical system for grating fabrication. The authors also give experimental results that agree with simulation results. Such compensation can reduce both the alignment difficulty and the required precision of fabrication structure parameters of concave gratings. It could also give theoretical guidance to the design and assembly of spectrometers.

The method uses an argon and oxygen ion beam to etch directly the fused silica substrate through a rectangular profile photoresist grating mask. The blaze angle can be significantly reduced by using oxygen, and the profile evolution under ion-beam bombardment can be simplified when a rectangular mask is used. A simple geometric model is built to analyze the etching process. The etched grating groove profile is approximately triangular with a sharp apex angle provided the aspect ratio of the mask ridge is properly chosen; the blaze angle is directly proportional to the ion-beam grazing incident angle for a fixed oxygen partial pressure. Gratings of a 24001ine/mm groove density and 0.5-3° blaze angles have been fabricated, which confirms the convenience of this method and the effectiveness of the etching model. © 2008 Optical Society of America.

68949127336	Asymmetrical excitation of surface plasmon polaritons on blazed gratings at normal incidence	We present results of numerical simulations and preliminary experiments to investigate and characterize the effect of asymmetrical coupling of normally incident light to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on metallic blazed gratings. Two types of blazed gratings are investigated, a two-dimensional (2D) area-coded binary grating and a one-dimensional (1D) slanted sinusoidal grating. The 2D blazed grating, which can be fabricated with standard e -beam lithography, is shown to have the same ability as the classical 1D blazed grating to enhance the strength of the -1st (+1st) evanescent order over the +1st (-1st) counterpart, which leads to the asymmetrical excitation of two counterpropagating SPP modes on the grating surface. The 1D blazed grating, as a reference, is also studied experimentally to verify the previous theoretical predictions. In our first experiments, the observed asymmetrical coupling effect is relatively weak compared with the optimal designs due to many practical limitations. However, good agreement between theory and experiment has been obtained, and physical insight concerning the observed SPP coupling phenomena has been gained. Further measures to realize stronger asymmetrical excitation of SPPs on blazed gratings at normal incidence are discussed. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

68249108839	Design method of convex master gratings for replicating flat-field concave gratings	Flat-field concave diffraction grating is the key device of a portable grating spectrometer with the advantage of integrating dispersion, focusing and flat-field in a single device. It directly determines the quality of a spectrometer. The most important two performances determining the quality of the spectrometer are spectral image quality and diffraction efficiency. The diffraction efficiency of a grating depends mainly on its groove shape. But it has long been a problem to get a uniform predetermined groove shape across the whole concave grating area, because the incident angle of the ion beam is restricted by the curvature of the concave substrate, and this severely limits the diffraction efficiency and restricts the application of concave gratings. the authors present a two-step method for designing convex gratings, which are made holographically with two exposure point sources placed behind a plano-convex transparent glass substrate, to solve this problem. The convex gratings are intended to be used as the master gratings for making aberration-corrected flat-field concave gratings. To achieve high spectral image quality for the replicated concave gratings, the refraction effect at the planar back surface and the extra optical path lengths through the substrate thickness experienced by the two divergent recording beams are considered during optimization. This two-step method combines the optical-path-length function method and the ZEMAX software to complete the optimization with a high success rate and high efficiency. In the first step, the optical-path-length function method is used without considering the refraction effect to get an approximate optimization result. In the second step, the approximate result of the first step is used as the initial value for ZEMAX to complete the optimization including the refraction effect. An example of design problem was considered. The simulation results of ZEMAX proved that the spectral image quality of a replicated concave grating is comparable with that of a directly recorded concave grating.

In addition, the method uses a red laser wavelength in the plane-mirror interferometers for the multi-dimensional attitude adjustment, so the adjustment can be done at leisure.

77953755225	Seismic performance analyses of energy-saving block and invisible multi-ribbed frame walls	Based on the tests of six modes of energy-saving block and invisible multi-ribbed frame walls with 1: 2 under low-cycle lateral loading, the main failure processes were studied on the normal wall, the seismic performance of the wall such as bearing capacity, ductility and energy dissipation was investigated. In order to estimate seismic behavior of energy-saving block and invisible multi-ribbed frame walls further more, a program of nonlinear finite element for complete load-displacement curve both rising branch and falling branch is made. The problem of falling branch is resolved comparatively well. Analytical load-displacement curves are found in a good agreement with the test results. The factors which influence the ductility such as shear-span ratio, axial compression ratio and reinforcement ratio are discussed and the results shown that: With the increase of shear span ratio, the ductility coefficient constantly increases, when the shear span ratio is greater than 1.5, the effects of shear span ratio decrease; With the increase of axial compression ratio, the ductility coefficient ceaselessly diminishes, in the state of low axial pressure ratio, the ductility coefficient are slowly reduced, however, in the state of high axial compression ratio, the ductility coefficient decreases rapidly; As the reinforcement increases, the ductility coefficient shows increasing trend, particularly ribbed beam reinforcement increase, the ductility coefficient increases rapidly. Finally, based on the above analyses, some detail requirements to guarantee the ductility of walls are recommended.

77953162642	Experimental study on fluid flow characteristic in orthogonal fracture network	In order to investigate fluid flow characteristic in orthogonal fracture network model and the effect of structure on permeability, fracture network models with different structure were made by marble and stainless steel filling piece. A series of single and two-phase fluid flow experiments were conducted on fracture network models by using of special physical simulation installment. The results show that fluid flow follows Darcy flow when velocity is low, however, fluid flow curves bend to pressure gradient axis with the velocity creasing and fluid flow presents nonlinear characteristics. Permeability is bigger in fracture network model with more fractures parallel to fluid flow. In fracture network model with fewer fractures parallel to fluid flow, final recovery efficiency and the injection-production pressure difference are bigger, and water cut increases slowly. Oil in fracture network is displaced by pressure gradient and gravity. Fluid flow in parallel fracture follows Darcy law. And gravity plays an important role in vertical fracture.

77955519601	Fabrication of large grating by monitoring the latent fringe pattern	Contemporary chirped-pulse-amplified high-power laser systems rely on meter-sized diffraction gratings for pulse compression. Fabricating large gratings is a bottle-neck problem. We developed a multiple-holographic-exposure method to fabricate large monolithic gratings. In consecutive exposures, the attitude of the photoresist-coated substrate is monitored and adjusted by using two interferometers with a He-Ne laser, and the relative position between the substrate and the exposure interference fringes is adjusted by using the interference fringes between the diffraction orders of the latent grating with the exposure beams as the incident beams.

0035759639	Fourier modal method for crossed anisotropic gratings	A Fourier modal method for analyzing crossed anisotropic gratings is presented. No restriction is imposed on the permittivity tensor of the medium in the grating region. A skew Cartesian coordinate system with skew angles both in and out of the grating plane is used in the mathematical derivation, which gives the formulation a greater generality. However, the facets of the crossed gratings are required to be parallel to the skew coordinate surfaces. Correct Fourier factorization of Maxwell's equations is carded out with aid of two efficient operators that greatly simplify otherwise complicated notation. Numerical curves are presented to demonstrate the convergence of the method, and numerical values are tabulated to provide reference data.

79958803352	Field singularities at lossless metal-dielectric right-angle edges and their ramifications to the numerical modeling of gratings	We mathematically prove and numerically demonstrate that the source of the convergence problem of the analytical modal method and the Fourier modal method for modeling some lossless metal-dielectric lamellar gratings in TM polarization recently reported by Gundu and Mafi [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 27, 1694 (2010)] is the existence of irregular field singularities at the edges of the grating grooves. We show that Fourier series are incapable of representing the transverse electric field components in the vicinity of an edge of irregular field singularity; therefore, any method, not necessarily of modal type, using Fourier series in this way is doomed to fail. A set of precise and simple criteria is given with which, given a lamellar grating, one can predict whether the conventional implementation of a modal method of any kind will converge without running a convergence test. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

79960576244	Theory analysis for force transferring performance of energy-saving block and invisible multi-ribbed frame wall	Based on the parametric analysis by means of nonlinear finite element model (FEM) program, the factors which may influence bearing capacity and stiffness of wall were theoretically studied with the created finite element model for energy-saving block and invisible multi-ribbed frame, including shear-span ratio, axial compression ratio and reinforcement; furthermore, single force transferring performance of box grid and interaction between energy-saving block and invisible multi-ribbed frame were studied too. The results show that with the increase of shear-span ratio, the decline of wall stiffness is greater, and the ultimate capacity decreases gradually till to a stable level; with the increase of axial compression ratio, the three-stage-stiffness and the ultimate capacity of wall increase to a certain degree; with the increase of reinforcement, the wall stiffness slightly increases but limited, and the ultimate capacity of the wall increases. Pure box grid failure mode is for frame bending damage, the moment values are the greatest in the four corner areas and the moment plays a main role, the structure becomes a mobile system and bearing capacity decreases after the four corner areas occur to plastic hinges; invisible multi-ribbed frame and block work together to effectively reduce the damage degree of the box grid, which has great protection for the working performance of rib beam and rib column.

84859231523	Field singularities at lossless metal-dielectric arbitrary-angle edges and their ramifications to the numerical modeling of gratings	I extend a previous work [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 28, 738 (2011)] on field singularities at lossless metal-dielectric rightangle edges and their ramifications to the numerical modeling of gratings to the case of arbitrary metallic wedge angles. Simple criteria are given that allow one knowing the lossless permittivities and the arbitrary wedge angles to determine if the electric field at the edges is nonsingular, can be regularly singular, or can be irregularly singular without calculating the singularity exponent. Furthermore, the knowledge of the singularity type enables one to predict immediately if a numerical method that uses Fourier expansions of the transverse electric field components at the edges will converge or not without making any numerical tests. All conclusions of the previous work about the general relationships between field singularities, Fourier representation of singular fields, and convergence of numerical methods for modeling lossless metal-dielectric gratings have been reconfirmed. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

84862909513	Experimental hysteretic behavior of in-plane loaded reinforced grouted multi-ribbed aerated concrete blocks masonry walls	Abstract. In order to analyze the experimental hysteretic behavior of the in-plane loaded reinforced grouted multi-ribbed aerated concrete blocks masonry walls (RGMACBMW), we have carried out the pseudo static testing on the six specimens of RGMACBMW. Based on the test results and shear failure characteristics, the shear force hysteretic curves and displacement envelope curves of the models were obtained and discussed. On the basis of the hysteretic curves a general skeleton curve of the shear force and displacement was formed. The restoring model was adopted to analyze the seismic behavior and earthquake response of RGMACBMW. The deformation capacity of the specimens was discussed, and the formulas for calculating the lateral stiffness of the walls at different loading stages were proposed as well. The average lateral displacement ductility factor of RGMACBMW calculated based on the test results was 3.16. This value illustrates that if the walls are appropriately designed, it can fully meet the seismic requirement of the structures. The quadri-linear restoring models of the walls degradation by the test results accurately reflect the hysteretic behaviors and skeleton curves of the masonry walls. The restoring model can be applied to the RGMACBMW structure in earthquake response analysis.

0038242382	Resonant optical transmission through thin metallic films with and without holes	Using a rigorous electromagnetic analysis of two-dimensional (or crossed) gratings, we account, in a first step, for the enhanced transmission of a sub-wavelength hole array pierced inside a metallic film, when plasmons are simultaneously excited at both interfaces of the film. Replacing the hole array by a continuous metallic film, we then show that resonant extraordinary transmission can still occur, provided the film is modulated. The modulation may be produced in both a one-dimensional and a two dimensional geometry either by periodic surface deformation or by adding an array of high index pillars. Transmittivity higher than 80% is found when surface plasmons are excited at both interfaces, in a symmetric configuration. © 2003 Optical Society of America.

0038706086	Measurement of phase differences between the diffracted orders of deep relief gratings	Measurement of the phase difference between the 0th and the 1st transmitted diffraction orders of a symmetrical surface-relief grating recorded on a photoresist film is carried out by replacement of the grating in the same setup with which it was recorded. The measurement does not depend on lateral shifts of the replaced grating relative to the interference pattern, on environmental phase perturbations or on the wave-front quality of the interfering beams. The experimental data agree rather well with theoretical results calculated for sinusoidal profiled gratings. © 2003 Optical Society of America.

84868671411	Study on system vulnerability of medium span reinforced concrete continuous girder bridge under earthquake excitation	Medium span multi-span continuous RC bridges, whose main failure modes are reflected in piers, abutments or bearings, are widely used in China. One common continuous girder bridge is taken as the analytical model; uncertainties in the strength of material and the weight of superstructure are considered, then a set of 10 nominally identical but statistically different bridge samples are developed for the bridge using the Latin hypercube sampling technique. 100 earthquake records are chosen from PEER according to the site condition of bridge to account for the uncertainty of ground motions, and then combined randomly with 10 bridge samples. Then, a series of nonlinear time-history analyses are conducted to obtain the responses of structure, and four limit states for different components are defined. vunerability curves of piers, abutments and bearings are obtained utilizing the traditional reliability and probability tools, and furthermore the system vulnerability of structure is studied using the joint failure probability method. The results show that the bearings, especially the active bearing of abutment, are more vulnerable than the column piers and the abutments. The failure probability of bridge system, which is calculated using the first-order and the second-order reliability principles, is larger than those of structural members, indicating that it is more reasonable to assess the seismic behavior of bridge basing on the system vulnerability.

84870029033	Computer simulation of the flow field in ESP with transverse collection plates	The computer simulation of the flow field in ESP with transverse collection plates was carried out, in which a physical model was adopted to simulate the flow field, and the computation was based on the SIMPLE algorithm. The finite volume method was adopted for computation area discretization, the mesh was generated with GAMBIT, and the computer simulation of flow field was carried on with FLUENT. We can draw the conclusion, by researching the changing of the flow field with the increasing of the velocity of flow inlet: its velocity lines of flow inlet which can be regarded as laminar motion are parallel, and the density increased with the increasing of the velocity of flow inlet ;it can form the turbulent near the collection plates and poles, whose intensity increased with the increasing of the velocity of flow inlet ;There is an obvious pressure loss from inlet to the outlet of the ESP, which is also increased with the increasing of the velocity of flow inlet, but it is quite stable between two plates. ©2010 IEEE.

84875920679	Phase invariance in a recently proposed common-path laser interferometer	This study shows that the principle of a recently proposed common-path laser interferometer containing a planar grating is nonexistent and apparently caused by a mathematical derivation error. Both p- and s-polarized beams in the proposed setup experience once the +1st-order diffraction and once the -1st-order diffraction by the grating. As a result, the phase of each beam remains unchanged and the interference fringes formed by the two beams are not expected to move when the grating is translated in the grating vector direction. We perform an experiment to confirm this prediction. Both our analysis and experimental observation cast doubt on the experimental results of the authors who proposed the interferometer. © 2012 Chinese Optics Letters.

Based on test results and finite element analysis, the comprehensive comparative analysis on similarity of the stress state between steel beam and CBCW was conducted. By fracture mechanics analysis and comparison between the test and finite element analysis results, the fatigue life calculation model was studied and the S-N curves of CBCW were derived. The results show that, for design of CBCW, the category C design standard of the AASHTO 2007 specifications is recommended for finite life fatigue design calculation for safety.

0043076039	Note on the S-matrix propagation algorithm	A set of full-matrix recursion formulas for the W → S variant of the S-matrix algorithm is derived, which includes the recent results of some other authors as a subset. In addition, a special type of symmetry that is often found in the structure of coefficient matrices (W matrices) that appear in boundary-matching conditions is identified and fully exploited for the purpose of increasing computation efficiency. Two tables of floating-point operation (flop) counts for both the new W → S variant and the old W → t → S variant of the S-matrix algorithm are given. Comparisons of flop counts show that in performing S-matrix recursions in the absence of the symmetry, it is more efficient to go directly from W matrices to S matrices. In the presence of the symmetry, however, using t matrices is equally and sometimes more advantageous, provided that the symmetry is utilized. © 2003 Optical Society of America.

0242524372	All-dielectric reflection gratings: A study of the physical mechanism for achieving high efficiency	The physical mechanism for the all-dielectric reflection gratings to achieve high efficiency in the - Ist-order Littrow mounting is studied. The all-dielectric gratings consist of two parts, a surface-relief grating and a highly reflecting dielectric stack. The surface-relief grating sits on top of the reflecting stack. A simple analytical expression for diffraction efficiency is obtained in terms of the S-matrix elements of the two parts. By analyzing the expression we show that the diffraction can be interpreted as the interference of a symmetric wave and an antisymmetric wave. The conditions for achieving high diffraction efficiency are also identified. The analytical results are illustrated by numerical computations. © 2003 Optical Society of America.

84896524490	Experimental research on dynamic monitoring of bridges using GNSS and accelerometer	To guarantee the integrality and accuracy of monitoring structural vibration of bridges, the experiment was conducted on the Nottingham Wilford Suspension Bridge using GNSS receiver and accelerometer. A special cage and a precise time data logger were made by the University of Nottingham to guarantee the same monitoring site and time synchronization. Accelerometer and GNSS data with three modes of conventional RTK, network RTK and post-processing were collected synchronously. The vibration displacements were identified by the designed filtering method integrating adaptive filter and Chebyshev filter. The results show that the GNSS receiver and accelerometer can detect low and high frequencies respectively. The frequencies identified by both sensors are similar in overlapping frequency band. The dynamic displacements identified by both sensors are similar with the standard deviation and mean value being less than 1 mm. The integrating method for bridge dynamic monitoring can be used for long-span bridges with low frequency and large amplitude vibration, and for the small or medium-span bridges with high frequency and small amplitude vibration.

0942278561	Formulation of the Fourier modal method for symmetric crossed gratings in symmetric mountings	The Fourier modal method for modelling crossed gratings is revisited in the case of symmetrical grating profiles. It is shown that when a plane wave is symmetrically incident on a grating, whose surface profile is mirror-reflection symmetric with respect to the two planes that are perpendicular to the grating plane and contain the two orthogonal periodic directions of the grating, the computational effort can be substantially reduced. For example, at normal incidence with polarization parallel to one of the periodic directions, the special formulation takes only about 1/64 of the computation time that the general formulation takes. Because the use of the symmetry conserves memory and speeds up computation, more accurate results can be obtained and more difficult problems can be treated.
