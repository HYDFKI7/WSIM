62749112777	Multi-hierarchy and fine-grained task-role-based access control in collaborative environments	This paper presents a novel multi-hierarchy and task-role based access control model named H-TRBAC. In the model, we create two multi-hierarchical sets, i.e., a role set and a task set. In the task hierarchy, a task may have some partial ordering relationships with other tasks. A task can not be scheduled until its entire ancestors are completed. It is the task's duty to select necessary roles and permissions and assign a proper permission to a suitable role. The assignment process will be done only when the task is run, and permissions will be revoked just after the task turns to other states. At last, we give all the necessary operational functions to describe the structure of H-TRBAC, and detailed comparisons among our model and others are also given. © 2008 IEEE.

62949172258	Multi-granularity time-constraint role-based access control	The research work of basic Role-based access control RBAC is greatly emphasized in recent years. However, many of present works have nothing to do with the time character. After detail analysis about the RBAC 2004 model, a new RBAC model with multigranularity time character called MG-TRBAC is proposed. In our new access control model, user, object, permission and roles are all temporal sensitive. Time constraints are measured by more than one granularity and can be implemented implicitly. The most interesting character in our access control model is that MG-TRBAC can adjust the minimum time unit threshold automatically; therefore, our access control model can save time and computational work deeply and efficiently. © 2008 IEEE.

An initialization scheme based on the problem-specific heuristics is presented to generate an initial population with a certain level of quality and diversity. A local search based on the insert neighborhood is embedded to improve the algorithm's local exploitation ability. The IABC is compared with the existing hybrid discrete differential evolution and discrete artificial bee colony algorithms based on the well-known flowshop benchmark of Taillard. The computational results and comparison demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IABC algorithm for the blocking flowshop scheduling problems with makespan criterion. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84862829861	An effective shuffled frog-leaping algorithm for multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problems	In this paper, we propose a hybrid shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (HSFLA) for solving the multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem. Three minimization objectives - the maximum completion time (makespan), the total workload of all machines, and the workload of the critical machine are considered simultaneously. In the proposed algorithm, several approaches are presented to construct the initial population with a high level of quality. Then each frog in the population is assigned to a corresponding memeplex according to the number of individuals who dominate it and then the number of frogs who are dominated by it. In the memetic evolution process, two crossover operators are presented to share information among the best frogs and the worst frog. Meanwhile, several local search methods are embedded in the algorithm to enhance the exploitation capability. Experimental results on the well-known benchmark instances and comparisons with other recently published algorithms show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a Modified Inver-over operator is proposed to solve the TSP. In the Modified Inver-over operator, the direction of the tour is considered when applying the inversion and the city c is decided whether it is kept same after the inversion according to adaptively increasing probability, meanwhile, the α-nearest candidate set is used when selecting city c′. We evaluate the proposed operator based on standard TSP test problems selected from TSPLIB and show that the proposed operator performs better than the Basic Inver-over operator and other operator in terms of solution quality and computational effort. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84863076867	A hybrid dynamic harmony search algorithm for identical parallel machines scheduling	In this article, a dynamic harmony search (DHS) algorithm is proposed for the identical parallel machines scheduling problem with the objective to minimize makespan. First, an encoding scheme based on a list scheduling rule is developed to convert the continuous harmony vectors to discrete job assignments. Second, the whole harmony memory (HM) is divided into multiple small-sized sub-HMs, and each sub-HM performs evolution independently and exchanges information with others periodically by using a regrouping schedule. Third, a novel improvisation process is applied to generate a new harmony by making use of the information of harmony vectors in each sub-HM. Moreover, a local search strategy is presented and incorporated into the DHS algorithm to find promising solutions. Simulation results show that the hybrid DHS (DHS-LS) is very competitive in comparison to its competitors in terms of mean performance and average computational time. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84864968874	Harmony search algorithm with dynamic control parameters	Harmony search (HS) is a population-based meta-heuristic imitating the music improvisation process, which has been successfully applied to optimization problems in recent years. This paper presents an effective harmony search algorithm for solving global continuous optimization problems. The proposed method presents a novel improvisation process which is different from the classical HS in two aspects. Firstly, the candidate harmony is chosen from the harmony memory by a tournament selection rule, so that the harmonies with better fitness will have more opportunities to be used in generating new harmonies. Secondly, two key control parameters, pitch adjustment rate (PAR) and bandwidth distance (bw), are adjusted dynamically with respect to the evolution of the search process and the different search spaces of the optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than the existing HS variants in terms of the solution quality and the stability. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84873539186	A hybrid harmony search algorithm combined with differential evolution for global optimization problems	Harmony search (HS) is a recently proposed meta-heuristic by imitating music improvisation process, which has drawn much attention in the past few years. However, researches have revealed that the performance and the convergence rate of the method are suffered when dealing with high-dimensional or/and multimodal problems. To get a better control between exploitation and exploration, a hybrid HS algorithm is proposed, which is characterized in two aspects. First, the memory consideration scheme is modified by introducing crossover and mutation operators, which is inspired by the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Second, two control parameters, namely PAR and bw, are either dynamically adjusted or self-learning along with the evolution process to fine-tune the solutions. Numerical results based on a test suite of well-known benchmark functions show that the proposed algorithm is more effective or at least competitive in finding near-optimal solutions compared with three HS variants and the DE/rand/1/bin algorithm. © 2012 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

84875477107	A hybrid discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving fuzzy job shop scheduling problem	In this paper, a hybrid algorithm combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and tabu search (TS) is proposed to solve the job shop scheduling problem with fuzzy processing time. The object is to minimize the maximum fuzzy completion time, i.e., the fuzzy makespan. In the proposed algorithm, PSO performs the global search, i.e., the exploration phase, while TS conducts the local search, i.e., the exploitation process. The global best particle is used to direct other particles to optimal search space. Therefore, in the proposed algorithm, TS-based local search approach is applied to the global best particle to conduct find-grained exploitation. In order to share information among particles, one-point crossover operator is embedded in the hybrid algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested on sets of the well-known benchmark instances.

84878123665	The implications between C-SPR and CRn (n&prime;, n) visited	The compression function is wildly used via many kinds of iterations in the construction of the modern hash function intended for use with standard digital signatures following the hash-and-sign mode. Some variants of second-preimage resistance(SPR)[1] assumptions of the keyless compression function, called c-SPR, r-SPR and e-SPR, have been put forth by Halevi and Krawczyk[2], in order to obtain higher security properties for the dedicated-key hash function by iteration. In this paper, we compare one variant, called c-SPR, with CRn (n&prime;, n) which has been raised by Mironov[3]. We give several different schemes of the dedicated-key compression functions firstly, the relations between c-SPR and CRn (n&prime;, n) differ in different schemes. In the second part of this paper, we provide a full picture of the relations between c-SPR and CRn (n&prime;, n), and give the additional restrictions that ensure c-SPR of the keyless compression function to be the necessary or sufficient conditions of CRn (n&prime;, n) of the dedicated-key compression function separately. © 2012 IEEE.

84879115741	Effective heuristics for the no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with total flow time minimization	The no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with total flow time criterion has important applications in industrial systems. Heuristics that explore specific characteristics of the problem are essential to find good solutions in limited computational time for many practical applications. This paper first presents two constructive heuristics, namely improved standard deviation heuristic (ISDH) and improved Bertolissi heuristic (IBH), by combining the standard deviation heuristic (Gao et al., Int J Adv Manf Technol 56:683-692, 2011) and Bertolliso heuristic (Bertolissi, J Mater Process Technol 107:459-465, 2000) with the procedure of the constructive heuristic of Laha (Int J Adv Manf Technol 41:97-109, 2009). Then, four composite heuristics, i.e., ISDH with local search, IBH with local search, ISDH with iteration, and IBH with iteration, are separately proposed using the insertion-based local search method and iteration operator to improve the solutions of the ISDH and IBH. Extensive computational experiments are carried out based on a set of well-known flow shop benchmark instances that are considered as no-wait flow shop instances. Computational results and comparisons show that the proposed composite heuristics perform significantly better than the existing ones, and the proposed composite heuristics further improve the presented constructive heuristics for the no-wait flow shop scheduling problem with total flow time criterion. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

84880922087	Chemical-reaction optimization for solving fuzzy job-shop scheduling problem with flexible maintenance activities	This paper proposes a hybrid chemical-reaction optimization (HCRO) algorithm for solving the job-shop scheduling problem with fuzzy processing time. The flexible maintenance activities under both resumable and non-resumable situations are also considered to make the problem more close to the reality. In the proposed algorithm, each solution is represented by a chemical molecule. Four elementary reactions, i.e.; on-wall ineffective collision, inter-molecular ineffective collision, decomposition, and synthesis, are imposed. A well-designed crossover function is introduced in the synthesis and decomposition operators. In order to balance the exploitation and exploration, HCRO divides the evolution phase into two loop bodies: the first loop body contains on-wall ineffective collision and inter-molecular ineffective collision, while the second loop body includes all the four elementary reactions. Tabu search (TS) based local search is embedded in the proposed algorithm to enhance the convergence capability. A novel decoding approach is utilized to schedule each operation, while considering each flexible preventive maintenance activity on each machine. The proposed algorithm is tested on sets of the well-known benchmark instances. Through the analysis of experimental results, the highly effective performance of the proposed HCRO algorithm is shown against three efficient algorithms from the literature, i.e.; SMGA (Sakawa and Mori, 1999), GPSO (Niu et al.; 2008), and RKGA (Zheng et al.; 2010). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents an effective discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm that has a hybrid representation and a combination of forward decoding and backward decoding methods for solving the problem. Based on the dispatching rules, the well-known NEH heuristic, and the two decoding methods, we first provide a total of 24 heuristics. Next, an initial population is generated with a high level of quality and diversity based on the presented heuristics.

A problem-specific local refinement procedure is developed to search for solution space that is unexplored by the honey bees. Afterward, the parameters and operators of the proposed DABC are calibrated by means of a design of experiments approach. Finally, a comparative evaluation is conducted, with the best performing algorithms presented for the HFS problem under consideration, and with adaptations of some state-of-the-art metaheuristics that were originally designed for other HFS problems. The results show that the proposed DABC performs much better than the other algorithms in solving the HFS problem with the makespan criterion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84909982502	Solving the steelmaking casting problem using an effective fruit fly optimisation algorithm	This paper presents an effective fruit fly optimisation algorithm (FOA) to solve the steelmaking casting problem. First, we model the realistic problem as a hybrid flow shop (HFS) scheduling problem with batching in the last stage. Next, the proposed FOA algorithm is applied to solve the realistic HFS problems. In the proposed algorithm, each solution is represented by a fruit fly. Each fruit fly first improves its status through a well-designed smell search procedure. During the vision-based search procedure, the worst fruit fly in the population will be induced by the best fruit fly found thus far to improve the exploitation ability of the entire fruit fly population further. To enhance the exploration ability of the proposed algorithm, in each generation, each fruit fly that has not updated its status during the last several iterations will be replaced by a newly-generated fruit fly. The proposed algorithm is tested on sets of the instances that are generated based on the realistic production. Moreover, the influence of the parameter setting is also investigated using the Taguchi method of the design-of-experiment (DOE) to determine the suitable values for the key parameters. The results indicate that the proposed FOA is more effective than the four presented algorithms.
