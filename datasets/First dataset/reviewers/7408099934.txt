1642369381	Evaluations on a Buffering WDM Optical Packet Switch Equipped with Shared Wavelength Converters	In this paper, a buffering WDM optical packet switch scheme employing the wavelength converters for contention resolution is evaluated. The architecture is dedicated to an individual buffer for each output and is equipped with tunable wavelength converters (TWCs) shared among the input lines. With the wavelength dimension for contention resolution, the size of each output buffer is reduced and less number of wavelength converters is employed; therefore, it is cost-effective. Based on the switch architecture, lower packet loss probability can be achieved. Furthermore, we analyze mean contention time in output contention process and mean packet delay in output buffer.

2142847325	Compensating fiber gratings for source flatness to reduce multiple-access interferences in optical CDMA network coder/decoders	A fiber-Bragg-grating (FBG)-based optical code- division multiple-access (OCDMA) network coder/decoder (codec) is investigated for its interference suppression induced by non- flattened broad-band lightwave sources. Since each network user with different signature address code has different spectral distribution , the nonflattened light sources will cause multiple-access interference (MAI). Flatness compensation schemes are proposed to solve the MAI effects induced by nonflattened broad-band light sources. By arranging the same coding scheme but in different spectral coding band, spectral chips from FBG coder/compensator will incoherently power summed in the photodetectors to approach a more flattened power level. Signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) performances are evaluated with such compensation method for the discussed OCDMA network.

Based on the developed multiple-access coding techniques, correlation subtractions of nearly orthogonal codes have been applied in this paper. We introduce the transmissive spectral characteristics of FBGs to construct our FBG encoder/decoder. Instead, it provides several important advantages. First, the cost is lowered due to our circulator-freed architecture. Second, the round-trip time problem is resolved. Besides, we also can eliminate the effect of chips power variance. The testbed consists of two active encoders and three decoders. Both matched and unmatched cases are demonstrated.

It is found that merged M-hop sequences not only possess higher capacity but also simpler configuration; it also cost less under the same BER conditions. In the proposed hybrid system, it has the advantages of good correlation properties for asynchronous / synchronous optical CDMA systems and more simultaneous users with simpler and lower cost configuration.

These 2-D codewords have multiple weights per row and can be encoded/decoded via compact hardware. With the proposed decoding mechanism, the intended user will reject interfering users and multiple-access interference is fully eliminated. In addition, the power of the same wavelength contributed by all interfering codewords is split and detected by distinct photodiodes in the decoder. Thus the performance degradation due to the beat noise arising in the photodetecting process is improved, as compared with the traditional 1-D coding scheme, and a larger number of active users is supported under a given bit-error rate. © 2006 IEEE.

33644521237	Incoherent hybrid spectral amplitude and polarization coding implemented over differential photo-detectors	This study proposes a spectral amplitude/polarization coding (SAC/SPC) scheme for the implementation of bipolar optical correlation in a non-coherent optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) network. The present coder/decoders (codecs) are implemented over differential photo-detectors based on hybrid fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and polarization beam splitters (PBSs). In the proposed scheme, the Walsh-Hadamard code is employed as a signature address to allocate each specified wavelength an individual SOP (i.e. a vertical or horizontal state). Hence, the previous complementary unipolar SAC scheme, which transmitted the specific codeword on data bit one and its complementary codeword on data bit zero, is incorporated with polarization coding (i.e., called hybrid SAC/SPC) as the specific signature address code and is therefore suitable for bipolar spectral systems. The evaluation results indicate that, theoretically, multiple access interference (MAI) can be completely eliminated.

33748593628	Complementary bipolar spectral polarization coding over fiber-grating-based differential photodetectors	This study proposes a spectral polarization coding scheme for the implementation of complementary bipolar optical correlation in a noncoherent optical code-division multiple-access network. The coder-decoders0 are implemented over differential photodetectors based on fiber Bragg gratings and polarization beamsplitters. Traditionally, complementary unipolar spectral amplitude coding (SAC) schemes are used to transmit the specific codeword on data bit 1 and its complementary codeword on data bit 0. In the proposed scheme, the spectral amplitude is incorporated with polarization coding as the specific signature address code. A Walsh-Hadamard code is employed as the signature address to allocate to each specified wavelength to an individual vertical or horizontal state of polarization. The results indicate that multiple-access interference can theoretically be eliminated by correlation subtraction at the differential photodetectors. Neglecting the effects of shot noise and thermal noise, and considering only phase-induced intensity noise with a degree-of-polarization setting of P=0 for the ideal case, the bit error rate (BER) versus the number of simultaneous active users is improved by 43% in the proposed scheme over the complementary unipolar SAC scheme for a 10

33748608028	Suppression of phase noises with residual-spectra eliminator in circulator-free fiber-grating optical code-division multiple-access network coder/decoder	In this work, transmissive spectral characteristics of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are applied to construct a circulator-free scheme of an optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) network coder/decoder (codec). The unnecessary spectra would accompany the coding chips to arrive at the photodetectors (PDs) to induce higher phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) and multiple-access interference (MAI). A residual-spectra eliminator (RSE) between OCDMA encoder and decoder modules is employed to remove the unnecessary spectral parts of data so that the PIIN and MAI can be reduced. A simple experiment performed on the basis of transmissive spectral characteristics of FBGs together with RSE is demonstrated to verify the capability of suppressing residual-spectra noise at the PDs. Performance evaluations indicate that using RSE between network codecs can remarkably lower the PIIN effects in the receiver PDs. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

33748626019	Phase noise suppression in multilevel optical code-division multiple-access network coding system with embedded orthogonal polarizations	This study proposes a novel spectral-amplitude coding optical code-division multiple-access (SAC-OCDMA) scheme with four optical intensity levels by polarization division multiplexing (PDM) to increase the maximum permissible number of simultaneous subscribers using an optical broadband source of finite bandwidth. In the proposed system, each encoder/decoder pair is shared by two subscribers, and the requirement for complex polarization compensator schemes at the receiver is removed. The phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) induced at high optical intensities significantly degrades the performance of a conventional SAC-OCDMA scheme. Therefore, this study uses two methods to suppress the PIIN effect: 1. two users share the same encoder and transmit signals on mutually orthogonal polarizations, such that some PIIN terms are canceled out; and 2. the receiver structure is equipped with multiple balanced detectors (MBDs) to reduce the PIIN power impinging on each photodiode (PD). The numerical evaluation results demonstrate that under PIIN-limited conditions, the proposed system achieves a higher performance than that of the conventional SAC-OCDMA scheme. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

In the previous spectral polarization (SPC) scheme, the entire wavelength is assigned as vertical or horizontal state of polarization (SOP), respectively. In current study, we assign positive (+), negative (-), and nothing chip (0) value on individual wavelengths allocation to realize the specified orthogonal ternary sequence which transformed from original bipolar Walsh-Hadamard matrix. The motivation of this manner is to reduce the phase induced intensity noise (PIIN) resulting from the wavelengths collision on photo-detector. It is shown that wavelength collision can be decreased and PIIN noise is also reduced at photo-detector. Neglecting the effects of shot noise and thermal noise, and considering only phase-induced intensity-noise with a degree of polarization setting of P = 0 for the ideal case, the bit error rate versus the number of simultaneous active users is approximately improved by 40% and 100% compared to the previous spectral polarization coding and complementary spectral amplitude coding (SAC) for a 10'9 error probability, respectively. © 2006 IEEE.

In addition, in order to obtain the maximal power transmission, we further derive the structure parameters of OADM such as the distance between two parallel fibers and the length of two long-period fiber gratings according to four-mode coupled-mode equations. As far as this OADM structure is concerned, it is obvious that LPG will dominate the entire bandwidth if LPG has enough narrow bandwidth in comparison with the 2 × 2 coupler. In other words, we can easily use LPG to estimate the bandwidth of OADM before starting to design it. In order to survey the feasibility of the above statement, the spectrum bandwidths of LPG and OADM for the various bandwidth of high-order cladding modes are compared and analyzed. Utilizing the four steps proposed in this paper, the numerical results have demonstrated that we can use the high order cladding mode v=125 to design the OADM that possesses narrow FWHM (<0.4 nm) and meets the DWDM system. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

In the proposed method, a single uniform fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is bonded to the structure of interest such that it encounters the arbitrary strain field. The arbitrary strain distribution is then determined inversely from the transmission intensity spectrum using a GA population-based optimization process. The major advantage of the proposed approach is its use of a single, uniform FBG to sense arbitrary strain distributions.

34247251348	Improved phase noise performance using orthogonal ternary codes over spectral polarization and amplitude coding networks	This study proposes an improved hybrid scheme of spectral polarization coding (SPC) and spectral amplitude coding (SAC) based on a specified orthogonal ternary sequence. In a previous SPC scheme, the entire wavelength was assigned either a vertical or a horizontal state of polarization. However, this study assigns positive, negative, or null chip values to individual wavelengths to create an orthogonal ternary sequence based on the bipolar Walsh-Hadamard matrix. This approach reduces the number of wavelength collisions at the photodetector and hence reduces the phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN). Neglecting the effects of shot noise and thermal noise, we consider only PIIN with a degree of polarization P=0. The proposed scheme improves the bit error rate by 40% and 100% over SPC and complementary unipolar SAC schemes. The number of simultaneous active users supported by the hybrid scheme for the worst case (P=1) is improved by 41.3% over the complementary unipolar SAC coding scheme for the ideal case (P=0). © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

The reconfigurable coder/decoder (codec) which was constructed with Arrayed-Waveguide-Grating (AWG), optical switch and additional controller unit is used as the basic system to realize the implementation of dynamic code matrix assignment. Instead of employing a huge code space, we adopt the spectral amplitude coding (SAC) with unipolar M-sequence code matrix for a specific signature address (coding) and its match address codeword (decoding). Furthermore, a weighted load balance problem based on the power distribution on each wavelength is investigated, and then a dynamic reconfiguration policy is proposed to choose the best code matrix assignment with the minimum weighted degree of load balance. The evaluation results show that the dynamic reconfiguration policy can outperform a class of static policies in terms of two performance metrics, weighted degree of load balancing and the number of register shifting.

The numerical results confirm that the proposed method successfully synthesizes the parameters of phase-shifted FBGs with various structures with a high degree of accuracy.

To prioritize transmissions in OCDMA, the orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes widely used in wireless CDMA are adopted. In addition, for feasible multiplexing, unipolar OCDMA modulation [L. Nguyen, B. Aazhang, J.F. Young, All-optical CDMA with bipolar codes, IEEE Electron. Lett. 31 (6) (1995) 469-470] is used to generate the code selector of multi-rate OMAN, and a flexible fiber-grating-based system is used for the equipment on OCDMA-OVSF code. These enable an OMAN to assign suitable OVSF codes when creating different-rate lightpaths. How to optimally configure a multi-rate OMAN is a challenge because of displaced lightpaths. In this paper, a genetically modified genetic algorithm (GMGA) [L.R. Chen, Flexible fiber Bragg grating encoder/decoder for hybrid wavelength-time optical CDMA, IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett. 13 (11) (2001) 1233-1235] is used to preplan lightpaths in order to optimally configure an OMAN.

0032674618	Intensity effects in Bragg grating sensors scanned by a tunable filter	The fact that the wavelength shift in fiber Bragg grating sensors is insensitive to intensity fluctuations has made them superior to other intensity-based or phase-based sensors. However, the intensity variations in the light source, the bending on lead/in-out fibers, and a tunable filter can cause signal deviations when a tunable filter scans the Bragg grating sensors. In this paper, the spectrum analysis is used in the Bragg grating sensing system for characterizing the signal deviation by intensity effects. The intensity effects are quantitatively analyzed by assuming approximate Gaussian distributions of spectra in a Bragg grating and a single-loop transmitted mode of a tunable Fabry-Perot filter in the spectrum analysis. It is concluded that the intensity effects from the light source or the macrobending on lead-in/out fibers need to be considered in high-frequency harsh environments. Thus, a cancellation method is introduced to compensate intensity variations in the Bragg grating sensing system. Experimental data shows a good agreement compared with the analytical predication in compensating intensity variations. A cancellation technique, therefore, can be effectively applied in the high-frequency harsh environments, especially in explosive tests.

0033885108	Preplanned Restoration and Optimal Capacity Placement on- ATM Multicast Tree	The ATM multicast Tree (AMT) is the Mbone of video/audio conferencing and other multicasting applications in ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks [11]. However, real problems such as temporarily moving switches, changing op> tic fiber connections and/or tangible/intangible failures of ATM networks will cause many service disruptions. Thus we must carefully consider the system's SQOS (Survivable QOS) [7] when we construct the system. A point-to-point self-healing scheme utilizing a conventional pre-planned backup mechanism is proposed to protect the AMT from failure. This scheme uses pointto-point pre-planned backup Root-to-Leaf Routes (RLR) as the root-to-leaf structure of an AMT. Though AMT protection via preplanned backup RLR requires no search time, duplicate paths may cause redundant bandwidth consumption. This paper also proposes a closest-node method, which can locate the minimumlength route structure during the initial design and also rebuild the AMT in the event of a network failure. To enhance the survivability of the system, we introduce two near optimal re-routing algorithms, a most-decent search algorithm, and also a predictivedecent search algorithm in order to find the minimum lost flow requirement. These near optimal schemes use search technique to guide the local optimal lost flow to the most-decent lost flow direction. The predictive way is an especially economical technique to reduce the calculation complexity of lost flow function. For the evaluation of the feasibility and performance of the new schemes, we simulate AMT restoration and the simulation results show the closest-node scheme provides superior AMT restoration compared to a system with a preplanned point-to-point backup scheme. In addition, the predictive-decent search algorithm is faster than the most-decent search one.

Spectral coding chips are attained by slicing the spectrum from a broadband light source (BLS) and then coded with an AWG router to form a stream of spectral chips. The chips spectra sliced from the contemporary BLS are usually not flat and will induce coding chips with unequal power levels. The resulting unequal chips power will cause multiple-access interference (MAI) at the receiver. Chips spectra compensation is therefore examined with backward-pumped fiber Raman amplifiers (FRAs). The study adopts a genetic algorithm (GA) and linear matrix to flatten the power spectra of coded wavelength-division multiplexing (coded-WDM) chips by identifying the optimal pump wavelengths and pump power of backward-pumped FRAs.

0034291990	Photonic CDMA networking with spectrally pseudo-orthogonal coded fiber Bragg gratings	An optical spectral coding scheme is devised for fiber-optic code-division multiple-access (FO-CDMA) networks. The spectral coding is based on the pseudo-orthogonality of FO-CDMA codes properly written in the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) devices. For an incoming broadband optical signal having spectral components equal to the designed Bragg wavelengths of the FBG, the spectral components will be reflected and spectrally coded with the written FO-CDMA address codes. Each spectral chip has different central wavelength and is distributed over the spectrum of the incoming light source. Maximal-length sequence codes (m-sequence codes) are chosen as the signature or address codes to exemplify the coding and correlation processes in the FO-CDMA system. By assigning the N cycle shifts of a single m-sequence code to N users, we get an FO-CDMA network that can theoretically support N simultaneous users. To overcome the limiting factor of multiple-access interference (MAI) on the performance of the FO-CDMA network, an FBG decoder is configured on the basis of orthogonal correlation functions of the adopted pseudo-orthogonal codes. An intended receiver user that operates on the defined orthogonal correlation functions will reject any interfering user and obtain quasi-orthogonality between the FO-CDMA users in the network. Practical limiting issues on networking performance, such as non-flattened source spectra, optical path delay, and asynchronous data accesses, are evaluated in terms of the bit-error-rate versus the number of active users. As expected, the bit-error-rate will increase with the number of active users. Increasing the flatness parameter of optical signal will lead to a lower average error probability, since we are working in a part of the more flattened optical spectrum. In contrast, reducing the encoded bandwidth will reduce the total received power, and this will necessitate higher resolution of fiber Bragg gratings.

0034295975	Intensity variation effects in fibre Bragg grating sensors scanned by a tunable filter	The fact that the wavelength shift in fibre Bragg grating sensors is insensitive to intensity fluctuations has made them superior to other intensity-based and phase-based sensors. However, the intensity variations from the macrobending of the lead-in/out fibres during high frequency disturbances can cause deviations of the signal when a tunable filter scans the Bragg wavelength. In this paper, an optical spectrum analysis method is utilized for characterizing the deviation of the signal caused by the intensity variations in the lead-in/out fibres. It is concluded that the intensity effects from the macrobending of the lead-in/out fibres, which are considered negligible, should be considered in environments with high-frequency disturbance. Therefore, a cancellation method is introduced to compensate for the intensity variations in the lead-in/out fibres in a Bragg grating sensing system. Experimental data on deviations of the signal are in good agreement with the analytical predications and a cancellation technique can be effectively applied to environments with high-frequency disturbance, especially in explosive tests.

In order to mitigate the channel variation effect precisely, a new application of grey theory [1] to the power-control strategy in the direct-sequence code-division multiple-access cellular mobile systems is introduced in this paper. This scheme aims to predict SIR affected by the channel variation at the receiver and issue appropriate control signal to the transmitter. The simulation results indicate that the grey-based scheme can offer less outage probability than the previous mechanisms. © 2000 IEEE.

84861445268	On designing Blu-ray pickup head system with liquid crystal lens	This research proposes a newly developed optical design and concept of active compensation on Blu-ray pick up head system with liquid crystal element. A liquid crystal (LC) lens with external input voltage is employed, that generates a symmetric non-uniform electrical field in the liquid crystal layer. This will direct liquid crystal molecules into appropriate distribution of gradient refractive indices, and result in convergence or divergence of specific light beam. By adjusting the voltages, a wide range of lens power is covered. The LC lens preserves its optical quality over the entire focus range, delivers fast and active compensation through optical design when errors occur. Simulation and tolerance analysis work have been done with Code V [1] software inclusive of defocus, tilt, decenter, and the related compensation. The results conclude that optical design with liquid crystal optics as active compensation device can eliminate aberrations compared to traditional ones. © 2012 IEEE.

84925761227	Securing optical code-division multiple-access networks with a postswitching coding scheme of signature reconfiguration	The optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) technique is considered a good candidate for providing optical layer security. An enhanced OCDMA network security mechanism with a pseudonoise (PN) random digital signals type of maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) code switching to protect against eavesdropping is presented. Signature codes unique to individual OCDMA-network users are reconfigured according to the register state of the controlling electrical shift registers. Examples of signature reconfiguration following state switching of the controlling shift register for both the network user and the eavesdropper are numerically illustrated. Dynamically changing the PN state of the shift register to reconfigure the user signature sequence is shown; this hinders eavesdroppers' efforts to decode correct data sequences. The proposed scheme increases the probability of eavesdroppers committing errors in decoding and thereby substantially enhances the degree of an OCDMA network's confidentiality

44449109516	Nonlinearity effect of electro-optical modulator response in double spread CDMA radio-over-fiber transmissions	This study presents a double-spread code-division multiple-access (CDMA) scheme for radio-over-fiber (RoF) transmissions. The network coder/decoders (codecs) are implemented using arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) routers coded with maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) codes. The effects of phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) and multiple-access interference (MAI) on the system performance are evaluated numerically for different values of the optical modulation index (OMI) during the nonlinear electro-optical modulator (EOM) response. At low OMI optical device noise is dominant, but at high OMI nonlinear effect becomes significant. Numerical result shows that the system performance is highly sensitive to the OMI. Therefore, specifying an appropriate value of the OMI is essential in optimizing the system performance. The influence of the degree of polarization (DOP) in the system is also discussed. By employing the scrambler in front of the balanced photo-detector, the system performance can be enhanced. The high-performance, low-cost characteristics of the double-spread CDMA render the scheme an ideal solution for radio-CDMA wireless system cascaded with optical CDMA network. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Rather than employing wavelength-hopping, time-spreading or spectral phase coding approaches, which all involve huge code space, this study applies spectral amplitude coding (SAC) with unipolar maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) as signature address code. By exploiting the inherent cyclic properties in arrayed-waveguidegrating (A WG) routers, the A WG-based reconfigurable encoder/decoder (codecs), which requires minimal code space but additional optical switches and controller units, is demonstrated. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative analyses of protecting against eavesdropping are investigated. Under eavesdropping with a series of photo-detection strategy, the proposed reconfigurable coded WDM-EPON scheme in terms of the degree of confidentiality (DOC) is improved 673 times compared to the conventional wavelength-division-multiplexing EPON (WDM-EPON) for system capacity of N= 127. ©2006 IEEE.

55949112431	Realization of OSW/AWG-based bipolar wavelength-time optical CDMA for wired-wireless transmissions	This study proposes a novel radio-over-fiber (RoF) system using two-dimensional (2-D) optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) scheme using pseudorandom (PN) codes for the time-spreading and wavelength-hopping (t-spreading/λ-hopping) codes. The 2-D system is implemented using optical switches (OSWs) and arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) routers. By constructing 2-D codes using bipolar PN codes rather than unipolar codes provides a significant increase in the maximum permissible number of active radio base stations (RBSs). In general, the phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) generated at high optical intensities significantly degrades the performance of a conventional multi-wavelength scheme. However, the OSW-based time-spreading method employed in the current 2-D OCDMA scheme effectively suppresses the PIIN effect. Additionally, multiple-access interference (MAI) is suppressed by the use of a wavelength/time balanced detector structure in the network receivers. The numerical evaluation results demonstrate that under PIIN- and MAI-limited conditions, the proposed system outperforms a conventional multi-wavelength OCDMA scheme by using the spectral spreading scheme to suppress beating noise. Especially, the t-spreading encoder/decoder (codec) groups share the same wavelength codec and the overall complexity is reduced and system network becomes more compact. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

56149092841	Construction of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes to combat optical CDMA interference noise	In spectral amplitude coding optical code-division multiple access (SAC-OCDMA) systems, phased-induce intensity noise (PIIN) is the main noise source which degrades the system performance severely and ultimately limit the number of active users. To reduce the effect of PIIN, we apply the error correction codes to SAC- OCDMA systems. This paper is concerning with investigating the performance of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) code for SAC-OCDMA networks, and it's easy to implement by using simply shift-registers due to the quasi-cyclic properties of QC- LDPC. Moreover, it has been shown that not only the BER performance can be greatly improved, but also a good coding gain can obtained.

Since each network user with different signature address code has different spectral distribution, the non-flattened broadband light source will cause multiple-access interference (MAI). Flattenness compensation scheme is proposed to solve the MAI effects induced by non-flattened light sources. By arranging the same coding scheme but at different coding bands, spectral chips from AWG coder/decoder will incoherently power summed by FSR characteristic of AWG in the photo-detectors to approach a more flattened power level. Performances of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are finally evaluated with such compensation method for the discussed OCDMA network codecs.

In this thesis, the same architecture is set up to investigate the reduction of multiple-access interference caused by the overlapping wavelength from undesired users. Furthermore, the reduction of optical beat interference (OBI) induced by those adjacent grating chips is examined. The reduction of multiple access interference (MAI) and OBI induced by those adjacent grating chips. FBG written as M-sequence and Walsh codes is proposed for such MAI and OBI cancellation in spectrally balanced photo-detectors. Theoretically, M-sequence and Walsh codes are characterized by nearly the same number of "on" chips (i.e., logic "1" chips) and "off" chips (i.e., logic "0" chips). It is seen that the differential decoding scheme characterizes a better performance on eliminating the MAI and OBI problem by mutual cancellation in reflected and transmitted branches of wavelength chips. Furthermore, we propose that the wavelength interleaving allocation method can result in a guard band to suppress OBI. It is shown that SIR has 13 dB improvement with the proposed scheme.

To avoid the huge code space requirements of wavelength hopping, time spreading, or spectral phase coding approaches, this study applies a spectral amplitude coding (SAC) technique and constructs signature address codes using unipolar maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) code. Exploiting the inherent cyclic properties of AWG routers, additional anticipative-warning-time policy is integrated to previous degree of weighted load balance (DWLB) policy and performs the changing codeword algorithm to thwart network attacks by eavesdroppers. Furthermore, the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the system's network protection performance are investigated by assessing the attained degree of confidentiality (DOC). Under the assumption of the brute-force searching attacking, the proposed active changing codeword scheme shows that for a system capacity of N = 127, the proposed system enhances data network confidentiality by a factor of 8063 times that provided by conventional wavelengthdivision multiplexed PON (WDM-PON) scheme.

The phase-shifted interferograms required to reconstruct the sample structure are obtained using an apochromatic quarter-wave retarder rather than a mechanical scanning operation, and thus the imaging results are free of vibrational-induced errors. The numerical analysis shows that it enhances the quality of high resolution FD-OCT and reduces the acquisition time. Moreover, the simulation results show that the proposed system is robust toward both the presence of noise in the power spectrum of the super luminescent diode (SLD) and a slight non-orthogonality of the two light beams incident on the spectrum analyzers, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

70350564767	Reduction of leakage effect with circulator-free fiber-gratings codec array in OCDMA network	The spectral-amplitude-coding (SAC) optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) systems use transmissive-mode fiber-Bragg gratings (FBG) instead of reflective-mode to avoid chip-timing. However, practical FBGs have non-ideal reflection coefficients to produce leakage effect and high phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN). This study is to cascade more of the same-frequency non-ideal FBGs to approach an ideal squared perfect spectrum for highly reliable network coding. A simple experiment is demonstrated to verify the square-like approach. Moreover, a residual-spectra eliminator (RSE) between FBG encoder and decoder is taken to remove non-coding part of the transmissive spectra for the suppression of PIIN in the receiver photo-detectors. Evaluation results show that the combination of RSE with cascaded FBGs can significantly improve the leakage and the PIIN effects for the SAC-OCDMA network. Crown Copyright © 2009.

Importantly, for the proposed broadband light source (BLS), the total number of available wavelengths is partitioned into G different groups according to the length of the M-sequence code. Every group is referred to as a hopping pattern and characterized by the FSR interval of the AWG router. Improving the prime-hop code (PHC) and the modified prime-hop code (MPHC) with cascading one additional AWG router, the cardinality of the proposed scheme is significantly increased by a factor of 15 under the optimum arrangement for a group hopping number of G=7. Moreover, the correlation property and bit error rate (BER) of proposed scheme is evaluated and the result reveals an improvement of the BER compared to MPHC and PHC. ©2009 IEEE.

0035278086	Resilience on pre-assigned ATM multicast tree	Networking technologies have greatly enhanced the Internet with respect to the backbone ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network. The ATM multicast Tree (AMT) is the Mbone of video/audio conferencing and other multicasting applications in ATM networks [5]. Temporarily moving switches changing optical fiber connections and, tangible or intangible network failure on ATM networks causes service disruption and motirates us to consider more carefully the system's SQOS (Survivable Quality of Service) [7]. A backup protection on the ATM multicast Tree (AMT) is proposed here. This scheme supports a point-to-point preplanned backup route for each root-leaf pair (RL pair) of an AMT. Usually, a restoration message needs to travel over a long backup route to restore disrupted services and point-to-point backup routes may overlap each other and waste bandwidth resources. This motivates us to develop a tree-structured backup AMT to support economical protection. For the providence and proof of performance of these new schemes, we also formulate Bellcore's LATA model to simulate restoration in two schemes. The simulation results show that the preplanned scheme supports fast restoration; however, a dynamic scheme is needed to compensate for and restore the blocked parts.

In the proposed system, the encoding and double balanced-detection processes are implemented using a polarization-diversity scheme. Because of the quasiorthogonality of Hadamard codes combining with array waveguide grating routers and a polarization beam splitter, the proposed codec pair can encode-decode multiple code words of Hadamard code while retaining the ability for multiple-access interference cancellation. The experimental results demonstrate that when the system is maintained with an orthogonal SOP for each user, an effective reduction in the phase-induced intensity noise is obtained. The analytical SNR values are found to overstate the experimental results by around 2 dB when the received effective power is large. This is mainly limited by insertion losses of components and a nonflattened optical light source. Furthermore, the matching conditions can be improved by decreasing nonideal influences. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

84863229717	Construction of one-coincidence sequence quasi-cyclic LDPC codes of large girth	One approach for designing the one-coincidence sequence (OCS) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes of large girth is investigated. These OCS-LDPC codes are quasi-cyclic, and their parity-check matrices are composed of circulant permutation matrices. Generally, the cycle structures in these codes are determined by the shift values of circulant permutation matrices, and the existence of cycles in the corresponding Tanner graph is governed by certain cycle-governing equations (CGEs). Therefore, finding the proper shift values is the key point to increase the girth of these codes. In this paper, we provide an effective method to systematically find out the CGEs for these codes of girth 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Then, one less computation-intensive algorithm is used to generate the proper shift values for constructing the OCS-LDPC codes of large girth.

With proper coder design, a receiver can reject interfering users and obtain quasi-orthogonality between optical code-division multiple-access (CDMA) users in the network. However, optical CDMA networks may be degraded by multiple-access interference (MAI) due to nonflattened incoherent sources and nonideal FBG coders. A compensating module is therefore proposed to compensate for such MAI effects. As a result, the MAI effects induced by nonideal FBG coders can be perfectly eliminated by the compensating module. With spectral width reduction on the incoherent source, the scheme can partly compensate the MAI effects induced by nonflattened sources and further reduce the average error probability in the system performance.

Importantly, for the proposed broadband light source (BLS), the total number of available wavelengths is partitioned into the different groups G based on the M-sequence code length. Every group is referred as hopping pattern and characterized by the FSR interval of AWG router. To improve the prime-hop code (PHC) and modified prime-hop code (MPHC) of 2-D OCDMA system with cascading one additional AWG router, the cardinality of proposed scheme is significantly increased by the factor of 15 times under the optimum arrangement for group hopping number of G=7. Moreover, the correlation property and bit error rate (BER) of proposed scheme is evaluated and the result reveals that the BER of proposed scheme is better than MPHC and PHC. © 2007 IEEE.

84869475330	Enhancing image objects resolution with Walsh-coded spatial light modulators embedded into Mach-Zehnder interferometry	In this paper, we use Mach-Zehnder interferometry (MZI) technique to enhance image objects resolution. We take sample's correlation characteristics over Walsh-Hadamard (WH)-coded spatial-light modulator (SLM) to boost the image resolution of sample objects detection. Comparing the spectral interferences with and without WH-coded SLM, we get more contrast difference on the correlation magnitudes. Through with computer simulations, we find that the interference correlations under coded-SLM have a contrast ratio of 2.0 which is larger than the contrast ratio of 1.49 for sample measurement without SLM coding. The enhancement of image objects resolution is thus assured in the paper. © 2012 IEEE.

84874179315	Improvements of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes based on hybrid structures of BIBD's schemes	In this paper, we propose a simple mathematical structure to improve the BER (bit error rate) performance of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes. Since the proposed structure can be defined in-between those of random codes and structured codes, these proposed QC-LDPC codes not only perform as well as random-LDPC codes, but also preserve the advantage of structured LDPC codes which is easier to implement over coding hardware. Moreover, the proposed structure, constructed from balanced incomplete block design (BIBD), can reduce the density of parity-check matrix and hence reduce the number of short cycles, which generally lead to better performance. At the end, we show that the error floor performance of QC-LDPC codes can be improved by proposed hybrid structures and perform well over binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. © 2012 IEEE.

84874276729	Structuring reconfigurable composite signature codecs to enhance OCDMA network confidentiality	In views of reconfiguring optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) network coder/decoders (codecs), a dynamic signature coding scheme structured over arrayed-wave guide gratings (AWGs) is devised. Such scheme of signature reconfigurations can find applications on enhancing OCDMA network confidentiality. The code reconfiguration can be achieved by exclusively assigning to each network user a set of composite signatures made up of pseudo-orthogonal maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) codes and randomly selecting one among them to represent each user's signature. On the basis of cyclic and periodic characteristics of M-sequence codes compatible with those of the same dimension AWGs, numerical design examples are illustrated throughout the network codecs configuration and operation. © 2012 IEEE.

84879903761	Fiber optics and optical communication structuring waveguide-grating-based wavelength-division multiplexing/optical code division multiple access network codecs over topology of concentric circles	The cyclic period and free spectral range of arrayed-waveguide gratings (AWG) in a wavelength-division multiplexing/optical code division multiple access optical code division multiple access network are exploited. The total optical network unit (ONU) of network capacity is partitioned into groups of different wavelength in accordance with the geographical location of subscribers based on the radial distance of the ONU to the optical line terminal. Combining concentric circles round by round for ONU groups enables a fixed round-trip time in the data transmission and a significant increase in system performance. Using AWG router, the proposed topology of concentric circles retains signature orthogonality and minimizes wavelength collisions on the photo-detector. Furthermore, the adoption of extended M-sequence codes corresponding to the AWG codec provides a simpler, more efficient coding procedure and accommodates more users in a single group. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

By embedding conjugated liquid crystal modulator (LCM) over the MZI setup, through optical spectrometer and charge coupled devices, we obtain the objects interference information being the phase conjugates of the adjusted LCM. On objects phase/amplitude measurement, by utilizing polarization multiplexing scheme, one linear polarization of the reference field is made to vary in quadrature with the other. The latter method of object phase measurement involves no iterative algorithms and is suitable even for complicated phase profiles. © 2013 IEEE.

84885883974	Optical CDMA with embedded spectral-polarization coding over double balanced differential-detector	A spectral-polarization coding (SPC) optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) configuration structured over arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) router is proposed. The polarization-division double balanced detector is adopted to execute difference detection and enhances system performance. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is derived by taking the effect of PIIN into account. The result indicates that there would be up to 9-dB SNR improvement than the conventional spectral-amplitude coding (SAC) structures with Walsh-Hadamard codes. Mathematical deriving results of the SNR demonstrate the system embedded with the orthogonal state of polarization (SOP) will suppress effectively phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN). In addition, we will analyze the relations about bit error rate (BER) vs. the number of active users under the different encoding schemes and compare them with our proposed scheme. The BER vs. the effective power under the different encoding scheme with the same number of simultaneous active user conditions are also revealed. Finally, the polarization-matched factor and the difference between simulated and experimental values are discussed. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2009.

84893611672	Using phase inversion to compensate fiber nonlinearity in Spectral-Amplitude Coding OCDMA network	Self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase modulation (SPM) are leading nonlinear transmission penalty in Spectral-Amplitude Coding optical CDMA (SAC-OCDMA) systems. In nonlinear optical media, a phenomenon of the intensity dependence of the refractive index occurs through SPM or XPM, which leads to spectral broadening of optical pulses and therefore degrade system performance. A novel scheme for fiber nonlinearity compensation based on the principles of phase inversion compensation (PIC) is proposed to reduce the phase distortion. The phase of the data pulses is modulated in the middle of fiber spans. The magnitude of the phase modulation is proportional to the detected pulse intensity, and the sign is opposite to that of the nonlinear phase shift caused by SPM and XPM. Thus, the nonlinear phase noise induced in the first-half fiber is partially compensated for in the second-half fiber. Using an optimum value, we show by numerical simulations that a SAC-OCDMA format transmission in dispersion-managed system with such nonlinearities compensation can provide greater than 3 dB increase in launch power. © 2013 IEEE.

84898815222	Structuring waveguide-grating routers with post-switching coding to secure optical CDMA network access	Optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) technique has been considered as a good candidate to provide optical layer security and regards as an important benefit to the enhanced security. In this paper, an enhanced security mechanism is structured over spectral-amplitude coding (SAC) scheme of OCDMA network coder/decoders (codecs). The network security is obtained through pseudo-noise (PN) type of shift register (SR) state switching to combat with eavesdropping. We construct the dynamic reconfigurable codec over arrayed-waveguide gratings (AWGs) by utilizing the cyclic properties of AWG routers and maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) codes. Signature code unique to each OCDMA network user is reconfigured in accordance with the memory cell state of the controlling electrical shift registers. Examples for both network user and eavesdropper are numerically illustrated. It is shown that, the eavesdroppers cannot accurately detect the cell-shift values of the shift register when the scheme is triggered. The proposed scheme thus makes the probability of achieving a correct detection result for the eavesdroppers become much lower. The degree of OCDMA network confidentiality is hence largely improved. © 2013 IEEE.

84898833929	BPSK-modulated radio transmissions over optical CDMA network for MAI elimination	We describe the implementation of radio-over-fiber (ROF) techniques with a combination of spectral-amplitude-coding optical code-division-multiple-access (SAC-OCDMA). The architecture of proposed fiber-radio network is presented in details where the radio frequency (RF) modulated signal is up-converted to the spectrum-coded optical carriers. System evaluation is analyzed by deriving the average bit error rate (BER) expression. Gaussian approximation is applied for the noise distribution, taking into account the thermal and phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) in the receiver. The binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signal is modulated on a radio frequency (RF) carrier. System evaluations are performed under the condition of different code-types (m-sequence code and SQC code) and code-lengths. © 2013 IEEE.

The key to the system performance depends on constructing a decoder that implements a true bipolar correlation using only unipolar signals and intensity detection. In our optical access coding system, the power spectrum is coded with programmable LC-SLMs. The high polarization selectivity of these components coupled with the polarization rotation ability of liquid crystal elements makes access coding switching possible with high extinction ratio and low crosstalk. © 2013 IEEE.

In this paper, an enhanced OCDMA network security mechanism with pseudo-noise (PN) type of M-sequence coding switching is presented to against eavesdropping. Signature code unique to each OCDMA network user is reconfigured in accordance with the register state of a controlling electrical shift register. Examples of signature reconfiguration following state switching of controlling shift register for both network user and eavesdropper are numerically illustrated. It is shown that, by dynamically changing PN state of shift register to reconfigure user signature sequence, eavesdropper will encounter difficulty on decoding correct data sequences. The proposed scheme hence raises a high error probability for eavesdroppers. Accordingly, the degree of the proposed optical network confidentiality can be largely improved. © 2014 IEEE.

84905965036	Constructing a two bands optical code-division multiple-access network of bipolar optical access codecs using walsh-coded liquid crystal modulators	We propose and experimentally demonstrated the two bands optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) network over bipolar Walsh-coded liquid-crystal modulators (LCMs) and driven by green light and red light lasers. Achieving system performance depends on the construction of a decoder that implements a true bipolar correlation using only unipolar signals and intensity detection for each band. We took advantage of the phase delay characteristics of LCMs to construct a prototype optical coder/decoder (codec). Matched and unmatched Walsh signature codes were evaluated to detect correlations among multiuser data in the access network. By using LCMs, a red and green laser light source was spectrally encoded and the summed light dots were complementary decoded. Favorable contrast on auto- and cross-correlations indicates that binary information symbols can be properly recovered using a balanced photodetector. © 2014 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

84906811618	Using wavelength/time signatures scrambling to realize cryptographic coded-wdm data networks	To combat with multiple-users interference and malicious eavesdropping, this paper proposes a double scrambling scheme over time/wavelength for a cryptographic optical CDMA (OCDMA) data transmission. By using wavelength-spreading/time-hopping, data reliability in OCDMA network can be highly improved. On the transmitter side, data bits are sliced into spectral chips, coded into M-sequence codes, and conducted with different units of time-delay. In the receiver side, fiber-delay lines (FDLs) reverse the spectral chips back to the same time basis, and optical switches (OSWs) turn on-off spectral chips into balanced detector for the final data decoding. By changing signature code frequently, the eavesdroppers cannot catch on the changing code speed and have little chance to detect the channel waveform to solve the code. To against eavesdropping, we take advantages of linear cyclic, periodic, and nearly-orthogonal characteristics of M-sequence codes. OSWs and FDLs are added into the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) codecs. The spectral codes and the time-delay units will follow cell states of a controlling shift register. Different shift register states will reconfigure AWG light spectra into different coding sequences. After pass through the associated OSWs and FDLs, user signature code appears to be a two-dimensional code matrix. In perspective of eavesdropper, smooth eavesdropping presents difficulties due to signature codes' frequent changing. The system can therefore achieve a high level of network confidentiality. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84908430895	Using memetic algorithm to optimize location estimate of mobile station in non-line-of-sight environment	Wireless location technology is mainly used to estimate the location of mobile station (MS). Positioning accuracy of the mobile station completely depends on the propagation environment of the wireless communications. The error caused by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) is the most urgent problem in positioning research. Memetic Algorithm (MA), similar to Genetic Algorithm (GA), is also called Genetic Algorithm combined with local search. MA is based on the concept of cultural evolution that combines with multi-point search features to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel location scheme by using MA that employs time of arrival (TOA) measurements from three base stations (BSs) to estimate the location of MS. MA is utilized to find the optimum solution in the intersections of three TOA circles. The optimum solution can be regarded as the MS location where minimizes the three circular intersection region caused by NLOS error. Simulation result will show that the proposed position location method improves the performance by mitigating the NLOS ranging error.

10444231153	Optical CDMA spectral-amplitude codecs capable of reducing multiple-access and optical beat interferences	Spectral-amplitude coding (SAC) techniques in fiber-Bragg-grating (FBG)-based optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) systems were investigated in our previous work. This paper adopts the same network architecture to investigate the simultaneous reductions of multiple-access interference (MAI) and optical beat interference (OBI). The MAI is caused by overlapping wavelengths from undesired network coder/decoders (codecs) while the OBI is induced by interaction of simultaneous chips at adjacent gratings. It is proposed that MAI and OBI reductions may be obtained by use of: 1) a source spectrum that is divided into equal chip spacing; 2) coded FBGs characterized by approximately the same number of "0" and "1" code elements; and 3) spectrally balanced photo-detectors. With quasi-orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard coded FBGs, complementary spectral chips is employed as signal pairs to be recombined and detected in balanced photo-detectors, thus achieving simultaneous suppression of both MAIs and OBIs. Simulation results showed that the proposed OCDMA spectral-amplitude coding scheme achieves significant MAI and OBI reductions.

In the proposed system, each network user requires only two AWG routers to accomplish spectral encoding and decoding for complementary keying, thus, resulting a simpler and low cost system. Performance of the proposed system is analyzed by taking the effect of phase-induced intensity noise into account. The result indicates that the established system not only preserves the capability of suppressing multiple-access interference (MAI), but also improves bit-error-rate performance as compared to the conventional coders employing simple on-off keying. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
