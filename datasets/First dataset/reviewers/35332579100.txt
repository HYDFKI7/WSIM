14844360680	Expression and purification of the catalytic domain of human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 for inhibitor screening	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen, can act in tumor-induced angiogenesis by binding to specific receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. One such receptor, VEGFR-2/KDR, plays a key role in VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Here, we expressed the catalytic domain of VEGFR-2 as a soluble active kinase using Bac-to-Bac expression system, and investigated correlations between VEGFR-2 activity and enzyme concentration, ATP concentration, substrate concentration and divalent cation type. We used these data to establish a convenient, effective and non-radioactive ELISA screening technique for the identification and evaluation of potential inhibitors for VEGFR-2 kinase. We screened 200 RTK target-based compounds and identified one (TKI-31) that potently inhibited VEGFR-2 kinase activity (IC

20944431603	Antimetastatic effect of salvicine on human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft is closely related to Rho-dependent pathway	Purpose: Salvicine is a novel DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor with potent anticancer activity. In present study, the effect of salvicine against metastasis is evaluated using human breast carcinoma orthotopic metastasis model and its mechanism is further investigated both in animal and cellular levels. Experimental Design: The MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft model was applied to detect the antimetastatic effect of salvicine. Potential target candidates were detected and analyzed by microarray technology. Candidates were verified and explored by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. Salvicine activities on stress fiber formation, invasion, and membrane translocation were further investigated by immunofluorescence, invasion, and ultracentrifugal assays. Results: Salvicine significantly reduced the lung metastatic foci of MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft, without affecting primary tumor growth obviously. A comparison of gene expression profiles of primary tumors and lung metastatic focus between salvicine-treated and untreated groups using the CLOTECH Atlas human Cancer 1.2 cDNA microarray revealed that genes involved in tumor metastasis, particularly those closely related to cell adhesion and motility, were obviously down-regulated, including fibronectin, integrin α3, integrin β3, integrin β3, FAK, paxillin, and RhoC. Furthermore, salvicine significantly down-regulated RhoC at both mRNA and protein levels, greatly inhibited stress fiber formation and invasiveness of MDA-MB-435 cells, and markedly blocked translocation of both RhoA and RhoC from cytosol to membrane. Conclusion: The unique antimetastatic action of salvicine, particularly its specific modulation of cell motility in vivo and in vitro, is closely related to Rho-dependent signaling pathway. © 2005 American Association for Cancer Research.

27744518445	In vitro pharmacological characterization of TKI-28, a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects	Tyrosine kinases are used as important biomarkers in many tumor types. Preclinical and clinical anti-tumor studies have shown that broadly acting tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be more useful than specific inhibitors, since the former might overcome redundancies and crosstalk in tumor cell growth signaling pathways. Here, we aim to identify a novel potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Computer modeling of the pyrido-pyrimidine class compound, TKI-28(6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-8-methyl-2-phenylamino-8H-pyrido[2,3-d] pyrimidine-7-one), predicted that the compound would dock well in the ATP pocket of the ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase, yielding a high binding affinity for ErbB receptors. Biochemical studies revealed that TKI-28 potently inhibited the activities of tyrosine kinases such as ErbB-2, EGFR, KDR, PDGFRß, c-kit and c-Src, but had little effect on Fit-1 in cell-free system. TKI-28 also efficiently blocked autophosphorylation of the listed receptor tyrosine kinases, and subsequently downregulated phosphorylation of many downstream signaling proteins at the cellular level. TKI-28 exhibited a more potent anti-proliferative activity against EGF- and neuregulin-stimulated SK-OV-3 cells versus serum-stimulated cells, accompanied by apparent induction of apoptosis. Finally, TKI-28 was found to possess anti-angiogenic effects, characterized by inhibition of cell proliferation driven by EGF, VEGF and PDGF, as well as decreased cell migration and tube formation in HMECs. These results collectively highlight the pharmacological characteristics of TKI-28 as a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that it has great potential as an anti-cancer and anti-angiogenesis agent. ©2005 Landes Bioscience.

The rigidity and flexibility of the linker in platinum complex together with the intramental distnaces offered the possibility of forming both intra-and inter-strand DNA cross-linking adducts. Gel mobility assay showed that the complex had more evident effects on the tertiary structure of DNA than cisplatin. The obtained data showed that complex reacted with GSH to give its monosubstituted and distributed products. The CD spectra of CT-DNA exhibited a positive band at 275 nm due to base stacking and a negative band at 245 nm due to the helicity of B-type DNA. It was observed that the local conformational changes induced by platinum complexes were directly related to the DNA repair systems as well as to the cytotoxic profiles.

33751200367	Salvicine functions as novel topoisomerase II poison by binding to ATP pocket	Salvicine, a structurally modified diterpenoid quinone derived from Salvia prionitis, is a nonintercalative topoisomerase II (topo II) poison. The compound possesses potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity with a broad spectrum of anti-multidrug resistance activity and is currently in phase II clinical trials. To elucidate the distinct antitumor properties of salvicine and obtain valuable structural information of salvicine-topo II interactions, we characterized the effects of salvicine on human topo IIα (htopo IIα), including possible binding sites and molecular interactions. The enzymatic assays disclosed that salvicine mainly inhibits the catalytic activity with weak DNA cleavage action, in contrast to the classic topo II poison etoposide (VP16). Molecular modeling studies predicted that salvicine binds to the ATP pocket in the ATPase domain and superimposes on the phosphate and ribose groups. In a surface plasmon resonance binding assay, salvicine exhibited higher affinity for the ATPase domain of htopo IIα than ATP and ADP. Competitive inhibition tests demonstrated that ATP competitively and dose-dependently blocked the interactions between salvicine and ATPase domain of htopo IIα. The data illustrate that salvicine shares a common binding site with ATP and functions as an ATP competitor. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify an ATP-binding pocket as the structural binding motif for a nonintercalative eukaryotic topo II poison. These findings collectively support the potential value of an ATP competitor of htopo IIα in tumor chemotherapy. Copyright © 2006 The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

Experimental Design: The in vitro cytotoxities of chimmitecan in human tumor cell lines and multidrug resistance (MDR) cells were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and sulforhodamin B assays. DNA relaxation, cleavage assays, and cellular band depletion assay were combined to delineate its effects on topoisomerase I. DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis were assessed using comet assay, flow cytometry, and DNA ladder analysis, respectively. The in vivo antitumor activities were measured in nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts. Results: Chimmitecan displayed more potent cytotoxicity than SN38 and topotecan. Neither a cross-resistance to chimmitecan in MDR cells nor an influence of human serum albumin in its cytotoxity was observed. Chimmitecan exhibited comparable effects on topoisomerase I compared with the reference drugs, including inhibiting topoisomerase I catalytic activity and trapping and stabilizing covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complexes. Furthermore, nanomolar levels of chimmitecan caused impressive DNA damage, G

34548238149	Caspase-8 preferentially senses the apoptosis-inducing action of NG-18, a gambogic acid derivative, in human leukemia HL-60 cells	Gambogic acid (GA) is the major active ingredient of gamboge secreted from a Chinese traditional medicine Garcinia hanburryi possessing potent anti-tumor activity. N-(2-ethoxyethyl)gambogamide (NG-18), a derivative of GA, also efficiently inhibits proliferation of cultured human tumor cells. The inhibition effect of NG-18 is associated with its ability to induce apoptosis. In the present study, NG-18 markedly induced leukemia HL-60 cells apoptosis, and the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways were activated almost at the same time. NG-18-induced tumor cell apoptosis was associated with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The NG-18-induced apoptosis was blocked completely by a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, indicating that caspases were functionally and actively involved in this process. The specific inhibition of caspase-8 activity using Z-IETD-FMK significantly blocked NG-18-induced apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of other initiator caspases, caspase-2 or -9, using Z-VDVAD-FMK or Z-LEHD-FMK respectively had no effect on NG-18-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our data demonstrated that NG-18-induced apoptosis was dependent on caspases and caspase-8 acted as a key executor in the event. ©2007 Landes Bioscience.

34748925888	Gambogic acid inhibits the catalytic activity of human topoisomerase IIα by binding to its ATPase domain	This study is intended to characterize the cellular target of gambogic acid (GA), a natural product isolated from the gamboge resin of Garcinia hurburyi tree, which possesses potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. The antiproliferative activity of GA was further confirmed here in a panel of human tumor cells and multidrug-resistant cells. We found that GA significantly inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerase (Topo) II and, to a comparatively less extent, of Topo I, without trapping and stabilizing covalent topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes. Down-regulation of Topo IIα but not Topo I and Topo IIβ, reduced GA-induced apoptosis and the phosphorylation of c-Jun, and restored cell proliferation upon GA treatment. Moreover, GA antagonized etoposide-induced DNA damage and abrogated the antiproliferative activity of etoposide, whereas it did not affect camptothecin-induced DNA damage. By dissecting the actions of GA on the individual steps of Topo IIα catalytic cycle, we found that GA inhibited DNA cleavage and ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, GA directly bound to the ATPase domain of Topo IIα, and may share common binding sites with ATP. The results reported here show that GA exerts its anti-proliferative effect by inhibiting the catalytic activity Topo IIα. They also indicate that GA inhibits Topo IIα-mediated DNA cleavage and modulate the activity of Topo II poisons, which provide rationale for further clinical evaluation of GA.

35948959761	Predictive factors of gefitinib response and survival in Chinese patients with local advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer	Background and objective: Gefitinib, a selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, has been approved effective in local advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with the equivalent response rate to that of chemotherapy in Asian patients. Asian ethnicity, gender, smoking history, adenocarcinoma histology were remarkably associated with gefitinib response and survival. However, predictive factors of gefitinib response and survival are still unclear in Asian population. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the data of 153 Chinese NSCLC patients who received a single agent of gefitinib with the purpose of identifying the potential predictive factors of gefitinib response and survival. Methods: Tumor response, survival and the clinicopathologic factors of 153 NSCLC patients treated between November of 2003 and June of 2004 were collected retrospectively from the multicenter clinical trial in China. Pearson Chi-square test and Logistic regression test were performed respectively as univariate and multivariate analyses of gefitinib response. Overall survivals between groups with different predictive factors were compared by log-rank tests. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors that independently predict for survival. Results: A total of 153 patients were included in this analysis. Objective response rate was statistically significant higher in patients with younger age (≤65 years) and longer interval from diagnosis to gefitinib treatment (≥6 months) in multivariate analysis (P<0.05). The median follow-up duration was 10.0 months (0.5-16.8). The median survival was 10.3 months (95% CI: 8.1-12.6) and 1-year survival was 44.1%. Significant independent predictive factors associated with longer survival in multivariate analysis were good performance status (score 0-1), controlled disease (CR+PR+SD) to most recent chemotherapy and controlled disease to gefitinib (P<0.05), Conclusion: Gefitinib is effective in local advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients who failed to chemotherapy in Chinese population. In Chinese NSCLC population, younger age (≤65 years) and longer interval from diagnosis to gefitinib treatment (≥6 months) were predictive factors in multivariate analysis for gefitinib response; good performance status (score 0-1), controlled disease to most recent chemotherapy and controlled disease to gefitinib were independent prognostic factors for survival.

38749145972	Fibrinogen interaction of CHO cells expressing chimeric αIIb/αvβ3 integrin	Aim: The molecular mechanisms of the affinity regulation of αvβ3 integrin are important in tumor development, wound repairing, and angiogenesis. It has been established that the cytoplasmic domains of αvβ3 integrin play an important role in integrin-ligand affinity regulation. However, the relationship of structure-function within these domains remains unclear. Methods: The extracellular and transmembrane domain of αIIb was fused to the αv integrin cytoplasmic domain, and the chimeric α subunit was coexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the wild-type β3 subunit or with 3 mutant β3 sequences bearing truncations at the positions of T741, Y747, and F754, respectively. The CHO cells expressing these recombinant integrins were tested for soluble fibrinogen binding and the cell adhesion and spreading on immobilized fibrinogen. Results: All 4 types of integrins bound soluble fibrinogen in the absence of agonist stimulation, and only the cells expressing the chimeric α subunit with the wild-type β3 subunit, but not those with truncated β3, could adhere to and spread on immobilized fibrinogen. Conclusion: The substitution αIIb at the cytoplasmic domain with the αv cyto-plasmic sequence rendered the extracellular αIIbβ3 a constitutively activated conformation for ligands without the need of "inside-out" signals. Our results also indicated that the COOH-terminal sequence of β3 might play a key role in integrin αIIb/αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on immobilized fibrinogen. The cells expressing αIIb/αvβ3 have enormous potential for facilitating drug screening for antagonists either to αvβ3 intracellular interactions or to αIIbβ3 receptor functions. © 2008 CPS and SIMM.

Methods: RCC05-TXJ, a CCRCC cell line established by our lab, was used in the present study. The cells were proliferated and the cell suspension was subcutaneously injected into the NOD-SCID mice. The newly-formed tumors were transplanted into the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice (in situ), and the formed tumors were harvested and again transplanted into NOD-SCID mice. A stable mouse model with CCRCC lung metastasis was established following several cycles of the transplantation. This transplantation cycle was repeated until the development of stable lung metastasis. The lung metastasis tissues were then injected into renal capsule for several cycles to induce the lung metastasis. The metastasis tissues were also primary cultured and proliferated and the cell suspensions were injected into renal capsule until the development of lung metastasis. The sub-cell lines which could stably produce lung metastasis were screened. During the screening, the in situ tumor information, lymphatic and pulmonary metastasis were all recorded in detail. Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to examine the expression of CA9 (a marker of renal cells) and CD133 (a marker of stem cells) on the metastatic CCRCC cells. Results: The lung metastasis was observed in the second cycle of the in situ transplantation of RCC05-TXJ in NOD-SCID mice. When the metastatic lung carcinoma tissues were used for in situ transplantation, lung metastasis was successfully established during the 3-6 cycles. CCRCC cells were successfully cultured with lung metastatic tissues, and the cell suspension of the passage 6 cells caused lung metastasis after implanted in the renal capsule. The result was stable in two repeated cycles. The lung metastatic RCC05-TXJ-L cells grew fast (average passage time was 2 days), and had a short in situ tumor-forming time (1 week). They also had a strong potential for lung metastasis and high expression of CA9 and CDI33. Conclusion: Repeated in situ transplantation of RCC05-TXJ can be used to establish stable lung metastasis mice model of CCRCC. The selected RCC05-TXJ-L sub-cell line can stably induce lung metastasis in NOD-SCID mice.

43949118059	Establishment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma lines of Han nationality in China	Objective: To establish clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines from clinical ccRCC specimens of Han nationality in China and to characterize the biological features. Methods: From 2005 to 2007, fresh surgical samples of ccRCC were obtained from 43 patients; the samples included primary tumor in situ, osseous metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and cancerous embolus. The samples were cultured in vitro using explant-culture method within 30-60 min after surgery. Analysis on cell growth and colony-forming efficiency was recorded for the lines which were passaged for over 50 generations. Chromosome examination, pathological examination and tumorigenesis in NOD-SCID mice were used to determine their malignancy. Flow cytometry was used to determine expression of CA9 and CD133. Results: Most of the primary cells could only be passaged for less than 5 generations; 5 lines could be serially passaged for over 5 passages, 3 lines for over 10 passages, and only 2 lines could be stably passaged. One line,named RCC05-TXJ, was from osseous metastatic ccRCC and had been serially passaged for 110 generations in 21 months; the average doubling time was 19.2 h,average chromosome number was 75,and colony forming efficiency was 41%. Another line,named RCC05-ZYJ,was from primary ccRCC specimen and had been serially passaged for 160 generations in 18 months; the average doubling time was 16.5 h,average chromosome number was 55,and the colony forming efficiency was 37%. Immunohistological analysis demonstrated that both lines expressed CA9 and CD133. Flow cytometry analysis found that expression levels of CA9 and CD133 increased with the passages. Both RCC05-ZYJ and RCC05-TXJ lines were able to form tumor and to metastasize in NOD-SCID mice; however, their metastatic ability was obviously different. Conclusion: We have established 2 ccRCC cell lines with different metastatic potentials from the clinical ccRCC specimens of Han nationality in China.

4544375253	Pseudolarix acid B inhibits angiogenesis by antagonizing the vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated anti-apoptotic effect	Angiogenesis is controlled by a number of growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, pseudolarix acid B, isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Pseudolarix kaempferi and originally identified as an early pregnancy-terminating agent, was evaluated for its potential as an angiogenesis inhibitor, using in vitro and in vivo models. After exposure to pseudolarix acid B 0.625-5 μM for 72 h, the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was significantly inhibited. Pseudolarix acid B 0.313-2.5 μM for 24 h potently blocked the VEGF-induced tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Matrigel plug assays disclosed that pseudolarix acid B reduced angiogenesis induced by VEGF in vivo. In addition, pseudolarix acid B antagonized VEGF-mediated anti-apoptotic effects on serum-deprived human umbilical vein endothelial cells and increased apoptosis of endothelial cells induced by VEGF in Matrigel plug assays. Moreover, pseudolarix acid B significantly inhibited VEGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase insert domain-containing receptor/fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR/flk-1), in correlation with a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). These findings collectively suggest that pseudolarix acid B possesses anti-angiogenic activity. One of the main anti-angiogenesis mechanisms of pseudolarix acid B may involve antagonism of the VEGF-mediated anti-apoptosis effect via inhibition of KDR/flk-1, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation in endothelial cells. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

47149100533	Analysis of the relationship between the response after the First-line chemotherapy and the survival in the advanced non-small cell lung cancer	Background and objective: Most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with first-line chemotherapy consisted of the third generation new drug got the disease in control (CR+PR+SD). In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our data to investigate the difference of survival between patients of disease control and progression (PD), and disease response (CR+PR) and stable (SD), to identify the prognosis factor correlated with survival. Methods: In our retrospective study, 118 patients with stage IIIB (with malignancy pleural fluid) and IV NSCLC were identified who received the third generation new drug-based platinum or non-platinum regimens, the response of first-line chemotherapy were complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to RECIST criteria based on the records on the imaging reports papers. Results: After first-line chemotherapy, 86 (72.9%) patients [CR2 (1.7%), PR47 (39.8%), SD37 (31.4%)) had disease control and 33 (27.1%) patients had progression disease. The median survival time of CR+PR+SD arm was significantly longer than PD arm (17.8 months vs 8.4 months, P=0.001), but there was no significant difference between CR+PR arm and SD arm (18.1 months vs 15.5 months, P=0.917), the PFS between two arms were no significantly different too (7.1 months vs 6.9 months, P=0.622). The Cox regression analysis shows that stage (IIIB or IV), chemotherapy lines (less than three lines or more than four lines) and disease control or not after first-line chemotherapy were independently prognosis factor of overall survival. Conclusion: Our data shows that the survival of response and stable disease patients are better than that of patient with progression disease, the survival benefit of patients with stable disease and responses are no significantly difference.

47249142436	Global analysis of metastasis-associated gene expression in primary cultures from clinical specimens of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma	Metastatic clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has a poor prognosis and unpredictable course, and there are no molecular markers that reliably predict ccRCC metastasis. In this study, ccRCC specimens from 84 patients were directly cultured in vitro. Primary cultures from 38 of 94 specimens contained more than 90% tumor cells at the fourth passage. After identification by immunostaining, the primary cultures of metastatic and nonmetastatic ccRCC specimens from the age- and gender-matched patients were subjected to cDNA microarray assays. A total of 842 differentially expressed genes with a FDR (false discovery rate) of 4.79% were identified. Pathway analysis and co-occurrence with "cancer", "metastasis" and "invasion" in the literature annotations functionally enriched the 842 genes and provided an indication of the reliability of our microarray assays. Novel genes associated with metastasis were selected based on protein-protein interactions between 205 differentially expressed genes that co-occurred with "metastasis" and those that did not co-occur with "metastasis" on Medline, and the results of co-expression analysis between the co-occurred genes and unpublished genes. FSTL1, AV722783, SLC15A1, DDX17, ORC2L and PKMYT1 were found to be potential ccRCC metastasis-associated novel genes, according to expression patterns in cultures and tumor tissues. Interestingly, the upregulated genes (CAV1, PKMYT1 and ORC2L) were also upregulated and the downregulated genes (FSTL1, GSTM3, CYR61, SLC15A1 and AV722783) were also downregulated in the primary ccRCC specimens compared with expression in adjacent renal tissues in 37 patients. This study has identified new candidate biomarkers and targets for the early diagnosis and treatment of ccRCC metastasis. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

48449092021	Promoter region methylation analysis of glutathione S-transferase p1 gene in prostate carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the promoter region CpG island methylation status of glutathione S-transferase p1 (GSTP1) gene in prostate carcinoma (PCa) tissues and to search for new molecular markers for the early diagnosis of PCa. Methods: The promoter region CpG island methylation status of 31 PCa, 18 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues (BPH) and 3 normal prostate tissues (NP) were examined by nest methylation-specific PCR (NMSP) technique, cloning and sequencing. Results: NMSP showed that the methylation rates of PCa, BPH and NP tissues were 83%, 0% and 0%, respectively. The CG sites methylation rates of PCa, BPH and NP tissues were 96%, 34% and 37%, respectively as determined by cloning and sequencing (P<0.01), with no significant difference found between those of BPH and NP tissues(P>0.05). A combination of NMSP and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was better than PSA alone in screen of PCa. Conclusion: CpG islands of promoter region of GSTP1 gene is hypermethylated in PCa tissues. NMSP is sensitive and specific in detection of GSTP1 methylation, which may serve as a new method for early screen of prostate carcinoma.

47949100369	Dihydroartemisinin induces apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells dependent of iron and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation but independent of reactive oxygen species	Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the main active metabolite of artemisinin derivatives, is one of the most effective anti-malarial analogs of artemisinin. In the current study, we found that DHA inhibited the proliferation of a panel of tumor cells originated from different tissue types. DHA effectively induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, which was accompanied with mitochondrial dysfunction and caspases activation. Further studies indicated that DHA-induced apoptosis was iron-dependent. Though DHA slightly elicited superoxide anion, these reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute little to DHA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Moreover, DHA time-dependently activated mitogen-activeted protein kinases (MAPKs) and specific inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), abolished DHA-induced apoptosis, indicating that activation of p38 MAPK is required for DHA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Altogether, our data uncover that DHA induces apoptosis is dependent of iron and p38 MAPK activation but not ROS in HL-60 cells. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

48949117184	ADAM15 suppresses cell motility by driving integrin α5β1 cell surface expression via Erk inactivation	Human ADAM15 is unique among the A disintegrin and metalloprotease domain (ADAM) family because of the integrin binding motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) within its disintegrin domain. Integrin α5β1 has been reported to bind to ADAM15 in an RGD-dependent manner, but the biological significance of the interaction between ADAM15 and α5β1 is unknown. To characterize the effects of ADAM15 on α5β1-mediated cell adhesion and migration and elucidate the potential mechanism, CHO cells which express endogenous integrin α5β1 were transfected with human ADAM15 cDNA. ADAM15 overexpression led to enhanced cell adhesion and decreased migration on fibronectin, which were suppressed by down-regulation of integrin α5. Overexpression of ADAM15 not only increased the cell surface expression of integrin α5 but also resulted in a more clustered staining of α5 on cell surface, while the β1 subunit remained unchanged. Unexpectedly, results from immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence indicated that ADAM15 and α5β1 integrin did not interact directly in CHO cells. We found that ADAM15 expression decreased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Consistently, down-regulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by MEK inhibitor PD98059 or siRNA against Erk1/2 enhanced the expression of α5 on cell surface. By using a B16F10 pulmonary metastasis model, we revealed that overexpression of ADAM15 significantly reduced the number of metastatic nodules on the lung. Taken together, this study reveals for the first time that ADAM15 could drive α5 integrin expression on cell surface via down-regulation of phosphorylated Erk1/2. This presents a novel mechanism by which ADAM15 regulates cell-matrix adhesion and migration. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Targeted uptake of therapeutic agent in the cell-, tissue- or disease-specific manner represents a potential technology for the treatment of HCC. A new docetaxel-loaded hepatoma-targeted solid lipid nanoparticle (tSLN) was designed and prepared with galactosylated dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine. The cellular cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, subcellular localization, in vivo toxicity, therapeutic effect, biodistribution and histology of tSLNs were investigated. The tSLNs showed the particle size about 120 nm with encapsulation efficiency >90%, a low burst effect within the first day and a sustained release for the next 29 days in vitro. Cytotoxicity of tSLNs against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL7402 was superior to Taxotere

56849098340	The marine-derived oligosccharide sulfate (MdOS), a novel multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, combats tumor angiogenesis both in Vitro and in Vivo	Despite the emerging success of multi-targeted protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors in cancer therapy, significant side effects and resistance concerns seems to be avoided unlikely. The aim of the present study was to identify novel multi-targeting PTK inhibitors. The kinase enzymatic activities were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antiproliferative activities in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were evaluated by sulforhodamine (SRB) assay. The phosphorylation of kinases and their downstream molecules was probed by western blot analysis. The binding mode between MdOS and PTKs was profiled by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach and molecular simulation. Tube formation assay, rat aortic ring method and chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay were combined to illustrate the in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenic effects. Results indicated that MdOS, a novel marine-derived oligosaccharide sulfate, exhibited a broad-spectrum PTK inhibitory action. At an enzymatic level, MdOS inhibited HER2, EGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, c-Kit, FGFR1 and c-Src, with little impact on FGFR2. In cellular settings, MdOS inhibited phosphorylation of PTKs, exemplified by HER2, EGFR and VEGFR2, and downstream molecules of Erk1/2 and AKT. Further studies demonstrated that MdOS acted as an ATP-competitive inhibitor via directly binding to the residues of entrance rather than those of the ATP-binding pocket. Furthermore, MdOS inhibited proliferation and tube formation of HMECs, arrested microvessel outgrowth of rat aortic rings and hindered the neovascularization of chick allantoic membrane. Taken together, results presented here indicated that MdOS exhibited anti-angiogenic activity in a PTK-dependent manner and make it a promising agent for further evaluation in PTK-associated cancer therapy. © 2008 Ma et al.

57049165519	Expression of glutathione S-transferase M3 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and its promoter CpG methylation	Objective: To examine the expression and promoter CpG island methylation of glutathione S-transferase M3 (GSTM3) gene in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and to evaluate the relationship of expression, methylation of GSTM3 gene with the metastasis and oncogenesis of ccRCC. Methods: Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique, we examined GSTM3 expression in surgical specimens of 24 primary ccRCCs and adjacent non-malignant tissues, 14 metastatic ccRCCs and 2 ccRCC cell lines (RCC05-TXJ,RCC05-ZTJ) with different metastatic potentials. RCC05-TXJ cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of GSTM3 in response to 5-Aza-CdR treatment. Nested bisulfite sequencing PCR and DNA sequencing were used to analyze different methylation locuses in GSTM3 gene promoter in 10 primary ccRCCs and adjacent non-malignant tissues. We also examined the methylation level in 10 primary ccRCCs and the corresponding non-malignant tissues as well as 8 metastatic tissues by nested methylation-specific PCR. Results: Expression of GSTM3 gene in metastatic ccRCC cells (RCC05-TXJ) was lower than that in the non-metastatic ccRCC cells (RCC05-ZYJ). Down-regulation of GSTM3 gene expression was found in 17 of the 24 primary ccRCCs as compared with the non-malignant tissue. Expression of GSTM3 in the metastatic ccRCCs was lower than that in primary ccRCCs. 5-Aza-CdR treatment increased GSTM3 expression in RCC05-ZYJ. Methylation in GSTM3 promoter was found in 4 of 10 ccRCC tissues, 2 of 10 adjacent tissues, and 1 of 8 metastatic tissues. No significant difference was found between ccRCC and adjacent tissues (P = 0.628) or ccRCC and metastatic disease (P = 0.314) due to limit number of cases. Conclusion: Our findings support that promoter aberrant methylation is one of the major mechanisms of GSTM3 gene down-regulation in ccRCC. The preliminary identification of GSTM3 promoter methylation sites may provide a basis for further study.

Methods: IntNetDB was used to search for the neighborhoods of gene PPP4R1 and cliques by CFinder; Chilibot was used to explore the association between the cliques and carcinoma, then the association of PPP4R1 with gastric carcinoma was deduced. Eighteen pairs of primary and metastatic specimens from the same patient and 12 pairs primary carcinoma and the adjacent normal specimens from the same patient were analyzed by RT-PCR for PPP4R1 expression. Results: It was found that the community genes of PPP4R1 included PPP2R5E, MTMR4, PPP3CC, CTDP1, CTDSP1, FLJ22405, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, PPP2R2A, PPP2R5A, PPP2R5C, CTDSP2, and PPP1CA as searched by Cfinder2. 0 when k = 14. Nine of the genes were associated with carcinoma and 2 associated with carcinoma and metastasis. The result of RT-PCR showed that higher expression of PPP4R1 was found in 15 of the 18 primary gastric cancer specimens compared with the paired metastatic specimens (P<0.01); higher expression was also found in 9 of the 12 adjacent normal specimens compared with the paired cancer specimens (P< 0.01). Conclusion: Gene PPP4R1 may be associated with the oncogeriesis and metastasis of gastric carcinoma; bioinformatics is an efficient way to investigate function of new genes.

Methods: Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine the differential expression of CD99, FKBP5, and FLJ13576 in the primary ccRCC tissues and the corresponding adjacent normal renal tissues. Results: The positive rates of CD99, FKBP5, and FLJ13576 in the primary ccRCC tissues were 72%, 60% and 48%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the adjacent normal renal tissues(28%, 24%, and 16%, P<0.05). Conclusion: Cancer metastasis-associated molecules CD99, FKBP5 and FLJ13576 are highly expressed in the primary ccRCC tissues, which might be associated with the development and progression of renal cancer. CD99, FKBP5 and FLJ13576 may serve as potential markers for detection of ccRCC.

64649106311	Targeted nanoassembly loaded with docetaxel improves intracellular drug delivery and efficacy in murine breast cancer model	Docetaxel is one of the most promising chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, but it shows fearful side effects. We hypothesized that a novel targeted nanoassembly (TNA) could provide efficient intracellular drug delivery in breast tumor cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and thus improve the efficacy and reduce the side effects of docetaxel. We prepared the novel docetaxel loaded TNAs formed by polyethylene glycol-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) and modified with EGF. Compared with nontargeted nanoassemblies (NNAs), TNAs showed obvious improvement of cell-specific uptake and internalization, and revealed more cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells by inducing more late apoptosis and subG1 cells at low drug concentration, or more G2/M arrest at high drug concentration than NNAs or Taxotere. In BALB/c mice bearing breast tumor xenografts, TNAs showed stronger inhibition of tumor growth compared with NNAs (relative tumor volume in mice treated with 5 mg/kg TNAs = 0.99 and 10 mg/kg NNAs = 1.71, p < 0.05) or Taxotere (relative tumor volume in mice treated with 5 mg/kg TNAs = 0.99 and 10 mg/kg Taxotere = 4.20, p < 0.01). In particular, tumor disappeared completely in the TNA group at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TNAs was about four times higher than that of Taxotere. TNAs also demonstrated a much longer circulation time in vivo and more drug accumulation in tumor in a murine breast cancer model than Taxotere. TNA treatment also prolonged survival of mice. These results suggested that TNAs could have more potential as a delivery system for breast cancer chemotherapy. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

65449148254	Identification of metastasis-Associated alternatively spliced variants of CD99 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues	Objective: To identify the metastasis-associated splice variants of CD99 and investigate the mRNA expression of the splice variants in clear cell renal cell carcinoma(ccRCC) tissues, so as to investigate its relationship with the initiation and progression of ccRCC. Methods: Alternative Splicing Database was used to predict the splice variants of CD99. The six predicted splice variants of CD99 were identified in the metastatic tissues, primary ccRCCs and normal tissues adjacent to cancer by using self-designed primer sets, and were cloned into vectors and sequenced. The mRNA expression of CD99 type I, CD99 type II, and CD99-III were detected in 9 metastatic tissues and their corresponding cancer tissues, 21 primary ccRCCs and normal tissues adjacent to cancer by RT-PCR. Results: A new isoform of CD99 (CD99-III) was identified, which was detected in 8 of the 9 metastatic tissues, a ratio significantly higher than that in the primary ccRCCs without metastasis (10 out of 21, P<0. 05). The results revealed that the transcripts of CD99 type I was present in all of the ccRCC specimens tested; CD99 type II was detected in 6 of 9 metastatic corresponding primary cancer tissues, a ratio significantly higher than that in cancer tissues without metastasis(3 out of 21, P=0.008). Conclusion: CD99 type II and CD99-III, a novel splice variant of CD99, may be associated with the initiation and progression of ccRCC.

64849110212	GA3, a new gambogic acid derivative, exhibits potent antitumor activities in vitro via apoptosis-involved mechanisms	Aim: Gambogic acid (GA) is the major active ingredient of gamboge, which is secreted from a Chinese traditional medicine, Garcinia hanburyi, which possesses potent antitumor activity. GA3, a new GA derivative, has been shown to possess better water solubility than GA. The aim of the present study was to examine the antitumor activity of GA3 and the mechanism underlying it. Methods: The growth inhibition of cancer cell lines induced by GA3 was assessed using the SRB assay. DAPI staining, flow cytometry, a DNA fragment assay, and Western blot analysis were used to study the apoptotic mechanisms of GA3.Results:GA3 displayed wide cytotoxicity in diversified human cancer cell lines with a mean IC 50 value of 2.15 mol/L. GA3 was also effective against multidrug resistant cells, with an average resistance factor (RF) that was much lower than that of the reference drug, doxorubicin. Mechanistic studies revealed that GA3-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells proceeded via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, with caspase-8 functioning upstream of caspase-9. In addition, GA3-driven apoptotic events were associated with up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and cleavage of Bid. Moreover, GA3 triggered cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, in particular bypassing the involvement of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Conclusion: Better solubility and a potential anti-MDR activity, combined with a comparable antitumor efficacy, make GA3 a potential drug candidate in cancer therapy that deserves further investigation. © 2009 CPS and SIMM.

67651171556	Targeting expression of the catalytic domain of the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) in the peroxisomes of Pichia pastoris	The kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), also known as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer because of its crucial role in angiogenesis, which is fundamental to the malignancy of tumors. Here, we expressed the catalytic domain of KDR in Pichia pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. In order to facilitate its purification and detection, His-tag and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were fused to the N-terminus of KDR. At the same time, a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (SKL) was fused to the C-terminus to avoid the potential negative effect on the host cell. The highly expressing clone K1 was selected by GFP fluorescence intensity analysis using flow cytometry (FCM). Furthermore, the GFP-KDR-SKL fusion protein was proved to be correctly targeted to the peroxisomes of P. pastoris by colocation with blue fluorescent protein-SKL. The expression of GFP-KDR-SKL led to extensive phosphorylation of endogenous proteins and significantly inhibited cell growth. However, the expression was not lethal to the cells. Both in vitro biological activity assay and inhibition rate assay demonstrated that the purified GFP-KDR-SKL fusion protein exhibited high kinase catalytic activity and could be used as a target for anticancer drug screening. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

68749089715	Anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting effects of C9, a new microtubule-depolymerizing agent	Background and purpose: The critical role of blood supply in the growth of /id tumours makes blood vessels an ideal target for anti-tumour drug discovery. The anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting activities of C9, a newly synthesized microtubule-depolymerizing agent, were investigated with several in vitro and in vivo models. Possible mechanisms involved in its activity were also assessed. Experimental approach: Microtubule-depolymerizing actions were assessed by surface plasmon resonance binding, competitive inhibition and cytoskeleton immunofluorescence. Anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting activities were tested on proliferation, migration, tube formation with human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and in rat aortic ring, chick chorioallantoic membrane and Matrigel plug assays. Western blots and Rho activation assays were employed to examine the role of Raf-MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated ERK kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and Rho/Rho kinase signalling. Key results: C9 inhibited proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells and inhibited angiogenesis in aortic ring and chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. C9 induced disassembly of microtubules in endothelial cells and down-regulated Raf-MEK-ERK signalling activated by pro-angiogenic factors. In addition, C9 disrupted capillary-like networks and newly formed vessels in vitro and rapidly decreased perfusion of neovasculature in vivo. Endothelial cell contraction and membrane blebbing induced by C9 in neovasculature was dependent on the Rho/Rho kinase pathway. Conclusions and implications: Anti-angiogenic and vascular disruption by C9 was associated with changes in morphology and function of endothelial cells, involving the Raf-MEK-ERK and Rho/Rho kinase signalling pathways. These findings strongly suggest that C9 is a new microtubule-binding agent that could effectively target tumour vasculature. © 2009 The British Pharmacological Society.

69049086659	Design and synthesis of novel C14-hydroxyl substituted triptolide derivatives as potential selective antitumor agents	It has long been considered that the free β hydroxyl group at C14 of triptolide (1) is essential to its potent anticancer activity. In this study, we synthesized novel derivatives of 1 with a hydroxyl group substituted by epoxy groups (4-8) or a five-membered ring (11-13). Compounds (4-8) showed significant in vitro anticancer activity although less potent than 1. Although with an α oxygen configuration at the C14 position, (14S)-14,21-epoxytriptolide (4) exhibited the highest potency among all these derivatives, clearly challenging the traditional viewpoint on the necessity of C14β-hydroxyl group of compound 1. Further studies revealed that while displaying broad spectrum in vitro anticancer activity, compound 4 demonstrated prominent selective in vivo anticancer activity, particularly against human ovarian SKOV-3 and prostate PC-3 cancers with obviously lower toxicity than 1. Noticeably, compound 4 was also highly effective against multidrug resistant cancer cells. Therefore, our study gives new insights into the structure-activity relationship of 1 and also produces a promising anticancer drug candidate with unique anticancer activities. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

Methods: Alternative Splicing Database (ASD) was used to predict the possible splicing variants of NR4A2; they were identified by gene sequencing technique and their expression was detected by semi-quantitative PCR. The mRNA expression of NR4A2 and its splicing variants in tumor and the corresponding adjacent-tumor tissues (n = 41) were determined by real-time PCR. Meanwhile, immunohistochemisty was employed to examine the protein levels of NR4A2 in the tumor tissues (n = 28). Results: The expression of NR4A2 mRNA was observed in the primary tumor tissues, adjacent tumor tissues, and metastatic tissues. Two splicing variants of NR4A2 were discovered: NR4A2-I and NR4A2-II. The mRNA expression of NR4A2, NR4A2-I, and NR4A2-II in the adjacent-tumor tissue was significantly higher than that in the primary tumor tissue (P = 0.017, P = 0.007, and P = 0.004), and that in the hepatic metastatic tissue was significantly lower than that in the primary tumor tissue (P = 0.001, P = 0.018, P = 0.016). Meanwhile, immunohistochemistry showed that the positive rate of NR4A2 protein was higher in adjacent-tumor tissue than that in both tumor tissues and metastatic tissues, but with no significant differences. Conclusion: At least there are 2 splicing variants of NR4A2 in the gastric tumor, adjacent-tumor, and metastatic tissues; NR4A2 and the novel splicing variants may contribute to the pathogenesis and metastasis of gastric malignancy.

70349722912	Identification of novel hub genes associated with liver metastasis of gastric cancer	Understanding hub genes involved in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis could lead to effective approaches to diagnose and treat cancer metastasis. In this study, 272 differentially expressed genes between synchronous liver metastasis and the paired GC were selected from microarray assays. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that of 13 enriched pathways, 8 were involved in cancer metastasis. Literature-based annotations showed that the differentially expressed genes significantly enriched known metastasis-related genes. With the use of protein-protein interaction network, we found a subnetwork significantly enriching the metastasis-related genes and hubs. Unannotated hubs in this subnetwork were predicted to be novel metastasis-associated genes. Nine hubs in this subnetwork were validated by using quantitative RTPCR, and 4 hubs were further validated by immunohistochemistry. NR4A2 was significantly down-regulated in synchronous liver metastasis compared with the paired GC at both transcriptional and translational levels. NR4A2 immunostaining was apparent in the mesenchymal cells of pathologically normal gastric mucosa and in the epithelial cells of primary GC. HSP90AA1 was not only up-regulated in the metastatic GC compared with primary GC at both transcriptional and translational levels, but also up-regulated in primary GC compared with the normal mucosa at the translational level. NR4A2, NR3C1, ARF3, XAB2, and alternatively spliced variants of NR4A2, SP8 and SP-novel, were significantly down-regulated, whereas CCNE1 significantly up-regulated, in primary GC compared with the normal gastric mucosa. Conclusively, NR4A2 and HSP90AA1 stand out as promising diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for liver metastasis of GC. CCNE1 and NR3C1 indicate primary GC, rather than distant metastasis. © 2009 UICC.

70649115439	The characteristics and performance of a multifunctional nanoassembly system for the co-delivery of docetaxel and iSur-pDNA in a mouse hepatocellular carcinoma model	Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most causes of cancer-related death and is well known because of resistant to chemotherapeutic drug. Co-delivery of antitumor agent docetaxel and iSur-pDNA, a suppressor of metastatic and resistance-related protein survivin, was postulated to achieve synergistic/combined effect of antitumor drug and gene therapeutics. To valid this hypothesis, a folate-modified multifunctional nanoassembly (FNA) loading both docetaxel and iSur-pDNA was constructed and evaluated as a therapeutic approach for HCC. The FNAs were prepared with folate-modified lipid FA-PEG-DSPE as the target to tumor, protamine sulfate (PS) as the condenser to protect and enhance the nuclear transfer of iSur-pDNA, and DOPE-based lipid envelope as the carrier of doctaxel and PS/DNA complex to achieve their co-delivery and enhance internalization into hepatoma cells. FNAs showed the particle size about 200 nm with encapsulation efficiency >90%. Blank nanoassemblies (BNAs) loading only reporter gene revealed higher transfection efficiency with neglectable cytotoxicity compared with Lipofectamine™ 2000, which could result from enhanced cellular uptake via ligand-receptor recognition and efficient nuclear delivery mediated by PS. Cytotoxicity of FNAs against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL 7402 was much higher than either docetaxel or non-docetaxel FNAs (nFNAs) loading only iSur-pDNA, and was also superior to the combined treatment with free docetaxel and nFNAs. Better antitumor efficacy of FNAs with low systemic toxicity was also observed on mouse hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model. These results suggested that co-delivery of docetaxel and iSur-pDNA with FNAs could be a safer and more efficient strategy for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic HCC. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77749239662	Oligomannurarate sulfate blocks tumor growth by inhibiting NF-kB activation	Aim: JG3, a novel marine-derived oligosaccharide, significantly inhibits angiogenesis and tumor metastasis by blocking heparanase activity. It also arrests tumor growth, an effect that is not fully explained by its anti-heparanase activity. Here we sought to identify the mechanisms underlying JG3-mediated inhibition of tumor growth. Methods: Heparanase expression was assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. NF-kB activation status was determined using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, DNA-binding and transcription- activity assays. The effect of JG3 on upstream components of the NF-kB pathway and on selected transcription factors were monitored by Western blotting. The antitumor effect of JG3 and its relation to NF-kB activation were evaluated using four different tumor xenograft models. Results: We found that JG3 effectively inhibited NF-kB activation independent of heparanase expression. Our results indicate that JG3 inactivated NF-kB by interfering with the activation of upstream components of the NF-kB pathway without generally affecting the nuclear translocation of transcription factors. Further, in vivo studies demonstrated that JG3 effectively arrested the growth of tumors derived from cell lines in which NF-kB was constitutively active (BEL-7402 liver carcinoma and MDA-MB-435s breast carcinoma), but did not affect the growth of tumors derived from NF-kB-negative cell lines (SGC-7901 gastric cancer and HO-8910 ovarian carcinoma). Conclusion: Our data indicate that NF-kB mediates the JG3-induced arrest of tumor growth. These results define a new mechanism of action of JG3 and highlight the potential for JG3 as a promising lead molecule in cancer therapy. © 2010 CPS and SIMM. All rights reserved.

77949650539	Echinoside A, a new marine-derived anticancer saponin, targets topoisomerase2α by unique interference with its DNA binding and catalytic cycle	Background: Echinoside A was isolated from sea cucumber. This study demonstrates its anticancer effects and its mechanisms of action. Materials and methods: Anticancer effects of echinoside A were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. TUNEL and DNA fragmentation assays were applied to examine its ability to induce apoptosis. A series of biochemical assays were applied to investigate the inhibition of echinoside A on topoisomerase2α (Top2α). Molecular docking analyses were used to demonstrate the direct interaction between echinoside A and Top2α. Results: Echinoside A inhibited the growth of tumors in mouse models and human prostate carcinoma xenografts in nude mouse models. Echinoside A shows the unique characteristics of inhibiting the noncovalent binding of Top2α to DNA by competing with DNA for the DNA-binding domain of the enzyme and of interfering predominantly with the Top2α-mediated prestrand passage cleavage/religation equilibrium over with the poststrand passage one. These features distinguish echinoside A from other known Top2α inhibitors. As a result, echinoside A induced DNA double-strand breaks in a Top2-dependent manner. Conclusion: Echinoside A targets Top2α by unique interference with the binding of Top2 to DNA and by imparing the Top2-mediated DNA cleavage and religation, exerting potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. © The Author 2009.

We retrospectively reviewed our data to compare the survival of immediate with delayed topotecan after first-line therapy in SCLC. Methods: In our retrospective study, 53 patients with SCLC were divided into two groups as follow: patients receiving topotecan-containing regimen as maintenance/consolidation (maintenance/consolidation chemotherapy group) and salvage chemotherapy (salvage chemotherapy group). The Log-rank test was used to assess the difference in OS between two groups. Cox regression model was used for the multivariable analysis of independent prognostic factors. Results: Twenty-nine patients received topotecan as maintenance/consolidation treatment, whereas 24 patients salvage chemotherapy. The response rates were 51.7% and 41.7%, respectively. The median survival time were 20 months and 27 months respectively (P=0.89). Multivariate Cox regression analyses identified sex and stage as independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: Efficacy of first-line therapy was improved by topotecan maintenance/consolidation treatment, which did not result in any significant survival benefits in SCLC.

77951096047	A series of α-heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones inhibit topoisomerase IIα catalytic activity	A series of novel thiosemicarbazone derivatives bearing condensed heterocyclic carboxaldehyde moieties were designed and synthesized. Among them, TSC24 exhibited broad antiproliferative activity in a panel of human tumor cells and suppressed tumor growth in mice. The mechanism research revealed that TSC24 was not only an iron chelator but also a topoisomerase IIα catalytic inhibitor. Its inhibition on topoisomerase IIα was due to direct interaction with the ATPase domain of topoisomerase IIα which led to the block of ATP hydrolysis. Molecular docking predicted that TSC24 might bind at the ATP binding site, which was confirmed by the competitive inhibition assay. These results about the mechanisms involved in the anticancer activities of thiosemicarbazones will aid in the rational design of novel topoisomerase II-targeted drugs and will provide insights into the discovery and development of novel cancer therapeutics based on the dual activity to chelate iron and to inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIα. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77952266182	Dihydroartemisinin accelerates c-MYC oncoprotein degradation and induces apoptosis in c-MYC-overexpressing tumor cells	Artemisinin and its derivatives (ARTs) are effective antimalarial drugs and also possess profound anticancer activity. However, the mechanism accounted for its distinctive activity in tumor cells remains unelucidated. We computed Pair wise Pearson correlation coefficients to identify genes that show significant correlation with ARTs activity in NCI-55 cell lines using data obtained from studies with HG-U133A Affymetrix chip. We found c-myc is one of the genes that showed the highest positive correlation coefficients among the probe sets analyzed (r=0.585, P<0.001). Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the main active metabolite of ARTs, induced significant apoptosis in HL-60 and HCT116 cells that express high levels of c-MYC. Stable knockdown of c-myc abrogated DHA-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Conversely, forced expression of c-myc in NIH3T3 cells sensitized these cells to DHA-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, DHA irreversibly down-regulated the protein level of c-MYC in DHA-sensitive HCT116 cells, which is consistent to persistent G1 phase arrest induced by DHA. Further studies demonstrated that DHA accelerated the degradation of c-MYC protein and this process was blocked by pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 or GSK 3β inhibitor LiCl in HCT116 cells. Taken together, ARTs might be useful in the treatment of c-MYC-overexpressing tumors. We also suggest that c-MYC may potentially be a biomarker candidate for prediction of the antitumor efficacies of ARTs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77955343964	Types of alternative splice variants of transcription factor 19 and their expression patterns in clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues	Objective: To study whether there is expression of the alternative splice variants of TCF19, a cell growth regulatory gene, in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues and their relationship with the development of ccRCC. Methods: Alternative Splicing Database was used to predict the possible alternative splice variants of TCF19. Specific primers for amplifying the 5 predicted variants of TCF19 were designed and used to examine the corresponding variants in 32 ccRCC tissues and normal tissues adjacent to the tumors by RT-PCR technique. The amplicons were then cloned and sequenced. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the expression differences of the variants between the primary renal cell carcinoma and adjacent tissues. Results: Two new isoforms of TCF19 (TCF19-1 and TCF19-3) were identified in the ccRCC and the adjacent tissues. RT-PCR results showed that TCF19-1 expression was significantly higher in the primary ccRCC tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001). And the expression of TCF19-3 in the primary tumor was only slightly higher than that in the adjacent tissues (P = 0.082). Conclusion: This study for the first time identifies the existence of two alternative splice isoforms of TCF-19, TCF19-1 and TCF19-3, in human ccRCC tissues, and the expression of TCF19-1 might be related to the development of ccRCC.

78649386068	MFTZ-1 reduces constitutive and inducible HIF-1α accumulation and VEGF secretion independent of its topoisomerase II inhibition	The macrolide compound MFTZ-1 has been identified as a novel topoisomerase II (Top2) inhibitor with potent in vitro and in vivo antitumour activities. In this study, we further examined the effects of MFTZ-1 on hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) accumulation, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and angiogenesis. MFTZ-1 reduced HIF-1α accumulation driven by hypoxia or growth factors in human cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that MFTZ-1 did not affect the degradation of HIF-1α protein or the level of HIF-1α mRNA. By contrast, MFTZ-1 apparently inhibited constitutive and inducible activation of both phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Further studies revealed that MFTZ-1 abrogated the HIF-1α-driven increase in VEGF mRNA and protein secretion. MFTZ-1 also lowered the basal level of VEGF secretion. The results reveal an important feature that MFTZ-1 can reduce constitutive, HIF-1α-independent VEGF secretion and concurrently antagonize inducible, HIF-1α-dependent VEGF secretion. Moreover, MFTZ-1 disrupted tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by hypoxia with low-concentration serum or by serum at normoxia, and inhibited HUVECs migration at normoxia. MFTZ-1 also prevented microvessel outgrowth from rat aortic ring. These data reflect the potent anti-angiogenesis of MFTZ-1 under different conditions. Furthermore, using specific small interfering RNA targeting Top2α or Top2-defective HL60/MX2 cells, we showed that MFTZ-1 affected HIF-1α accumulation and HUVECs tube formation irrelevant to its Top2 inhibition. Taken together, our data collectively reveal that MFTZ-1 reduces constitutive and inducible HIF-1α accumulation and VEGF secretion possibly via PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways, eliciting anti-angiogenesis independently of its Top2 inhibition. © 2009 The Authors.

78549293261	MT7, a novel compound from a combinatorial library, arrests mitosis via inhibiting the polymerization of microtubules	Targeting cellular mitosis is an attractive antitumor strategy. Here, we reported MT7, a novel compound from the 6H-Pyrido[2′,1′:2,3]imidazo [4,5-c]isoquinolin- 5(6H)-one library generated by using the multi-component reaction strategy, as a new mitotic inhibitor. MT7 elicited apparent inhibition of cell proliferation by arresting mitosis specifically and reversibly in various tumor cell lines originating from different human tissues. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that MT7 induced typical gene expression profiles related to mitotic arrest shown by cDNA microarray assays. Connectivity Map was used to analyze the microarray data and suggested that MT7 was possibly a tubulin inhibitor due to its similar gene expression profiles to those of the known tubulin inhibitors demecolcine, celastrol and paclitaxel. Further analyses demonstrated that MT7 inhibited the polymerization of cellular microtubules although it was not detectable to bind to purified tubulin. The inhibition of cellular tubulin polymerization by MT7 subsequently resulted in the disruption of mitotic spindle formation, activated the spindle assembly checkpoint and consequently arrested the cells at mitosis. The persistent mitotic arrest by the treatment with MT7 led the tested tumor cells to apoptosis. Our data indicate that MT7 could act as a promising lead for further optimization, in hopes of developing new anticancer therapeutics and being used to probe the biology of mitosis, specifically, the mode of interference with microtubules. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79957484161	Anaesthetic technique may affect prognosis for ovarian serous adenocarcinoma: A retrospective analysis	Animal studies have shown that regional anaesthesia and analgesia may prevent or attenuate the surgical stress response by preserving immune function and result in better long-term outcome. We have tested the hypothesis that patients with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma who had surgery with epidural anaesthesia and analgesia would have better long-term outcome than those who were given general anaesthesia (GA) and i.v. opioid analgesia. Methods. A retrospective review of medical records identified 143 patients with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery between January 1994 and October 2006 at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Data in the analysis included age, anaesthesiaanalgesia technique, ASA status, blood loss, transfusion, duration of surgery, status of preoperative cancer antigen 125, tumour size, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, histological grade, lymph node status, residual macroscopic tumour, and chemotherapy. Survival analysis was made with the main outcome measure of death. Results. The 3- and 5-yr overall survival rates were 78 and 61 in the patient group who received epidural anaesthesia and analgesia (Group E, n106), and 58 and 49 in the patient group who received GA and i.v. opioid analgesia (Group G, n37), respectively. After adjusting for the other variables, Group G had a hazard ratio of 1.214 (P0.043) in a multivariable Cox regression model compared with Group E. Conclusion. sThis retrospective analysis suggests that epidural anaesthesia and analgesia for ovarian serous adenocarcinoma surgery may reduce mortality during the initial years of follow-up. © The Author [2011].

79960577238	AST1306, a novel irreversible inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 and 2, exhibits antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo	Despite the initial response to the reversible, ATP-competitive quinazoline inhibitors that target ErbB-family, such a subset of cancer patients almost invariably develop resistance. Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that irreversible ErbB inhibitors have the potential to override this resistance. Here, we found that AST1306, a novel anilino-quinazoline compound, inhibited the enzymatic activities of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 as well as EGFR resistant mutant in both cell-free and cell-based systems. Importantly, AST1306 functions as an irreversible inhibitor, most likely through covalent interaction with Cys797 and Cys805 in the catalytic domains of EGFR and ErbB2, respectively. Further studies showed that AST1306 inactivated pathways downstream of these receptors and thereby inhibited the proliferation of a panel of cancer cell lines. Although the activities of EGFR and ErbB2 were similarly sensitive to AST1306, ErbB2-overexpressing cell lines consistently exhibited more sensitivity to AST1306 antiproliferative effects. Consistent with this, knockdown of ErbB2, but not EGFR, decreased the sensitivity of SK-OV-3 cells to AST1306. In vivo, AST1306 potently suppressed tumor growth in ErbB2-overexpressing adenocarcinoma xenograft and FVB-2/N

82455192399	PH006, a novel and selective Src kinase inhibitor, suppresses human breast cancer growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo	The central role of Src in tumor progression and metastasis has validated it as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of human breast cancer. The aim of this study was to identify potential Src kinase inhibitor, explore its activity, and mechanism of action in human breast cancer. A strategy integrating focused combinatorial library design, virtual screening, chemical synthesis, and high-throughput screening was adopted and a novel 6-hydrazinopurine-based inhibitor of c-Src kinase PH006 was obtained. The kinase enzymatic activities were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The binding mode between PH006 and Src was profiled by surface plasmon resonance approach and molecular simulation. The anti-proliferative activity was evaluated by Sulforhodamin B (SRB) and Colony formation. The anti-invasion and anti-migration activities were assessed by trans-well and wound healing assay. Results indicated that PH006 was an ATP-competitive Src inhibitor, which selectively inhibited c-Src with an IC50 of 0.38 lM among a panel of 14 diverse tyrosine kinases. PH006 potently inhibited c-Src phosphorylation and c-Src-dependent signal transduction, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Further study demonstrated that the anti-proliferative activity of PH006 was ascribed to its capability to arrest cells in G1 phase, while its anti-motility activity was related to suppression of MMP2/9 and HGF secretion. Moreover, PH006 exhibited potent activity against tumor growth as well as metastasis of human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 xenograft beard in nude mice, which was accompanied with reduced Src/FAK signaling in tumor tissue. Taken together, PH006 is a novel selective inhibitor of c-Src and possesses potent activity against breast cancer growth and metastasis, which could be potentially developed as a lead candidate against breast cancers with elevated Src tyrosine kinase activity. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2010.

83655201531	Oligomannurarate sulfate sensitizes cancer cells to doxorubicin by inhibiting atypical activation of NF-κB via targeting of Mre11	Aberrant regulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor is involved in cancer development, progression and resistance to chemotherapy. JG3, a marine-derived oligomannurarate sulfate, was reported as a heparanase and NF-κB inhibitor to significantly block tumor growth and metastasis in various animal models. However, the detailed functional mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that JG3 inhibits NF-κB activation by specifically antagonizing the doxorubicin-triggered Ataxia-telangiectasia- mutated kinase (ATM) and the sequential MEK/ERK/p90Rsk/IKK signaling pathway but does not interfere with TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. This selective inactivation of the specific NF-κB cascade is attributed to the binding capacity of JG3 for Mre11, a major sensor of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Based on this selective mechanism, JG3 showed synergistic effect with doxorubicin in a panel of tumor cells and did not affect immune system function as shown in the in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and hemolysis assays. All these highlight the clinical potential of JG3 as a favorable sensitizer in cancer therapy. In addition, identification of Mre11 as a potential target in the development of NF-κB inhibitors provides a platform for the further development of effective anticancer agents.

Methods: Antagonizing effect of C9 on anti-apoptotic activity of VEGF and bFGF was determined by FACS and TUNEL assay in endothelial cells cultured in serum-free media. Phosphorylation of c-Raf, Mek, Erk and Akt was detected by Western blot after treatment with various concentrations of C9. Results: FACS and TUNEL assay showed that C9 antagonized the anti-apoptosis activity of VEGF and bFGF on apoptosis induced by serum-free culture in endothelial cells. Western Blot revealed that C9 at various concentrations downregulated phosphorylation of c-Raf, Mek, Erk and Akt, but did not affect the phosphorylation of KDR or FGFR1. Conclusion: C9 inhibits the angiogenesis process by targeting the Raf-Mek-Erk-MAPK pathway.

84863112637	AL3810, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, exhibits potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumour activity via targeting VEGFR, FGFR and PDGFR	Angiogenesis plays an important role in neoplastic transformation and progression as well as in the metastasis process of most human cancers. Herein, we identified AL3810 as a novel and orally bioavailable small molecular inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against multiple tyrosine kinases involved in the process of angiogenesis. We found that AL3810 substantially inhibited the autophosphorylation of VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1 in endothelial cells. Moreover, AL3810 exhibited potent anti-angiogenesis activity, manifested by significant inhibition of microvessel outgrowth of rat arterial ring and chickallantochorion membrane (CAM) in ex vivo angiogenesis models. Daily dosing of AL3810 has shown broad-spectrum anti-tumour activity in human kidney, pancreas, liver cancer xenograft models. Importantly, immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that the anti-tumour activity of AL3810 was closely correlated with its anti-angiogenesis activity, as demonstrated by a decreased microvessel area and reduced microvessel numbers in tumour tissues. The overall pharmacological profiles of AL3810 are superior to sorafenib. The clinical trials of AL3810 will soon be launched in China. © 2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2012 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84863282932	Enhancement of Helicobacter pylori outer inflammatory protein DNA vaccine efficacy by co-delivery of interleukin-2 and B subunit heat-labile toxin gene encoded plasmids	Development of an effective vaccine for controlling H. pylori-associated infection, which is present in about half the people in the world, is a priority. The H. pylori outer inflammatory protein (oipA) has been demonstrated to be a potential antigen for a vaccine. In the present study, use of oipA gene encoded construct (poipA) for C57BL/6 mice vaccination was investigated. Whether co-delivery of IL-2 gene encoded construct (pIL-2) and B subunit heat-labile toxin of Escherichia coli gene encoded construct (pLTB) can modulate the immune response and enhance DNA vaccine efficacy was also explored. Our results demonstrated that poipA administered intradermally ('gene gun' immunization) promoted a strong Th2 immune response, whereas co-delivery of either pIL-2 or pLTB adjuvant elicited a Th1-biased immune response. PoipA administered with both pIL-2 and pLTB adjuvants promoted a strong Th1 immune response. Regardless of the different immune responses promoted by the various vaccination regimes, all immunized mice had smaller bacterial loads after H. pylori challenge than did PBS negative and pVAX1 mock controls. Co-delivery of adjuvant(s) enhances poipA DNA vaccine efficacy by shifting the immune response from being Th2 to being Th1-biased, which results in a greater reduction in bacterial load after H. pylori challenge. Both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination can achieve sterile immunity in some subjects. © 2012 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84864011949	Therapeutic vaccination with Salmonella-delivered codon-optimized outer inflammatory protein DNA vaccine enhances protection in Helicobacter pylori infected mice	Vaccination had demonstrated as an alternative way to combat Helicobacter pylori challenge. In the present study, codon-optimized outer inflammatory protein gene (oipA) for Mus species codon usage, the inclusion of optimal Kozak sequence, and modified of GC content was applied to construct a novel DNA construct. The Salmonella-delivered wild type oipA construct (SL7207/poipA) and the Salmonella-delivered codon-optimized oipA construct (SL7207/poipA-opt) were prepared and their therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in H. pylori-infected mice. The codon-optimized oipA construct (poipA-opt) expressed almost six-fold higher protein than that of wild type construct (poipA) as normalized to the β-actin expression in AGS cells. Oral therapeutic immunization with SL7207/poipA-opt significantly eliminated H. pylori colonization in the stomach; and protection was related to a robust Th1/Th2 immune response. Therefore, our results suggested that fine therapeutic efficacy was related to sufficient expression of the antigen. It is supposed that codon-optimized oipA gene improves protein expression and consequently enhances the immunogenicity of DNA vaccine, which resulted in a significant reduction of bacterial loads in H. pylori infected mice. The Salmonella-delivered codon-optimized DNA construct could be a candidate vaccine against H. pylori for the clinical application. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0037449461	Quercetin, a dietary-derived flavonoid, possesses antiangiogenic potential	Quercetin, a dietary-derived flavonoid, suppresses tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinase. The effects of quercetin on the angiogenic process were examined in this study. Quercetin was found to inhibit several important steps of angiogenesis including proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human microvascular dermal endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the effect of quercetin on endothelial cell proliferation was confirmed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The activity of quercetin on the proliferation of endothelial cells was stronger than that on A549, BEL-7402, MKN-45 tumor cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells. The chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay revealed that addition of quercetin displayed an antiangiogenic effect in vivo. After exposure to quercetin, a decrease in the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2, which is involved in the angiogenic process of migration, invasion, and tube formation, was observed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gelatin zymography. These findings suggest that quercetin has antiangiogenic potential and that this effect may be related to an influence on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Cell phenotype was examined by karyotyping, immunostaining, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. A nested PCR protocol using primers specific for human SRY genes was designed to detect hEMSCPC-derived cells in female chimeric mice. FISH was used to validate the results of nested PCR. Results indicated that hEMSCPCs were derived from epidermis but were distinct from epidermal cells; they resembled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) morphologically and expressed the main markers of MSCs. About half of all female offspring of mice implanted with embryos injected with hEMSCPCs at the blastocyst stage harbored the human Y chromosome and tissue-specific human protein, thereby demonstrating the transdifferentiation of hEMSCPCs.

11144220863	Pseudolaric acid B inhibits angiogenesis and reduces hypoxia-inducible factor 1α by promoting proteasome-mediated degradation	Purpose: Pseudolaric acid B (PAB), the naturally occurring diterpenoid isolated from the root bark of Pseudolarix kaempferi Gordon tree (Pinaceae), possesses potent antifungal and pregnancy-terminating effects that may be tightly associated with angiogenesis. This study was to examine its angiogenic inhibition, impact on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion from tumor cells and the possible mechanism of action. Experimental Design: Angiogenesis inhibition was assessed by the human umbilical vascular endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube-formation assays, as well as the chorioallantoic membrane assay. ELISA, reverse transcription-PCR, and Western blotting analyses were performed to examine VEGF protein secretion, inRNA expression, and the possible mechanism in hypoxic MBA-MB-468 cells. Results: PAB displayed potent in vitro antiangiogenic activity shown by inhibiting VEGF-stimulated proliferation and migration and fetal bovine serum-stimulated tube formation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, PAB (10 nmol per egg) significantly suppressed in vivo angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. On the other hand, PAB abrogated hypoxia-indaced VEGF secretion from MDA-MB-468 cells via reducing HIF-1α protein. Additional analyses using LY294002 and U0126 indicated that the increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)α protein level was highly dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activities in hypoxic MDA-MB-468 cells. However, PAB treatment did not affect the active (phosphorylated) forms of Akt and Erk. Interestingly, the selective proteasome inhibitor MG-132 completely reversed the reduction of HIF-1α protein in the PAB-treated MDA-MB-468 cells. Conclusions: PAB displays the dual antiangiogenic activities of directly inhibiting endothelial cells and abrogating paracrine stimulation of VEGF from tumor cells due to reducing HIF-1α protein by promoting its proteasome-mediated degradation in MDA-MB-468 cells, which has potential clinical relevance.
