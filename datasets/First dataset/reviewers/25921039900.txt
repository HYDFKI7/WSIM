1542783190	Speech Enhancement Using Perceptual Wavelet Packet Decomposition and Teager Energy Operator	It has been shown in the literature that the perceptual wavelet packet decomposition (PWPD) and the Teager energy operator (TEO) are useful for various speech processing systems and speech enhancement applications, respectively. By the use of the PWPD and the TEO, this paper presents an improved wavelet-based speech enhancement method. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the over thresholding of speech segments which is usually occurred in conventional wavelet-based speech enhancement schemes can be avoided. As a consequence, the enhanced speech quality of the proposed method can be increased substantially from those of conventional approaches. In addition, the proposed method does not require a complicated estimation of the noise level or any knowledge of the SNR. Using speech signals corrupted by additive and real noises, experimental results demonstrate that the speech enhancement method presented in this paper is capable of outperforming conventional noise cancellation schemes.

0032638027	C/V segmentation algorithm for Mandarin speech signal based on wavelet transforms	This paper proposes a new consonant/vowel (CN) segmentation algorithm for Mandarin speech signal. Since the Mandarin phoneme structure is a combination of a consonant (may be null) followed by a vowel, the C/V segmentation is an important part in the Mandarin speech recognition system.

The product function is generated from the appropriate wavelet and scaling coefficients of input speech signal, and it can be applied to indicate the C/V segmentation point. With this product function and the additional verification of energy profile, the C/V segmentation point can be accurately pointed out with a low computation complexity. Experiments are provided that demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. An overall accuracy rate of 97.2% is achieved.

30644476408	An adaptive wavelet-based deblocking algorithm for MPEG-4 codec	This paper proposed an adaptive wavelet-based deblocking algorithm for MPEG-4 video coding standard. The novelty of this method is that the deblocking filter uses a wavelet-based threshold to detect and analyze artifacts on coded block boundaries. This threshold value is based on the difference between the wavelet transform coefficients of image blocks and the coefficients of the entire image. Therefore, the threshold value is made adaptive to different images and characteristics of blocking artifacts. Then one can attenuate those artifacts by applying a selected filter based on the above threshold value. It is shown in this paper that the proposed method is robust, fast, and works remarkably well for MPEG-4 codec at low bit rates. Another advantage of the new method is that it retains sharp features in the decoded frames since it only removes artifacts. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a significantly improved visual quality and increase the PSNR in the decoded video frame.

The first step of this new VAD algorithm is to make use of the PWPT to decompose the input speech into 17 critical subband signals. To enhance energy of voice frames and decay energy of unvoice frames, the voice activity shape (VAS) will be derived from the Teager energy operator (TEO) of these critical subband signals. Then the adaptive weighted threshold (AWT) value can be calculated from the second derivative recursive mean (SDRM) of the VAS and environments noise estimation. It is shown in this paper that the AWT is a robust threshold value for VAD under various noisy environments.

84866624425	A study of station platform security using digital image processing technology	The rail transport systems, including railway, MRT, and latest high speed rail, all play a major role in Taiwan public transit circuits. According to statistics, over 2,360,000 passengers use these railway systems every day. Therefore, how to strengthen the safety and security of station platform has become an important issue in recent years. The traditional way to perform station platform security is by the use of monitoring equipment, e.g., CCD and DVR, to record the passengers' behavior on the platform. The main drawback of such a system is that it just could record the video frames and can not provide warning message to passenger immediately. Hence, this paper proposed a novel method that could detect the passenger moving direction without using additional passenger detection equipment. First, the proposed method extracts the motion vectors from the digital compressed video files, e.g., MPEG-4 or H.264, and then uses these motion vectors to determine whether passenger is approaching railway. Once passenger is too approaching railway, the proposed method will notify the passenger via broadcasting or speech message to increase the safety on the platform. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively identify the motion direction of passenger on the platforms, and can successfully start the broadcasting warning system when passenger is too approaching railway. © 2012 IEEE.

70350418253	An enhanced wavelet-based scheme for near lossless satellite image compression	An enhanced wavelet-based compression scheme for satellite image is proposed in this paper. The Consultative Committee for Space Data System (CCSDS) presented a recommendation which utilizes the wavelet transform and the bit plane coder for satellite image compression. The bit plane coder used in the CCSDS recommendation encodes the coefficient block of bit planes one by one and then truncates the unnecessary bit plane coefficient blocks. By this way, the contexts of bit planes are not considered as the redundancy embedded data which may be compressed further. The proposed scheme uses a bit plane extractor to parse the differences of the original image data and its wavelet transformed coefficients. The output of bit plane extractor will be encoded by a run-length coder and will be sent to the communication channel with the CCSDS compressed data. Comparing with the recommendation of CCSDS, under a reasonable complexity, the subjective quality of the image will maintained or even better. In addition, the bit-rate can be further decreased from 85% to 95% of the CCSDS image compression recommendation at the similar objective quality level. By using the lower bit rate lossy mode compression and bit plane compensation, it is possible to obtain lower bit rate and higher quality image than which the higher bit rate lossy mode compression can achieve. © 2009 SPIE.

77949507249	Speaker verification using line spectrum frequency, formant, and support vector machine	Speaker verification is desirable widely in many speech related applications, such as automatic telephone banking and biometric security system. This paper proposes an application of line spectrum frequency (LSF), formant, and support vector machine (SVM) to develop an algorithm of text-dependent speaker verification system. First, LSF and formant are extracted from the voiced password provided by the user. Then the proposed algorithm will make use of SVM to train the speaker characteristics from these speaker features and finally generate a claimed speaker model to discriminate between the speaker and other impostors. Experiments were conducted on the real speech signals and shown the performance of the proposed algorithm yields an equal error rate (EER) of 2.12% with 8-order LSFs and formant information. In addition, both of the false acceptance rate (FAR) and the false rejection rate (FRR) are also improved remarkably. © 2009 IEEE.

77950041461	Improved voice activity detection algorithm using wavelet and support vector machine	This paper proposes an improved voice activity detection (VAD) algorithm using wavelet and support vector machine (SVM) for European Telecommunication Standards Institution (ETSI) adaptive multi-rate (AMR) narrow-band (NB) and wide-band (WB) speech codecs. First, based on the wavelet transform, the original IIR filter bank and pitch/tone detector are implemented, respectively, via the wavelet filter bank and the wavelet-based pitch/tone detection algorithm. The wavelet filter bank can divide input speech signal into several frequency bands so that the signal power level at each sub-band can be calculated. In addition, the background noise level can be estimated in each sub-band by using the wavelet de-noising method. The wavelet filter bank is also derived to detect correlated complex signals like music. Then the proposed algorithm can apply SVM to train an optimized non-linear VAD decision rule involving the sub-band power, noise level, pitch period, tone flag, and complex signals warning flag of input speech signals. By the use of the trained SVM, the proposed VAD algorithm can produce more accurate detection results. Various experimental results carried out from the Aurora speech database with different noise conditions show that the proposed algorithm gives considerable VAD performances superior to the AMR-NB VAD Options 1 and 2, and AMR-WB VAD. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

78049261510	Simplified 2-D cubic spline interpolation scheme using direct computation algorithm	It has been shown that the 2-D cubic spline interpolation (CSI) proposed by Truong is one of the best algorithms for image resampling or compression. Such a CSI algorithm together with the image coding standard, e.g., JPEG, can be used to obtain a modified image codec while still maintaining a good quality of the reconstructed image for higher compression ratios. In this paper, a fast direct computation algorithm is developed to improve the computational efficiency of the original FFT-based 2-D CSI methods. In fact, this algorithm computes the 2-D CSI directly without explicitly calculating the complex division usually needed in the FFT or Winograd discrete Fourier transform (WDFT) algorithm. In addition, this paper describes a novel way to derivate the 2-D CSI from the 1-D CSI by using the row-column method. This new fast 2-D CSI provides a regular and simple structure based upon linear correlations. Therefore, it can be implemented by the use of a modification of Kung's pipeline structure and is naturally suitable for VLSI implementations. Experimental results show that the proposed new fast 2-D CSI algorithm can achieve almost the same CSI performance with much fewer arithmetic operations in comparison with existing efficient algorithms. © 2006 IEEE.

78650509513	The use of k-means algorithm to compute the line spectrum pair frequencies with tschirnhaus transform	This paper proposes a fast 10-order line spectrum pair (LSP) frequencies calculation method using the k-means algorithm and the Tschirnhaus transforms. The first step of the proposed method is to derive a quartic equation from the 1st derivative of the given 5-degree LSP polynomial. Then the extremes of the 5-degree LSP polynomial can be found by applying the Tschirnhaus transform to the above quartic equation. By the use of k-means algorithm, the proposed method can build up precise cosine lookup tables with the minimum memory size for Tschirnhaus transform. Finally these extremes could be used as the initial approximations to solve the roots of the 5-degree LSP polynomial via the Newton method and get the accurate LSP frequencies. One of the main advantages of the proposed method is the rapid root determination of a quartic equation without complex number operations and resulting in considerable computational saving. Compared to other methods, the proposed algorithm can determine the precise LSP frequencies with the lowest computational complexity as well as memory usage. © 2010 IEEE.

79952552026	Fast macro-block selection algorithm using 2-D haar wavelet features for H.264 video codec	This paper proposes a fast macro block selection algorithm using Haar wavelet features for H.264/AVC video codec system. The proposed algorithm makes use of the two-dimensional Haar wavelet transform to estimate the sub-band energy of each macro-block in a given video frame. Then the sub-band energy can be applied to the macro-block mode decision as a primary parameter. To prevent the error segmentation, the proposed algorithm uses the rate-distortion cost (RDcost) mechanism in the mode decision procedure. Various experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively make a macro-block mode decision under an RDcost value. Furthermore, the execution time of the proposed wavelet-based macro-block selection algorithm is faster 2∼4 times than that of the high complexity mode algorithm with the similar macro-block mode decision results. © 2010 IEEE.

79952566276	A study on speech control interface for vehicle on-board diagnostic system	This paper developed a speech controlled interface for vehicle on-board diagnostic (OBD) system. The proposed vehicle OBD system contains three parts. They are OBD embedded global position system (GPS-OBD) module, speech controlled interface, and vehicle surveillance server. The GPS-OBD module is designed to monitor the real-time location as well as operation information of vehicle. The real-time location information contains driving date, driving time, longitude, and latitude obtained from GPS receiver. In addition to these-real time location information obtained from GPS receiver, the GPS-OBD module can also record the real-time vehicle operation information, e.g., vehicle speed, engine rpm, coolant temperature, battery voltage, fault code number, and others from OBD system. Both of the real-time location and operation information will be uploaded to the vehicle surveillance server via 3.5G wireless network. At the same time, the speech controlled interface can be used to operate the GPS-OBD module. The GPS-OBD module can recognize speech commands and make proper responses in text-to-speech (TTS) format to the drivers. The derivers therefore could safely operate the proposed system without removing their eyes from the road. The vehicle surveillance server is designed to receive and record the real-time vehicle information. The authorized supervisors or servicemen can use this server to access the state of vehicle in the real time. The proposed system is very useful for the detection of vehicle pollution, warning of vehicle malfunction, remote diagnosis, and roadside repair. © 2010 IEEE.

80052378219	The use of cloud speech recognition technology in vehicle diagnosis applications	This paper developed a speech controlled interface with cloud computing technology for vehicle on-board diagnostic (OBD) system. The proposed vehicle OBD system is constructed by two parts. They are OBD embedded global position system (GPS-OBD) module and vehicle surveillance server. The speech recognition task is performed in vehicle surveillance server, instead of GPS-OBD module. The speech signal spoken by driver will be first transferred into AMR format and then submitted to the speech recognition system built in the vehicle surveillance server via 3.5G wireless network. The proposed system can directly extract the speech features from AMR bit stream and carries out accurate speech recognition results. Meanwhile, the vehicle equipped with GPS-OBD module will consistently report its OBD-II data and GPS coordinates to the vehicle surveillance server. Hence, one can use the speech controlled interface to access vehicle operation information, e.g., vehicle location, vehicle speed, engine rpm, coolant temperature, fault code number, and others from GSP and OBD. The main advantage of the proposed system is that users do not need to install any speech recognition software in their GPS-OBD module before using the proposed cloud speech controlled interface. This will also benefit the cost and size reduction of the GPS-OBD module. The derivers could operate the proposed system without removing their eyes from the road and increase driving safety. © 2011 IEEE.

84862942423	Vision-based distance estimation for multiple vehicles using single optical camera	This paper presents a novel algorithm which can be applied in the telematic systems to detect the multiple vehicles distances. The characteristic of the proposed algorithm is that it only makes use of a single optical camera to capture images of vehicles and without using other auxiliary equipment. The working principle of the proposed algorithm is to use width of the license plate as the known information, and then calculate the pixel size of the license plate appeared in the CCD image. The extraction of the license plate region is performed by the image processing software. This paper derives a distance-pixel relation equation from the evaluation CCD images with known vehicles distances. After a simple mathematical operation, one can immediately obtain the distance information of multiple vehicles within the CCD image using the distance-pixel relation equation. This distance measure method can display the individual distance of multiple vehicles located at difference positions. Moreover, in comparison with other traditional methods, the overall structure of the proposed algorithm is quite simple. It just requires only a camera with a data processor and is very applicable in telematic systems. © 2011 IEEE.

84879865403	A division-free algorithm for fixed-point power exponential function in embedded system	This work presents a division-free algorithm for fixed-point power exponential function (PEF) using Newton's method. Such a mechanism can improve the computational speed of PEF and is suitable for low-cost embedded systems without floating-point units (FPU). To achieve the goal, this work develops a fast square method to effectively describe a PEF in the form of multiplicative representation. Such representation can be separated into integer and fraction parts. For computing the base term of fraction part in fast square method, a division-free Newton's method is proposed in this paper. The proposed one utilizes two-stage iterations to modify the conventional solving strategy to reduce iteration times when the exponential term is positive. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the execution period about 1.8 times than the baseline one. Additionally, the performance of the proposed algorithm can reach five times higher than that of the system using a floating architecture.

84883339946	High-efficient hardware design based on enhanced Tschirnhaus transform for solving the LSPs	This work presents a novel hardware design based on the enhanced Tschirnhaus transform (ETT) to solve the 8-order line spectral pairs (LSPs). To reduce high-complexity problems caused by fractional multiplication, the ETT is proposed to replace such operations with integer-based shift and addition operations of the original Tschirnhaus transform. Also, the data dependency graph (DDG) of the ETT is analyzed for designing hardware units and reducing computation cycles. The proposed hardware has two key blocks: The mixture computation unit (MCU) and the multiplier-free pipelined square-root unit (PSRU). The first block is designed to fast calculate multiplication and summation operations in the ETT with the use of a two-stage pipeline architecture. The second is developed to speed up square-root operations after 8-order LSPs are decomposed into two 4-order LSPs. It can also timely process the result of the first block within limited cycles. The experimental results show that compared with the Chebyshev-based research, the proposed hardware can reduce the cycle times by 98.1% and also saved about 49.7% of gate counts. In the precision evaluation, the result indicates that 95% of the computation errors are within 0.02 and proves that the proposed hardware is capable of quantizing LSPs almost as accurately as computers do. Such results reveal that the proposed work is superior to the other Chebyshev-based methods, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed design. © 2013 IEEE.

0042062339	Subtitle enhancement in MPEG-4 for very low bit rate streaming video	This paper develops a bit-plane coding technique to achieve the subtitle enhancement in MPEG-4 for very low bit rate streaming video. The original video frame that contains subtitle information is encoded by the use of MPEG-4 codec and then the MPEG-4 decoded Y frame is subtracted from the original one to generate a residue. Because the subtitle information usually appears on the special region of a video frame, one can pre-set the position of the subtitle region and just process this residue subtitle region for subtitle enhancement. The pixel value of the residue subtitle region will be transferred from decimal number to binary number. Thus one can obtain 8 bit-planes of the residue subtitle region. For each bit-plane, (RUN, EOP) symbols are formed and then encoded via the variable length coding to produce the output bitstream. It has been shown that such a bit-plane coding technique is very efficient and its decoding procedure can be easily performed. From various experimental results, using MSB, MSB-1 and MSB-2 planes can obtain a satisfied subtitle visual enhancement with only increasing 5% bit rate.
