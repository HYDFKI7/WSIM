80052684173	Analysis of polishing errors by tool paths and optimization of tool paths	To solve the problem that the inerratic tool paths will bring the iterative errors between path and path to polished optical components, a new polishing tool path which is named random tool path is proposed. The way of random tool path polishing is carried out as follows. Firstly, the orders of polishing positions and polishing paths are created by random tool path algorithm after the polishing positions of optical components are discretized. Secondly, the dwell times can be figured out from error distributions and material removal function. However, the actual dwell times are not the calculated values because the random polishing paths will affect the dwell times when each path scans through some polishing positions. So the next step is that the actual dwell times are computed by the offset method, and numerical control codes are produced with actual dwell times. Finally, the polishing process is performed in numerical control polishing machine. The experimental results show that the way of random tool path is disordered, and the disorder can make the iterative errors between path and path distribute equally, which can reduce the error on optical mirrors and improve the roughness.

79952725263	Research of errors analysis and material removal stability in fluid jet polishing	Experiments is designed to research the instability of fluid jet polishing system. The results show that the material removal shape is dissymmetrical, and the material removal ratio is fluctuating with different polishing regions even on the same polishing condition. Then the influence factors of the instability is analyzed, such as pressure fluctuation, abrasive particles deposition, turbulent intensity and so on. The fluctuation of those error factors are acquired from experiments and simulation. Based on these data, the uncertainty is established for material removal ratio, showing that the theoretical uncertainty accords with the experiments' error. Polishing precision can be improved by error factors' compensation.

79957742283	Comparative experimental study on absolute measurement of spherical surface with two-sphere method	The two-sphere method with multiple confocal measurements and a cats-eye measurement is used widely in high accuracy interferometry, which can obtain the absolute surface data of the tested spherical surface. We provide a comparative experimental study on absolute testing procedures for spherical surface with two-sphere method, which include the classical Jensen method with three position measurements, the Zygo method with five position measurements and a variant of the Jensen method. The variant of the Jensen method can combine the multiple three-position measurements based on the fiducial method and averaging method. The repeatability of the involved absolute measurement methods is also studied by the five set experiments, and the corresponding Zernike fitting coefficients are compared in detail. The experimental results are meaningful for implementation of two-sphere method with higher repeatability in practice. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79959715380	Influence of standoff distance on material removal function in fluid jet polishing	The behavior and mechanism of material removal influences of standoff distance were studied with fluid jet polishing experiments. There were two main effects due to standoff distance: material removal rate and removal region, and the effect of standoff distance on the removal rate in impinging region was different from that in wall jet region. In order to comprehend the relation between standoff distance and material removal, the removal mechanism and correlative theory were analyzed, and two functions with the standoff distance were established for impinging region's and wall jet region's material removal by adopting a correctional factor. The results show that the theoretical removal functions are in line with experiments data. Then the material removal distribution function is revised.

80053263988	Study on submerged jet problem of concave optics surface in fluid jet polishing	Fluid jet polishing (FJP) is a computer controlled polishing (CCP) process. As the water effect of concave optics surface, the slurry won't spread immediately until component have a basinful, and jet goes through a layer of slurry firstly before impact in FJP process, the submerged jet will influence material removal rate and bring on inaccurate fabrication results if it is not considered. In this paper, submerged jet characteristics are studied, and researches were taken for submerged jet polishing by simulation with FLUENT software and experiments analysis. Based on that, mathematical material removal correction with submerged depth is established for semi-submerged jet polishing. A BK7 concave surface was polished by semi-submerged jet with removal correction. The results show an affirmative proof for correction in submerged jet polishing. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

82755195596	Ultra-precision figuring using submerged jet polishing	A new removal optimization method called submerged jet polishing (SJP) is reported. Experiments are conducted to obtain the removal shape. Results of SJP indicate that a Gaussian shape removal function can be obtained and that the removal rate is sensitive to variations in the standoff distance. SJP is applied to the corrective figuring of a BK7 optical glass. The flatness is improved from photovolatic (PV) 0.066 λ to 0.024 λ (λ=632.8 nm) after three iterations, and the root mean square (RMS) value is improved from 0.013 λ to 0.00395 λ. The experimental result indicates that SJP has a capability for ultra-precision figuring and can be applied in polishing complex-shaped surfaces. ©2011 Chinese Optics Letters.

84862911182	Ring source technology based on spatial coherence control	A new method of generating ring source by binary grating is described, and the radius and thickness of the source ring can be changed dynamically in either continuous or stepwise fashion. The reason for which the ring source can reduce the coherent noise is given. The relation of the ring source's radius and cavity length with interferogram contrast is deduced. Comparative experiments with the traditional point source show that, the ring source can suppress coherent noises effectively and preserve the fringe contrast. The system intrinsic noise in ring source pattern is less than that in point source one and there is no Newton ring in the phase map in evidence.

84862962409	High accuracy algorithm for calculating best fitting sphere of high-order aspheric surface	A high accuracy algorithm based on one dimensional search which is used for calculating the BFS (best fitting sphere) of high-order optical aspheric surface is proposed, according to the geometric property between the aspheric surface and its BFS. This method can be used to calculate the radius and the center location of the BFS and the asphericity for conicoid and high-order aspheric surface (including concave and convex surfaces). The analysis of calculation examples shows that, this method can reduce the maximum asphericity from 500.8 μm to 30 μm for high-order aspheric surface, and it can get the same asphericity for conicoid compared to other methods. In addition, it can get better BFS than other methods when used for high-order aspheric surface, and its fast speed and high accuracy make it suitable for calculating the BFS for aspheric surface of any order.

84865825172	Multivariate statistical model between stressed-lap surface displacements and driving forces	In order to ensure the fitting of stressed-lap and optical elements with aspheric surface with different local position in real time, regression analysis is used to analyze the changing rule between stressed-lap surface displacements and driving forces. The relationship between stressed-lap surface displacements and driving forces was formulated as a multivariate regression model. The surface displacements of a stressed-lap are modeled as a function of driving forces. The regression coefficients of the model are determined by using the least-squares method. The surface displacements can therefore be calculated quickly based on arbitrary given driving forces. At the same time, the multivariate regression model between driving forces and stressed-lap surface displacements is also proposed in this paper. The solution method is similar to the former model. The driving forces are also quickly calculated based on arbitrary given surface displacements. The proposed models are used to a 420 mm diameter stressed-lap with 12 motors and 60 macro-movement sensors. The case studies show that the results are very close to testing values, and indicate that the proposed models have the accuracy and feasibility.

Since it is a linear model. There are difficulties such as long period in determining processing parameters, low accuracy and large cost etc. in applications. For this reason an intelligent control model-a modified adaptive fuzzy control model with self-training function and capability of fully using expert language information and data information is proposed. If we use this model in polishing period, the P-V values of surface shape are reduced by a factor of 3.

84875549051	Rigidity controllable polishing tool based on Magnetorheological effect	A stable and predictable material removal function (MRF) plays a crucial role in computer controlled optical surfacing (CCOS). For physical contact polishing case, the stability of MRF depends on intimate contact between polishing interface and workpiece. Rigid laps maintain this function in polishing spherical surfaces, whose curvature has no variation with the position on the surface. Such rigid laps provide smoothing effect for mid-spatial frequency errors, but can't be used in aspherical surfaces for they will destroy the surface figure. Flexible tools such as magnetorheological fluid or air bonnet conform to the surface [1]. They lack rigidity and provide little natural smoothing effect. We present a rigidity controllable polishing tool that uses a kind of magnetorheological elastomers (MRE) medium [2]. It provides the ability of both conforming to the aspheric surface and maintaining natural smoothing effect. What's more, its rigidity can be controlled by the magnetic field. This paper will present the design, analysis, and stiffness variation mechanism model of such polishing tool [3]. © 2012 SPIE.

84875586861	Experimental study on virtual spatially extended source	One of the most important factor in influencing interferometer measurement accuracy is coherent noise.To improve measurement accuracy, the coherent noise of interferometric system should be reduced effectively. A new method of generating virtually extended source is described in this paper, which can suppress coherent noise effectively and verified by experiment. Experiments of comparing with traditional point source show that the virtually extended source can suppress coherent noise effectively and preserve the fringe contrast. There is no Newton rings in the phase map in evidence. The experiments show the wedge angle to be chosen between 8 minutes and 17minutes for a better results. The final measurement about surface profile show the method with virtually extended source has lower RMS value. © 2012 SPIE.

With a new procedure to measure the rotationally asymmetric component and an iterative algorithm to calculate the symmetric component, the method can calibrate the spherical reference surface with high accuracy.

84882935429	Simple and rapid data-reduction method with pixel-level spatial frequency of shift-rotation method	Absolute testing methods are commonly employed in surface metrology to calibrate the reference surface deviation and obtain the absolute deviation of the surface under test. A simple and reliable datareduction method of absolute shift-rotation method with rotational and translational measurements is presented here, which relies on the decomposition of the surface deviation into rotationally asymmetric and symmetric components. The rotationally asymmetric surface deviation can be simply obtained by classical N-position averaging method. After that, the two-dimensional problem of estimating the other rotationally symmetric surface deviation can be simplified to a one-dimensional problem, and it can be directly calculated out with pixel-level spatial frequency based on several measurements of different translations in one same direction. Since that no orthogonal polynomials fitting, such as Zernike polynomials, is required in the calculation, the data reduction of the method is simple and rapid. Experimental absolute results of spherical surfaces are given. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84886927884	Optimized absolute testing method of shift-rotation	The absolute testing method of shift-rotation that combines the traditional N-position method and Zernike polynomial fitting has been commonly employed in surface metrology. It preserves the high spatial frequency of the surface deviation with the N-position method to obtain the rotationally asymmetric surface deviation, but it suffers the kN? order angular terms errors missed by the N-position method when it calculates the rotationally symmetric surface deviation with the Zernike rotationally symmetric polynomial fitting method. An optimized absolute testing method of shift-rotation is presented in this paper. It considers the missing kN? order errors when the equations of the rotationally symmetric surface deviation are solved. As a result, it is more accurate than the traditional method.

The global optimized shift-rotation method can obtain the surface deviation accurately of both the reference and test surfaces in terms of Zernike polynomials. Experiments have been implemented to verify the validity of the absolute calibration, and the results show that the reference surface deviation agrees well with the calibration result of conventional two-sphere method.

84887109978	Absolute interferometric shift-rotation method with pixel-level spatial frequency resolution	Absolute interferometric testing method of shift-rotation in a Fizeau interferometer is effective in optical surface metrology with high accuracy and has been developed for decades. A pixel-level spatial frequency solution of interferometric shift-rotation method is presented in the manuscript. It requires a 90 rotational measurement and at least two translational measurements with different translations in the x and y directions besides a measurement at an original confocal position (0). With the well-organized absolute procedures, the absolute surface deviation of the test and reference surface can be obtained accurately with pixel-level spatial frequency resolution. As a result, the absolute results of the method contain much more mid-to high spatial frequency information and it is useful to directly detect the defects (dusts, pits) of the test and reference surfaces. No orthogonal polynomials fitting (such as Zernike polynomials) and interpolations are required in the calculation, and the absolute results can be guaranteed with high accuracy. Experimental absolute results of flat surfaces are given. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84887214092	Study on active lap tool influence function in grinding 1.8 m primary mirror	We present a theoretical modeling method to predict the ring tool influence function (TIF) based on the computer-controlled active lap process. The gap on the lap-grinding layer is considered, and its influence on the ring TIF is analyzed too. The relationship between the shape of the ring TIF and the lap-workpiece rotation speed ratio is discussed in this paper. The recipe for calculating dwell time for axisymmetric fabrication is discussed. The grinding process of a 1.8 m primary mirror is improved based on these results. The grinding process is accomplished after 30 circles of grinding, and the surface shape error is from PV 82 μm RMS 16.4 μm reduced to PV 13.5 μm RMS 2.5 μm. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84899841219	Edge effect modeling and experiments on active lap processing	Edge effect is regarded as one of the most difficult technical issues for fabricating large primary mirrors, especially for large polishing tools. Computer controlled active lap (CCAL) uses a large size pad (e.g., 1/3 to 1/5 workpiece diameters) to grind and polish the primary mirror. Edge effect also exists in the CCAL process in our previous fabrication. In this paper the material removal rules when edge effects happen (i.e. edge tool influence functions (TIFs)) are obtained through experiments, which are carried out on a F1090-mm circular flat mirror with a 375-mm-diameter lap. Two methods are proposed to model the edge TIFs for CCAL. One is adopting the pressure distribution which is calculated based on the finite element analysis method. The other is building up a parametric equivalent pressure model to fit the removed material curve directly. Experimental results show that these two methods both effectively model the edge TIF of CCAL. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84902096182	Removal effects of waterjet particle impinging in ductile manner	For process of optical components having defects such as sharp projections, pits and scratches at the micro, abrasive waterjet impinging with low mass concentrations is proposed. Starting from the elastic contact, the critical velocity of plastic contact between components and waterjet particles is deduced. The critical impinging velocity of ductile to brittle transfer is introduced. Thus the velocity range of the ductile removal is clearly defined. Combined with specific parameters, K9 and fused silica's velocity range of the ductile removal are simulated. Using the single particle impinging removal model, these two materials' impinging removal in ductile removal manner is simulated. The results show that the critical velocity of plastic contact for fused silica is higher than K9's, but the velocity of ductile to brittle transfer is reversed. Thus, the velocity range of ductile removal for fused silica is a subinterval of that for K9. The impinging removal of these two materials increases with the increase of impinging velocity. However, the harder fused silica is less resistant to impinging than K9 and it is easier to be removed by impinging.

84922803903	Improvement of active lap processing in grinding of 1.8m primary mirror	The computer controlled active lap (CCAL) is used to grind a 1.8m honeycomb primary mirror. One problem which is not totally solved by CCAL is the edge effect, also exists in many other fabricating methods. To reduce the CCAL edge effect, the pressure distribution on the contact face between lap and mirror is analyzed by finite element method (FEM). A new method is proposed to calculate the pressure curve from FEM results. A simplified model is used to approximate the pressure curve along the mirror radius when active lap covers the mirror center hole. The const-linear (C-L) model is used to describe the pressure curve when active lap overhang at the mirror out edge. The contact status between lap and mirror is also considered in this paper, and its influence is taken into the material removal rate calculation. The API's T3 laser tracker is used to measure the mirror surface shape and to check the correctness of the theoretical model. The results that we have got by now and the problems that still exist are reported in this paper.

84922880673	A sampling method to measure surface roughness of circular flat	We propose a sampling method to measure surface roughness of circular flat in this paper. The steps of this method are described in following. First, the number of sampling points is determined based on the radius of the circular flat; then the sampling points are selected by a certain angle in helical line; at last we use instrument like white light interferometer to measure the surface roughness of these sample points. The sampling method can effectively use the surface roughness of sampling points to estimate the surface roughness of the overall optical surface. According to mathematic derivation and simulation analysis, this method has a good sampling results, thus it can be widely used to measure the surface roughness of the circular flat.
