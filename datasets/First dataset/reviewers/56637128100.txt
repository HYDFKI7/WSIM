84934895159	Secure access control and large scale robust representation for online multimedia event detection	We developed an online multimedia event detection (MED) system. However, there are a secure access control issue and a large scale robust representation issue when we want to integrate traditional event detection algorithms into the online environment. For the first issue, we proposed a tree proxy-based and service-oriented access control (TPSAC) model based on the traditional role based access control model. Verification experiments were conducted on the CloudSim simulation platform, and the results showed that the TPSAC model is suitable for the access control of dynamic online environments. For the second issue, inspired by the object-bank scene descriptor, we proposed a 1000-object-bank (1000OBK) event descriptor. Feature vectors of the 1000OBK were extracted from response pyramids of 1000 generic object detectors which were trained on standard annotated image datasets, such as the ImageNet dataset. A spatial bag of words tiling approach was then adopted to encode these feature vectors for bridging the gap between the objects and events. Furthermore, we performed experiments in the context of event classification on the challenging TRECVID MED 2012 dataset, and the results showed that the robust 1000OBK event descriptor outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

33646946218	Blind mimo channel estimation using space time block code	Channel estimation is one of the key issues in space-time systems design. In this paper we propose a blind estimation algorithm solely based on exploiting the code construction of the space-time block code. Subspace decomposition is applied to the channel output and we show that if the signal subspace is uniquely decided by the channel, then the channel parameter can be uniquely estimated up a scalar constant. The proposed algorithm is derived based on a general form of space-time block code and therefore may be applicable for any block code.

33846592415	A multi-granular-based fuzzy adaptive controller	The accuracy and complexity of fuzzy control systems are problems worthy of study deeply. The high accuracy of control means that the controlled variables will have to be represented at fine granularity which increases the complexity of controller. To attain the prescribed accuracy in reducing control complexity, a multi-granular fuzzy adaptive controller is proposed which represents the process of reaching goal at different spaces of the information granularity. When the prescribed accuracy is low, a coarse fuzzy controller can be used. As the process moves from high level to low level, the prescribed accuracy becomes higher and the information granularity to fuzzy controller becomes finer. In this controller, a rough plan is generated to reach the final goal firstly. Then, the plan is decomposed to many sub-goals which are submitted to the next lower level of hierarchy. And the more refined plans to reach these sub-goals are determined. If needed, this process of successive refinement continues until the final prescribed accuracy is obtained. In addition, the methods are presented to determine the depth of levels and the number of granules in each level. Finally, the simulation results of double inverted pendulum indicate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

CURD (clustering using references and density) is a fast clustering algorithm based on reference and density, which can discover clusters with arbitrary shape and has the linear times complexity. However, it still has some shortcomings such as: the efficiency to deal with the high-dimensional data is uncertain, the noise processing is not ideal, besides the number of the clustering results may not satisfy the requirement of the users. According to these deficiencies, this paper introduces a new method to propose the high-dimensional data with information entropy technology and quotient space theory.

The model tried to minimize the distance between the ship and the storage blocks, and avoid shipments for multiple ships in the same block, under the condition that the number of allocated blocks equals the result of each port's experiential formula. The genetic algorithm was used to solve this problem. The encoding used binary encoding. The length of the chromosome was the total number of blocks in the yard. Each gene in the chromosome was expressed for the each block. The value of '1' meant that the corresponding block was allocated; '0' meant that the corresponding block wasn't allocated for the ship.

This Letter re-examines securities of Lian's cryptosystem and its improved version, by showing that not all details of the ciphered image of Lian's cryptosystem can be recovered by Rhouma et al.'s attacks due to the incorrectly recovered part of the sign-bits of the AC coefficients with an inappropriately chosen image. As a result, modifications of Rhouma et al.'s attacks are proposed in order to recover the ciphered image of Lian's cryptosystem completely; then based on the modifications, two new attacks are proposed to break the improved version of Lian's cryptosystem.

The algorithm decides the center nodes of community by using both the resistance distance and degrees of nodes; whereafter compares the resistance distance in between other nodes and center nodes for clustering the network. The experiment results show that the algorithm is stable and reliable and can accurately obtain the division of community structure. ©2012 by Binary Information Press.

84873951459	Community detection algorithm using the definition of community	On the basis of discussing the definitions of community in complex network, a new method is to put forward for the community detection. This method initially marks all nodes as unvisited, and then searches these unvisited nodes and seeks some so-called strong structures made up of a core node with a maximal degree and most of its neighbors, and marks them as visited. Subsequently the unvisited nodes are assigned to different strong structures according to some criteria. At last the existing strong structures are perhaps optimized and then different communities generate. The experiment results show that the algorithm is stable and reliable and can accurately obtain the division of community structure. In addition, the algorithm is fast and its time complexity is approximately O(n+m). © 2012 IEEE.

84874528961	Study and analysis on identification method of power flow transferring	Two kinds of methods to identify power flow transferring, namely estimating line current based on compensation with add-on current source and estimating line active power flow based on DC power flow distribution factor, which are currently mentioned in existing references, are analyzed in depth. Through further arrangement of the calculation formula for power flow transferring factor, it is discovered that under the premise of ignoring branch resistances the calculation formula for power flow transferring factor is the same as that for distribution coefficient of power flow transferring, and the correctness of this conclusion is verified by simulation results of IEEE 10-machine 39-bus system. Simulation of power flow transferring is performed and the estimation errors of above-mentioned two estimation methods are analyzed. It is pointed out that the reason causing higher error of estimated current error lies in that the variation of reactive power injected at generator nodes is ignored during the calculation, and to improve the judgment reliability of line active power flow estimation based on DC power flow distribution factor an auxiliary criterion is proposed.

84880055276	Embedding change rate estimation based on ensemble learning	In order to achieve higher estimation accuracy of the embedding change rate of a stego object, an ensemble learning-based estimation method is presented. First of all, a framework of embedding change rate estimation based on estimator ensemble is proposed. Then an algorithm of building the estimator ensemble, the core of the framework, is concretely described. Finally, a pruning method for estimator ensemble is proposed in consideration of both the diversity among the base estimators and accuracy of each of them. The experimental results for three modern steganographic algorithms (nsF5, PQ and PQt) indicate that the proposed method acquired better performance than the existed typical method. Furthermore, the pruned estimator ensemble with less base estimators maintained, even slightly improved the estimation accuracy, compared to the one without purning. © 2013 ACM.

84886621097	A power flow transfer identification scheme based on WAMS	In the power system, power flow transfer can cause emergency overload or the maloperation of zone IIIdistance relays, and this is one of the main factors causing cascading trips and eventual blackout. Taking advantages of wide area measurement system (WAMS), the paper proposed a power flow transfer identification scheme. According to the differences of three-phase current increments and zero-sequence current, asymmetric faults on transmission lines and overload can be distinguished. According to the voltage amplitude, symmetric faults and overload can be distinguished. And corresponding identification criterions were given. Taking into account the effect of system oscillation and the overload condition after faults, the practical strategies of power flow transfer identification was proposed and its implementation process was given. The strategy can effectively prevent zone IIIdistance protection from maloperation for overload conditions and reliably unblock it for faults. Through the simulation of New England 10-machine 39-bus system, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was verified.

84888332076	Fuzzy control of a double inverted pendulum based on hyper topology space	The control of double-inverted pendulum is one of the most difficult control problems, especially for the control of parallel-type one, because of the high complexity of control systems. To attain the prescribed accuracy in reducing control complexity, a new fuzzy controller for stabilizing a double inverted pendulum system is presented based on the model of hyper topology space. It is a universal multi-granular fuzzy adaptive controller which represents the process of reaching goal at different spaces of the information granularity. When the prescribed accuracy is low, a coarse fuzzy controller can be used. As the process moves from high level to low level, the prescribed accuracy becomes higher and the information granularity to fuzzy controller becomes finer. In this controller, a rough plan is generated to reach the final goal firstly. Then, the plan is decomposed to many sub-goals which are submitted to the next lower level of hierarchy. And the more refined plans to reach these sub-goals are determined. If needed, this process of successive refinement continues until the final prescribed accuracy is obtained. Analysis and design of the fuzzy controller is discussed. Finally, simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

84888380269	A multi-granular fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method	The comprehensive evaluations of complex systems are worthy of study deeply, and the subjectivity and fuzziness of evaluation objects further increase complexity of the evaluation systems. To attain the final comprehensive evaluation result in reducing evaluation difficulties, a multi-granular fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is proposed, which is a top-down method for the multi-layer evaluation index system and represents the process of reaching goal at different spaces of the information granularity basing on the theory of hyper topology space. At first, a rough evaluation plan is generated to reach the final goal. Then, the plan is decomposed to many sub-goals which are submitted to the next lower layer of the index hierarchy and the more refined evaluation plans to reach these sub-goals are determined. As the evaluation process moves from high layer to low layer, the information granularity to the comprehensive evaluation becomes finer. This process of successive refinement continues until the final evaluation result is obtained. If only possible, the evaluation work will be finished depending on the part of index hierarchy, and it is not necessary to do the calculations for all the indexes. Finally, the practical applications indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84893903686	A TPSAC model and its application to mechanical cloud simulation	As a further development of the simulation grid, the cloud simulation platform is a new kind of network modeling as well as simulation platforms, and one of the hottest research directions in the cloud computing. While brings about the users with a lot of convenience, the cloud simulation shows also many severe security issues with its own characteristics, which can't be solved effectively by the traditional access control strategies. According to the traditional role based access control(RBAC) model, this paper proposed a tree proxy-based and service-oriented access control(TPSAC) model. In the TPSAC model, a multilevel inherited meta permission and a multi-tree child-sibling linked list were adopted to separate the permission loading function and the permission distribution function to achieve a multi-granularity and quantized access control with the cloud simulation. A verification experiment on the CloudSim simulation platform was conducted then to demonstrate that the TPSAC model achieved the desired result. © 2014 SERSC.

84899710749	Study on adaptive and fuzzy weighted image fusion based on wavelet transform in trinocular vision of picking robot	In order to improve the adaptive recognition abilities of picking robot in complex environment, a fusion approach of trinocular vision in wavelet domain based on fuzzy reasoning weight was proposed. Firstly, membership functions of fusion rules are determined by fuzzy reasoning of picking environmental features, and membership values of fusion types are calculated according to regional energy and match degree of origin images. Based on the maximum membership degree principle, fuzzy decision is carried on to determine the fusion types and fusion weight. Secondly, the mean weighted method and regional energy feature method are adopted respectively to carry on the low frequency as well as high frequency coefficients fusion among multi-source images by using two-level 2D wavelet, and the final fusion images are attained by inverse HIS transform based on inverse wavelet transform. Four groups of experiment show that in the complex picking environment like weak illumination and strong noise, the information entropy and average gradient of fused image that obtained by using the wavelet fusion method based on fuzzy reasoning weight are higher than that of traditional mean method, pyramid algorithm and wavelet packet method, which means that the fusion effect has been improved greatly. © 2014 Binary Information Press.

A microgrid reactive power and voltage control strategy based on a multi-agent system (MAS) characterized by being self approach optimal and distributed in the island mode is proposed. By using the control method of combining the issuance of distributed energy, capacitor switching and load switching, microgrid voltage control problems in the island mode are solved. Finally, simulation verification shows that the method can effectively regulate the bus voltage of the control system and reactive power output of micro sources, while maintaining stable operation of the system.
