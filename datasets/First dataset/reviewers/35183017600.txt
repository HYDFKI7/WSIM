8844238479	On the computation of space-time correlations by large-eddy simulation	The effect of subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling on velocity (space-) time correlations is investigated in decaying isotropic turbulence. The performance of several SGS models is evaluated, which shows superiority of the dynamic Smagorinsky model used in conjunction with the multiscale large-eddy simulation (LES) procedure. Compared to the results of direct numerical simulation, LES is shown to underpredict the (un-normalized) correlation magnitude and slightly overpredict the decorrelation time scales. This can lead to inaccurate solutions in applications such as aeroacoustics. The underprediction of correlation functions is particularly severe for higher wavenumber modes which are swept by the most energetic modes. The classic sweeping hypothesis for stationary turbulence is generalized for decaying turbulence and used to analyze the observed discrepancies. Based on this analysis, the time correlations are determined by the wavenumber energy spectra and the sweeping velocity, which is the square root of the total energy. Hence, an accurate prediction of the instantaneous energy spectra is most critical to the accurate computation of time correlations. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.

2442498281	Multiscale coupling in complex mechanical systems	Multiscale coupling attracts broad interests from mechanics, physics and chemistry to biology. The diversity and coupling of physics at different scales are two essential features of multiscale problems in far-from-equilibrium systems. The two features present fundamental difficulties and are great challenges to multiscale modeling and simulation. The theory of dynamical system and statistical mechanics provide fundamental tools for the multiscale coupling problems. The paper presents some closed multiscale formulations, e.g., the mapping closure approximation, multiscale large-eddy simulation and statistical mesoscopic damage mechanics, for two typical multiscale coupling problems in mechanics, that is, turbulence in fluids and failure in solids. It is pointed that developing a tractable, closed nonequilibrium statistical theory may be an effective approach to deal with the multiscale coupling problems. Some common characteristics of the statistical theory are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33646859003	Elliptic model for space-time correlations in turbulent shear flows	An elliptic model for space-time correlations in turbulent shear flows is proposed based on a second order approximation to the iso-correlation contours, while Taylor's hypothesis implies a first-order approximation. It is shown that the space-time correlations are mainly determined by their space correlations and the convection and sweeping velocities. This model accommodates two extreme cases: Taylor's hypothesis at vanishing sweeping velocity and the sweeping hypothesis at vanishing convection velocity. The result is supported by the data from the direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The secondary EOFs are analyzed by solving the Stokes equation with heterogeneous slip velocity boundary conditions. The analytical results obtained are compared with the direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. The secondary EOFs could transport scalar in larger areas and increase the scalar gradients, which significantly improve the mixing rate of scalars. It is shown that the heterogeneous zeta potentials could generate complex flow patterns and be used to enhance scalar mixing.

33748709671	Statistics of conditionally filtered dissipation and diffusion in large eddy simulation	In the large eddy simulation of turbulent reacting flows, the filtered reaction terms are unclosed. It is difficult to construct the subgrid scale (SGS) model for filtered reaction terms due to the absence of a universal energy cascade process, which is the foundation of SGS models in fluid turbulence. With the conditional filter approach, the SGS models for conditionally filtered reaction terms can be closed, but the conditional diffusion and dissipation have to be modeled. We use a direct numerical simulation of turbulent mixing to investigate the scale-dependence of the conditional filtered diffusion and dissipation. The results show that the conditional filtered diffusion depends on large scales, but the conditional filtered dissipation depends on both large and small scales. The effects of small scales on the conditional filtered dissipation have to be included in its SGS models.

3943104769	Multiscale coupling: Challenges and opportunities	Multiscale coupling is ubiquitous in nature and attracts broad interests of scientists from mathematicians, physicists, machinists, chemists to biologists. However, much less attention has been paid to its intrinsic implication. In this paper, multiscale coupling is introduced by studying two typical examples in classic mechanics: fluid turbulence and solid failure. The nature of multiscale coupling in the two examples lies in their physical diversities and strong coupling over wide-range scales. The theories of dynamical system and statistical mechanics provide fundamental methods for the multiscale coupling problems. The diverse multiscale couplings call for unified approaches and might expedite new concepts, theories and disciplines.

40449137641	Time correlations of pressure in isotropic turbulence	The time correlations of pressure modes in stationary isotropic turbulence are investigated under the Kraichnan and Tennekes "random sweeping" hypothesis. A simple model is obtained which predicts a universal form for the time correlations. It implies that the decorrelation process of pressure fluctuations in time is mainly dominated by the sweeping velocity, and the pressure correlations have the same decorrelation time scales as the velocity correlations. These results are verified using direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence at two moderate Reynolds numbers; the mode correlations collapse to the universal form when the time separations are scaled by wavenumber times the sweeping velocity, and the ratios of the correlation coefficients of pressure modes to those of velocity modes are approximately unity for the entire range of time separation. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

59249105523	Subgrid-scale contributions to Lagrangian time correlations in isotropic turbulence	The application of large-eddy simulation (LES) to particle-laden turbulence raises such a fundamental question as whether the LES with a subgrid scale (SGS) model can correctly predict Lagrangian time correlations (LTCs). Most of the currently existing SGS models are constructed based on the energy budget equations. Therefore, they are able to correctly predict energy spectra, but they may not ensure the correct prediction on the LTCs. Previous researches investigated the effect of the SGS modeling on the Eulerian time correlations. This paper is devoted to study the LTCs in LES. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the LES with a spectral eddy viscosity model are performed for isotropic turbulence and the LTCs are calculated using the passive vector method. Both a priori and a posteriori tests are carried out. It is observed that the subgrid-scale contributions to the LTCs cannot be simply ignored and the LES overpredicts the LTCs than the DNS. It is concluded from the straining hypothesis that an accurate prediction of enstrophy spectra is most critical to the prediction of the LTCs. © 2008 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

79951988083	An immersed boundary method based on the lattice Boltzmann approach in three dimensions, with application	The immersed boundary (IB) method originated by Peskin has been popular in modeling and simulating problems involving the interaction of a flexible structure and a viscous incompressible fluid. The NavierStokes (NS) equations in the IB method are usually solved using numerical methods such as FFT and projection methods. Here in our work, the NS equations are solved by an alternative approach, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Compared to many conventional NS solvers, the LBM can be easier to implement and more convenient for modeling additional physics in a problem. This alternative approach adds extra versatility to the immersed boundary method. In this paper we discuss the use of a 3D lattice Boltzmann model (D3Q19) within the IB method. We use this hybrid approach to simulate a viscous flow past a flexible sheet tethered at its middle line in a 3D channel and determine a drag scaling law for the sheet. Our main conclusions are: (1) the hybrid method is convergent with first-order accuracy which is consistent with the immersed boundary method in general; (2) the drag of the flexible sheet appears to scale with the inflow speed which is in sharp contrast with the square law for a rigid body in a viscous flow. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

45249101349	A pressure-correction method and its applications on an unstructured Chimera grid	In this paper, an unstructured Chimera mesh method is used to compute incompressible flow around a rotating body. To implement the pressure correction algorithm on unstructured overlapping sub-grids, a novel interpolation scheme for pressure correction is proposed. This indirect interpolation scheme can ensure a tight coupling of pressure between sub-domains. A moving-mesh finite volume approach is used to treat the rotating sub-domain and the governing equations are formulated in an inertial reference frame. Since the mesh that surrounds the rotating body undergoes only solid body rotation and the background mesh remains stationary, no mesh deformation is encountered in the computation. As a benefit from the utilization of an inertial frame, tensorial transformation for velocity is not needed. Three numerical simulations are successfully performed. They include flow over a fixed circular cylinder, flow over a rotating circular cylinder and flow over a rotating elliptic cylinder. These numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the current scheme in handling moving boundaries. The numerical results are in good agreement with experimental and computational data in literature. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

46149092993	Hybrid computations using continuum and molecular dynamics for micro-fluidics	A hybrid numerical method of particle-continuum dynamics designed for micro-fluidics is being developed which solves the Navier-Stokes equations in one domain, where the continuum description is still valid, and uses the molecular dynamics in another domain where the continuum description fails. The matching of these two descriptions can be achieved by a constrained particle dynamics in the overlap region, which exchanges the information between the molecular dynamics and the Navier- Stokes equations. However, the existing models for the constraint particle dynamics often have the empirical parameters such as the coupling parameter, the size of overlap domain and the ratio of the time steps for the molecular dynamics and the Navier-Stokes equation. In this paper, we develop a dynamic Langevin equation, and the coupling parameters in the models can be determined by the velocity consistent constraint. The dynamic scheme is used to simulate the sudden-start Couette flows with either slip or no-slip boundary conditions. The results obtained are quantitatively in agreement with the analytical solutions under the no-slip boundary condition and the full MD simulations under the certain slip boundary conditions. This agreement demonstrates the validity of the dynamic Langevin equation. © 2006 IEEE.

50849125070	Effects of subgrid-scale modeling on Lagrangian statistics in large-eddy simulation	The application of large-eddy simulation (LES) to turbulent transport processes requires accurate prediction of the Lagrangian statistics of flow fields. However, in most existing SGS models, no explicit consideration is given to Lagrangian statistics. In this paper, we focus on the effects of SGS modeling on Lagrangian statistics in LES ranging from statistics determining single-particle dispersion to those of pair dispersion and multiparticle dispersion. Lagrangian statistics in homogeneous isotropic turbulence are extracted from direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the LES with a spectral eddy-viscosity model. For the case of longtime single-particle dispersion, it is shown that, compared to DNS, LES overpredicts the time scale of the Lagrangian velocity correlation but underpredicts the Lagrangian velocity fluctuation. These two effects tend to cancel one another leading to an accurate prediction of the longtime turbulent dispersion coefficient. Unlike the single-particle dispersion, LES tends to underestimate significantly the rate of relative dispersion of particle pairs and multiple-particles, when initial separation distances are less than the minimum resolved scale due to the lack of subgrid fluctuations. The overprediction of LES on the time scale of the Lagrangian velocity correlation is further confirmed by a theoretical analysis using a turbulence closure theory.

65649132385	Space-time correlations of fluctuating velocities in turbulent shear flows	Space-time correlations or Eulerian two-point two-time correlations of fluctuating velocities are analytically and numerically investigated in turbulent shear flows. An elliptic model for the space-time correlations in the inertial range is developed from the similarity assumptions on the isocorrelation contours: they share a uniform preference direction and a constant aspect ratio. The similarity assumptions are justified using the Kolmogorov similarity hypotheses and verified using the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flows. The model relates the space-time correlations to the space correlations via the convection and sweeping characteristic velocities. The analytical expressions for the convection and sweeping velocities are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for homogeneous turbulent shear flows, where the convection velocity is represented by the mean velocity and the sweeping velocity is the sum of the random sweeping velocity and the shear-induced velocity. This suggests that unlike Taylor's model where the convection velocity is dominating and Kraichnan and Tennekes' model where the random sweeping velocity is dominating, the decorrelation time scales of the space-time correlations in turbulent shear flows are determined by the convection velocity, the random sweeping velocity, and the shear-induced velocity. This model predicts a universal form of the space-time correlations with the two characteristic velocities. The DNS of turbulent channel flows supports the prediction: the correlation functions exhibit a fair good collapse, when plotted against the normalized space and time separations defined by the elliptic model. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

67650742134	Turbulent collision of inertial particles: Point-particle based, hybrid simulations and beyond	Point-particle based direct numerical simulation (PPDNS) has been a productive research tool for studying both single-particle and particle-pair statistics of inertial particles suspended in a turbulent carrier flow. Here we focus on its use in addressing particle-pair statistics relevant to the quantification of turbulent collision rate of inertial particles. PPDNS is particularly useful as the interaction of particles with small-scale (dissipative) turbulent motion of the carrier flow is mostly relevant. Furthermore, since the particle size may be much smaller than the Kolmogorov length of the background fluid turbulence, a large number of particles are needed to accumulate meaningful pair statistics. Starting from the relative simple Lagrangian tracking of so-called ghost particles, PPDNS has significantly advanced our theoretical understanding of the kinematic formulation of the turbulent geometric collision kernel by providing essential data on dynamic collision kernel, radial relative velocity, and radial distribution function. A recent extension of PPDNS is a hybrid direct numerical simulation (HDNS) approach in which the effect of local hydrodynamic interactions of particles is considered, allowing quantitative assessment of the enhancement of collision efficiency by fluid turbulence. Limitations and open issues in PPDNS and HDNS are discussed. Finally, on-going studies of turbulent collision of inertial particles using large-eddy simulations and particle-resolved simulations are briefly discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

67650321340	An atomistic-continuum hybrid simulation of fluid flows over superhydrophobic surfaces	Recent experiments have found that slip length could be as large as on the order of 1 μm for fluid flows over superhydrophobic surfaces. Superhydrophobic surfaces can be achieved by patterning roughness on hydrophobic surfaces. In the present paper, an atomistic-continuum hybrid approach is developed to simulate the Couette flows over superhydrophobic surfaces, in which a molecular dynamics simulation is used in a small region near the superhydrophobic surface where the continuum assumption is not valid and the Navier-Stokes equations are used in a large region for bulk flows where the continuum assumption does hold. These two descriptions are coupled using the dynamic coupling model in the overlap region to ensure momentum continuity. The hybrid simulation predicts a superhydrophobic state with large slip lengths, which cannot be obtained by molecular dynamics simulation alone. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

69049089641	A smoothing technique for discrete delta functions with application to immersed boundary method in moving boundary simulations	The effects of complex boundary conditions on flows are represented by a volume force in the immersed boundary methods. The problem with this representation is that the volume force exhibits non-physical oscillations in moving boundary simulations. A smoothing technique for discrete delta functions has been developed in this paper to suppress the non-physical oscillations in the volume forces. We have found that the non-physical oscillations are mainly due to the fact that the derivatives of the regular discrete delta functions do not satisfy certain moment conditions. It has been shown that the smoothed discrete delta functions constructed in this paper have one-order higher derivative than the regular ones. Moreover, not only the smoothed discrete delta functions satisfy the first two discrete moment conditions, but also their derivatives satisfy one-order higher moment condition than the regular ones. The smoothed discrete delta functions are tested by three test cases: a one-dimensional heat equation with a moving singular force, a two-dimensional flow past an oscillating cylinder, and the vortex-induced vibration of a cylinder. The numerical examples in these cases demonstrate that the smoothed discrete delta functions can effectively suppress the non-physical oscillations in the volume forces and improve the accuracy of the immersed boundary method with direct forcing in moving boundary simulations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

71049166317	Effects of geometric shape on the hydrodynamics of a self-propelled flapping foil	The hydrodynamics of a free flapping foil is studied numerically. The foil undergoes a forced vertical oscillation and is free to move horizontally. The effect of chord-thickness ratio is investigated by varying this parameter while fixing other ones such as the Reynolds number, the density ratio, and the flapping amplitude. Three different flow regimes have been identified when we increase the chord-thickness ratio, i.e., left-right symmetry, back-and-forth chaotic motion, and unidirectional motion with staggered vortex street. It is observed that the chord-thickness ratio can affect the symmetry-breaking bifurcation, the arrangement of vortices in the wake, and the terminal velocity of the foil. The similarity in the symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the present problem to that of a flapping body under constraint is discussed. A comparison between the dynamic behaviors of an elliptic foil and a rectangular foil at various chord-thickness ratios is also presented. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

70450241137	A delay model for noise-induced bi-directional switching	Many biological systems can switch between two distinct states. Once switched, the system remains stable for a period of time and may switch back to its original state. A gene network with bistability is usually required for the switching and stochastic effect in the gene expression may induce such switching. A typical bistable system allows one-directional switching, in which the switch from the low state to the high state or from the high state to the low state occurs under different conditions. It is usually difficult to enable bi-directional switching such that the two switches can occur under the same condition. Here, we present a model consisting of standard positive feedback loops and an extra negative feedback loop with a time delay to study its capability to produce bi-directional switching induced by noise. We find that the time delay in the negative feedback is critical for robust bi-directional switching and the length of delay affects its switching frequency. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd and London Mathematical Society.

75449084931	Scale-similarity model for Lagrangian velocity correlations in isotropic and stationary turbulence	A scale-similarity model for Lagrangian two-point, two-time velocity correlations (LVCs) in isotropic turbulence is developed from the Kolmogorov similarity hypothesis. It is a second approximation to the isocontours of LVCs, while the Smith-Hay model is only a first approximation. This model expresses the LVC by its space correlation and a dispersion velocity. We derive the analytical expression for the dispersion velocity from the Navier-Stokes equations using the quasinormality assumption. The dispersion velocity is dependent on enstrophy spectra and shown to be smaller than the sweeping velocity for the Eulerian velocity correlation. Therefore, the Lagrangian decorrelation process is slower than the Eulerian decorrelation process. The data from direct numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence support the scale-similarity model: the LVCs for different space separations collapse into a universal form when plotted against the separation axis defined by the model. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

While the present two-dimensional mathematical model is a free boundary problem, in our new numerical method, the fluid domain enclosed by the free boundary is embedded into a rectangular one so that the problem can be solved by a regular Cartesian grid method. We introduce an augmented variable along the free boundary so that the stress balancing boundary condition is satisfied. A hybrid time discretization is used in the projection method for better stability. The resultant Helmholtz/Poisson equations with interfaces then are solved by the IIM in an efficient way. Several numerical tests including an accuracy check, and the spreading and recoiling processes of a liquid drop are presented in detail. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77951012043	A kinematic subgrid scale model for large-eddy simulation of turbulence-generated sound	In the hybrid approach of large-eddy simulation (LES) and Lighthill's acoustic analogy for turbulence-generated sound, the turbulence source fields are obtained using an LES and the turbulence-generated sound at far fields is calculated from Lighthill's acoustic analogy. As only the velocity fields at resolved scales are available from the LES, the Lighthill stress tensor, serving as a source term in Lighthill's acoustic equation, has to be evaluated from the resolved velocity fields. As a result, the contribution from the unresolved velocity fields is missing in the conventional LES. The sound of missing scales is shown to be important and hence needs to be modeled. The present study proposes a kinematic subgrid-scale (SGS) model which recasts the unresolved velocity fields into Lighthill's stress tensors. A kinematic simulation is used to construct the unresolved velocity fields with the imposed temporal statistics, which is consistent with the random sweeping hypothesis. The kinematic SGS model is used to calculate sound power spectra from isotropic turbulence and yields an improved result: the missing portion of the sound power spectra is approximately recovered in the LES. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

Data from direct numerical simulation (DNS) are used as a benchmark to evaluate the LES using both a priori and a posteriori tests.

78149424236	Prediction of space-time correlations by large eddy simulation	The recently increasing application of large eddy simulation to unsteady problems [1], such as turbulence-generated sound and turbulent reacting flows, requires that large-eddy simulation (LES) with a sub-grid scale (SGS) model could accurately predict space-time correlations. Most of the currently existing SGS models are based on the energy budget equations. Therefore, they are able to correctly predict energy spectra at large scales, but they may not accurately predict other statistical quantities that are not determined fully by large-scale energy spectra, such as space-time correlations. In this paper, we will investigate the effects of SGS modeling on spacetime correlations in LES. The numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence [2, 3] and turbulence channel flows [4] show that, compared with the results of direct numerical simulation (DNS), LES under-predicts the un-normalized correlation magnitude and over-predict the decorrelation time scales. This can lead to inaccurate solutions in applications such as sound power spectra. In turbulence-generated sound, according to Lighthill's theory, the acoustic intensity radiated by turbulent flows depends on two-point, two-time correlations, or Eulerian space-time correlations. Therefore, an accurate calculation of the Eulerian space-time correlation is important to the prediction of the sound radiations. The application of space-time correlations to acoustic power in LES is also discussed. Copyright © 2008 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

78649826368	Towards large-eddy simulation of turbulent flows with complex geometric boundaries using immersed boundary method	Approximate immersed boundary conditions for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows in combination with immersed boundary method are proposed. The approximate immersed boundary conditions are based on the fluxes and the shear stresses in order to ensure the momentum conservation: the velocity boundary conditions are imposed to the convection terms and the shear stress boundary conditions imposed to the diffusion terms. On a body-fitted grid, they are exactly the same as the non-penetration and wall stress boundary conditions, for the immersed boundary method they are now the generalized off-wall boundary conditions. This strategy is tested in turbulent channel flows with the wall not being aligned with Cartesian grids. The results obtained show the promising of this strategy in simulations of high Reynolds number turbulent flows. The effects of different eddy-viscosity models used in conjunction with approximate immersed boundary conditions need to be further investigated.

However, its performance in simulating turbulent flows and transitional flows with moving boundaries has not been fully evaluated. In the present work, we use the IB method to simulate fully developed turbulent channel flows and transitional flows past a stationary/plunging SD7003 airfoil. To suppress the non-physical force oscillations in the plunging case, we use the smoothed discrete delta function for interpolation in the IB method.

0036640671	Effects of subgrid-scale modeling on time correlations in large eddy simulation	The effects of the unresolved subgrid-scale (SGS) motions on the energy balance of the resolved scales in large eddy simulation (LES) have been investigated actively because modeling the energy transfer between the resolved and unresolved scales is crucial to constructing accurate SGS models. But the subgrid scales not only modify the energy balance, they also contribute to temporal decorrelation of the resolved scales. The importance of this effect in applications including the predictability problem and the evaluation of sound radiation by turbulent flows motivates the present study of the effect of SGS modeling on turbulent time correlations. This paper compares the two-point, two-time Eulerian velocity correlation in isotropic homogeneous turbulence evaluated by direct numerical simulation (DNS) with the correlations evaluated by LES using a standard spectral eddy viscosity. It proves convenient to express the two-point correlations in terms of spatial Fourier decomposition of the velocity field. The LES fields are more coherent than the DNS fields: their time correlations decay more slowly at all resolved scales of motion and both their integral scales and microscales are larger than those of the DNS field. Filtering alone is not responsible for this effect: in the Fourier representation, the time correlations of the filtered DNS field are identical to those of the DNS field itself. The possibility of modeling the decorrelating effects of the unresolved scales of motion by including a random force in the model is briefly discussed. The results could have applications to the problem of computing sound sources in isotropic homogeneous turbulence by LES. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.

80052163859	Flow past two freely rotatable triangular cylinders in tandem arrangement	In this paper we investigate the interaction of two freely rotatable triangular cylinders that are placed in tandem in a laminar flow. To study how the spacing between the two cylinders may influence the dynamic behavior of the cylinders and vortical structure of the flow, we have performed a series of numerical simulations of the two-cylinder-flow system. In all the simulations, the dimensionless moment of inertia and Reynolds number are fixed to 1.0 and 200, respectively. Four cases with the spacing ratio (L/D) of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 are studied. With the increase of spacing, three different states of motion of the system are found. At L/D = 2.0, oscillatory rotation (swinging in both directions) is observed. At L/D = 3.0 both cylinders exhibit quasi-periodic autorotations. At L/D = 4.0 and 5.0, a more complicated pattern (irregular autorotation) is observed. For each case, the time history of angular velocity, the phase portrait (angular acceleration versus angular velocity,) and the spectra of the moments of forces on both cylinders are plotted and analyzed. The vortical structures in the near and far wake are visualized. Physical interpretations for various phenomenon observed are presented whenever possible. © 2011 by ASME.

84870386942	LES prediction of space-time correlations in turbulent shear flows	We compare the space-time correlations calculated from direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent channel flows. It is found from the comparisons that the LES with an eddy-viscosity subgrid scale (SGS) model over-predicts the space-time correlations than the DNS. The overpredictions are further quantified by the integral scales of directional correlations and convection velocities. A physical argument for the overprediction is provided that the eddy-viscosity SGS model alone does not includes the backscatter effects although it correctly represents the energy dissipations of SGS motions. This argument is confirmed by the recently developed elliptic model for space-time correlations in turbulent shear flows. It suggests that enstrophy is crucial to the LES prediction of spacetime correlations.

84872422796	Simulations of a pitch-up and pitch-down maneuver of a span-wise flexible wing in a free stream flow	A span-wise flexible wing undergoing a rapid pitch-up and pitch-down maneuver in a steady free stream is studied with a lattice Boltzmann flexible particle method (LBFPM) in a three-dimensional space at a chord based Reynolds number of 100. The pitching rates and flexibility are systematically varied, and their effects on the generated aerodynamic forces and power efficiency are explored. It is found that at a higher pitch rate average lift coefficient increases first, as flexural rigidity decreases, and arrives at a maximum, then falls down as the flexural rigidity continuously decreases, while at a lower pitch rate, no similar phenomena is observed. It seems that flexibility can be utilized to improve lift at a high reduced frequency. A small deformation at a level of 5% due to flexibility can largely improve lift force only during pitch-down time period. On the Contrary, flexibility has a negative impact on the lift during pitch-up time period. Most likely, deformation may passively and dynamically adjust the trailing edge position along the span direction, induce larger leading edge vortices (LEV) and tip edge vortices (TEV), and enhance trailing vortex shedding due to Kutta condition, thus improve lift.

84875447077	A nonlinear model for the subgrid timescale experienced by heavy particles in large eddy simulation of isotropic turbulence with a stochastic differential equation	The effects of subgrid scale (SGS) motions on the dispersion of heavy particles raise a challenge to the large-eddy method of simulation (LES). As a necessary first step, we propose the use of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to represent the SGS contributions to the relative dispersions of heavy particles in LES of isotropic turbulence. The main difficulty is in closing the SGS-SDE model whilst accounting for the effects of particle inertia, filter width and gravity. The physics of the interaction between heavy particles and SGS turbulence is explored using the filtered direct numerical simulation method. It is found in the present work that (i) the ratio of the SGS Lagrangian and Eulerian timescales is different from that of the full-scale Lagrangian and Eulerian timescales. The ratios are also dependent on filter widths. (ii) In the absence of gravity, the SGS timescale seen by heavy particles non-monotonically changes with particle Stokes number and has a maximum at particle Stokes number (St = τ

84878322110	A numerical study of a turbulent mixing layer and its generated noise	A direct numerical simulation of a turbulent mixing layer with the Reynolds number 500 and the convective Mach number 0.6 is performed and the results obtained are used to study the turbulent flow field and its generated noise. In the present simulation, the numerical techniques of absorbing buffer zones, artificial convection velocity and spatial filtering are used to achieve nonreflecting boundary conditions. The self-similarity is used to validate the present numerical simulations. The large-scale coherent structures are plotted together with the acoustic waves, which demonstrates the directivity of acoustic waves. The Lighthill's source and space-time correlations are further investigated.

84881451258	On applicability of the Kutta-Joukowski theorem to low-Reynolds-number unsteady flows	The limitations of the Kutta-Joukowski (K-J) theorem in prediction of the time-averaged and instantaneous lift of an airfoil and a wing in low-Reynolds-number unsteady flows are examined. A general lift formula for a rectangular control volume is given in a very simple form in the framework of viscous flow theory, which provides a rational foundation for a direct comparison with the K-J theorem considered as a reduced case. Direct numerical simulations on the stationary and flapping flat plate and rectangular wing are conducted to assess the accuracy of both the K-J theorem and the general lift formula. In particular, the Lamb vector integral for the vortex force and the acceleration term of fluid for the unsteady inertial effect are evaluated as the main contributions to the unsteady lift generation of a flapping wing. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

84883174197	Turbulent clustering of point particles and finite-size particles in isotropic turbulent flows	Particle clustering in turbulent flows is ubiquitous in particle-fluid two-phase flows in the riser of fast fluidized beds. Controlling the level of clustering is very crucial for improving the reactive efficiency in such flows. The present paper is devoted to numerically studying particle clustering in turbulent flows, where both point particles and finite-size particles are taken into account, respectively. A pseudospectral method with the particle tracking method is used to simulate the point particle clustering in the forced isotropic turbulent flows, while the lattice Boltzmann method is used to simulate the finite-size particles in decaying isotropic turbulent flows. It is observed that the mean drift velocity, caused by forces such as gravity, could reduce the level of particle clustering for point particles. However, the particle clustering is very weak for the particles of sizes larger than the characteristic viscous scales of turbulent flows, which is consistent with the previous experimental results. The observations suggest that the mean drift velocity and particle sizes can be used to control the level of particle clustering in chemical reactors. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84883889615	Temporal decorrelations in compressible isotropic turbulence	Temporal decorrelations in compressible isotropic turbulence are studied using the space-time correlation theory and direct numerical simulation. A swept-wave model is developed for dilatational components, while the classic random sweeping model is proposed for solenoidal components. The swept-wave model shows that the temporal decorrelations in dilatational fluctuations are dominated by two physical processes: random sweeping and wave propagation. These models are supported by the direct numerical simulation of compressible isotropic turbulence, in the sense that all curves of normalized time correlations for different wave numbers collapse into a single one using the normalized time separations. The swept-wave model is further extended to account for a constant mean velocity. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84885056142	Lattice Boltzmann simulations of sedimentation of a single fiber in a weak vertical shear flow	Instability of a suspension is directly related to the problem of the cross-stream migration of a particle relative to its neighboring particle suspension. Such cross-stream or lateral migration of a single non-spherical particle (fiber) settling in a bounded weak shear flow with vertical streamlines produced by a perturbation to the fiber number density is studied using lattice Boltzmann simulations. The present simulation results demonstrate that at a given shear rate, the lateral migration can be divided into three phases depending on settling Reynolds number Rsd and particle aspect ratio κ. At a low settling Reynolds number Rsd, the suspension becomes more stable in phase 1. As Rsd increases and excesses a critical settling Reynolds number Rsd1, the fiber suspension becomes unstable in phase 2. In phase 3, at an enough large Rsd, the inertia dominates the weak shear flow and it may have little effect on stability. A mechanism of the instability induced by an inertial fiber orientation drift and a shear induced cross-streamline drift, recently proposed by Shin, Koch, and Subramanian ["Structure and dynamics of dilute suspensions of finite reynolds number settling fibers," Phys. Fluids21, 123304 (2009)], is examined and confirmed. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84885641949	Pumping of water through carbon nanotubes by rotating electric field and rotating magnetic field	Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate pumping of water through a carbon nanotube by applying the combination of a rotating electric field and a rotating magnetic field. The driving force is a Lorentz force generated from the motion of charges in the magnetic field, and the motion is caused by the rotation of the electric field. We find that there exits a linear relationship between the average pumping velocity v and magnetic field strength B, which can be used to control the flux of the continuous unidirectional water flow. This approach is expected to be used in liquid circulation without a pressure gradient. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84885132869	Parallel computing strategy for a flow solver based on immersed boundary method and discrete stream-function formulation	The development of a parallel immersed boundary solver for flows with complex geometries is presented. The numerical method for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is based on the discrete stream-function formulation and unstructured Cartesian grid framework. The code parallelization is achieved by using the domain decomposition (DD) approach and Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) programming paradigm, with the data communication among processes via the MPI protocol. A 'gathering and scattering' strategy is used to handle the force computing on the immersed boundaries. Three tests, 3D lid-driven cavity flow, sedimentation of spheres in a container and flow through and around a circular array of cylinders are performed to evaluate the parallel efficiency of the code. The speedups obtained in these tests on a workstation cluster are reasonably good for the problem size up to 10 million and the number of processes in the range of 16-2048. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84891825836	Numerical simulation of drop oscillation in AC electrowetting	In this paper, a "macroscopic-scale" numerical method for drop oscillation in AC electrowetting is presented. The method is based on a high-fidelity moving mesh interface tracking (MMIT) approach and a "microscopic model" for the moving contact line. The contact line model developed by Ren et al. [Phys Fluids, 2010, 22: 102103] is used in the simulation. To determine the slip length in this model, we propose a calibration procedure using the experimental data of drop spreading in DC electrowetting. In the simulation, the frequency of input AC voltage varies in a certain range while the root-mean-square value remains fixed. The numerical simulation is validated against the experiment and it shows that the predicted resonance frequencies for different oscillation modes agree reasonably well with the experiment. The origins of discrepancy between simulation and experiment are analyzed in the paper. Further investigation is also conducted by including the contact angle hysteresis into the contact line model to account for the "stick-slip" behavior. A noticeable improvement on the prediction of resonance frequencies is achieved by using the hysteresis model. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag 2013.

84892957993	An improved direct-forcing immersed boundary method for fluid-structure interaction simulations	Simulation of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of flexible bodies are challenging due to complex geometries and freely moving boundaries. Immersed boundary method has found to be an efficient technique for dealing with FSI problems because of the use of non-body-fitted mesh and simple implementation. In the present work, we developed a FSI solver by coupling a direct forcing immersed boundary method for the fluid with a finite difference method of the structure. Several flow problems are simulated to validate our method. The testing cases include flow over a stationary cylinder and flat plate, two-dimensional flow past an inextensible flexible filament and three-dimensional flow past a flag. The results obtained agree well with those from previously published literatures. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.

This method is able to deal with bending deformation of flexible biological bodies in fluids. The interactions between elastic solids and fluid are treated with the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method. GLLM is validated by comparing the present results with the existing theoretical and simulation results. As an application of GLLM, swimming of flagellum in fluid is simulated and propulsive force as a function of driven frequency and fluid structures at various Reynolds numbers 0.15-5.1 are presented in this paper. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84896809116	An improved direct-forcing immersed boundary method for fluid-structure interaction simulations	In the present work, we present an improved version of the direct-forcing immersed boundary (IB) method proposed in Wang and Zhang (2011, "An Immersed Boundary Method Based on Discrete Stream Function Formulation for Two- and Three-Dimensional Incompressible Flows," J. Comput. Phys., 230(9), pp. 3479-3499). In order to obtain an accurate prediction of local surface force, measures have been taken to suppress the unphysical spatial oscillations in the Lagrangian forcing. A fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver has been developed by using the improved IB method for the fluid and the finite difference method for the structure. Several flow problems are simulated to validate our method. The testing cases include flows over a stationary cylinder and a stationary flat plate, two-dimensional flow past an inextensible flexible filament, and three-dimensional flow past a flapping flag.

84899533745	Numerical study on hydrodynamic effect of flexibility in a self-propelled plunging foil	The present study is a numerical investigation of the hydrodynamic effects of passive flexibility on a self-propelled plunging foil. In the model problem, the flow is two-dimensional, incompressible and laminar, while the flexible foil is treated as an inextensible filament. The leading-edge of the foil undergoes a prescribed harmonic oscillation in the vertical direction. In the horizontal direction, the foil is free to move and no constraint is imposed. The simulations are performed by using a solver which couples the immersed boundary method for the flow and the finite difference method for the structure. A systematic parametric study has been conducted to investigate the effects of flexibility on important physical quantities such as the cruising speed, swimming power and propulsive efficiency. It is found that optimal cruising speed is always achieved in foils with some passive flexibility and not the rigid ones. Another important finding is that optimum performance is always achieved at a forcing frequency much lower than the resonance point. Based on the simulation results, three dynamical states of a self-propelled foil have been identified with the increase of bending rigidity, i.e., non-periodic movement, periodic backward-movement and periodic forward-movement. For a flexible foil in forward movement, depending on the range of bending rigidity, either a deflected or a symmetric vortex street arises as the characteristic wake structure. It is found that moderate flexibility is beneficial to symmetry preservation in the wake, while excessive flexibility can trigger symmetry-breaking. The results obtained in the current work shed some light on the role of flexibility in flapping-based biolocomotion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84904071454	How flexibility affects the wake symmetry properties of a self-propelled plunging foil	The wake symmetry properties of a flapping-foil system are closely associated with its propulsive performance. In the present work, the effect of the foil flexibility on the wake symmetry properties of a self-propelled plunging foil is studied numerically. We compare the wakes of a flexible foil and a rigid foil at a low flapping Reynolds number of 200. The two foils are of the same dimensions, flapping frequency, leading-edge amplitude and cruising velocity but different bending rigidities. The results indicate that flexibility can either inhibit or trigger the symmetry breaking of the wake. We find that there exists a threshold value of vortex circulation above which symmetry breaking occurs. The modification of vortex circulation is found to be the pivotal factor in the influence of the foil flexibility on the wake symmetry properties. An increase in flexibility can result in a reduction in the vorticity production at the leading edge because of the decrease in the effective angle of attack, but it also enhances vorticity production at the trailing edge because of the increase in the trailing-edge flapping velocity. The competition between these two opposing effects eventually determines the strength of vortex circulation, which, in turn, governs the wake symmetry properties. Further investigation indicates that the former effect is related to the streamlined shape of the deformed foil while the latter effect is associated with structural resonance. The results of this work provide new insights into the functional role of passive flexibility in flapping-based biolocomotion. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.

84905372923	Lattice boltzmann simulations of a pitch-up and pitch-down maneuver of a chord-wise flexible wing in a free stream flow	A rapid pitch-up and pitch-down maneuver of a chord-wise flexible wing in a steady free stream is studied by using a lattice Boltzmann flexible particle method in a three-dimensional space at a chord based Reynolds number of 100. The pitching rates, flexibility, and wing density are systematically varied, and their effects on aerodynamic forces are investigated. It is demonstrated that the flexibility can be utilized to significantly improve lift forces. The flexible wing has a larger angular momentum due to elasticity and inertia and generates a larger leading edge vortex as compared with a rigid wing. Such lift enhancement occurs mainly during the pitch-down motion while a large stall angle is produced during the pitch-up motion. At a low pitch rate, the flexibility cannot improve lift. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84905215304	Lift enhancement by dynamically changing wingspan in forward flapping flight	Dynamically stretching and retractingwingspan has been widely observed in the flight of birds and bats, and its effects on the aerodynamic performance particularly lift generation are intriguing. The rectangular flat-plate flapping wing with a sinusoidally stretching and retracting wingspan is proposed as a simple model for biologically inspired dynamic morphing wings.Numerical simulations of the low-Reynolds-number flows around the flapping morphing wing are conducted in a parametric space by using the immersed boundary method. It is found that the instantaneous and timeaveraged lift coefficients of the wing can be significantly enhanced by dynamically changing wingspan in a flapping cycle. The lift enhancement is caused by both changing the lifting surface area and manipulating the flow structures responsible to the vortex lift generation. The physical mechanisms behind the lift enhancement are explored by examining the three-dimensional flow structures around the flapping wing. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84922334746	Underlying principle of efficient propulsion in flexible plunging foils	Passive flexibility was found to enhance propulsive efficiency in swimming animals. In this study, we numerically investigate the roles of structural resonance and hydrodynamic wake resonance in optimizing efficiency of a flexible plunging foil. The results indicates that (1) optimal efficiency is not necessarily achieved when the driving frequency matches the structural eigenfrequency; (2) optimal efficiency always occurs when the driving frequency matches the wake resonant frequency of the time averaged velocity profile. Thus, the underlying principle of efficient propulsion in flexible plunging foil is the hydrodynamic wake resonance, rather than the structural resonance. In addition, we also found that whether the efficiency can be optimized at the structural resonant point depends on the strength of the leading edge vortex relative to that of the trailing edge vortex. The result of this work provides new insights into the role of passive flexibility in flapping-based propulsion.
