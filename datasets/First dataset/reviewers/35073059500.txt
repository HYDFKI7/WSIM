84932631806	Learning with cascade for classification of non-convex manifolds	Images of a visual object, such as human face, reside in a complicated manifold in the high dimensional image space, when the object is subject to variations in pose, illumination, and other factors. Viola and Jones have successfully tackled difficult nonlinear classification problem for face detection using AdaBoost learning. Moreover, their simple-to-complex cascade of classifiers structure makes the learning and classification even more effective. While training with cascade has been used effectively in many works [4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10], an understanding of the role of the cascade strategy is still lacking. In this paper, we analyze the problem of classifying non-convex manifolds using AdaBoost learning with and without using cascade. We explain that the divide-and-conquer strategy in cascade learning has a great contribution on learning a complex classifier for non-convex manifolds. We prove that AdaBoost learning with cascade is effective when a complete or over-complete set of features (or weak classifiers) is available. Experiments with both synthesized and real data demonstrate that AdaBoost learning with cascade leads to improved convergence and accuracy.

13944274494	Real-time facial expression recognition in the interactive game based on embedded Hidden Markov Model	Combine the facial expression of the game player with the game role and the context can highly enhance the interaction and attractiveness of the interactive computer game. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to real-time facial expression recognition in the interactive computer game environment. There are two main contributions of this work. First, an embedded HMM proposed by Nefian et al. for face recognition [1] is used in real-time facial expression recognition. Second, face alignment is used in facial expression environment. In this paper, the embedded HMM uses two-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-DCT) coefficients as the observation vectors opposite to previous HMM approaches which use pixel intensities to form the observation vectors. Our proposed system reduces the complexity of the training and recognition system.

1542503977	Structure matching algorithm of fingerprint minutiae based on core point	Fingerprint matching algorithm is a key issue of the fingerprint recognition, there already exist many study about fingerprint matching algorithms. According to dependence on core point, fingerprint matching algorithms can be grouped into two categories: core-based match algorithms and structure-based match algorithms. Most of the structure-based matching algorithms are time consuming, therefore they are not suitable for on-line application. Meanwhile, core-based matching algorithm is more efficient than the structure-based matching algorithm, but it highly depends on core point detection precision. We present a new core-based structure matching algorithm which both considers efficient and precision. Firstly, we use core point detection algorithm to find the core point and define some local minutiae structures around core point. Through matching these local minutiae structures, we can get some corresponding points of the two fingerprint images. Secondly, we use the corresponding points to match the global feature of fingerprints, where a match table is constructed to prevent one to many false minutiae match. Finally, we promote the global match distance and global match distance variance to help make the final decision. Experimental result shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm is good.

17044398039	Shape localization based on statistical method using extended local binary pattern	Accurate localization of representative points of a face is crucial to many face analysis and synthesis problems. Active Shape Model (ASM) is a powerful statistical tool for face alignment. However, it suffers from variations of pose, illumination and expressions. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism of Active Shape Model and realize that the ability of profiles normal to describe local appearance pattern is very limited. For efficient appearance pattern representation, local binary pattern is used and extended to describe local patterns of facial key points. For the purpose of retaining spatial information, sub-images of key points are divided into several regions, which are combined to define the extended local binary pattern (ELBP) histogram. Then we propose an improved ASM method framework, ELBP-ASM, in which local appearance patterns of key points are modelled using extended local binary pattern. Experimental results demonstrate that ELBP-ASM achieves more accurate results compared with original method used in ASM. © 2004 IEEE.

2042510343	An image scrambling algorithm based on wavelet transform and Knight's tour	Image secure transmission is one of the main research issues in the field of network communications. Many typical image encryption techniques take the direct way of scrambling the transmitted image itself, which may limit the scrambling effect that is achievable. A new image encryption algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm uses various knight-tours on the chessboard as the basic tool for image scrambling, and scrambles the wavelet coefficients of the transmitted image instead of the image itself. Experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve better scrambling effect. Some useful conclusions are obtained through the analysis and explanation of the experimental data, which lay a solid foundation for further research.

After that, technology has advanced along many dimensions, especially in hardware progress and wireless communication technologies. A number of leading technological organisations are exploring Pervasive Computing. But it is far from Weiser's vision become reality. Pervasive Computing will be the future. Pervasive computing will be a fertile source of challenging research problems in computer systems for many years to come. But until today, there is less attention to the system evolution in pervasive computing environment. This paper discusses the current development of Pervasive Computing and technical challenges in deploying Pervasive Computing systems. First, a model for evolution of pervasive Information technology infrastructure of pervasive information is presented which shows how the existing technologies solutions available can be used to develop a pervasive information infrastructure. Then a generic architecture of pervasive computing system is given. Based these, an evolutionary system design approach is suggested. © 2004 IEEE.

The approach introduces the linear prediction synthesis filter, whose parameters are derived from a set of just noticeable differences estimated by HVM. After being filtered by such a filter, the watermark can be adapted to characteristics of human visual system. As a result, the watermark visibility is noticeably decreased, while at the same time enhancing its energy.

24644478713	Jensen-shannon boosting learning for object recognition	In this paper, we propose a novel learning method, called Jensen-Shannon Boosting (JSBoost) and demonstrate its application to object recognition. JSBoost incorporates Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence into AdaBoost learning. JS divergence is advantageous in that it provides more appropriate measure of dissimilarity between two classes and it is numerically more stable than other measures such as Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (see ). The best features are iteratively learned by maximizing the projected JS divergence, based on which best weak classifiers are derived. The weak classifiers are combined into a strong one by minimizing the recognition error. JSBoost learning is demonstrated with face object recognition using a local binary pattern (LBP) based representation. JSBoost selects the best LBP features from thousands of candidate features and constructs a strong classifier based on the selected features. JSBoost empirically produces better face recognition results than other AdaBoost variants such as RealBoost , GentleBoost and KL-Boost , as demonstrated by experiments. © 2005 IEEE.

25144455930	Removing shadows from face images using ICA	Shadows produce troublesome effects in many computer vision applications. The idea behind most current shadow removal approaches is locating shadows and then removing them[1][4]. However, distinguishing shadow edges due to shadows from reflectance edges due to reflectance changes is a difficult problem, particularly in a single image. In this paper, we focus on the shadow removal problem in face recognition, and take a novel method based on ICA (Independent Component Analysis) to remove shadows from a single face images. The training set contains face images without shadows. Firstly, we applied derivative filters on training images to derive face edge maps, and then perform ICA on filtered training set to construct pixel ICA subspaces which can be used to remove shadow edges from the filtered versions of a single test image. After the shadow edges removal process, a shadow free image can be reconstructed using an approach similar to [7]. Unlike previous shadow removal approaches, our method can remove shadows from a single gray image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively eliminate the effects of shadows in face recognition. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

25144469284	Boosting statistical local feature based classifiers for face recognition	In this work, we present a novel approach for face recognition which use boosted statistical local Gabor feature based classifiers. Firstly, two Gabor parts, real part and imaginary part, are extracted for each pixel of face images. The two parts are transformed into two kinds of Gabor features, magnitude feature and phase feature. 40 magnitude Gaborfaces and 40 phase Gaborfaces are generated for each face image by convoluting face images with five scales and eight orientations Gabor filters. Then these Gaborfaces are scanned with a sub-window from which the quantified Gabor features histograms are extracted representing efficiently the face image. The multi-class problem of face recognition is transformed into a two-class one of intra-and extra-class classification using intra-personal and extra-personal images, as in [5]. The intra/extra features are constructed based on these histograms of two different face images with Chi square statistic as dissimilarity measure. A strong classifier is learned using boosting examples, similar to the way in face detection framework [10]. Experiments on FERET database show good results comparable to the best one reported in literature [6]. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

25144495245	Head gesture recognition based on Bayesian network	Head gestures such as nodding and shaking are often used as one of human body languages for communication with each other, and their recognition plays an important role in the development of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). As head gesture is the continuous motion on the sequential time series, the key problems of recognition are to track multi-view head and understand the head pose transformation. This paper presents a Bayesian network (BN) based framework, into which multi-view model (MVM) and the head gesture statistic inference model are integrated for recognizing. Finally the decision of head gesture is made by comparing the maximum posterior, the output of BN, with some threshold. Additionally, in order to enhance the robustness of our system, we add the color information into BN in a new way. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is effective. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

The SQI overcomes limitations of the original QI method and is able to extract the intrinsic property. It performs a theoretical analysis of conditions when the algorithm applies. A non-iterative filtering algorithm is presented for SQI calculation. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the method for face recognition under various lighting conditions.

The 3D face model in games is represented by a 3D geometry mesh and a 2D texture image. The personalized geometry mesh is obtained by deforming an original mesh with the relative positions of the player's facial features, which are automatically detected from the frontal image. The relevant texture image is also obtained from the same image. In order to save storage space and network bandwidth, only the feature data and texture data from each player are sent to the game server and then to other clients.

33646744389	Gabor feature selection for face recognition using improved AdaBoost learning	Though AdaBoost has been widely used for feature selection and classifier learning, many of the selected features, or weak classifiers, are redundant. By incorporating mutual information into AdaBoost, we propose an improved boosting algorithm in this paper. The proposed method fully examines the redundancy between candidate classifiers and selected classifiers. The classifiers thus selected are both accurate and non-redundant. Experimental results show that the strong classifier learned using the proposed algorithm achieves a lower training error rate than AdaBoost. The proposed algorithm has also been applied to select discriminative Gabor features for face recognition. Even with the simple correlation distance measure and 1-NN classifier, the selected Gabor features achieve quite high recognition accuracy on the FERET database, where both expression and illumination variance exists. When only 140 features are used, the selected features achieve as high as 95.5% accuracy, which is about 2.5% higher than that of features selected by AdaBoost. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

In the framework, an improved face alignment method is proposed to localize the key landmarks of a face, which would be used to locate decorations. Active Shape Models(ASMs), as a robust image alignment method is employed to localize such landmarks. In this work, the authors review the conventional ASMs algorithm for face alignment, and present several improvements on it. It's believed that traditional ASMs is heavily dependent on initial states and prone to local minima. To improve the stability as well as its efficiency, much work is done. First, the eyes are roughly localized in the face area, which are used to initialize the shape model and evaluate the result. Then conventional point distribution model(PDM) is replaced by a newly proposed combined PDM. Experiments on a database containing 200 labelled face images show that the proposed method performs significantly better than traditional ASMs. Finally, the improved method was used to implement a face decorating system. © 2006 ACM.

35048898382	Statistical learning of evaluation function for ASM/AAM image alignment	Alignment between the input and target objects has great impact on the performance of image analysis and recognition system, such as those for medical image and face recognition. Active Shape Models (ASM)[1] and Active Appearance Models (AAM) [2, 3] provide an important framework for this task. However, an effective method for the evaluation of ASM/AAM alignment results has been lacking. Without an alignment quality evaluation mechanism, a bad alignment cannot be identified and this can drop system performance. In this paper, we propose a statistical learning approach for constructing an evaluation function for face alignment. A nonlinear classification function is learned from a set of positive (good alignment) and negative (bad alignment) training examples to effectively distinguish between qualified and un-qualified alignment results. The AdaBoost learning algorithm is used, where weak classifiers are constructed based on edge features and combined into a strong classifier. Several strong classifiers is learned in stages using bootstrap samples during the training, and are then used in cascade in the test. Experimental results demonstrate that the classification function learned using the proposed approach provides semantically more meaningful scoring than the reconstruction error used in AAM for classification between qualified and un-qualified face alignment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

35048832548	Core-based structure matching algorithm of fingerprint verification	The fingerprint matching algorithm is a key issue of fingerprint recognition, and there already exist many fingerprint matching algorithms. According to the dependence of the core point, fingerprint matching algorithms are divided into two groups: core-based match algorithms and noncore-based match algorithms. Most of the noncore-based matching algorithms are time consuming, therefore, they are not suitable for online application; while the core-based matching algorithm is more efficient than the noncore-based matching algorithm, but it highly depends on the core detection precision. In this paper, we present a new core-based structure matching algorithm which considers both efficient and precision. First, we use a core detection algorithm to obtain the core position, then define some local structures of the core area. Using these local structures, we can find some of the correspondent points of the two fingerprint image. Next, we use the correspondent points in the first stage to match the global feature of the fingerprint. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is good.

35048837909	Face representation and reconstruction under different illumination conditions	To deal with image variations due to illumination problem, Ramamoorthi and Basri have independently derived a spherical harmonic analysis for the Lambertian reflectance and linear subspace. Their theoretical work provided a new approach for face representation, however both of them assume that the 3D surface normals and albedo (or unit albedo)are known, which limit this algorithm's application. In this paper, we present a novel method for modeling 3D face shape and albedo from only three images and this work well fill the blank, which Ramamoorthi and Basri left. Our work is closely related to photometric stereo, but conditions of photometric stereo for estimating albedo and surface normal are too strict to be applied for real application. Moreover, the conventionally used singular value decomposition (SVD) approach will lead to the notorious linear ambiguity and the solvent of this problem will need to introduce more constrains or more images. By taking the advantage of similar 3D shape of all human faces, the highlight of the new method is that it circumambulates the linear ambiguity by 3D alignment. The experiment results show that our estimated model can be perfectly employed to face recognition and 3D reconstruction.

Moreover, we promote a new decision method based on orientation validation, and a new rule is proposed to make the final judgment. Finally, the experimental results conducted in DB3, from FVC2002, show that the performance of our algorithm is good. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

38049087181	Weighted active appearance models	This paper presents a robust real-time face alignment algorithm based on Active Appearance Models(AAMs). Fitting an AAM to an image is considered to be a problem of minimizing the error between the input image and the closest model instance. If the input image is far from the model space, the fitting process will fail. This can always occur in application because of illumination variation. So, building a good appearance space is very important. We propose a weighted cost function which can incorporate intensity and edgeness of an image into AAMs framework. To achieve high performance, Active Appearance Models proposed by Iain Matthews is employed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

84867340626	Adaptive spatiotemporal background modelling	In this study, one adaptive spatiotemporal background modelling algorithm is proposed for robust and reliable moving object detection in dynamic scene. First, a modified adaptive Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is presented to describe the temporal distribution of each pixel, based on which the spatial distribution of background is constructed by using non-parametric density estimation. By fusing the temporal and spatial distribution model, a heuristic strategy is presented for background subtraction. To reduce the computational cost, a novel criterion for adaptively determining the components number of GMM and the integral image method for calculating the spatial distribution model are proposed. Several experiments show that the proposed method can effectively reduce false positives caused by sudden or gradual changes of the background, and maintains lower false negatives, compared with some representative algorithms. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

4544285772	Evaluation of face alignment solutions using statistical learning	In this paper, we propose a statistical learning approach for constructing an evaluation function for face alignment. A nonlinear classification function is learned from a set of positive (good alignment) and negative (bad alignment) training examples to effectively distinguish between qualified and un-qualified alignment results. The AdaBoost learning algorithm is used, where weak classifiers are constructed based on edge features and combined into a strong classifier. Several strong classifiers is learned in stages using bootstrap samples during the training. The evaluation function thus learned gives a quantitative confidence and the good-bad classification is achieved by comparing the confidence with a learned optimal threshold. We point out the importance of using cascade strategy in the stagewise learning of strong classifiers. The divide-and-conquer strategy not only dramatically increases the speed of classification, but also makes the training easier and the good-bad classification more effective. Experimental results demonstrate that the classification function learned using the proposed approach provides semantically more meaningful scoring than the reconstruction error used in AAM for classification between qualified and un-qualified face alignment.

45449088562	Personal virtual human modeling from images	A new technique is presented for modeling personal virtual clothed human model with images in orthogonal views. The modeling process is template-based. Firstly, a method for constructing a cross-section based template human model from a scanning human model is proposed. A method for describing the intrinsic relationship between cross-sections and the 3D skeleton of template human model is proposed. Secondly, 2D skeletons of a human in images are set up after automatically extracting feature points on human contours. Thirdly, the relationship between the cross-sections and images is established with the correspondence between 3D skeleton of the template human model and 2D skeletons on images. Finally, a personal virtual human model is obtained by parametrically deforming cross-sections with shape parameters that is automatically gotten from images. Comparing with other methods, our approach is feature and parameterization based, which makes human model deformation more convenient and efficient; the mapping uncertainty between vertices on 3D human model and 2D images is removed; and self-intersection during human model deformation is also avoided.

To cope with the deformation brought by distorted fingerprints, we trained the distribution of orientation difference at a series of concentric circles around the corresponding pairs, and calculate the posterior probability of matched class using Bayesian method. We compute the score of unmatched absolute reliable minutiae by doubling the size of bounding box. At finally, we fuse the both scores with the score of matched minutiae using the multiplication rule.

In our implementation, a B-spline deformable template is used to represent human hand contour, and a 14-dimensions non-linear state space which is divided into 7 parts is used to represent the dynamics of a hand contour. The tracking is performed in grey-scale skin-color image based on particle filter and partitioned sampling. Firstly, a Gaussian model is used to extract the skin pixels. Secondly, particles for each of the 7 parts of the non-linear state space are generated hierarchically based on second-order auto-regressive processes and partitioned sampling, and then each generated particle is weighted by an observation density. Finally, the best complete particle is chosen as the tracking result, and several complete particles are stored to be used in the next frame. The experiments show that our tracker performs well when tracking both rigid movements of the whole hand and non-rigid movements of each finger. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Angle Based Flattening(ABF) surface parameterization is used to build the correspondence between a 3D face model and its 2D texture domain. Feature points on face model are defined according to face anatomy, and their counterparts on images are automatically extracted with AAM method, plus by some little user interaction. The correspondence between feature points on 3D model and 2D images sets up the correspondence between images and the texture domain. With above methods, we can efficiently synthesis texture seamlessly from multi-view images, and map it onto the 3D face model. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

5044238717	Generalized quotient image	In this paper, we present a unified framework for modeling intrinsic properties of face images for recognition. It is based on the quotient image (QI) concept, in particular on the existing works of QI [1, 2], Spherical Harmonic[13, 14, 15], [16, 17], Image Ratio [3, 5, 6, 7]and Retinex [4, 9]. Under this framework, we generalize these previous works into two new algorithms: (1) Non-Point Light Quotient Image (NPL-QI) extends QI to deal with non-point light sources by modeling non-point light directions using spherical harmonic bases; (2) Self-Quotient Image (S-QI) extends QI to perform illumination subtraction without the need for alignment and no shadow assumption. Experimental results show that our algorithms can significantly improve the performance of face recognition under varying illumination conditions.

51449092181	Fingerprint matching based on ridge similarity	This paper proposes a method for fingerprint matching based on the local ridge similarity. Different from traditional methods which estimate rotation angle between a query and template minutia using orientation field, our approach estimates the local rotation angle directly from sampling points of ridges. After fitting samples by least square method, the optimal local rotation angle is obtained, moreover, the similarity between two ridges is measured by virtue of the fitting error. The best reference pair is then determined in the smoothed similarity histogram. Finally, a matching score is computed by projecting the query minutiae set to the template according to the best reference. The experimental results on the public fingerprint database, FVC2002 DB3(800 fingerprints, 8 impressions per finger) and a self-collected database(880 fingerprints, 5 impressions per finger), show that our approach is more effective compared with the conventional ridges-based approach. ©2008 IEEE.

This paper discusses a scheme for minutiae scoring and its application for fingerprint matching. First, quality factors of three levels, namely global factors, block image quality and neighborhood detailed structure, are investigated and combined by product rule and linear weight, which produce a comprehensive score for minutiae evaluation. Second, minutiae score is incorporated into fingerprint matching by checking the scores of corresponding minutiae pairs. A comparative experiment is conducted on a public fingerprint database, FVC, DB3, and the result presents that minutiae scoring is useful for fingerprint matching. © 2008 IEEE.

67449138898	A two-stage approach for AAM fitting	The Active AppearanceModel (AAM) is a powerful generative method for modeling and registering deformable objects. The Project-Out Inverse Compositional (POIC) method is one of the most common methods for AAM fitting and is also the fastest known method to date. However, it does not work well when the initialization is far from the optimum. In this paper, a two-stage fitting procedure based on POIC method is presented: at the first stage, we consider the model as a rigid body and roughly fit it to obtain large capture range; at the second stage, we deem the model as a deformable model and solve for local deformations to achieve accurate results. In other words, the algorithm firstly updates the global similarity transform parameters and then updates the global similarity transform parameters and the linear shape parameters simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve larger capture range with better convergence rates. © 2008 IEEE.

67649427334	Eye locating algorithm for frontal view face image	Projection function is widely used in eye detection for its simplicity and effectivity; however, the specular spots caused by light reflection reduce its accurate detection rate. This paper presents an eye locating algorithm for frontal-view face image to solve this problem. Considering the specular spots in the images, firstly, three eye imaging models are defined and their projection curves are analyzed. Secondly, the detection method for each model is described. Finally, these three models are combined and a unified detection algorithm is proposed. As the shape of standard model's projection curve is symmetric parabola, it is utilized to eliminate the specular spots' influence. Experimental results show that our method can accurately detect eye positions, and the accurate detection rate is over 93%.

70349608521	A reduced unconstrained system for the cloth dynamics solver	Modern direct solvers have been more and more widely used by computer graphics community for solving sparse linear systems, such as those that arise in cloth simulation. However, external constraints usually prevent a direct method from being used for cloth simulation due to the singularity of the constrained system. This paper makes two major contributions towards the re-introduction of direct methods for cloth dynamics solvers. The first one is an approach which eliminates all the constrained variables from the system so that we obtain a reduced, nonsingular and unconstrained system. As alternatives to the well-known MPCG algorithm, not only the original, unmodified PCG method, but also any direct method can be used to solve the reduced system at a lower cost. Our second contribution is a novel direct-iterative scheme applied for the reduced system, which is basically the conjugate gradient method using a special preconditioner. Specifically, we use the stiff part of the coefficient matrix, which we call the matrix core, as the preconditioner for the PCG. The inverse of this preconditioner is computed by any eligible direct solver. The direct-iterative method has proved to be more efficient than both direct and iterative methods. Our experiments show a factor of two speedup over direct methods when stiff springs are used, even greater improvements over the MPCG iterative method. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

To simulate this dynamic process of expression changes, this paper proposes a method of facial expression synthesis based on active appearance model. First, the relationship between facial expression and model parameters is obtained with an offline learning strategy. Then, the given person's facial expressions can be synthesized based on the learning results. In order to solve the problem of blurry eyes and teeth, a synthetic eye image and a teeth template are used to replace these blurry parts of textures. Experimental results show that facial expressions with different intensity and categories can be synthesized; the synthetic eye image enhances the realism of the expressions and makes it easy to implement eye animation.

The original message pattern is generated with a standard and large size. When embedding, the message pattern is scaled into the same size as the cover data by the sampling with equal intervals. The same operation is also applied before watermark detecting. As a result, the pixel-pixel mapping relation between message pattern and the cover data is changed slightly by scaling. So the synchronization of detector can be implemented. Experimental results show it is effective on resistance to scaling.

7744233156	Shape localization by statistical learning in the gabor feature space	Accurate localization of representative points of a face is crucial to many face analysis and synthesis problems. Active Shape Model (ASM) is a powerful statistical tool for face alignment. However, it suffer from variations of pose, illumination and expressions. In this paper, we propose an improved ASM method, RG-ASM, in which local appearance models of key points are modeled using statistical learning. RealBoost is proposed to build the likelihood model that ensures the ground truth position of each key point will more likely have a higher likelihood than its neighbors. Instead of using principle components analysis and one pixel Gabor coefficients, Gabor wavelet features of key point and its neighbors are used as the feature space in the learning procedure to model local structures of a face. Experimental results demonstrate that RG-ASM achieves more accurate results compared with original method used in ASM.

77956002331	AAM based face tracking with temporal matching and face segmentation	Active Appearance Model (AAM) based face tracking has advantages of accurate alignment, high efficiency, and effectiveness for handling face deformation. However, AAM suffers from the generalization problem and has difficulties in images with cluttered backgrounds. In this paper, we introduce two novel constraints into AAM fitting to address the above problems. We first introduce a temporal matching constraint in AAM fitting. In the proposed fitting scheme, the temporal matching enforces an inter-frame local appearance constraint between frames. The resulting model takes advantage of temporal matching's good generalizability, but does not suffer from the mismatched points. To make AAM more stable for cluttered backgrounds, we introduce a color-based face segmentation as a soft constraint. Both constraints effectively improve the AAM tracker's performance, as demonstrated with experiments on various challenging real-world videos. ©2010 IEEE.

Firstly, we propose a two-stage segmentation method in the stereo matching algorithm with point entropy, which is superior to the widely used simple segmentation method. Secondly, we take the advantage of multiple views by back-projection. Stereo methods usually demand the input images with near-horizontal and little viewpoints variation. In our method, images in different positions with large viewpoint variety are used as the input of stereo matching algorithm. With given camera parameters and assumed depth, we can back-project the appointed point in the reference image into other views and get the data cost of several different image pairs, which gives nice initialization for energy function minimization.

In hand detection stage, an open hand is detected by the histograms of oriented gradient and AdaBoost method. The hand detector is trained by the AdaBoost algorithm with HOG features. A contour based tracker is applied in combining condensation and partitioned sampling. After a hand is detected in the image, the tracker can track the hand contour in real time. During the tracking, the trajectory is saved to perform hand gesture recognition in the last stage. Recognition of the hand moving trajectory is implemented by hidden Markov models. Several HMMs are trained in advance, and the results from the tracking stage are then recognized using the trained HMMs. Experiments have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed system. Under normal webcam it can recognize the predefined gestures quickly and precisely. As it is easy to develop other hand gestures, the proposed system has good potential in many applications. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

For different cluster, we allow different dimensionality but retain the same discriminant power, aiming at optimization of total dimensionality. Furthermore, we use each feature's nearest set of cluster centers as its expression bases, which is chosen using nearest neighbor distance ratio, so that the correspondence between a feature and its nearest set is more stable. The goal of the above scheme is to adapt the feature representation to distribution of feature classes in each cluster and distribution of cluster centers in feature space.

84869045348	Entropy-based maximally stable extremal regions for robust feature detection	Maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) is a state-of-the-art method in local feature detection. However, this method is sensitive to blurring because, in blurred images, the intensity values in region boundary will vary more slowly, and this will undermine the stability criterion that the MSER relies on. In this paper, we propose a method to improve MSER, making it more robust to image blurring. To find back the regions missed by MSER in the blurred image, we utilize the fact that the entropy of probability distribution function of intensity values increases rapidly when the local region expands across the boundary, while the entropy in the central part remains small. We use the entropy averaged by the regional area as a measure to reestimate regions missed by MSER. Experiments show that, when dealing with blurred images, the proposed method has better performance than the original MSER, with little extra computational effort. © 2012 Huiwen Cai et al.

Active Shape Model (ASM) is a powerful statistical tool for face alignment. However, it suffer from variations of pose, illumination and expressions. In this paper, we propose an improved ASM method, RG-ASM, in which local appearance models of key points are modeled using statistical learning. RealBoost is proposed to build the likelihood model that ensures the ground truth position of each key point will more likely have a higher likelihood than its neighbors. Instead of using principle components analysis and one pixel Gabor coefficients, Gabor wavelet features of key point and its neighbors are used as the feature space in the learning procedure to model local structures of a face. Experimental results demonstrate that RG-ASM achieves more accurate results compared with original method used in ASM.

10444261913	A novel watermarking scheme on resistance to scaling	In this paper, the effect of scaling on the watermark detector is analyzed. A novel idea, watermark normalization is proposed. The original message pattern is generated with a standard and large size. When embedding, the message pattern is scaled into the same size as the cover data by the sampling with equal intervals. The same operation is also applied before watermark detecting. As a result, the pixel-pixel mapping relation between message pattern and the cover data is changed slightly by scaling. So the synchronization of detector can be implemented. Experimental results show it is effective on resistance to scaling.

10044238019	Feature based fragile image watermarking framework	A feature based fragile image watermarking framework is proposed to resist vector quantization (VQ) attack. Image features are extracted to process the original watermark or generate the watermark so that the embedded watermark is not only unknown to the attacker, but also dependent on the image. Therefore, different images have different embedded watermarks so that it is impossible for the attacker to build VQ codebook. At the same time, the watermark is embedded into the image under consideration of security and localization. The basic requirements for the embedding scheme are given for the trade-off between the security and localization. An actual moment invariants based fragile image watermarking scheme is presented to demonstrate our fragile watermarking framework. Analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can simultaneously detect even one bit image alteration with graceful localization and resist vector quantization attack without the need of any unique keys or image indexes.

13444310852	Subgrid scale laminar flamelet model for partially premixed combustion and its application to backdraft simulation	Flame spread after air is suddenly introduced to a vitiated compartment in backdraft is between non-premixed and premixed flame spread under a ventilation-controlled condition. And it is necessary, but difficult to numerically simulate it. In this paper, an attempt of backdraft simulation is introduced. Numerical models including a subgrid scale laminar flamelet model and a partially premixed model are imbedded in FDS3.0 source code for backdraft simulation. Some significant fire characteristics reported in previous backdraft experiments can be seen in the numerical results. It is also indicated that these combined models can be used to predict the partially premixed combustion and fire phenomena under ventilation-controlled conditions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

13944250983	Imaged-based 3D face modeling	In this paper, we present an image-based 3D face modeling algorithm. Different from traditional complex stereo vision procedure, our new method needs only two orthogonal images for fast 3D modeling without any camera calibration. The proposed method has two steps. Firstly according to MPEG-4 protocol for 3D face structure, we appoint and deform feature points by Radial Basis functions (RBF) in the input images corresponding to the generic model. Then the texture mapping is carried out with regard to different directional projections. The experiments demonstrate that our new algorithm can photo- realistically render 3D face with very limited computation.
