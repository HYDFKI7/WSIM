84928623765	Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy application in environmental monitoring of water quality: a review	Water quality monitoring is a critical part of environmental management and protection, and to be able to qualitatively and quantitatively determine contamination and impurity levels in water is especially important. Compared to the currently available water quality monitoring methods and techniques, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has several advantages, including no need for sample pre-preparation, fast and easy operation, and chemical free during the process. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the fundamentals of aqueous LIBS analysis and effectively apply this technique to environmental monitoring. This article reviews the research conducted on LIBS analysis for liquid samples, and the article content includes LIBS theory, history and applications, quantitative analysis of metallic species in liquids, LIBS signal enhancement methods and data processing, characteristics of plasma generated by laser in water, and the factors affecting accuracy of analysis results. Although there have been many research works focusing on aqueous LIBS analysis, detection limit and stability of this technique still need to be improved to satisfy the requirements of environmental monitoring standard. In addition, determination of nonmetallic species in liquid by LIBS is equally important and needs immediate attention from the community. This comprehensive review will assist the readers to better understand the aqueous LIBS technique and help to identify current research needs for environmental monitoring of water quality.

With the help of the multiplicity of generating sequence, three kernel functions of FRFT are produced to build three different FRFT operators. And the three generating sequences, transform orders, random matrixes for phase encoding are used as encryption keys in the algorithm. The coded image is transformed three times by different FRFTs with different kernel functions in order to encrypt the image. As the transform times of FRFT increase, the complexity of die algorithm enhances. Experimental results show that the mean square error (MSE) caused by deviation of the last transform orders is the biggest and the algorithm is very reliable and complex.

In this paper, a new underdetermined blind source separation (UDBSS) approach, based on the local mean decomposition (LMD) method and the AMUSE algorithm, is proposed. To make the UDBSS problem simpler, some extra observation signals are first constructed using the LMD method. Thus the underdetermined blind source separation problem is transformed into an (over-)determined one. Subsequently, the well known AMUSE algorithm is applied to these new observations to estimate the source signals.

49249128625	Performance analysis of stochastic gradient algorithms under weak conditions	By using the stochastic martingale theory, convergence properties of stochastic gradient (SG) identification algorithms are studied under weak conditions. The analysis indicates that the parameter estimates by the SG algorithms consistently converge to the true parameters, as long as the information vector is persistently exciting (i.e., the data product moment matrix has a bounded condition number) and that the process noises are zero mean and uncorrelated. These results remove the strict assumptions, made in existing references, that the noise variances and high-order moments exist, and the processes are stationary and ergodic and the strong persistent excitation condition holds. This contribution greatly relaxes the convergence conditions of stochastic gradient algorithms. The simulation results with bounded and unbounded noise variances confirm the convergence conclusions proposed. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

This method does not rely on the accurate model of the system. According to the partly known and unknown coupling matrix of the controller respectively, this method takes the model perturbation, the external disturbance and the dynamic coupling including the interaction of the input variables as a total disturbance to each channel based on the local static decoupling. By introducing virtual control and state variables, the extended state observer(ESO) is designed to estimate the total disturbance and then it is fed back to the controller to compensate the disturbances. And then, the non-linear SISO ADRC is designed to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system for each decoupling sub-object.

79956322957	Hybrid modeling for deactivation of BPA catalyst	During the production of bisphenol A(BPA), the used ion exchange resin catalyst will be deactivated with the changes of reaction temperature, operation time, ratio of phenol to acetone in feed and load of production. In order to monitor the change of catalyst activity online, based on mathematical regression and support vector machine (SVM), a hybrid soft sensing model for catalyst activity of BPA production was established. During the establishment of the above model, a quadratic polynomial was applied for the mathematical regression of the decreasing trend of the catalyst activity; and based on it, the SVM was used for the consideration of the catalyst activity fluctuation caused by the reaction temperature, ratio of phenol to acetone and feed load. Finally a soft sensing model used for the estimation of the BPA content in the reactor outlet of the BPA production was established too. The results of the model simulations and the industrial production process show that the established soft sensing model for the catalyst activity of BPA production can yield satisfactory estimation results and meet the needs of industrial production process.

Finally, a compositional SVM model is constructed. The simulation results show that the composition model can reduce the information interference among the different data categories and improve the inferential accuracy of the model. © All Rights Reserved.

For example, quality variables in chemical processes are often measured off-line through laboratory analysis. Collection of samples and subsequent analyses inevitably introduce uncertain time delays associated with the irregularly sampled quality variables, which add significant difficulty in identification of process with multirate (MR) data. Considering the MR system with random sampling delays described by a finite impulse response (FIR) model, an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate its parameters along with the time delays is developed. Based on the identified FIR model, two algorithms are proposed to recover the approximate output error (OE) or transfer function model.

84920936765	A Non-Linear Blind Source Separation Method Based on Perceptron Structure and Conjugate Gradient Algorithm	The linear mixing model has been considered previously in most of the researches which are devoted to the blind source separation (BSS) problem. In practice, a more realistic BSS mixing model should be the non-linear one. In this paper, we propose a non-linear BSS method, in which a two-layer perceptron network is employed as the separating system to separate sources from observed non-linear mixture signals. The learning rules for the parameters of the separating system are derived based on the minimum mutual information criterion with conjugate gradient algorithm. Instead of choosing a proper non-linear functions empirically, the adaptive kernel density estimation is used in order to estimate the probability density functions and their derivatives of the separated signals. As a result, the score function of the perceptron’s outputs can be estimated directly. Simulations show good performance of the proposed non-linear BSS algorithm.
