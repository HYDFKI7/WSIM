17044437717	Novel missense mutations, GCC [Ala306] - > GTC [Val] and ACG [Thr318] - > CCG [Pro], in the CYP11B1 gene cause steroid 11β-hydroxylase deficiency in the Chinese	Objective: Steroid 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) deficiency, an autosomal recessive inherited disease, accounts for 5-8% of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It is mainly caused by mutations of nucleotide substitutions in the coding region. Patients and Methods: The study reports on a 9-year-old Chinese boy who presented with a bone age of 16 years, an enlarged penis, an accelerated growth rate since early childhood and hypertension (160-170/100-110 mmHg) for 3 years. Because it shares 95% sequence homology with aldosterone synthetase (CYP11B2), we developed gene-specific primers for differential PCR amplification of the CYP11B1 gene. The secondary PCR products of nine exons of the CYP11B1 gene were then subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. The serum hormone levels were also determined. Results: We found that the boy diagnosed with CAH due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency carried mutations of A306V (GCC- > GTC) and T318P (ACG- > CCG) in two respective chromosomes. The hormone assay showed that the 11-deoxycortisol level was higher (667 nmol/l) than normal and was further increased after ACTH stimulation (1206 nmol/l). Conclusions: These two mutations have not previously been described in the CYP11B1 gene. The discovery of these two novel mutations increases our knowledge of CAH caused by 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

22044450684	Repeated ovarian stimulations induce oxidative damage and mitochondrial DNA mutations in mouse ovaries	Superovulation by injection of exogenous gonadotropin is the elementary method to produce in vivo-derived embryos for embryo transfer in women. Increased oocyte aneuploidy, embryo mortality, fetal growth retardation, and congenital abnormalities have been studied at higher-dose stimulations. Ovarian and oocyte biological aging possibly may have adverse implications for human oocyte competence with repeated hyperstimulation. In this study, we found that reduced competence for the human oocyte has been associated with degenerative embryo upsurge during embryo culture and failure to develop into the blastocyst stage in the three, four, five, and six stimulation cycles. On the other hand, the numbers of ovulated oocytes were decreased in the groups with more ovarian stimulation. More aggregated mitochondria were found in the cytoplasm of the repetitively stimulated embryos. Higher amounts of oxidative damage including 8-OH-dG, lipoperoxides, and carbonyl proteins were also revealed in the ovaries with more cycle numbers of ovarian stimulation. Higher proportions of mtDNA mutations were also found. The detected molecular size of the mutated band was approximately 675 bp. Increased amounts of carbonyl proteins were also revealed after repeated stimulation. An understanding of the relationship between oocyte competence and ovarian responses to stimulation in the mouse may provide insights into the origin of oocyte defects and the biology of ooplasmic aging that could be of clinical relevance in the diagnosis and treatment of human infertility. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.

22244433561	Polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue and apoptosis of endometriotic cells	Objective: To induce apoptosis of endometriotic cells of patients with endometriosis. Design: To demonstrate that polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue directly inhibits cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Setting: University hospital infertility center. Patient(s): Twelve women who visited the center for infertility therapy. Intervention(s): Polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue was applied into primary endometriotic cells; the manipulated cells were collected 1-4 days after polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary endometriotic cell cultures from eutopic endometriotic tissue were established. The effect of the novel biological glue, polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue A, on endometrial cells in vitro was examined. The different stages of apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (FITC)-annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Result(s): The growth inhibitory effects of polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue A on endometrial cells were found to be dose-response and time dependent. Less than 15% viability was detected in cultures containing 2,000 μg of polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue A after 4 days of treatment. Induced apoptosis and caspase activity were revealed. The caspase-3 activity increased 2.2-fold with 4 days of culture with 2,000 μg of polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue A. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to demonstrate that polyglycolic acid/chitosan glue directly inhibits cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis, thus suggesting that this new biological glue may be useful for endometriosis therapy. ©2005 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

0029979629	Direct molecular diagnosis of CYP2 1 mutations in congenital adrenal hyperplasia	Abstract The majority of congenital adrenal hy-perplasia (CAH) cases arise from mut-ations in the steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) gene. Without reliance on HLA gene linkage analysis, we have developed primers for differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the CYP21 gene and the non-functional CYP21P gene. Using the amplification created restriction site (ACRS) approach for direct muta-tional detection, a secondary PCR was then performed using a panel of primers specific for each of the 11 known mutations associated with CAn. Subsequent re-striction analysis allowed not only the de-tection but also the determination of the zygosity of the mutations analysed. Ex-isting deletion of the CYP21 gene could also be detected. In the analysis of 20 in-dependent chromosomes in 11 families of CAH patients in Taiwan, four CYP21 mutation types, besides deletion, were de-tected. Interestingly, in five different al-ides, the CYP21P pseudogene contained some polymorphisms generally associated with the CYP21 gene. These results suggest gene conversion events that are occurring in both CYP21P and CYP21 genes. Our combined differential PCR-ACRS pro-tocol is simple and direct and is applicable for prenatal diagnosis of CAH using chor-ionic villi or amniotic cells.

0030747786	Severe bleeding from a pregnancy tumor: A case report	BACKGROUND: Hyperplastic gingivitis and gingival hyperplasia accompanying gestation have been termed 'pregnancy gingivitis' and 'pregnancy tumor.' The condition is benign but, rarely, is complicated by severe bleeding that is difficult to manage. A single case of a pregnancy tumor is reported. CASE: A 28-year-old woman in the third trimester was evaluated for treatment of a pregnancy granuloma with recurrent episodes of severe bleeding for two weeks. Conservative management by firm pressure on gauze packs was applied to control the bleeding, but in vain. Induction of labor was conducted at 37 weeks partially because of term pregnancy and uncontrollable bleeding from the gingiva. An emergency cesarean section was done because of acute fetal distress during induction of labor. A healthy infant was delivered. The gingival bleeding stopped spontaneously five days afterwards. The patient was given thorough dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene instructions. The buccal granulomatous tumor was decreased in size four weeks postpartum. CONCLUSION: Careful oral dental hygiene, removal of dental plaque and debris, and use of soft toothbrushes are important during pregnancy to avoid occurrence of a pregnancy tumor. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, management should be based on the individual condition and should range from supportive therapy-such as desiccation of bleeders; local, firm compression and oral hygiene to blood transfusion-as well as medication to accelerate fetal lung maturity or even termination of pregnancy to save the patient's life, as with treatment of uncontrollable eclampsia.

0030788456	Acetaminophen poisoning in late pregnancy: A case report	BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen poisoning is a major cause of hospital admission and has been extensively reviewed. Its occurrence in pregnant women has been reported seldom, and the prognosis has been good except for one case, in which the fetus died. We report on a case of acetaminophen poisoning that resulted in the death of both the mother and the infant. CASE: A 38- year-old woman whose pregnancy was at 31 weeks' gestational age was evaluated for treatment of an acetaminophen overdose. She was admitted more than 26 hours after taking 35 g of acetaminophen. An emergency cesarean section was performed one hour after admission because of acute fetal distress. A grossly normal, 1,620-g, female infant was delivered and had Apgar scores at 1, 5 and 10 minutes of 0, 0 and 1, respectively, despite the initiation of resuscitation immediately following delivery. Acidosis was noted in the mother during the operation; it was followed by acute hepatorenal failure 16 hours after admission. That resulted in the mother's death 40 hours after admission. The infant also died 34 hours after delivery. CONCLUSION: Delays in administering the antidote treatment, N-acetylcysteine, after acetaminophen intoxication significantly increases the risk of mortality in both the mother and infant. The development of acidosis carries a poor prognosis in such patients and may necessitate liver transplantation to save the life of the mother.

0030833812	Maintenance of human sperm motility and prevention of oxidative damage through co-culture incubation	Co-culture incubation is one of the important techniques used in basic and clinical research of assisted reproduction. In this study, sperm samples from 40 healthy donors were prepared for co-culture incubation with Vero cells which had been derived from the kidney fibroblasts of the African green monkey, Cercopithecus aethiops. We found that the motility characteristics of ejaculated human sperm co-cultured with Vero cells were largely maintained and the percentage of hyperactivated sperm in the co-culture group was not affected. While the sperm of the control group completely lost the motility at 12 h incubation at 37°C in 5% CO

0031045298	Rapid detection of trisomy 21 by homologous gene quantitative PCR (HGQ-PCR)	Down's syndrome results from the production of three copies of chromosome 21 within a cell. We have devised a method termed the homologous gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HGQ-PCR), which uses one pair of primers and which can directly identify the additional copy of chromosome 21 by simultaneously amplifying two highly homologous genes of the human liver-type phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 21 (PFKL-CH21) and the human muscle-type phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 1 (PFKM-CH1) for self-detecting determination. On analysis of 34 cases of Down's syndrome, including two cases of unbalanced translocation 46, XY, der (14; 21) (q10; q10), + 21, and 100 normal individuals, the relative ratio of the PFKM-CH1/PFKL-CH21 product was 1.33 ± 0.323 (mean ± SD) and 0.40 ± 0.16 (mean ± SD) for disomy DNA and trisomy DNA, respectively. The difference between these two groups was highly significant (P < 0.001). These results indicate that this quantitative method is practical and may be used for the prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome caused by trisomy 21.

0031691665	Successful pregnancy in a woman with acute myeloid leukemia treated with high-dose whole-body irradiation	BACKGROUND: Although radiotherapy is an integral part of managing certain types of hematologic malignancies, its effect on the reproductive system are well established. We report a case of successful pregnancy in a patient who received high-dose-whole-body irradiation(WBI) (1,575 cGy) as part of her treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CASE: A 26-year-old woman received high-dose cyclophosphamide accompanied by high-dose (1,575 cGy) WBI as part of her treatment for AML when she was 23 years of age. The patient received oral contraceptives before, during and after treatment. After WBL the patient developed ovarian failure and amenorrhea, which was confirmed by hormonal evaluation. The amenorrhea persisted for one year. No recurrence of AML was found. The patient was placed on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) because of vasomotor changes. An unexpected pregnancy occurred 14 months later; HRT was discontinued. The patient delivered a normal female infant at 38 weeks of gestation. The infant was followed for eight months; her development appeared to be normal. CONCLUSION: In this case report, it is unclear whether pregnancy resulted from active folliculogenesis remote from radiation therapy or from possible ovarian protection rendered by the use of oral contraceptives. The benefit of oral contraceptives in protecting the ovary from radiation injury is unknown and remains an area for future research.

0031826410	Multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA are associated with the decline of motility and fertility of human spermatozoa	Sperm motility is one of the major determinants of male fertility and is required for successful fertilization. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the occurrence and accumulation of the 4977 bp deletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is associated with diminished fertility and motility of human spermatozoa. The possible relationship between multiple deletions of mtDNA and the decline of fertility and motility in human spermatozoa was further explored in 36 subjects including subfertile and infertile males in this study. Using long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we confirmed the 4977 bp deletion and identified two novel deletions of 7345 and 7599 bp of mtDNA in the spermatozoa with poor motility. We used Percoll gradients to fractionate spermatozoa with differing motility, and then screened for two novel large-scale deletions of the mtDNA. The results showed that the ratio of the deleted mtDNA in the spermatozoa with poor motility and fertility. In addition, we found that the frequencies of the three large-scale deletions in the spermatozoa from patients with primary infertility and oligoasthenozoospermia were higher than those of the fertile males. Our findings suggest that mtDNA deletions may play an important role in some pathophysiological conditions of human spermatozoa.

0031897785	Direct measurement of the tail beat frequency of human sperm by flash light synchronization	Based on the synchronization between a periodic vibration and flashing light, we designed a device to determine the flagellar beating frequency of human sperm. The head of a spermatozoon was either held by the tip of a micropipette operated with a micromanipulator or adhered by itself on the surface of a glass slide when the sperm swam out of the micropipette into the fresh Ham's F-10 medium. The beat frequency of the flagellum was measured by synchronization of the frequency-adjustable flash light built on an inverted microscope. The light frequency synchronizer included a controller, a pulse generator, a signal counter, and a flash illuminator. During each measurement, the spermatozoon was transferred to the center of the observing field and the frequency generator created a series of signals which developed flashing signals onto the sample plane. When the vibration of the flagellum was observed as a constant two-step-like movement after frequency adjustment, the beating frequency was read from the signal counter and the count was twice that of the beat frequency of the sperm tail. As the flash signal was decreased to half of this frequency, an apparently immobilized sperm flagellum was observed and the exact beating frequency could then be determined. This device was then used to measure the effect of pentoxifyl- line on sperm motility. The results showed that the increase of tail beat frequency as measured by this device is well correlated with the increase of beat cross frequency as detected by a computer-assisted semen analyzer. These findings suggest that this flash light synchronization device is a reliable and useful system for the assessment of sperm motility.

0031474522	Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix after laparoscopic surgery: A case report	BACKGROUND: Although more than 50 cases of recurrence at the sites of cannula insertion after laparoscopy for malignant tumors nave been reported in the literature, the majority were adenocarcinoma. We report a case of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis and abdominal wall metastases of the trocar site after laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. CASE: A 47-year-old woman underwent curative, laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for treating squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, stage IB. The postoperative course was uneventful until two months later, when abdominal recurrences at the trocar site and diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis were noted. Pathology proved recurrent intraperitoneal squamous cell carcinoma with invasion of the abdominal port site. CONCLUSION: This case further alerts gynecologic oncologists of the potential risks of laparoscopic surgery for potentially curable gynecologic malignancies.

0031915264	Fever of unknown origin in the puerperium: A case report	BACKGROUND: Postpartum fever is a common problem for obstetricians, but fever of unknown origin (FUO) occurring in the puerperium may be relatively unfamiliar and a challenge to the majority of obstetricians. CASE: A 29- year-old woman had a FUO detected during the puerperium. Despite serial examinations and therapeutic trials, the fever persisted for three weeks without a clinical improvement or definite infection source. The presence of a huge uterine myoma was observed. The patient finally underwent myomectomy, and a pathology review revealed a cellular leiomyoma associated with massive infarction and acute inflammation. The fever subsided substantially on the third day postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Although a uterine leiomyoma as a cause of fever in the puerperium is not new, rarely does it cause prolonged fever. It should be taken into consideration in pregnant women known to have uterine myomas during pregnancy and in the puerperium, especially if FUO develops. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be a tool for making the differential diagnosis in such a patient, and exploratory laparotomy can be delayed until an emergency condition occurred, especially important during pregnancy.

0031919395	High-risk gestational trophoblastic disease: Analysis of clinical prognoses	Purpose of investigation: An attempt to better define factors leading to patient survival in the high-risk group of malignant gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Methods: From January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1995 25 cases of malignant high-risk GTD were retrospectively collected to evaluate prognostic factors by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: We identified the presence of liver metastases and/or brain metastases and the presence of intestinal metastates as significant by using univariate analysis. However, only the presence of liver metastases of brain metastases was significant by multivariate analysis (p = 0.009). Conclusions. Although a high-risk group of GTD can be identified according to the modified World Health Organization (WHO) prognostic scoring system, liver metastases were not emphasized (only two points) in this scoring system. We suggested that these risk factors, including brain metastases and liver metastases, should be weighted more than other risk factors.

0031919718	Small cell carcinoma of the cervix: Analysis of clinical and pathological findings	Purpose of investigtion: An attempt to better identify small cell carcinoma of the cervix and evaluate its prognosis. Methods: From January of 1970 to March of 1995, a total of seven patients diagnosed with small cell carcinoma of the cervix by pathologic revision were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical information including age, clinical stage, lymph-vascular space invasion, lymph node metastases, prognoses were analyzed. Results: All specimens stained positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and four were positive for chromogranin (CGR). The majority of patients (71%) died of disease within 18 months. Only one patient had an abnormal Pap smear before definite diagnosis, and only one patient was well and alive after a combination of surgery and multi-agent chemotherapy (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Pap smears may not be an appropriate screening method for detecting small cell carcinoma of the cervix. Immunohistological staining may be helpful in diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the cervix. Because of a very poor prognosis, more effective therapeutic protocol should be further defined in the management of cervical small cell carcinoma.

Design: Case report Setting: University hospital-based reproductive biology unit. Patient(s): A 50-year-old female patient exhibited persistent elevation of T (>2.0 ng/mL) after surgery for steroid cell tumor of the ovary, not otherwise specified, stage IIA for 3 months. This elevation suggested the presence of some residual active tumor. Intervention(s): All tumor evaluations, including those for tumor markers, a thorough physical examination, imaging studies, and evaluations of nuclear medicine studies were negative except for elevated serum T levels. The patient was treated with GnRH-a between the fourth month and sixth month postoperatively. Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum levels of T and tumor survey. Result(s): The serum T levels returned to normal limits after administration of the first dose of GnRH-a. Follow-up of tumor survey was negative. The patient was alive and free of disease 26 months treatment with GnRH-a. Conclusion(s): GnRH-a may be an alternative choice as adjuvant therapy for managing a persistent or recurrent hormone-producing steroid cell tumor of the ovary.

0031193420	Port site metastasis after laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy for endometrial cancer: Possible mechanisms and prevention	Only 19 cases of metastases at the cannula insertion site after laparoscopy for gynecological malignancy have been reported in the literature. One case has been diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the others have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumor. We present a novel case of laparoscopy-site abdominal wall metastasis from endometrial cancer after laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). The 56-year-old female patient exhibited metastases of an abdominal wall trocar site and a perineal site after undergoing LAVH and laparoscopic-assisted (LA) bilateral pelvic lymph node sampling as well as LA para-aortic lymph node sampling for treating endometrial carcinoma, surgical staging IIIC, G3. The interval between the surgical extirpation of endometrial carcinoma and diagnosis of the tumor recurrence was 6 months, suggesting that overmanipulation of the diseased organ during laparoscopic surgery may have resulted in tumor spillage, intraperitoneal dissemination, and wound contamination. Although this procedure has been proven beneficial to patients with benign disease or early-stage gynecologic malignancies, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy may not be efficacious to eradicate advanced gynecological malignancies.

They have been divided into two subtypes according to their cell of origin as follows: stromal luteoma, and Leydig cell tumors, and a third subtype with lineage unknown is asteroid cell tumor, not otherwise specified (NOS). The clinical presentation may take many forms, including pain, abdominal distention and bloating, but perhaps the most interesting and noticeable presentations are those related to the hormonal activity and virilizing properties of the tumor. No radiological features of the steroid cell tumor, NOS have been presented in the literature. This report presents the MRI and ultrasonographic findings of a patient having steroid cell tumor, NOS, of the right ovary with metastasis to the uterus.

0031658966	Identification of four novel mutations in the CYP21 gene in congenital adrenal hyperplasia in the Chinese	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder mainly caused by defects in the steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) gene. We have analyzed CYP21 gene sequences in 65 CAH families in Taiwan. All ten exons of the CYP21 gene were analyzed by differential polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism electrophoresis and the amplification-created restriction site method. About 95% (123 chromosomes) contain mutations due to conversion of DNA sequences into its neighboring homologous pseudogene, CYP21P. Four novel mutations representing 5% of the total chromosomes have also been identified. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing an aberrant DNA fragment. These four mutations included a base change of the splicing donor site at intron 2 from GT to AT, a base substitution of C to T at codon 316, deletion of ten bases (TCCAGCTCCC) at codons 330-333 of exon 8, and duplication of 16 bases (CCTGGATGACACGGTC) at codons 393-397 of exon 9. The loss of the splicing donor site at intron 2 and the premature stop at codon 316 may result in aberrant splicing to reduce enzyme activity and a truncated protein with no enzyme activity, respectively. Likewise, both the duplication and the deletion forms create a frameshift and premature stop during translation. The resulting proteins lack the heme-binding domain and hence are expected to lose enzymatic activity. Since these mutations are not found in the neighboring CYP21P pseudogene, gene conversion should not be the cause of these novel mutations.

0031671626	Delayed postpartum hemorrhage in adenomyosis: A case report	Adenomyosis of the uterus is a serious problem for women of reproductive age because of its possible consequence of infertility. We present the case of a woman who had adenomyosis of the uterus, a successful spontaneous pregnancy, and delayed and tenacious postpartum hemorrhage that did not respond to conservative treatment. The 26-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 1, suffered from fulminating vaginal bleeding and associated shock 20 days after the delivery of a 3,450-g female by Cesarean section. Conservative treatment included uterine compression and massage, blood transfusion, intravenous administration of high-dosage estrogen, oxytocin and sulprostone (prostaglandin E analogue), and gauze packing from the vagina into the uterine cavity. Despite treatment, the patient went into shock due to persistent vaginal bleeding. Emergency exploratoric assessment laparotomy was performed, followed by a stotal hysterectomy. Pathology revealed extensive adenomyosis of the uterus without other significant abnormality. The potential dangers of adenomyosis in pregnancy should not be overlooked when patients seek treatment for infertility.

0032190188	Laparoscopic surgery for heterotopic pregnancies: a case report and a brief review	A heterotopic pregnancy is in effect a multiple pregnancy with one or more intrauterine pregnancies coexisting with an ectopic pregnancy and is rarely spontaneous. With the increasing popularity of ovulation induction performed during assisted reproductive techniques, it will not be surprising to observe that this phenomenon has increased significantly. However, diagnosis is often delayed because of its rarity and difficulty. We report a case of a woman with a viable intrauterine pregnancy who had a complication of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome secondary to ovulation induction following in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer, but who, during hospitalization, presented with clinically progressive abdominal pain. An unruptured ectopic pregnancy of the right fallopian tube was diagnosed accidentally by laparoscopy and laparoscopic salpingectomy was immediately performed. Post-operative follow-up revealed that the intrauterine pregnancy continued normally. She delivered a normal female baby at 38 weeks of gestation. The promising neonatal outcome might suggest that laparoscopy might be safely performed to aid differential diagnosis in an uncertain condition during pregnancy: therefore, laparoscopic surgery might be an appropriate method to manage some carefully selected patients with HP. A brief review of the published literature on the role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and management of heterotopic pregnancy is given. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

0032433665	Uterine myoma after cessation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist: Ultrasound and histopathologic findings	Background. This study attempted to search for the possible mechanism of regrowth of uterine myoma after cessation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) therapy. Methods. Five premenopausal women presenting with symptomatic uterine myoma were prospectively studied in this trial. All patients were treated with a subcutaneous injection of goserelin depot 3.6 mg every four weeks for 16 weeks. Clinical examinations as well as hormonal and ultrasound determinations were performed before, during and after treatment to monitor the efficacy of therapy. At the end of the treatment period, all patients underwent myomectomy. The ultrastructural change of the myoma was evaluated postoperatively. Results. The volume of the uterus decreased 21- 57% and the volume of the uterine myoma decreased 21-65% after therapy. There was no significant change in resistance index of the uterine vessels or major vessels supplying the uterine myoma between pretreatment and post-treatment values. The morphologic features of the treated myoma showed marked cellular shrinkage and loss of myofibrillar structure. Conclusions. There is no significant cellular damage to the cellular structure that contributes to regrowth of treated intramural uterine myoma following cessation of treatment.

0032443249	Preoperative diagnosis of primary fallopian tube carcinoma by magnetic resonance imaging: A case report	Because of the rarity and insidious onset of primary adenocarcinoma of the fallopian tube, early diagnosis is very difficult. Primary fallopian tube carcinoma is also rarely diagnosed preoperatively. This report reviews the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in aiding the detection of early- stage primary fallopian tube carcinoma in a 48-year-old female. The diagnosis was based on clinical suspicion, elevated CA-125 and MRI. MRI demonstrated the tumor as an area of solid masses with marked enhancement after gadolinium-diethylenetetraaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) administration. Primary fallopian tube carcinoma was confirmed by pathologic examination. We hope that, with improvements in imaging, early diagnosis of such a malignant disease could become routinely possible in the future.

2442560440	High Resistance Index of Doppler Ultrasound in Tuberculous Peritonitis Presenting as Abdominal Carcinomatosis: Report of Two Cases	The radiologic features of tuberculous peritonitis (TB peritonitis) are seldom reported, and the use of color Doppler ultrasound in the diagnosis of TB peritonitis is even less common. Herein, we present two patients (a 29-year-old woman and a 56-year-old woman) who were evaluated for months of progressive enlargement of the abdomen, poor appetite and weight loss. In both patients, clinical and laboratory examinations suggested carcinoma, except a very high vascular resistance (resistance index 1.0 and 0.89, respectively) of the tumor feeding vessels detected by color Doppler ultrasound. TB peritonitis was finally diagnosed by exploratory laparotomy. Both patients were treated using a four-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol hydrochloride and pyrazinamide for nine months and were clinically cured. In conclusion, if color Doppler ultrasound reveals normal ovaries, ascites containing thin, delicate incomplete or complete septa, and only a few high-resistance tumor feeding vessels in the abdominal cavity (resistance index ≥ 0.80), TB peritonitis should be considered.

We report a case of placenta previa accreta with cervical involvement resulting in tenacious postpartum hemorrhage. A 28-year-old pregnant woman, gravida-2 para-1, who had undergone a previous cesarean section, was scheduled for a repeat cesarean section because of complete placenta previa associated with placenta accreta. The patient underwent cesarean section and delivered a 3,700 g, male infant. Manual removal of the placenta was performed with some difficulty and redundant placental tissue remained adhered to the uterine wall. Oxytocin, ergometrine, uterine arterial ligation and packing of the lower uterine segment were used to control bleeding; the wound was closed as usual after achieving adequate hemostasis. While closing the abdominal wall, vaginal bleeding was noted. After conservative treatment, shock progressively emerged due to persistent vaginal bleeding. Emergency laparotomy found active bleeding from the cervix and total abdominal hysterectomy was performed without hesitation. Careful evaluation is mandatory to preserve the uterus. In the case of cervical involvement, aggressive treatment such as hysterectomy should be undertaken promptly to decrease the risks of both morbidity and mortality.

Design: Prospective study. Setting: A tertiary medical center. Patient(s): Twenty-one postmenopausal women. Intervention(s): Transdermal estradiol or placebo therapy for 3 weeks in randomized, double-blinded, crossover fashion. Main Outcome Measure(s): Heart rate variability measures in both time and frequency domains, serum biochemistry, and climacteric symptoms were compared among baseline, placebo and transdermal estrogen therapies. Result(s): Plasma concentration of estradiol rose significantly from 11.0 ± 5.2 pg/ml to 48.2 ± 34.0 pg/ml after transdermal estrogen. The standard deviation of RR-interval increased significantly from 30.3 ± 9.9 ms (placebo) to 31.3 ± 7.4 ms (transdermal estrogen), and the coefficient of variation of RR-interval increased significantly as compared with the baseline session. The total power was marginally increased as compared among baseline, placebo, and transdermal estrogen sessions. The irritability symptom decreased significantly after transdermal estrogen therapy, as compared with baseline and placebo treatment. Conclusion(s): Transdermal estradiol for 3 weeks could significantly increase the global heart rate variability and reduce the irritability symptom in the postmenopausal women. Short-term transdermal estrogen for 3 weeks could improve cardiac autonomic nervous modulation and climacteric symptoms, and might have some cardioprotective effect in postmenopausal women. ©2005 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

3242806054	Sperm mitochondrial DNA depletion in men with asthenospermia	Objective To determine the content of sperm mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in patients with asthenospermia or with poor sperm motility. Design Analysis of the content of mtDNA as the ratio between the amount of mtDNA and nuclear DNA by using a new concurrent polymerase chain reaction. Setting University hospital infertility center. Patient(s) Eighty-six men who sought infertility therapy. Intervention(s) Moving characteristics of sperm were examined with a computer-assisted semen analyzer. Main outcome measure(s) Sperm samples were classified into two groups, one with asthenospermia and the other with normal moving characteristics. The content of mtDNA in sperm was determined by polymerase chain reaction. We analyzed the mitochondrial mass by MitoTracker Green staining and analyzed DNA content with propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry. Result(s) A decrease in sperm mtDNA content was detected in patients with asthenospermia or with poor sperm motility (<20% motility). The relative mtDNA contents in the asthenospermia and normal groups were 7.2 ± 1.3 (mean ± SD, n = 23) and 74.1 ± 2.0 (n = 29), respectively. Lower intensities of propidium iodide staining were detected in patients with asthenospermia or poor motility, but there was no significant difference in MitoTracker Green staining between the sperm with different motility. Conclusion(s) We suggest that mtDNA content may serve as a useful indicator of sperm quality and that mtDNA depletion may play an important role in the pathophysiology of some male infertility. © 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

33745884671	Single-dose sertaconazole vaginal tablet treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis	Background: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a bothersome disease in women. Poor compliance with the continuous use of antifungal vaginal drugs often results in treatment failure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of single-dose sertaconazole vaginal tablet (500 mg) treatment compared with conventional 3-dose econazole vaginal tablet (150 mg) treatment for VVC. Methods: In this open, randomized, and comparative study, 40 symptomatic patients with VVC confirmed by the smear method were enrolled. Patients in group A were treated with single-dose sertaconazole vaginal tablet and those in group B were treated continuously with econazole vaginal tablet for 3 days. Results: The characteristics of the patients in both groups were comparable and without statistical difference. Group A showed a significantly better clearance rate for candidiasis than group B (100% vs. 72.2% on day 7, p = 0.013; 100% vs. 77.8% on day 14, p = 0.030), based on smear method results. Group A showed a more rapid response for symptom relief than group B on day 7, but there was no difference in overall symptom relief between group A and group B on day 14. Conclusion: Single-dose sertaconazole proved to be a more convenient and symptom-relieving treatment for VVC. The advantages of such management are worthy of further study in women with relapse VVC. © 2006 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

34447518688	Effect of a selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, celecoxib, on the reproductive function of female mice	Background: The aim of the present study was to determine if long-term use of a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor affects fertility or ovulation in female mice. Methods: Twenty-four female mice, 25 days of age, were given a selective COX-2 inhibitor: 3 mg/kg celecoxib (n=8), 5 mg/kg celecoxib (n=8), or placebo (n=8) in a random fashion. Eight female mice, 10-11 weeks old, given 3 mg/kg celecoxib (n=4) or placebo (n=4) were subjected to continuous mating studies. Results: Results from the 24 mice (n=8 for each group) showed that oocyte number was not significantly different between female mice treated with either 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg celecoxib and placebo (21.4±2.5, 21.5±3.3, 23.3±3.8, respectively). From the continuous mating study, the litter size of female mice treated with celecoxib was not significantly different (8.2±1.3 pups/litter) compared to those treated with placebo (8.3±1.2 pups/litter). In addition, female mice treated with celecoxib had an average of 2.8±0.5 litters in a 12-week period, which was similar to female mice treated with placebo (3.0±0.8 litters/female). Conclusion: This study suggests that use of low-dose (≤5 mg/kg) selective COX-2 inhibitor in a mouse model does not significantly impair the female reproductive function. © 2007 Elsevier.

34547768079	Standard and low-dose hormone therapy for postmenopausal women - Focus on the breast	Menopause occurs naturally when the ovary ceases folliculogenesis, or artificially by surgical and/or medical ablation of the ovarian function. Menopause is a hypoestrogenic state, which may adversely affect estrogen target tissues, such as the brain, skeleton and skin, as well as the cardiovascular and genitourinary systems, with resultant frequency and severity of climacteric symptoms. The climacteric symptoms, however, vary significantly among women. For decades, hormone therapy (HT) has been the mainstay and is considered the most effective for managing menopausal symptoms. The prolonged use of either single estrogen therapy or a combination therapy of estrogen and progestogen (EPT) might be associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer and many resultant adverse events, such as coronary heart disease, stroke and venous thromboembolism. Perhaps because the clear benefits are limited to these end points of HT in treating menopausal women, the relatively significant adverse event profiles of these women may not be enough to trigger primary care physicians to be more aggressive than they have been to date in treating climacteric symptoms of postmenopausal women. However, severe climacteric symptoms really disturb the woman's life. Some epidemiologic studies have shown that the increased risk for breast cancer after 5 years of combined EPT is similar in magnitude to other lifestyle variables, such as 10-year delayed menopause, fewer pregnancies and reduced breastfeeding, postmenopausal obesity, excessive alcohol or cigarette use, and lack of regular exercise. Furthermore, elevated serum concentrations of either endogenous or exogenous (replaced by HT) sex hormone in either pre- or postmenopausal women are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Finally, the increased breast cancer risk diminishes soon after discontinuing hormones, and largely disappears by 5 years after cessation. Taken together, low-dose conventional HT can be used with symptomatic menopausal women, but is worthy of further evaluation because we found the following potential benefits, including (i) low-dose oral EPT appears to be effective for the alleviation of climacteric symptoms; (ii) it has a good tolerability profile with a low incidence of the most common and problematic side effects, such as breast tenderness and an increased mammographic density. Altogether, when compared with the standard dose HT, physicians may prefer to use low-dose HT initially in managing the climacteric symptoms of postmenopausal women. Time will prove.

34547775777	Effects of tibolone on the breast of postmenopausal women	For decades, hormone therapy (HT) has been the mainstay for managing menopausal symptoms. However, the prolonged use of either single estrogen therapy (ET) or a combination therapy of estrogen and progestogen (EPT) might be associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Alternative therapies that are effective in the prevention and/or treatment of menopause, having associated morbidities but no unwanted effects, are of primary interest in clinical practice. Tibolone (Livial; NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands) is structurally related to 19-nortestosterone derivatives and is a new postmenopausal regimen with a unique pharmacological profile, licensed for the relief of climacteric symptoms and the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Tibolone exhibits weak estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic activities, which in theory might influence the breast. The effect of tibolone on breast tissue, however, is obscure. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of tibolone on breast safety, and the collected data include preclinical models, clinical observation, and epidemiologic study. Although in vitro studies showed conflicting results (with the majority being favorable effects) regarding the effects of tibolone on breast cells, in vivo studies showed favorable effects of tibolone on the breast in animal models. Similarly, an epidemiologic study indicated an increased risk of breast cancer when tibolone was used to manage climacteric symptoms of postmenopausal women, but accumulated data obtained from radiologie studies (mammography) showed a possible protective effect of tibolone on the breast. Taken together, we conclude that tibolone, if not superior to conventional HT, may be more acceptable to clinicians as a therapeutic drug option for use with symptomatic menopausal women. Only time will tell whether tibolone will be the preferred option.

37349096616	Vulvar metastasis as the initial presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: A case report	BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma constitutes 40% of malignant lymphomas. Involvement of the vulva, either primarily or secondarily, appears to be very rare. CASE: An 87-year-old woman with a 2-cm, left vulvar mass was initially treated with antibiotics due to a suspicion of Bartholin's gland abscess. The mass grew rapidly, from 2 to 10 cm, within 3 months. Biopsy showed a diffuse, large, B-cell lymphoma. After 1 cycle (5 days) of treatment with 200 mg endoxan and 60 mg prednisolone, the mass significantly decreased in size. The de crease in size occurred within 2 days after the beginning of treatment and resolved completely 7 days later. CONCLUSION: If a vulvar mass is found in an elderly woman, the physician should consider the possibility of malignancy, especially metastasis. © Journal of Reproductive Medicine®, Inc.

0033035876	Relationship between hormone receptor concentration and tumor shrinkage in uterine myoma after treatment with a GnRHa	Background. Uterine myomas are benign tumors of the uterus, occurring in up to 25% of women of reproductive age. We examined the possible causes for different degrees of volume reduction in patients with uterine myomas who received gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment by investigating the hormone receptors at the end of GnRHa treatment. Methods. This trial was designed as a prospective study of five premenopausal women presenting with symptomatic uterine myoma. All patients were treated with a subcutaneous injection of goserelin depot 3.6 mg every four weeks for 16 weeks. Clinical examinations, hormonal evaluation and ultrasound determinations were performed before, during and after treatment. At the end of the treatment period, all patients underwent myomectomy. The concentrations of the unbound progesterone receptors and estrogen receptors were evaluated. Results. The volume of the uterine myoma decreased by 21% to 65%. The percentage of decrease in volume of treated uterine myomas was found to negatively correlate with the concentration of unbound progesterone receptors (r

0032784467	Primary repair of cornual rupture occurring at 21 weeks gestation and successful pregnancy outcome	The successful delivery in a 31 year old woman at 33 weeks gestation is reported, after repair to a cornual rupture which occurred at 21 weeks gestation. The patient exhibited acute abdominal pain and pending shock. Emergency laparotomy showed a cornual rupture and an intrauterine vital fetus having intact amnion membrane. On the patient's family's insistence, primary repair for a cornual rupture was performed and preservation of the fetus attempted. Postoperatively, tocolytic agent with ritodrine hydrochloride was administered and close follow-up of the patient was uneventful. The patient had a smooth obstetric course until 33 weeks gestation when premature rupture of the membranes occurred, soon followed by the onset of labour. She underwent an elective Caesarean section and delivered a normal male fetus weighing 2140 g with Apgar scores at 1, 5 and 10 min of 6, 8, and 9 respectively. Because of this successful outcome, we suggest that primary repair for such an unusual patient should be accepted.

0033498079	A prospective, randomized comparison of port wound and culdotomy for extracting mature teratomas laparoscopically	Study Objective. To compare removing teratomas through a culdotomy opening or through an enlarged port wound. Design. Prospective, randomized trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). Setting. Veterans Hospital. Patients. Thirty-one women with mature teratomas identified by ultrasound examination and biochemical markers. Intervention. Laparoscopic cystectomy. Measurements and Main Results. Patients were randomly assigned to have the cysts removed intact in a cellulose bag through an enlarged port site (15, group A) or through a culdotomy opening (16, group B). Inclusion criteria were history of vaginal delivery, no previous abdominal surgery, no history of pelvic inflammatory disease, no medical illness, and no symptoms. Operating time in group B (90 ± 18 min) was significantly longer than that in group A (70 ± 22 min, p = 0.0113). Blood loss was 79 and 49 ml, respectively (p = 0.0010). There was no significant differences in tumor size, patient age, and postoperative recovery between groups. Conclusion. It is possible to remove intact ovarian dermoid cysts and prevent rupture and spillage of cyst contents during laparoscopic surgery by both approaches. We prefer the enlarged port because operating time is shorter and blood loss is less.

0032788126	Primary malignant lymphoma of the cervix in pregnancy: A case report	BACKGROUND: Malignant lymphoma arising from the uterine cervix is a very rare entity. Only two such patients have been reported as pregnant at the time of the diagnosis. CASE: A 35-year-old woman (negative Pap smear at antenatal clinics) was referred because of the accidental finding of a huge cervical mass during labor. The patient underwent cesarean section because of arrest of cervical dilatation and persistent floating of the fetal head. The final diagnosis of this cervical mass was malignant lymphoma, low grade B cell, after radical abdominal hysterectomy. CONCLUSION: Although labor obstructed by a tumor of the pelvic organs is a relatively rare event and the majority of cases are benign leiomyomas of the uterus or cervix, the risk of pelvic malignancies should be considered. Bimanual examination and pelvic ultrasound and/or color Doppler ultrasound should be applied without hesitancy in any uncertain situation during pregnancy or labor.

0032834457	Managing a patient with presumed testosterone-secreting ovarian tumor	We report the case of a 70-year-old woman who was presumed to have right ovarian testosterone-secreting tumor and was treated with long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy plus add-back hormone replacement therapy. The patient presented with various medical problems including hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, and poor control of diabetic mellitus and had exhibited rapid symptoms of androgen excess such as progressive hirsutism and bilateral temporal balding for half a year. Tumor survey was negative except for an elevated testosterone level. Renal vein catheterization successfully detected a right ovarian androgen-secreting tumor. Because the patient was deemed medically unable to tolerate surgery, she received an alternative treatment consisting of 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist (GnRH-a) and add-back hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Serum testosterone levels returned to normal limits after administration of the first dose of GnRH-a. A follow-up tumor survey was negative. The patient has been alive and free of disease for 8 months after six doses of GnRH-a. We conclude that this strategy might be used as urgent therapy in a medically compromised patient with presumed ovarian androgen-secreting tumor.

0032894024	Rapid progression of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix after hyperbaric oxygenation	The role of hyperbaric oxygenation in the treatment of radiation-induced sequelae and chronic ulcer is well established. On the contrary, a possible cancer-causing or growth-enhancing effect by hyperbaric oxygenation was highly controversial. Herein, we present a 55-year-old Chinese woman with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix on her left inguinal area. She received concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by radical inguinal lymphadenectomy due to persistent tumor mass. The patient was complicated with severe radiation fibrosis and unhealed wounds, so she was treated with hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO). However, the patient died of complications of the disease after completing HBO therapy 1 month later and autopsy of the patient showed carcinomatosis of the abdominal cavity and lower abdominal wall. Because previous studies have been inconclusive regarding the effect of HBO on tumor cells, we reviewed the possible relation between the HBO and tumor cells.

0032898175	Ovarian tumors complicating pregnancy: Emergency and elective surgery	OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively evaluate the different effects and characteristics of ovarian surgery performed under emergency conditions and electively during pregnancy and to search for risk factors contributing to emergency ovarian surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Between 1980 and 1996, 174 patients undergoing adnexal surgery during pregnancy or the puerperium were reviewed at Veterans General Hospital-Taipei. Of these 174 patients, 32 underwent emergency surgery (group A), while 142 patients underwent elective surgery (group B). In order to search for differences between the emergency and elective operations, patients in both groups were analyzed, with particular emphasis on the characteristics and outcome of pregnancy. RESULTS: In contrast to elective operations, there were five distinct aspects of emergency surgery. First, half of them occurred in the first trimester. Second, they contributed to 75% (9/12) of the total fetal wastage and 85.7% (6/7) of spontaneous fetal loss (P = .00016). Third, tumor sizes (11.1 ± 4.2 cm) were significantly larger than those found (8.3 ± 3.76 cm) in the elective surgery group (P < .05). Fourth, tumors less than 5 cm never caused symptoms requiring surgery. Fifth, an increasing incidence of completely extirpative surgery and general anesthesia was noted (P < .005). Incidence of tumors greater than 10 cm during pregnancy increased with malignancy (P =.0295) and before emergency surgery (P = .00001). CONCLUSION: We could remove ovarian tumors greater than 10 cm in diameter or with a teratoma component at earlier stages of pregnancy (after the seventh week of gestation) to avoid unpredictable complications. This reduces the risks of malignancy and emergency surgery. There was no evidence of increasing risk of fetal loss when surgery was performed after the seventh week of gestation.

0032925540	Risk factors contributing to early occurrence of port site metastases of laparoscopic surgery for malignancy	In this article, the authors present an up-to-date review of our experience and that of the medical literature encompassing all important aspects of port site metastases after laparoscopic surgery for malignancy and to search for potential risks with contribution to early occurrence of port site metastases after laparoscopic surgery. We used a Medline computer database search to conduct for pertinent articles through September 1996. Cross-referencing identified additional publications. We found that the majority of recurrences were in patients with adenocarcinoma cell type, advanced stage (far-advanced disease), and often with diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis, suggesting that port site metastases may contribute to the highly aggressive nature of the disease. Risk factors that contributed to early occurrence of port site metastases were ovarian cancers, presence of ascites, and diagnostic or palliative procedures for malignancy (P < 0.0001, P = 0.008, and P < 0.001, respectively). Practitioners should exercise extreme caution when using laparoscopic techniques to manage the care of these patients.

0032962957	Borderline ovarian tumors complicating pregnancy: A case report	Although the majority of ovarian tumors complicating pregnancy are benign, they still pose a challenge because of the difficulty in differentiating between benign and malignant tumors during pregnancy. To our knowledge, the value of color Doppler ultrasound in the diagnosis of borderline malignant tumors complicating pregnancy remains unclear. We present the case of a 29-year-old pregnant woman with an ovarian tumor of low malignant potential. Preoperative ultrasound revealed a well-encapsulated cystic complex on the left ovary measuring 16 x 18 x 12 cm with an internally smooth surface, multiple septa ranging from 2 to 4 mm in thickness and a small solid component 2 cm in diameter, with a resistance index of 0.42. The differential diagnosis preoperatively was a borderline tumor. The patient underwent a left oophorectomy at 18 weeks of gestation. Frozen pathology indicated a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of low malignant potential. A thorough surgical staging was completed. The final pathology confirmed mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of low malignant potential, stage IA. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful course and did not receive any adjuvant therapy. She delivered a normal male fetus weighing 3,450 g at 38 weeks of gestation. We conclude that color Doppler ultrasound is helpful for the preoperative diagnosis of borderline tumors of the ovaries but its usefulness for making an accurate diagnosis may require further evaluation.

0032992796	Lymphocyte-infiltrated FIGO Stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is a prominent factor for disease-free survival	Background: The data of histopathological factors affecting prognosis of patients with FIGO Stage IIB squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix are rarely known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the histopathological factors rendering therapeutic failure in patients with FIGO Stage IIB. Methods: Survival and prognostic factors were analyzed in 83 patients with FIGO stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with radical hysterectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy between 1980 and 1989. The relapse-free and overall survival rate was 61.4%. Results: Univariate analysis demonstrated that the degree of lymphoreticular cells infiltrating the cervix, lymph node metastases, barrel shape of the cervix, lymph-vascular space invasion, more than three lymph nodes involved, and bulky tumor size (i.e. tumor size larger than 4 cm) were of prognostic significance in disease-free survival. However, pronounced lymphoreticular cells infiltrating the cervical cancer was the only independent factor to disease-free survival in patients with FIGO stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma treated with radical hysterectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection using multivariate analysis. Conclusions: We concluded that the immune function of the host might play a crucial role in the process of anti-neoplasm even if local advanced carcinoma of the cervix is noted. Individual therapies may very well have limited efficacy based on the patient's tumor or the inherent host response. How to strengthen the power of the host's immune system may offer another thinking process to treat such a subgroup of patients. More studies are required.

0033758280	BRCA1 mutations in Taiwanese with epithelial ovarian carcinoma and sporadic primary serous peritoneal carcinoma	Background: Germline BRCA1 mutations of sporadic ovarian cancers are presumed to be rare events, except among specific populations. To date, the status of germline BRCA1 mutations in Taiwanese with primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma (PEOC) is still unknown. In this study, we tried to answer part of this question. Methods: Sixty-four patients documented with PEOC, four patients with family history of breast and/or ovary cancer syndrome and five patients with sporadic primary serous peritoneal carcinoma (PSPC) were enrolled in this retrospective study from January 1994 through June 1999. At the same time, 50 normal healthy Taiwanese without family history were enrolled in this study. Germline DNA from these patients was screened for mutations in the BRCA1 gene using polymerase chain reaction-based single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP). Shifting DNA bands were sequenced. Results: One of the 64 patients with PEOC (1.6%) exhibited germline BRCA1 heterozygous mutation which was exon11 single-base substitution at nucleotide 1047 (CAG to TAG). One of the five patients with PSPC (20%) exhibited an exon11 single-base substitution at nucleotide 914 (TCT to TCC) with resultant silent mutation. One of the normal healthy Taiwanese (2%) was found to have an exon 2 single-base substitution at nucleotide 152 (A→C) which was also a silent mutation. No mutations of BRCA1 were detected in four patients with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Conclusions: Based on this study, it was very difficult to obtain precise dta to prove the value of applying genetic testing of BRCA1 mutations in Taiwanese patients with sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers or sporadic PSPC and even with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer because of its rare event and because of the too small number of cases available in this study.

0034105179	Vaginal obliteration after total body irradiation and chemotherapy as treatment for acute myeloid leukemia	Although radiotherapy is an integral part in the management of certain types of hematological malignancies, its effect on the reproductive system has been well documented. We report a rare complication where a patient had complete vaginal obliteration after receiving a dose of total body irradiation (1575 cGy) as part of her treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. A 37-year-old married woman, G3P2, underwent high-dose cyclophosphamide accompanied by high dose (1575 cGy) total body irradiation (TBI) as part of her treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML: m1) when she was 35 years of age. After TBI, the patient developed ovarian failure and amenorrhea, which was confirmed by hormonal evaluation. Nevertheless, she did not receive any hormonal replacement therapy and stopped her sexual life for two years. Fortunately, no recurrence of AML was noted. The patient visited our clinic due to difficulty in performing coitus. Physical examination showed a 2-cm short and blinded vaginal pouch. She initially received hormonal replacement therapy followed by surgical correction via vaginoplasty and two months of dilatory replacement and frequent coitus with satisfactory result. To our limited knowledge, vaginal obliteration as a complication of condition regimen has never been reported before. In the present case report, it is unclear whether spontaneous vaginal obliteration resulted from chemotherapy, total body irradiation, or another unknown cause such as a concomitant leukemic infiltration of the vaginal wall, severe bacterial and fungal infection before treatment, or from any combination of the above. However, due to this case presentation, we suggest that such patients must receive hormonal replacement therapy and be encouraged to have a normal sexual life to avoid this possible problem.

0034111761	Posterior uterine wall rupture during labour	Vaginal births after Caesarean section (VBAC) are well-accepted procedures when pregnant women do not have any contra-indications. The possibilities of the uterine dehisence and rupture during VBAC should always be considered. This occurrence is usually related to the previous scar tissue and subsequent risk is acceptable. Nevertheless, rupture that occurs in presumably normal tissue areas of the uterus instead of in scar tissue areas with resultant perinatal death is extremely rare. We present a 31 year old woman who had posterior uterine rupture when she tried VBAC at 38 weeks gestation. During the course of VBAC, she had a smooth labour course without use of any augmentation medication, but her condition was complicated with uterine rupture without any premonitory signal. It resulted in maternal shock and sequentially the death of the newborn 7 days after delivery. By reviewing this case report, we should keep in mind that prompt response to every woman during labour is of paramount importance to avoid repeating the occurrence of uterine rupture, partly because uterine rupture could occur without prominent signals and partly because subsequent dangers seem to be those created by acts of omission. Finally, the benefits and safety of VBAC have not been undermined because this patient is an isolated and extremely rare case.

0034113650	Analysis of the chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 gene in steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency	Background: A single nonfunctional chimeric gene with its 5' and 3' ends corresponding to CYP21P and CYP21, respectively, is caused by unequal gene crossover in the CYP21 genes during meiosis. The presence of the chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 molecule can not be detected by conventional PCR methods and therefore may be lost in PCR amplification. This leads to a false result and diagnostic discordance. Methods: We developed a rapid and direct method to detect a chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 gene that uses a 3'-specific primer for the CYP21 gene and two different 5' primers for both CYP21 and CYP21P to amplify the wild-type CYP21 and the chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 genes. A secondary PCR that can differentiate the chimeric from the wild-type gene was also performed. The PCR product was directly analyzed on agarose gel. Results: After careful titration, we found that earlier failure to detect the chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 gene could be caused by unequal concentrations of two independent alleles as the PCR template or by the lack of primers to amplify chimeric molecules. We successfully amplified the chimeric gene using our improved method. Conclusions: The chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 is present in a large portion of congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients. By adding a CYP21P/CYP21-specific primer, we were able to amplify and detect both homozygous and heterozygous chimeric genes. Therefore, our new PCR-based assay is a more effective way to analyze congenital adrenal hyperplasia mutations. (C) 2000 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

0033779934	Brain-damaged survivors after intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin	Background. Potential risks for a surviving twin after fetal death of a co-twin in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) has been documented. Although some studies suggest ending a twin pregnancy after a single fetal death as soon as possible in order to minimize the risks of thromboembolic complications in the surviving twin, we are more concerned about the risks of a premature birth. In this study, we searched for a potential marker to predict thromboembolic complications in the surviving twin. Methods. From 1993 to 1998, nine women in two teaching hospitals had pregnancies complicated by TTTS and the death of one fetus. In addition to routine ultrasound examinations and obstetric monitoring, all patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation tests. The outcome of the surviving fetus was recorded. Results. Three patients had silent and minimal coagulopathy (33%) that revealed only the presence of D-dimer. Among these three patients, two had a disappearance of serum D-dimer, but the other one had persistent D-dimer levels for more than 5 weeks and delivered a fetus with a cerebral infarction. Except for the above-mentioned fetus, all surviving fetuses were normal and healthy and were delivered at the median gestational age of 33 (range, 31-36) weeks. Of the nine surviving children, the mean interval between fetal death of one twin and delivery of the healthy twin was 22.7 days, ranging from 3 days to 47 days. Conclusions. All patients having TTTS associated with one fetal death should be carefully monitored for coagulopathy; the appropriate time for delivery might depend on the duration of persistent D-dimer in the maternal blood. The long-term presence of D-dimer in the maternal serum may indicate a severe underlying thromboembolic complication in the surviving twin after intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin. Due to the increased risks of morbidity in premature births, the benefit of early termination of pregnancy in order to protect against subsequent sequelae in the surviving twin is minor and remains an area for future research.

0033953610	Disseminated carcinomatosis after laparoscopic surgery for presumably benign ruptured ovarian teratoma	The authors reported the intraperitoneal carcinomatosis after laparoscopic surgery for presumably benign ruptured ovarian teratoma in a 28- year-old woman. A 28-year-old female patient exhibited intraperitoneal carcinomatosis after a laparoscopic surgery for ruptured mature teratoma of the ovary with occult malignant transformation. The complication was found two months after initial laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was smooth including oophorectomy, and removing all spilled specimens within the abdominal cavity. At the end of the laparoscopic surgery, cleaning the abdominal cavity and irritating the port site were also performed. Cytology of the abdominal cavity and all removed specimens did not show evidence of malignancy. She followed up regularly and uneventfully except for persistently abdominal fullness and erythematous change of umbilical portal site. Evidence demonstrated intestinal obstruction associated with ascites after a detailed evaluation. Although the patient received supportive treatment the symptom exacerbated. Therefore, the patient was treated with exploratory laparotomy. Pathology proved with intraperitoneal carcinomatosis caused by squamous cell carcinoma. All tumor evaluations including tumor markers, a thorough physical examination, imaging studies and evaluations of the nuclear medicine were negative except of intraperitoneal carcinoma, origin to be determined. The patient is dead 14 months' post-treatment by exploratory laparotomy. Although it was not clear that the laparoscopic approach or the disease itself worsened indeed the prognosis because the disease was already disseminated before the laparoscopy, we still emphasized the possible limitation of laparoscopic surgery if diagnosis at original surgery is impaired, of if excision is incomplete and the delay between the laparoscopic procedure and the carcinomatosis.

40749108502	Low frequency of the CYP21A2 deletion in ethnic Chinese (Taiwanese) patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder which causes more than 90% of CAH cases due to defects in the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2). The frequency of large mutations was determined in 200 ethnic Chinese (i.e., Taiwanese) CAH patients belonging to 200 families with different clinical forms of CYP21A2 deficiency over 10 years of molecular diagnoses. For a large-gene deletion (or conversion) and the CYP21A2 deletion identification, a PCR product covering the TNXB gene and the 5′-end of the CYP21A2 gene with TaqI endonuclease digestion was analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. For CYP21A2 mutational analysis, secondary PCR amplification of the amplification-created restriction site method was applied. From the results of the analysis, we found that large-gene deletions (or conversions) occurred in 7.5% of the alleles including three different types of the chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 genes and the haplotype of IVS2-12A/C>G in combination with the 707-714del mutation (without the P30L mutation). The CYP21A2 deletion occurred in 2.0% of the alleles which contained three types of the chimeric TNXA/TNXB genes with two novel ones. We concluded that the CYP21A2 deletion in the ethnic Chinese (Taiwanese) patients exhibits a low occurrence, with the haplotype of the IVS2-12A/C>G in combination with the 707-714del mutation (without the P30L mutation) being prevalent among large gene deletions or conversions. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0034903179	Nitric oxide induces extensive apoptosis in endometrial epithelial cells in the presence of progesterone: Involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways	During trophoblast invasion, luminal and glandular endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) have been found to undergo apoptosis through undetermined mechanisms. We postulate that nitric oxide (NO) and progesterone may mediate apoptosis in EEC because they are produced by trophoblasts at concentrations that can cause apoptosis in non-uterine cells. Using a cultured EEC line, RL95-2, we found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), two commonly used NO-releasing agents, caused the death of EEC in a dose-dependent manner and progesterone markedly enhanced NO-induced cytotoxicity. Cells treated with NO/progesterone showed a significant increase in the percentage of condensed nuclei, as detected by DAPI staining, and in caspase-3 activity, indicating that these cells underwent apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis revealed that SNP/NO could activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and, to a lesser extent, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). While pretreatment with PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) did not prevent cell death, the addition of SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) effectively rescued the cells from NO/progesterone treatment. Moreover, SNP/NO-induced p38 MAPK activation was significantly up-regulated by progesterone. Our results demonstrate that NO and progesterone may synergistically activate p38 MAPK to induce apoptosis in EEC, a process that may facilitate implantation.

0034643897	Effects of estrogen on cognition, mood, and cerebral blood flow in AD: A controlled study	Objective: To examine the effects of estrogen therapy on cognition, mood, and cerebral blood flow in patients with AD. Background: Some studies have suggested estrogen may be effective in the treatment of AD. However, most of these studies were not controlled adequately. Methods: Fifty female AD patients were recruited in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial. Each member of the estrogen-treated group received conjugated estrogen (Premarin) 1.25 mg/day. The primary outcome measures were the Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-plus). The secondary outcome measures were Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and

42949092333	Rationale for using raloxifene to prevent both osteoporosis and breast cancer in postmenopausal women	Both osteoporosis with fracture and breast cancer are important health issues for postmenopausal women. It is well known that estrogen and estrogen receptors (ERs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. In past decades, hormone therapy (HT), mainly estrogen plus progestin (EPT), has been frequently used for the purpose of preventing and treating postmenopausal osteoporosis because of its efficacy, but it also contributes to a significant increase in breast cancer. Currently, there is a dilemma regarding the use of estrogen for postmenopausal women. Fortunately, an increasing understanding of the action of estrogen has led ultimately to the design of new drugs that work by virtue of their interaction with the ER; these drugs have come to be known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and are not only effective in preventing osteoporosis and managing those with osteoporosis, but also in decreasing the incidence of breast cancer. Among these SERMs, raloxifene may be the most attractive agent based on the evidence from five recent large trials (Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation [MORE], Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista [CORE], Raloxifene Use for the Heart [RUTH], Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene [STAR], and Evista Versus Alendronate [EVA]). The former three trials showed that raloxifene not only decreases the incidence of osteoporosis-associated fractures, but also has efficacy in breast cancer prevention. The head-to-head comparison with the anti-fracture agent alendronate (EVA trial) and the chemoprevention agent tamoxifen (STAR trial) further confirmed that raloxifene is a better choice. We concluded that since there is an absence of a therapeutic effect on relieving climacteric symptoms and there is the presence of a potential risk of thromboembolism in the use of raloxifene, this drug can be prescribed for clear indications, such as the management of osteoporosis, the prevention of fracture, and decreasing the incidence of invasive breast cancer, with careful monitoring for thromboembolism. It is reasonable to use raloxifene as an appropriate medicine that targets climacteric symptom-free postmenopausal women because of its overall favorable risk-benefit safety profile using the global index proposed by the Women's Health Initiation (WHI). © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

42949125058	The role of selective estrogen receptor modulators on breast cancer: From tamoxifen to raloxifene	The link between hormones and breast cancer growth and development has been recognized for more than a century. Estrogen stimulates the proliferation of breast epithelial cells, and both endogenous and exogenous estrogens have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Classically, estrogen action at target sites around the body is mediated through related but distinct estrogen receptors (ERs), designated ERα and ERβ, to alter gene expression. This accumulating understanding of the mechanism of action of estrogen led ultimately to the design of antiestrogenic agents that work by virtue of their interaction with the ER; these drugs have come to be known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Tamoxifen, a SERM, emerged as the first antiestrogenic agent that is clinically applicable to breast cancer. Tamoxifen became the "gold standard" and established the principles of tumor targeting and identified the appropriate treatment strategy to aid survivorship in breast cancer patients, with enhancement of disease-free survival and a 50% decrease in recurrences observed in ER-positive patients 15 years after diagnosis. However, because of the many adverse events in the use of tamoxifen, some of which have contributed to significant morbidity and mortality, drug modification which has resulted in fewer incidences of adverse events without compromising the therapeutic effect for breast cancer prevention may face an easier road to acceptance. Raloxifene may be a better alternative, since evidence from large clinical trials showed that raloxifene not only decreases the incidence of osteoporosis and related fractures, but also offers benefits for breast cancer prevention. The results from the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial showed the superiority of raloxifene over tamoxifen, not only for the equal efficacy in the prevention of invasive breast cancer but also for the fewer serious adverse events. Taken together, without other competition so far, raloxifene is recommended for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who also need breast cancer prevention.

42949126825	Medical treatment for uterine myomas	Uterine myomas are the most common benign tumors in the female reproductive tract. Most women with myomas are asymptomatic. Therefore, expectant observation and follow-up are often recommended for these myoma patients. However, myomas may cause menstrual symptoms, pelvic pain, pressure complaints, subfertility or pregnancy-related complications, with resultant requests for a definitive treatment. The management of myomas has become multidisciplinary in the past 20 years. Basically, the choice of treatment depends on the patient's age, the reason for treatment, the issue of fertility preservation, and the patient's preference. The treatment spectrum includes an expectant management, medical therapy, surgical intervention, uterine artery embolization or ablative techniques. Medical therapy is an option for women with symptomatic myomas who prefer non-surgical treatment, consider fertility preservation, or expect a less aggressive operation after shrink-age of the uterine volume. This review will summarize the recent well-documented drugs for the management of uterine myomas.

43449117768	Increase of oxidative stress in human sperm with lower motility	Objective: To investigate the causal role of oxidative-stress status on human sperm motility. Design: To demonstrate that sperm with higher oxidative damage have a lower antioxidant capacity. Setting: University hospital infertility center. Patient(s): Seventy-eight semen samples were obtained from 35 healthy donors who had normal semen characteristics and from 43 infertile or subfertile males. Intervention(s): The levels of oxidative damage (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG] and lipid peroxides) and antioxidants (retinol, α-tocopherol, ascorbate, and protein thiols) in the spermatozoa and/or seminal plasma were measured. Main Outcome Measure(s): We analyzed the specific content of 8-OHdG and lipid peroxides by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrochemical detection and HPLC-fluorescence analysis, respectively. Retinol and α-tocopherol were analyzed by using an HPLC system, whereas ascorbate and protein thiols were determined by using spectrophotometry. 8-Hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine was visualized by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-8-OHdG antibody that was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. Lipid peroxides in spermatozoa were stained with a fluorescent dye, C11-BODIPY

54349114245	Laparoscopic Uterine Vessel Occlusion in the Treatment of Women with Symptomatic Uterine Myomas with and without Adding Laparoscopic Myomectomy: 4-Year Results	Study Objective: To estimate the necessity of laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) in the treatment of women with symptomatic uterine myomas who are undergoing laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion (LUVO). Design: A comparative observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). Setting: Medical center. Patients: In all, 163 patients with symptomatic, uncomplicated myomas warranting myomectomy. A total of 95 patients underwent LUVO and 68 underwent LUVO with LM. Interventions: Symptomatic myomas treated by LUVO with or without LM. Measurements and Main Results: The outcome was measured by comparing surgical parameters, immediate postoperative parameters, 4-year evaluations of symptom control, and reintervention (hysterectomy or myomectomy) in both groups. The general characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups. No statistical differences existed in complications, success rate, or immediate satisfaction rate between the 2 groups. Compared with LUVO+LM, LUVO had advantages in surgical and immediate postoperative parameters, including less operative time, minimal blood loss, and rapid postoperative recovery; however, LUVO+LM was superior to LUVO in terms of a better and longer duration of symptom relief, a higher level of satisfaction, and avoidance of reintervention. Of the sexually active patients who did not use contraception, 58.8% (10/17) and 66.7% (4/6) became pregnant in groups I and II, respectively (no statistical significance). Conclusion: Although LUVO is a less invasive procedure in the treatment of most women with symptomatic myomas, it is also less effective for symptom control and has shorter durable symptom relief compared with LUVO+LM. Reoperation can be avoided in most patients who are treated with LUVO+LM. © 2008 AAGL.

67349149615	Comparison of ultraminilaparotomy for myomectomy through midline vertical incision or modified Pfannenstiel incision-a prospective short-term follow-up	Objective: To evaluate the short-term therapeutic outcome of myomectomy using ultraminilaparotomy (UMLT) through a midline vertical incision (MVI) or a modified Pfannenstiel incision (MPI) in the treatment of myomas. Design: Controlled, nonrandomized clinical study. Setting: University-affiliated medical center. Patient(s): Ninety-eight patients with symptomatic, uncomplicated myomas warranting myomectomy. Forty-three patients underwent UMLT myomectomy by MVI and 55 by MPI. Intervention(s): UMLT myomectomy through MI or MPI access. Main Outcome Measure(s): The outcome was measured by comparing incision length, blood loss, operative time, postoperative pain, complications, success rate, postoperative recovery, and the return to work capability in both groups. Result(s): General characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups. There were no statistical differences in postoperative recovery, complications, and success rate between the two groups. However, the operative technique seemed to be easier and more acceptable in the MVI group compared with that in the MPI group, because of the smaller incision wound, less operation time, and less blood loss. By contrast, less postoperative pain and an earlier return to work capability were noted in the MPI group. Conclusion(s): This study has demonstrated that UMLT myomectomy using either a MVI or MPI can be applied in the successful management of uncomplicated myomas. The MPI technique was more complicated, but yielded less wound pain and earlier postoperative recovery for the women during this 1-year short-term follow-up. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

67349236707	Abnormal cerebral metabolism during menstrual pain in primary dysmenorrhea	Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM, menstrual pain without pelvic abnormality) is the most common gynecological disorder for women in the reproductive age. It is characterized by cramping pain and enhanced pain sensitivity during the menstruation period. PDM has been associated with peripheral and central sensitization. Abnormal brain mechanisms may further contribute to development and maintenance of the state. Using fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, increased activity was observed in prefrontal/orbitofrontal regions and left ventral posterior thalamus while decreased activity mainly was observed in sensorimotor regions of the left hemisphere at onset compared to offset of PDM. These results were specific to menstrual pain and were not found in menstrual matched controls. Orbitofrontal activities were positively related to while somatosensory activities where negatively related to subjective pain ratings. These results show that ongoing menstrual pain in PDM is accompanied by abnormal brain metabolism. Disinhibition of thalamo-orbitofrontal-prefrontal networks may contribute to the generation of pain and hyperalgesia in PDM possibly by maintaining spinal and thalamic sensitization while increasing negative affect. Excessive excitatory input during menstrual pain may induce compensatory inhibitory mechanism in several somatic sensorimotor regions. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

67651095858	Symptomatic myoma treated with laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion and subsequent immediate myomectomy: which is the optimal surgical approach?	Objective: To determine the optimal surgical approach when patients are treated with laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion (LUVO) combined with myomectomy in the management of women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Design: An observational study. Setting: Medical centers. Patient(s): One hundred thirty-one patients with symptomatic myomas underwent LUVO plus laparoscopic myomectomy (LM; LUVO+LM) (n = 49) or LUVO plus ultra-mini laparotomy UMLT-M (LUVO+UMLT-M) (n = 82). Intervention(s): Myomectomy through laparoscopy or UMLT access. Main Outcome Measure(s): The outcome was measured by comparing surgical techniques, and 3-year follow-up, including symptom control and reintervention (hysterectomy or myomectomy), in both groups. Result(s): General characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups, except the number of myomas. Surgical techniques seemed to be easier in the LUVO+UMLT-M group than in LUVO+LM group, because of less operation time (56.1 ± 16.9 minutes vs. 73.4 ± 26.9 minutes; P=.009) and a higher success rate (100% vs. 91.8%; P=.018). There were no differences in the 3-year follow-up of the therapeutic outcomes of the LUVO+UMLT-M and LUVO+LM groups, with low reintervention rates (1.2% vs. 0) and good symptom control rates in both groups. Conclusion(s): The LUVO+LM, either through laparoscopy or UMLT, was acceptable in the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids. However, the LUVO+UMLT-M technique might be more feasible, as it required less operative time and had a higher success rate. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

67651115750	Use of a Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist to Manage Perimenopausal Women With Symptomatic Uterine Myomas	Objective: To determine the acceptability and effectiveness of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for the treatment of perimenopausal women with symptomatic uterine myomas. Materials and Methods: The participants included 43 women with symptomatic myomas who wished to retain their uteri. All the women were older than 45 years old, agreed to use the GnRH agonist for menopause induction, and were without any underlying malignancy. They were treated with six courses of GnRH agonist between 2004 and 2005. The definition of re-intervention included: (1) surgical intervention, such as hysterectomy, myomectomy or laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion, or (2) modification of GnRH agonist use. Modification of GnRH agonist use included either failure to complete a 6-month GnRH agonist treatment course, or re-use of GnRH agonist with/without interruption of continuity. Failure was defined as women who underwent surgical intervention or failed to complete the 6-month GnRH agonist treatment. Evaluations were performed every 6 months, for up to 2 years. Results: Re-intervention rates were 14.0% (n = 6), 23.3% (n = 10) and 32.6% (n = 14), and failure rates were 7.0% (n = 3), 11.6% (n = 5) and 16.3% (n = 7), at the end of the 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up periods, respectively. Three patients failed to complete the 6-month GnRH agonist treatment, and four received surgical interventions. Conclusion: More than 80% of women in this study benefited from the use of GnRH agonist to produce menopause, suggesting that this can be an alternative choice for managing perimenopausal women with symptomatic uterine myomas. © 2009 Taiwan Association of Obstetric & Gynecology.

67650468489	Is the surgical approach beneficial to subfertile women with symptomatic extensive adenomyosis?	Aim: Our aim was to assess the role of surgical intervention for symptom control and reproductive performance improvement in the management of subfertile women with symptomatic extensive uterine adenomyosis. Methods: Sixty-five subfertile women with pathology-proven extensive uterine adenomyosis, who were treated with conservative surgery or medical treatment with 6-month gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or combination therapy, were retrospectively reviewed and their data analyzed. Twenty-eight women received conservative surgery with/without GnRH agonist (group A), and 37 received 6-month GnRH agonist therapy only (group B). Follow-up evaluations, including subjective symptoms (a self-reported 6-point verbal numeric rating scale and an analgesic usage score for dysmenorrhea) and objective parameters (serum CA125 level, and uterine size), and clinical pregnancy and successful delivery rates were made semi-annually over the ensuing 3 or more years. Results: The women in group A had higher serum CA125 levels, more infertile years, and a larger uterine size. Subjective symptom control and objective parameters were better in group A during the entire 36-month follow up compared with those in group B. Cumulative 3-year clinical pregnancy and successful delivery rates were significantly higher in group A, compared with those in group B (46.4% [13/28] versus 10.8% [4/37], P = 0.002, and 32.1% [9/28] versus 8.1% [3/37], P = 0.022, respectively). Conclusion: Conservative surgery or combination therapy provides more effective and longer durable symptom control in the management of symptomatic women with extensive uterine adenomyosis, compared with GnRH agonist alone. Reproductive performance was also better in patients treated with conservative surgery with/without GnRH agonist. © 2008 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

69049086013	Comparison of surgery alone and combined surgical-medical treatment in the management of symptomatic uterine adenomyoma	Objective: To compare the efficacy of surgical-medical treatment and surgery alone in the treatment of uterine symptomatic adenomyoma. Design: Prospective nonrandomized study. Setting: Medical centers. Patient(s): One hundred sixty-five women treated with conservative adenomyomectomy. Intervention(s): Surgery followed by six-course treatment (n = 114, surgical-medical group) or no treatment (n = 51, surgery-alone group) with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist regimen. Main Outcome Measure(s): Symptom relief (scale: 0, no symptoms, to 5, worst symptoms) and relapse (when any one scale was ≥2 after treatment) during the 2-year follow-up period. Result(s): The general characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups, except for the diameter of the adenomyoma and age. Patients in both groups had statistically significant symptom relief, and all symptom scores declined from a mean of 3 or 4 to a mean of 1 or less at the end of the 2-year follow-up period. The symptom-relapse rates in the surgical-medical group were statistically significantly lower than those in the surgery alone group (n = 32, 28.1% vs. n = 25, 49.0%, respectively). Conclusion(s): Conservative surgery, regardless of GnRH agonist treatment, may be acceptable for management of a selected population with severe symptomatic adenomyoma. However, surgical-medical treatment provided more effective symptom control (a lower symptom relapse rate) than surgery alone during the 2-year follow-up period. © 2009 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

69449083336	Uterine Vascular Occlusion in Management of Leiomyomas: Laparoscopy vs Laparotomy	Study Objective: To compare the difference between laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion (LUVO) and ultra-minilaparotomy (UMLT) uterine vessel occlusion (UVO) in the management of symptomatic uterine myomas with 2-year follow-up. Design: Observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). Setting: University-associated hospital. Patients: Ninety-one patients with symptomatic leiomyoma. Interventions: Uterine vessel occlusion via laparoscopy (n = 51) or UMLT access (n = 40). Measurements and Main Results: Outcome was determined by comparing operative time, complications, successful operation rate, postoperative pain, time to resumption of a regular diet, time to return to work, 2-year symptom control, relapse of symptoms, and repeat intervention between both groups. There were no statistical differences in 2-year symptom control, relapse of symptoms, repeat intervention, surgical complications, and successful operation rate between the 2 groups; however, LUVO yielded shorter operative time, less operative pain, shorter time to resumption of a regular diet, and earlier return to work, compared with UMLT-UVO. Conclusion: If UVO is chosen for management of symptomatic uterine myoma, both the LUVO and UMLT are acceptable options, with similar therapeutic outcomes; however, LUVO might yield more rapid postoperative recovery. © 2009 AAGL.

0034454685	Carrier analysis and prenatal diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency in Chinese	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder mainly caused by defects in the steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) gene. We screened 1,000 healthy people, using a previously developed differential PCR method combined with single-strand conformation polymorphism and amplification-created restriction site methods for the carrier detection of the CYP21 gene deficiency. Our results indicated that the rate of occurrence of the heterozygous CAH carrier was about 12 in 1,000, with a gene frequency of 0.0060 and an incidence frequency of 1 in 28,000 in the Chinese population. In addition, 9 cases of CAH families were performed with prenatal diagnosis. Among them, 3 cases were diagnosed as the severe form, 4 cases carried the heterozygous mutation, and 2 were normal. This is the first report of carrier frequency analysis and prenatal diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency in Chinese.

0034785582	Altered mRNA expression of sialyltransferase in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix	Objective. Increased sialylation has been reported in various kinds of cancers, but to date, sialylation of cervical carcinoma has never been evaluated. This study of the changes in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of the four sialyltransferases (ST3Gal I, ST3Gal III, ST3Gal IV, and ST6Gal I) in a normal cervix and that with FIGO stage IB1 squamous cell carcinoma was undertaken to assess the extent of sialylation associated with establishment of the carcinoma. Methods. Alterations in ST mRNA expression in FIGO IB1 cervical cancer (n=30) and normal cervixes (n=30) were examined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results. ST6Gal I expression was enhanced in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (P=0.026, Mann-Whitney U test), but mRNA expression from the other three STs (ST3Gal I, ST3Gal III, and ST3Gal IV) was significantly down-expressed in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix compared to the normal cervix (P=0.003, P<0.001, and P=0.001, respectively). High ST6Gal I expression was associated with more invasive properties of cervical cancer, such as deep stromal invasion, lymph or vascular space involvement, and poor differentiation (P=0.010, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Conclusions. A combination of enhanced ST6Gal I mRNA expression and decreased mRNA expression from ST3Gal I, ST3Gal III, and ST3Gal IV might be important in cervical cancer. Future studies will investigate whether RT-PCR detection of the expression of these enzymes can be helpful for prognostic purposes. © 2001 Academic Press.

0035081209	Primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma in Taiwanese women	Purpose of investigation: Primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma is common in industrial countries but rare in the Orient. In fact, it is still a rare disease in Taiwan. In this article, we report the general data of Taiwanese patients with primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Methods: In this retrospective study we used univariate and multivariate analysis models to analyze the prognosis of patients with surgically confirmed primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma. One hundred and ninety-four patients from 1990 to 1996 were identified and enrolled in this study. Results: The mean follow-up time was 44.7 months with an interval between 15.1 months and 105.9 months, Univariate analysis showed postmenopausal status, advanced stage, presence of lymph node metastasis, poor differentiation, and suboptimal surgery as risk factors for disease recurrence and subsequent deaths. Multivariate analysis demonstrated stage as the most important factor correlated with recurrent disease (risk ratio: 7.303 and 5.409, respectively), followed by optimal surgery (RR: 2.447), and cellular differentiation (RR: 1.677). Conclusions: Our data on the Taiwan population were consistent with other reports of different races. Early detection for primary epithelial ovarian cancer is of great importance because stage is still the most important predictor in disease-free survival and disease-related deaths. Application of the most reliable and acceptable methods of screening is our goal in the next century after weighing benefits over costs.

0035099513	Major complications of operative and diagnostic laparoscopy for gynecologic disease	Study Objective. To compare complication rates of diagnostic and operative laparoscopy. Design. Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification 11-2). Setting. One medical center and three teaching hospitals. Patients. Six thousand four hundred fifty-one women with various indications for laparoscopic diagnosis and/or laparoscopic surgery from January 1994 through June 1999. Intervention. Diagnostic and operative laparoscopies. Measurements and Main Results. Forty-two major complications occurred that directly resulted in one death. One patient had stomach injury, 3 had major vessel injuries, 5 had ureter injuries, 10 had intestinal injuries, and 23 had bladder injuries. The overall complication rate for all laparoscopies was 0.65% (42/6451); however, it rose to 0.80% (39/4865) for operative laparoscopy compared with 0.19% for diagnostic laparoscopy (3/1586; p <0.001, Fisher's exact test). Conclusion. Laparoscopic surgery is appropriate for managing various gynecologic diseases and has an acceptable complication rate. However, operative laparoscopy should be performed carefully because its rate of complications is significantly higher than that of diagnostic laparoscopy, especially for laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.

0035136536	Excision of mature teratoma using culdotomy, with and without laparoscopy: A prospective randomised trial	Objective: To compare the results of removing mature teratoma with laparoscopy or without laparoscopy. Design: A prospective, randomised trial. Setting: Medical centre. Participants: Seventy-nine women with mature teratomas identified using results of ultrasound examinations and biochemical markers. Intervention: Cystectomy with laparoscopic approach or without laparoscopic approach through a culdotomy. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to have their cysts removed via vaginal cystectomy without laparoscopy (n = 37, Group A) or laparoscopic cystectomy via culdotomy opening (n = 42, Group B). Inclusion criteria were history of vaginal delivery, no previous abdominal surgery, no history of pelvic inflammatory disease, no medical illness and no presenting symptoms. Eight women randomised to Group A withdrew before surgery. The laparoscopically resected tumours were each put into a cellulose bag, and tumours without laparoscopic-assistance were removed directly via the vagina. Results: Blood loss in Group A (88 ± 37 ml) was significantly more than that in Group B (64 ± 20 ml, P = 0.000). The post-operative recovery times were 20 and 17 hours, respectively (P = 0.030). The rates of successful surgery were 58.6 and 97.6%, respectively (P = 0.002). The spillage rates were 44.8% and 19.0%, respectively (P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in tumour size, patient age, and operative time between groups. Conclusion: Cystectomy without assistance of laparoscopy could be applied to manage mature teratoma of the ovary; however, because of the difficulty of this technique, we had high percentages of tumour spillage and more blood loss during operation and a high percentage of patients who required conversion to laparotomy compared with laparoscopic cystectomy. We favoured laparoscopically assisted cystectomy to manage mature teratoma.

7344247654	Ovarian surgery during pregnancy and puerperium: Twelve-year experience at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei	Background. This study was performed in order to assess the surgical effects and characteristics of ovarian tumors during pregnancy and analyze their prognosis. Methods. Between 1982 and 1993, 121 patients who had undergone ovarian surgery during pregnancy or puerperium were reviewed at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei. These patients were analyzed with particular emphasis on the length of gestation at the time of surgery, complications related to the stage of pregnancy, surgical and pathologic findings and the outcome of pregnancy. Results. Ovarian tumors were commonly detected during the second trimester (54.5%) and most of them (79.3%) were asymptomatic. The pathologic review found 38 patients (31.4%) with benign teratoma, 16 patients (13.1%) with corpus luteum and four patients (3.3%) with malignancy. There was a significant difference between emergent ovarian surgery and elective ovarian surgery in the spontaneous fetal wastage rate (14.1% vs 1%, p = 0.009). Compared with elective surgery, cases necessitating oophorectomy, with or without salpingectomy, increased significantly during emergency surgery (57% vs 36%, p = 0.03). All ovarian surgeries performed before a gestational age of seven weeks resulted in spontaneous fetal wastage. Conclusions. Although the majority of the ovarian tumors detected during pregnancy were benign, emergency laparotomy was sometimes required, which led to an increase in the risk of a fetal wastage. Preconception counseling should be emphasized because early removal of non-functional ovarian tumor before conception, especially teratoma, would decrease the incidence of ovarian surgery during pregnancy. Furthermore, elective and well-prepared surgical intervention appears to be a crucial factor for favorable pregnancy outcome.

77951126619	Pattern and Consequences of First Visits to Obstetricians/gynecologists by Adolescents: A Nationwide Study in Taiwan	Background: Some adolescents have special health care needs. Privacy concerns, unawareness or ethnical/cultural factors are barriers to women visiting obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs). The utilization of OB/GYN services by adolescent girls is seldom reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern and consequences of first visits to OB/GYNs by adolescent girls within the National Health Insurance in Taiwan. Methods: From the 1-million cohort dataset of the National Health Insurance Research Database spanning from 1996 to 2007, adolescent girls visiting OB/GYNs for the first time were identified. The characteristics of first visits were analyzed. Their follow-up visits and admissions within 1 year after their first visits to OB/GYNs were traced. Results: In 2006, only 5.8% (n = 2,682) of 46,582 adolescent girls in our study cohort had their first visits to OB/GYNs: 46.7% with diagnoses of menstrual disorders and 14.8% with diagnoses related to inflammatory or infectious diseases of the genital organs. The examination most frequently ordered was pregnancy test (for 19.9% of these first visits). Very few (0.4%) first visits were for preventive services. Among the infrequent admissions (85 admissions of 75 girls) to obstetric/gynecology wards within 1 year after first visits, the majority (74 of 85 admissions) were pregnancy-related. Conclusion: The leading motivating factor for first visits to OB/GYNs by adolescent girls was menstrual disorders. The majority of subsequent admissions were pregnancy-related, indicating that adolescent pregnancy deserves further attention. © 2010 Elsevier.

77955589293	Brain morphological changes associated with cyclic menstrual pain	Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM) is the most prevalent gynecological disorder for women in the reproductive age. PDM patients suffer from lower abdominal pain that starts with the onset of the menstrual flow. Prolonged nociceptive input to the central nervous system can induce functional and structural alterations throughout the nervous system. In PDM, a chronic viscero-nociceptive drive of cyclic nature, indications of central sensitization and altered brain metabolism suggest a substantial central reorganization. Previously, we hypothesized that disinhibition of orbitofrontal networks could be responsible for increased pain and negative affect in PDM. Here, we further tested this hypothesis. We used an optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to compare total and regional gray matter (GM) increases and decreases in 32 PDM patients with 32 healthy age and menstrual cycle matched (peri-ovulatory phase) controls. Abnormal decreases were found in regions involved in pain transmission, higher level sensory processing, and affected regulation while increases were found in regions involved in pain modulation and in regulation of endocrine function. Moreover, GM changes in regions involved in top-down pain modulation and in generation of negative affect were related to the severity of the experienced PDM pain. Our results demonstrate that abnormal GM volume changes are present in PDM patients even in the absence of pain. These changes may underpin a combination of impaired pain inhibition, increased pain facilitation and increased affect. Our findings highlight that longer lasting central changes may occur not only in sustained chronic pain conditions but also in cyclic occurring pain conditions. © 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

0036181564	Analysis of genetic aberrations in uterine adenomyosis using comparative genomic hybridization	OBJECTIVE: To use comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to analyze frozen tissues from adenomyosis cases to discover and map genomic regions for chromosomal gains and losses. STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective study, upper and lower threshold values of 1.20 and 0.80, respectively, were used to define positive findings. RESULTS: No positive recurrent gene copy number alterations were detected in the 25 cases of pathologically proven adenomyosis. CONCLUSION: Although CGH is extremely useful in investigating candidate genes in the development of adenomyosis, CGH was not useful in this study. Genetic changes might be indeed extremely rare in adenomyosis, or CGH was not sensitive enough to detect candidate genes.

0036310680	Expression of sialyltransferase family members in cervix squamous cell carcinoma correlates with lymph node metastasis	Objective. Altered messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of the four sialyltransferases (STs including ST3Gal I, ST3Gal III, ST3Gal IV, and ST6Gal I) is important in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. This study further investigates their changes in mRNA expression of the four STs in FIGO stage IB1 squamous cell carcinoma to assess the extent of sialylation associated with lymph node metastases. Methods. Alterations in ST mRNA expression in FIGO IB1 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (n = 79) were examined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results. Both ST6Gal I mRNA and ST3Gal III mRNA expressions were significantly increased in patients with lymph node metastases compared to those without lymph node metastases (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). Using receiver operating characteristic curves of ST ratio index for accuracy comparison of lymph node metastases, ST3Gal III and ST6Gal I were observed to be fairly interchangeable (area under the curve (AUC) of 3Gal I = 0.810; AUC of 6Gal I = 0.786, significance of difference between AUC = 0.810). High ST6Gal I expression was associated with other invasive properties of cervical cancer, such as deep stromal invasion and presence of lymph-vascular space involvement. ST6Gal I expression seemed to be more enhanced in bigger tumors. Conclusions. Our results suggested that ST3Gal III and ST6Gal I were of importance for the lymph node metastases in FIGO IB1 cervical cancer patients; more specifically, overexpression of ST6Gal I was of crucial relevance for the presence of poor prognostic factors, such as deep stromal invasion and lymph-vascular space involvement and lymph node metastases. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

83155175324	Power spectral analysis of plethysmographic pulse waveform in pregnant women	Objective. To investigate the effect of pregnancy on the pulse wave of the mother. Patients and methods. Pulse waveforms recorded via a pulse oximeter from the left index finger of non-pregnant women and pregnant women in the three trimesters of pregnancy were Fourier transformed into power spectra. Spectral indices of the power spectra of pulse waveform were obtained and compared among non-pregnant women and pregnant women in the three trimesters of pregnancy. Results. The power of harmonics of pulse wave decayed exponentially with respect to the order of harmonics. The exponent and initial value of exponential decay for the power of harmonics and the power of the 2nd harmonic were increased, whereas the total power of pulse and the powers of higher order harmonics were decreased during pregnancy. Conclusion. The power of harmonics of pulse wave can be described by an exponential decay function with respect to the order of harmonics in both non-pregnant and pregnant women. The effects of pregnancy on the pulse wave are the reduction in the total power of pulse and the power of higher order harmonics, and the increase in the power of lower order harmonics in the power spectrum of pulse wave. This effect of pregnancy on the pulse wave might be caused by the decrease in vascular resistance during pregnancy, the increase in workload on the heart due to increased demand of the growing fetus, and the aortocaval compression caused by the progressively enlarged gravid uterus and fetus. © Springer 2011.

84859428697	The Chinese Utian Quality of Life Scale for women around menopause: Translation and psychometric testing	Objective: Chinese-language scales for assessing quality of life in women around menopause are rare. This study was conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese-language version of the Utian Quality of Life Scale (UQOL-C). Methods: A sample of women (n = 434) between 41 and 60 years old was recruited from an obstetrics/gynecology outpatient department in Taipei. After translating the instrument, we conducted psychometric testing, which included internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. Construct validity of the UQOL-C was examined by testing the correlations between the UQOL-C and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Taiwan version and between the UQOL-C and the Greene Climacteric Scale Chinese version. Results: The Chinese translation captured the content of the original tool. The reliability coefficients (Cronbach α) for the quality of life domains measured were as follows: 0.86, overall; 0.85, occupational; 0.70, health-related; 0.66, emotional; and 0.61, sexual. The test-retest reliability of the UQOL-C was satisfactory (r = 0.88-0.91, P < 0.001). The construct validity of the UQOL-C was confirmed through significant correlations between scores on (1) the UQOL-C and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey Taiwan version (r = 0.15-0.59, P < 0.01) and (2) the UQOL-C and the Greene Climacteric Scale Chinese version (r =-0.10 to-0.56, P < 0.05). Conclusions: The UQOL-C was shown to be reliable and valid with this sample of women between 41 and 60 years old. The low Cronbach α values of the UQOL-C emotional and sexual domains suggested that the reliability of these two domains required further studies. © 2012 by The North American Menopause Society.

0036826069	Establishment of an efficient method to quantify embryo attachment to endometrial epithelial cell monolayers	During implantation, complex embryo-endometrium interactions result in blastocyst adhesion. To study the mechanisms of implantation, an effective assay for monitoring adhesiveness between embryos and endometrial epithelium is essential. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable method to quantify embryo-endometrium adhesion in vitro. Murine blastocysts or BeWo trophoblast spheroids were cocultured with monolayers of RL95-2 endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) grown in 96-well plates. At the end of coculture, the wells were filled with medium, and the plate was sealed with an adhesive film, inverted, and centrifuged at 25 × g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the plate was kept inverted and directly examined microscopically to determine whether the blastocysts or spheroids were attached to EEC monolayers. Our assay demonstrated that blastocysts recovered at 1200-1400 h on d 4 were more adherent to EEC than those recovered earlier, consistent with the timing of intrauterine embryo activation. Serum also enhanced blastocyst-EEC adhesion. SpheroidEEC adhesion was inhibited by blocking Ca

0037622815	Efficacy and safety of raloxifene 60 milligrams/day in postmenopausal Asian women	In healthy Caucasian postmenopausal women, raloxifene increases bone mineral density (BMD), decreases biochemical markers of bone turnover, and lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, without effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. This randomized, double-blind study examines the effects of raloxifene 60 mg/d (n = 483) or placebo (n = 485) in healthy postmenopausal Asian women (mean age 57 yr) from Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Serum osteocalcin, serum N-telopeptide, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Lumbar spine BMD was measured at baseline and 1 yr in 309 women from 4 countries. Clinical adverse events were recorded at each interim visit. At 6 months, raloxifene 60 mg/d significantly decreased osteocalcin, N-telopeptide, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol by medians of 15.9%, 14.6%, 5.3%, and 7.7%, respectively, from placebo. Changes in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were similar between raloxifene and placebo. Raloxifene 60 mg/d increased mean lumbar spine BMD (1.9%) from placebo at 1 yr (P = 0.0003). The incidences of hot flashes (placebo 3.5%, raloxifene 5.6%, P = 0.12), and leg cramps (placebo 2.7%, raloxifene 4.3%, P = 0.16) were not different between groups. No case of venous thromboembolism was reported. The effects of raloxifene 60 mg/d on bone turnover, BMD, and serum lipids in healthy postmenopausal Asian women were similar to that previously reported in Caucasian women.

0037643678	Wound endometriosis: Risk factor evaluation and treatment	Background. Wound endometriosis is still a rare phenomenon. In this study, we tried to identify its risk factors and presented our experience in managing such disease. Methods. We studied twenty-three women with pathologically confirmed wound endometriosis after surgery between January 1990 and June 1999 retrospectively. Results. Patients were classified to three groups according to the types of operations including obstetric surgery (n = 6186), gynecologic surgery (n = 3231) and laparoscopic procedures (n = 2184), which made a significant difference in the occurrence rate of endometriosis (p = 0.04): 2.7 per 1000 obstetric surgeries, 1.5 per 1000 cases of gynecologic surgeries, and 0.5 per 1000 laparoscopic procedures. Obstetric surgery showed the relative risk of occurrence of wound endometriosis 7.71 (95%: 1.03∼57.92) compared with laparoscopic procedures. The median time for occurrence of wound endometriosis in patients with normal preoperative CA-125 (< 15 mIU/ml), 760 days, was significantly longer than that in patients with abnormal preoperative CA-125 (> 15 mIU/ml) of 496 days (p = 0.03). Preoperative CA125 level, patient's age, preoperative extent of endometriosis, or operative time made no significant contributions to the occurrence of wound endometriosis. Combination therapy of surgical excision and postoperative adjuvant therapy of GnRH-agonist or Danazol® showed the better prognosis because it could decrease the recurrence of wound endometriosis (42.9% versus 11%, p = 0.01). Conclusion. Obstetric surgery may be an important risk factor in contributing to wound endometriosis, and the aggressive behavior of endometriosis itself might also be a possible risk factor because it shortens the time of occurrence of wound endometriosis after surgery. Therapy might be dependent on individuals. Surgical excision with postoperative adjuvant therapy of either GnRH-agonist or Danazol® might be valid, although its effectiveness needed proven in the future.

0038512579	Enhanced expression of α 2,6-sialyltransferase ST6Gal I in cervical squamous cell carcinoma	Objective. Increased messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of β-galactoside α 2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal I) is important in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix. In many tissues, ST6Gal I is transcriptionally regulated through the use of promoters that originate in the mRNA species that diverge in the 5′-untranslated regions. To clarify the roles of ST6Gal I mRNA species in cervical SCC, we investigated their expression, including a "constitutive" promoter (placental or Y + Z form), "hepatic" promoter (H form), and a specific lymphoblastic promoter (X form), in normal and SCC tissues of the cervix using real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods. Expression of the ST6Gal I species was investigated in normal cervical tissue samples (n = 38) and FIGO IB1 cervical SCC samples (n = 38) by relatively quantitative real-time RT-PCR, using primers designed for amplification of a portion of the coding region common to all mRNA species or ones for amplification of the placental transcript, the hepatic transcript, or lymphoblastic transcript. Results. ST6Gal I mRNA expression was significantly increased in cancerous tissues compared to that in normal tissues (P = 0.004, Mann-Whitney U test; P < 0.001, paired t test). Expression of the Y + Z form did not appear to be affected by cancer transformation, since it was detected at comparable levels in normal and cancerous tissues (P = 0.986), but H form expression was significantly enhanced in cancerous tissues compared to that in normal tissues (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test and paired t test). Surprisingly, the X form could be detected in some patients with and without cancer, but the detection rate was significantly higher in patients with cancer (86.8% vs 52.6%, respectively; P = 0.021, Fisher's exact test). Although the X transcript was detected at a low level compared to the H and Y + Z transcripts, its expression was also significantly enhanced in patients with cancers compared to those without cancers (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test and paired t test). Conclusions. An increased level of hepatic transcripts may be important in cancer transformation because the transcripts contribute to enhance ST6Gal I expression in cancerous tissues. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

0038692047	Duplication of 111 bases in exon 1 of the CYP21 gene is combined with deletion of CYP21P-C4B genes in steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder mainly caused by defects in the steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) gene. A 9.3-kb fragment generated by NdeI and AseI digestion by Southern blot analysis indicated that a consequence of deletion of the C4-CYP21 repeat module was the production of a distinct chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 molecule. In the present study, we report a novel CYP21 genotype in two CAH families in which the gene appeared as 9.4- and 3.3-kb fragments by TaqI digestion, rather than as a chimeric gene. From the analysis of PCR amplification patterns and DNA sequencing, we found that there was a duplication of 111 bases from codons 21 to 57 inserted at codon 58 in exon 1 of the CYP21 gene. In addition, codon 21 in the repeated sequence changed from TGG to AGG. Furthermore, this novel CYP21 gene present in both CAH families showed no mutations at IVS2-12A/C > G, 707-714delGAGACTAC, and P30L. Interestingly, the 5′ end region of these two CYP21 genes showed the sequence of the CYP21P gene at nucleotides (nt) -103, -110, -123, and thereafter. Our data suggest that these two CYP21 genes are caused by deletion of the CYP21P, XA, RP2, and C4B genes. Possibly, the additional 111-base duplicated coding sequence may be generated by multiple intergenic recombinations, while there seems to be no relationship with deletion of the CYP21P-C4B regions. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

84878019956	Reproductive performance of severely symptomatic women with uterine adenomyoma who wanted preservation of the uterus and underwent combined surgical-medical treatment	Objective: To assess the factors associated with future pregnancy and successful delivery in women who were treated for uterine adenomyoma with combination (surgical-medical) therapy using ultramini- or mini-laparotomy conservative surgery and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. Materials and Methods: One hundred and two women were evaluated. Items for analysis included: age, body mass index, and conception history; clinical symptoms of dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia; tumor location and preoperative serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125); the intraoperative findings of the weight of the removed tumor, and the uterine cavity opening. Results: After excluding those patients using contraception or searching for an assisted reproductive technique, a total of 56 women were enrolled for analysis. Twenty-three (41.1%) women had 27 clinical pregnancies after 3 years of follow-up; 15 went on to deliver a healthy live-born child; two delivered preterm but healthy babies; seven had elective abortions; four had spontaneous abortions; and one had an ectopic pregnancy. The women who had a successful delivery during the 3-year follow-up after treatment tended to be younger, with a lower body mass index, lower baseline analgesic usage score, and lower preoperative serum level of CA125, be nulliparous, and with an adenoma in an anterior location. The linear regression model showed that age and baseline analgesic usage score were independent predictors of successful delivery and accounted for 56.5% of the total variance related to successful delivery. Conclusion: Age was an important factor associated with future successful delivery, therefore, caution should be taken in considering the maintenance of future fertility in older women treated with surgical-medical therapy. © 2013.

84880787632	Brain Signature Characterizing the Body-Brain-Mind Axis of Transsexuals	Individuals with gender identity disorder (GID), who are commonly referred to as transsexuals (TXs), are afflicted by negative psychosocial stressors. Central to the psychological complex of TXs is the conviction of belonging to the opposite sex. Neuroanatomical and functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the GID is associated with brain alterations. In this study, we found that TXs identify, when viewing male-female couples in erotic or non-erotic ("neutral") interactions, with the couple member of the desired gender in both situations. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the TXs, as opposed to controls (CONs), displayed an increased functional connectivity between the ventral tegmental area, which is associated with dimorphic genital representation, and anterior cingulate cortex subregions, which play a key role in social exclusion, conflict monitoring and punishment adjustment. The neural connectivity pattern suggests a brain signature of the psychosocial distress for the gender-sex incongruity of TXs. © 2013 Ku et al.

84881659792	Menstrual pain is associated with rapid structural alterations in the brain	Dysmenorrhea is the most prevalent gynecological disorder in women of child-bearing age. Dysmenorrhea is associated with central sensitization and functional and structural changes in the brain. Our recent brain morphometry study disclosed that dysmenorrhea is associated with trait-related abnormal gray matter (GM) changes, even in the absence of menstrual pain, indicating that the adolescent brain is vulnerable to menstrual pain. Here we report rapid state-related brain morphological changes, ie, between pain and pain-free states, in dysmenorrhea. We used T1-weighted anatomic magnetic resonance imaging to investigate regional GM volume changes between menstruation and periovulatory phases in 32 dysmenorrhea subjects and 32 age- and menstrual cycle-matched asymptomatic controls. An optimized voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted to disclose the possible state-related regional GM volume changes across different menstrual phases. A correlation analysis was also conducted between GM differences and the current menstrual pain experience in the dysmenorrhea group. Compared with the periovulatory phase, the dysmenorrhea subjects revealed greater hypertrophic GM changes than controls during the menstruation phase in regions involved in pain modulation, generation of the affective experience, and regulation of endocrine function, whereas atrophic GM changes were found in regions associated with pain transmission. Volume changes in regions involved in the regulation of endocrine function and pain transmission correlated with the menstrual pain experience scores. Our results demonstrated that short-lasting cyclic menstrual pain is associated not only with trait-related but also rapid state-related structural alterations in the brain. Considering the high prevalence rate of menstrual pain, these findings mandate a great demand to revisit dysmenorrhea with regard to its impact on the brain and other clinical pain conditions. © 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

0242267096	Induction of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Mediated Apoptosis Is Involved in Outgrowth of Trophoblast Cells on Endometrial Epithelial Cells in a Model of Human Trophoblast-Endometrial Interactions	During embryo implantation in species with hemochorial placentation, such as the mouse and human, trophoblast cells of the attached blastocyst penetrate the luminal epithelium of the endometrium before invasion into the endometrial stroma. Signs of apoptosis were demonstrated in luminal endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) adjacent to the trophoblast cells; however, the signaling mechanisms leading to apoptosis in EEC remain unclear. Because mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) were shown to mediate apoptosis in several model systems and found to be activated in the uterus during decidualization, the possible involvement of MAPK during trophoblast-EEC interactions was studied. By coculturing BeWo human trophoblast spheroids with RL95-2 human EEC monolayers to mimic the blastocyst-endometrial interaction, we found that most spheroids rapidly attached to EEC monolayers and then progressively expanded, with marked dislodgment of EEC adjacent to the spreading trophoblast cells. Immunoblotting analysis showed that both p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were activated in EEC after coculture. However, only SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor), but not PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor), inhibited trophoblast outgrowth on EEC monolayers through the suppression of p38 MAPK activation in EEC. Furthermore, trophoblast expansion caused prominent EEC apoptosis at the spheroid-EEC interface, as detected by annexin V labeling and valyl-alanylaspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (which binds activated caspases) staining, and SB203580 significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Our results, based on a model of human trophoblast-EEC interactions, establish that trophoblast cells cause activation of p38 MAPK in EEC and, consequently, induce apoptosis and displacement of EEC, a process that may facilitate implantation.

84899632556	Hormone therapy for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer	The "gold standard" treatment for endometrial cancer is completely staged surgery, followed by radiation or chemotherapy, based on the final pathological surgical stage and requirements. In the primary treatment of endometrial cancers, hormones are rarely taken into consideration after primary surgery. Primary treatment with hormones to preserve fertility in younger women with endometrial cancer is an attractive option, and many successful cases have been reported, although the majority of them finally received definite therapy, including total hysterectomy. The role of hormone therapy is often delayed in recurrent disease; response rates to progestins and tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancers are approximately 15-20% and nearly ≤10%, respectively. This review is focused on updated information and recent knowledge on the use of hormones in the management of women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancers. © 2014.

The diagnosis is often delayed, and mortality sometimes occurs with delayed diagnosis and treatment, especially in elderly and disabled women. To increase knowledge of this unusual condition-vesical stone associated with VVF-we present a case report, and summarize the published cases to review this topic, focusing on the etiology, symptoms and signs, and recent management strategy. Finally, based on this case report, we emphasize that careful physical examination and the use of less invasive and economic tools, such as plain X-ray are important to investigate this very sick and old lady, because these strategies could help us to make an accurate diagnosis earlier without the need for more aggressive, invasive, and expensive tools. © 2013.

84907534797	Primary fallopian tube cancer: Domestic data and up-to-date review	Primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is a rare gynecological malignancy with the following characteristics: its preoperative diagnosis is easy to miss or delay because of a lack of specific symptoms and signs; it is difficult to distinguish from serous epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal serous carcinoma during or even after operation because they have the same histopathological features; and there is uncertainty regarding the optimal management because of the lack of available standard guidelines. All of these factors contribute to the major challenge of undertaking a comprehensive study of this disease. To improve our understanding of this rare disease, the domestic data were summarized first. We searched PubMed on this topic, using the term "primary fallopian tube tumor and Taiwan" (from January 1, 1990 to November 3, 2013) and identified 15 published articles, but only 11 studies focused on the outcome of patients with PFTC in Taiwan. These limited data were not enough to increase our knowledge in dealing with this disease; therefore, the addition of large series or published review articles addressing this topic was needed. According to these reports, we concluded: (1) the main type of PFTC was serous type, often poorly differentiated; (2) the diagnosis of PFTC is frequently missed or delayed; (3) PFTC is often of an earlier International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage than is epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), because of the appearance of earlier but nonspecific symptoms or signs, such as abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and watery discharge or mass; (4) the most important clinicopathological prognostic factor was FIGO stage; (5) the therapeutic strategy is still uncertain, but is often based on the guidelines for treating EOC. An intensive surgical effort such as a complete surgical resection or optimal cytoreduction surgery with a minimal residual tumor followed by a platinum-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy with/without targeted therapy (for example, antiangiogenesis agents) may provide the best possibility of disease-free or overall survival.

84911410793	Association of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene Val66Met polymorphism with primary dysmenorrhea	Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), the most prevalent menstrual cycle-related problem in women of reproductive age, is associated with negative moods. Whether the menstrual pain and negative moods have a genetic basis remains unknown. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in the production of central sensitization and contributes to chronic pain conditions. BDNF has also been implicated in stress-related mood disorders. We screened and genotyped the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) in 99 Taiwanese (Asian) PDMs (20-30 years old) and 101 age-matched healthy female controls. We found that there was a significantly higher frequency of the Met allele of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in the PDM group. Furthermore, BDNF Met/Met homozygosity had a significantly stronger association with PDM compared with Val carrier status. Subsequent behavioral/hormonal assessments of sub-groups (PDMs = 78, controls = 81; eligible for longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging battery studies) revealed that the BDNF Met/Met homozygous PDMs exhibited a higher menstrual pain score (sensory dimension) and a more anxious mood than the Val carrier PDMs during the menstrual phase. Although preliminary, our study suggests that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with PDM in Taiwanese (Asian) people, and BDNF Met/Met homozygosity may be associated with an increased risk of PDM. Our data also suggest the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism as a possible regulator of menstrual pain and painrelated emotions in PDM. Absence of thermal hypersensitivity may connote an ethnic attribution. The presentation of our findings calls for further genetic and neuroscientific investigations of PDM.

84924843506	Neural network of body representation differs between transsexuals and cissexuals	Body image is the internal representation of an individual's own physical appearance. Individuals with gender identity disorder (GID), commonly referred to as transsexuals (TXs), are unable to form a satisfactory body image due to the dissonance between their biological sex and gender identity. We reasoned that changes in the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) network would neurologically reflect such experiential incongruence in TXs. Using graph theory-based network analysis, we investigated the regional changes of the degree centrality of the rsFC network. The degree centrality is an index of the functional importance of a node in a neural network. We hypothesized that three key regions of the body representation network, i.e., the primary somatosensory cortex, the superior parietal lobule and the insula, would show a higher degree centrality in TXs. Twenty-three pre-treatment TXs (11 male-to-female and 12 female-to-male TXs) as one psychosocial group and 23 age-matched healthy cissexual control subjects (CISs, 11 males and 12 females) were recruited. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and binarized rsFC networks were constructed. The TXs demonstrated a significantly higher degree centrality in the bilateral superior parietal lobule and the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition, the connectivity between the right insula and the bilateral primary somatosensory cortices was negatively correlated with the selfness rating of their desired genders. These data indicate that the key components of body representation manifest in TXs as critical function hubs in the rsFC network. The negative association may imply a coping mechanism that dissociates bodily emotion from body image. The changes in the functional connectome may serve as representational markers for the dysphoric bodily self of TXs. © 2014 Lin et al.
