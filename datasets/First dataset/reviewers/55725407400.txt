84940360751	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy	Background: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is the hot research in the field of genetics at home and abroad and there still lacks of the effective treatment method. Objective: To analyze the efficacy and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on the treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in two cases. Methods: Two cases of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were selected from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology for comprehensive analysis and genetic testing. The success of the transplantation and the occurrence of complications after transplantation were observed. Results and Conclusion: Both of the two cases were childhood cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. One case had successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but with serious transplant-related complications, and the other one case was failed. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an effective method for treatment of early childhood cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, but the ultimate effect was related with the success of transplantation and post-transplant complications and other factors, and the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation still needs long-term investigation.

21044447902	Role of fibrinogen-like protein 2 prothrombinase/fibroleukin in experimental and human allograft rejection	Immune coagulation is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of xenograft rejection, viral-induced hepatocellular injury and cytokine-induced fetal loss syndrome. In this study, we investigated the contribution of the novel gene product, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (fgl2) prothrombinase, in mediating immune injury in experimental and human acute allograft rejection. Using a mouse heterotopic cardiac transplant model, mouse fgl2 (mfgl2)/fibroleukin mRNA transcripts and protein were highly expressed in macrophages, CD4- and CD8-positive T lymphocytes, and endothelial cells in rejecting cardiac allografts in association with deposits of fibrin. Although mfgl2-deficient mice rejected allografts at similar rates to littermate controls, survival of grafts from mfgl2-deficient mice were prolonged and deposition of intravascular fibrin was diminished. Treatment of wild-type mice with a neutralizing anti-fgl2 Ab ameliorated histological evidence for allorejection and intravascular fibrin deposition, and resulted in an increase in graft survival. To address further the relevance of fgl2 in acute allograft rejection, we examined kidney biopsies from patients who had undergone renal transplantation. Human fgl2 mRNA transcripts and protein were markedly expressed mainly in renal tubule cells, infiltrating lymplioid cells including macrophages, CD8

33745645833	Novel mfgl2 antisense plasmid inhibits murine fgl2 expression and ameliorates murine hepatitis virus type 3-induced fulminant hepatitis in BALB/cJ mice	Our previous reports, both experimental and human studies, have shown the importance of fibrinogen-like protein-2 (fgl2) prothrombinase in the development of fulminant viral hepatitis, a disease with a mortality of more than 80% in cases lacking immediate organ transplantation. To interfere with this potentially effective target, a 322-bp mouse fgl2 (mfgl2) antisense plasmid complementary to the exon 1 sequence of the gene, including the translation initiation site AUG, was successfully constructed. A dose-dependent inhibitory effect on mfgl2 expression by mfgl2 antisense plasmid was observed in interferon-γ-treated RAW 264.7 cells. On hydrodynamic delivery, mfgl2 antisense plasmid significantly reduced mfgl2 expression in vivo; markedly ameliorated inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrin deposition, and hepatocyte necrosis; prolonged the survival time period; and elevated the survival rate among BALB/cJ mice with murine hepatitis virus type 3-induced fulminant hepatitis. This study may provide an effective way to interfere with the potential therapeutic target fgl2 gene for fulminant viral hepatitis and other diseases with similar pathological characteristics of microcirculation disorders, including acute rejection of xeno- or allograft transplantation and fetal loss syndrome, in which studies show fgl2 plays an important role. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

33747618012	CXCR2 blockade reduces radical formation in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rat lung	Inflammation contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In previous studies, we showed that blocking neutrophil influx by treatment with SB265610, a selective CXCR2 antagonist, could partly reduce superoxide accumulation and preserve alveolar development in 60% O2-exposed newborn rats. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the role of neutrophils in the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species mediating hyperoxia-impaired lung development. We found that hydroxyl radical formation and lipid peroxidation in rat lungs were significantly increased during 60% O2 exposure. These increases were attenuated by the administration of SB265610. In addition, SB265610 largely inhibited protein nitration induced by hyperoxia. SB265610 partly prevented the hyperoxia-enhanced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein content in 60% O2-exposed animals. Our results demonstrate that neutrophils have a pivotal role in hydroxyl radical formation, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. Taken together with our previous studies, the present findings show that blocking neutrophil influx protects alveolar development and improves lung function in part by preventing reactive oxygen/nitrogen species accumulation.

34248198256	Comparative study on the selected area electron diffraction pattern of Fe oxide/Au core-shell structured nanoparticles	The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of magnetic iron oxide core/gold shell nanoparticles has been studied. For the composite particles with mean size less than 10 nm, their SAED pattern is found to be different from either the pattern of pure Fe oxide nanoparticles or that of pure Au particles. Based on the fact that the ring diameters of these composite particles fit the characteristic relation for the fcc structure, the Au atoms on surfaces of the concerned particles are supposed to pack in a way more tightly than they usually do in pure Au nanoparticles. The driving force for this is the coherency strain which enables the shell material at the heterostructured interface to adapt the lattice parameters of the core.

36849003958	Protection of INS-1 cells from free fatty acid-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the glycogen synthase kinase-3	To examine the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) in the apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells to better understand the pathogenesis and to find new approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes, apoptosis was induced by oleic acid (OA) in INS-1 cells and the activity of GSK-3 was inhibited by LiCl. The PI staining and flow cytometry were employed for the evaluation of apoptosis. The phosphorylation level of GSK-3 was detected by Western blotting. The results showed that OA at 0.4 mmol/L could cause conspicuous apoptosis of INS-1 cells and the activity of GSK-3 was significantly increased. After the treatment with 24 mmol/L of LiCl, a inhibitor of GSK-3, the OA-induced apoptosis of INS-1 cells was lessened and the phosphorylation of GSK-3 was increased remarkably. It is concluded that GSK-3 activation plays an important role in OA-induced apoptosis in pancreatic-cells and inhibition of the GSK-3 activity can effectively protect INS-1 cells from the OA-induced apoptosis. Our study provides a new experimental basis and target for the clinical treatment of type-2 diabetes. © 2007 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

36849064742	Detection of HBV and HCV coinfection by TEM with Au nanoparticle gene probes	Gold(Au) nanoparticle HBV DNA or HCV cDNA gene probes were prepared and were used to detect HBV DNA and HCV RNA extracted from positive serum of patients with HBV and HCV coinfection directly by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PCR identifying HBV and HCV in serum of patients with HBV and HCV coinfection was established. Alkanethiol-modified oligonucleotide was bound with self-made Au nanoparticles to form nanoparticle HBV DNA or HCV cDNA gene probes through covalent binding of Au-S. HBV DNA and HCV RNA extracted from positive serum of patients with HBV and HCV coinfectionw as added to the detection system composed of nanoparticle HBV DNA and(or) HCV cDNA gene probes. The results showed that HBV DNA and HCV RNA could be specifically amplified by PCR. The zones of DNA amplification appeared in 431 bp and 323 bp respectively. When HBV DNA and HCV RNA extracted from positive serum of patients with HBV and HCV coinfection were added to the detection system, TEM displayed the nanoparticles self-assembled into large network aggregates. It was concluded that the detection of HBV and HCV coinfection by TEM was convenient and efficient with high specificity and sensitivity. © 2007 Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

38349165374	The detection of HBV DNA with gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticle gene probes	Gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticle Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA probes were prepared, and their application for HBV DNA measurement was studied. Gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared by the citrate reduction of tetra-chloroauric acid in the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles which were added as seeds. With a fluorescence-based method, the maximal surface coverage of hexaethiol 30-mer oligonucleotides and the maximal percentage of hybridization strands on gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were (120 ± 8) oligonucleotides per nanoparticle, and (14 ± 2%), respectively, which were comparable with those of (132 ± 10) and (22 ± 3%) in Au nanoparticle groups. Large network aggregates were formed when gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticle HBV DNA gene probe was applied to detect HBV DNA molecules as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and the high specificity was verified by blot hybridization. Our results further suggested that detecting DNA with iron oxide nanoparticles and magnetic separator was feasible and might be an alternative effective method. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) indicate that there are two populations of well-dispersed nanoparticles: one is the small-diameter iron oxide particles with metallic gold shell, while the other is the moderately large gold particles containing magnetic core/cores. A close relation between the maximum optical absorbance of characteristic gold colloid and the magnetic field applied during performance of high-gradient magnetic filtration confirms further that nearly all the particles of Au character contain magnetic inclusion. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

34247403411	Atomic, electronic, and magnetic structure of the Au (100) Fe3 O4 (100) interface: Density functional theory study	The relative stability, the electronic structure, and the magnetic properties of the four models for Au (100) Fe3 O4 (100) interface have been studied using density functional theory. From calculations, we find that all the interface energies of the four models are dependent linearly on the O chemical potential. At the same time, we predict the most stable structure of Au (100) Fe3 O4 (100) interface. The density of states, the total energies, and the atomic spin magnetic moments of the four interface models are also calculated, which show that the half-metallic properties of bulk Fe3 O4 are destroyed in the four models due to the charge transfer between Au layers and the Fe3 O4 surface. In addition, from the total energies of the relaxed interface models in three magnetic states corresponding to ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and nonmagnetic, we get the ground states of the four relaxed interface models, respectively. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

84861596451	A Chinese patient with acquired partial lipodystrophy caused by a novel mutation with LMNB2 gene	Acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL) is a rare disorder, mainly characterized by progressive loss of subcutaneous fatty tissue, starting from the face and spreading to the upper part of the body. The etiology of APL is unknown. It may be caused by mutations in the lamin B 2 (LMNB2) gene on 19p13.3. We present a Chinese patient who had APL for 12 years, which initially affected her face. She also suffered from marked fatty liver and a mild metabolic disorder. We identified a heterozygous T to C transition in exon 5 of the LMNB2 gene (c.694T>C), and, consequently, tyrosine for histidine (p.Y232H). However, these features and the mutation were absent in her parents. The p.Y232H has not been described previously. We provide clinical data to the genotype-phenotype discussion and further expanded the number of LMNB2 mutations. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

84867100989	Downregulation of FGL2/prothrombinase delays HCCLM6 xenograft tumour growth and decreases tumour angiogenesis	Background: Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), which directly generates thrombin from prothrombin without activation of the conventional coagulation cascade, was shown to be overexpressed in various human malignant tumours. Aims: Herein, we aimed to investigate its expression pattern, biological function and mechanism of action in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: FGL2 expression and colocalization with fibrin was examined in 15 HCC tissues. FGL2 downregulation was performed by targeting microRNA in a HCCLM6 cell line in which FGL2 was highly expressed in xenografts of nude mice. The effects of FGL2 knockdown on tumour growth and angiogenesis were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cytometric bead arrays were employed to identify FGL2-regulated signalling pathways. Results: FGL2 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and colocalized with fibrin deposition. Knockdown of FGL2 expression in HCCLM6 cells (hFGL2

46849090323	The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV induces transcription of hfgl2 prothrombinase gene dependent on C/EBP alpha	Fibrin deposition was universal in the lungs of SARS patients and fgl2 prothrombinase gene, a novel procoagulant, was demonstrated to express highly in a clinically relevant SARS model. To investigate whether and which structural protein of SARS-CoV induced transcription of hfgl2 prothrombinase gene, three eukaryotic expression plasmids expressing nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M) and spike protein 2 (S2) of SARS-CoV were co-transfected with hfgl2 promoter luciferase-reporter plasmids and β-galactosidase plasmid in CHO cells, respectively. M, N and S2 protein of SARS-CoV were detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. Further assays demonstrated that expression of hfgl2 gene was related with N protein, but not with M or S2 protein in THP-1 cells and Vero cells. N protein significantly induced functional procoagulant activity in comparison with control group. Luciferase assay showed that N protein of SARS-CoV could activate the transcription of hfgl2 promoter compared with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Site-directed mutagenesis and EMSA assay further demonstrated that transcription factor C/EBP alpha band with its cognate cis-element in hfgl2 promoter. The results showed that N protein of SARS-CoV induced hfgl2 gene transcription dependent on the transcription factor C/EBP alpha, which maybe contribute to the development of thrombosis in SARS. © 2008 The Japanese Biochemical Society.

55649117733	Automatic bone age assessment based on intelligent algorithms and comparison with TW3 method	Purpose: New algorithms are proposed to improve the validity, accuracy and practicality of automatic bone age assessment (ABAA). Materials and methods: The concept of object-based region of interest (ROI) was proposed. Thirteen RUS (including radius, ulna and short finger bones) ROIs and seven carpal ROIs were appointed respectively according to Tanner-Whitehouse (TW3) method. Five features including size, morphologic features and fusional/adjacent stage of each ROI were extracted based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and input into ANN classifiers. ANNs were built upon feed-forward multilayer networks and trained with back-propagation algorithm rules to process RUS and carpal features respectively. About 1046 digital left hand-wrist radiographs were randomly utilized half for training ANNs and the rest for ABAA after manual reading by TW3 method. Results: BA comparison between observers indicated that the S.D. of RUS BA was larger than that of carpal BA (S.D. = 4.40, 2.42 respectively), but interestingly, both CVs were 4.0, and both concordance rates were very high (95.5% and 94.2%), and both differences between observers were not significant (both P > 0.05). We found by comparison between results of ABAA and manual readings that RUS BA had larger S.D.s than carpal BA between two methods, but the CVs were very similar in the case of carpal BA < 9 years and RUS BA ≥ 9 years (CV = 3.0, 3.1 respectively), apart from a comparatively larger CV for RUS BA < 9 years (CV = 3.5). Both parts of ABAA system, RUS and carpal, had very high concordance rates (97%, 93.8% and 96.5%) and no significant difference compared with manual method (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: PSO method made image segmentation and feature extraction more valid and accurate, and the ANN models were sophisticated in processing image information. ABAA system based on intelligent algorithms had been successfully applied to all cases from 0 to 18 years of bone age. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

57749083495	Hepatitis B virus-induced hFGL2 transcription is dependent on c-Ets-2 and MAPK signal pathway	Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2)/fibroleukin plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of experimental and human fulminant and chronic viral hepatitis. To define the transcription factor(s) and upstream signal transduction pathways involved in the transcription of human FGL2 (hFGL2) in response to hepatitis B (HB) virus, hepatitis B core (HBc), hepatitis B virus S protein (HBs), or hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) protein, expression plasmids were cotransfected with an hFGL2 promoter luciferase reporter construct into Chinese hamster ovary and HepG2 cells, respectively. HBc and HBx proteins, but not HBs protein, enhanced hFGL2 transcription in both cell lines. A strong regulatory region from -712 to -568 (relative to the transcriptional starting site) was shown to be responsible for hFGL2 gene transcription in response to both HBcandHBxproteins. c-Ets-2 was shown to be translocated to the nucleus in association with hFGL2 expression in response to both HBc and HBx proteins. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference of c-Ets-2 expression inhibited hFGL2 gene transcription by 64.8 and 60.0% in response to HBc and HBx, respectively. c-Ets-2 protein was highly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with severe chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in contrast to patients with mild CHB. Increased phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with severe CHB. ERK inhibitor PD098059 or ERK shRNA abolished the nuclear c-Ets-2 DNA binding activity and hFGL2 induction in response to HBc, whereas JNK inhibitor SP600125 or JNK shRNA abolished the nuclear c-Ets-2 DNA binding activity and hFGL2 induction in response to HBx. In conclusion, HBc and HBx proteins enhance transcription of hFGL2 through c-Ets-2 dependent on MAPK signal pathways. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

58149096974	Negative regulation of virus-triggered IFN-β signaling pathway by alternative splicing of TBK1	Induction of Type I IFNs is a central event in antiviral responses and must be tightly controlled. The protein kinase TBK1 is critically involved in virus-triggered type I IFN signaling. In this study, we identify an alternatively spliced isoform of TBK1, termed TBK1s, which lacks exons 3-6. Upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection, TBK1s is induced in both human and mouse cells and binds to RIG-1, disrupting the interaction between RIG-I and VISA. Consistent with that result, overexpression of TBK1s inhibits IRF3 nuclear translocation and leads to a shutdown of SeV-triggered IFN-β production. Taken together, our data indicate that TBK1s plays an inhibitory role in virus-triggered IFN-β signaling pathways. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

67349168688	Clinical evaluation of recombinant human growth hormone injection in children with growth hormone deficiency	Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has been widely used in the clinical treatment of growth hormone deficiency. To simplify the injection process and increase drug compliance, application of the GH injection has become a new treatment plan in recent years. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhGH injection for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children in China. In a nationwide, noncomparative, prospective, randomized, open trial, 31 children with confirmed complete GHD received subcutaneous injection of rhGH at 0.25 mg/kg wk (0.107 IU/kg d). The injection was given daily and the total weekly amount was separated into 6-7 injections. The patients were followed up at 3-month intervals and the treatment duration was 12 months. The height (HT), annual growth velocity (GV), mean height standard deviation score (HT SDS), blood serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and bone maturity before and after treatment were compared, and the safety of the treatment was analyzed. The mean HT, GV, and HT SDS were increased from 109.0±14 cm, 2.7±0.9 cm/yr, and -4.62 ±1.46 at baseline to 121.8±13.4 cm, 12.9±3.3 cm/yr, and -2.45±1.86 after 12 months of treatment, respectively (P <0.001). At the same time, blood IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 were increased significantly [41.27±64.43 μg/L vs 159.21±167.92 μg/L and 1540.00±1325.11 mg/L vs 3533.93±413.82 mg/L, respectively (P <0.001)]. The bone age assessments performed 6 and 12 months after the treatment showed that no advanced bone maturation was noted. No serious adverse events occurred during the treatment, and the drug-related adverse events were mainly decreased thyroid function. We conclude that rhGH injection is a safe and effective drug for treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.

67749089173	Onset of breast and pubic hair development and menses in urban Chinese girls	OBJECTIVES: To determine the current prevalence and mean ages of onset of pubertal characteristics in healthy urban Chinese girls. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of sexual maturation of healthy Chinese girls was conducted in 9 representative cities of the eastern, western, southern, and northern parts and central region of China between 2003 and 2005. At examination, stages of breast and pubic hair development were rated on girls 3 through 19.83 years of age, and height and weight were also recorded. Data on menses were collected by the status quo method. Probit analysis was used to calculate the median age and 95% confidence interval (CI) for onset of breast and pubic hair development and menarche. RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 20 654 apparently healthy girls. At age 8 years, 19.57% of these girls had evidence of breast development. The median ages of onset of Tanner stages 2 and 3 for breast development were 9.20 (95% CI: 9.06-9.32) years and 10.37 (95% CI: 10.28-10.45) years, respectively. The median ages of onset of Tanner stages 2 and 3 for pubic hair development were 11.16 (95% CI: 11.03-11.29) years and 12.40 (95% CI: 12.25-12.55) years, respectively. Menses occurred at 12.27 years (95% CI: 12.16-12.39). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that urban Chinese girls are actually experiencing earlier breast development than currently used norms. The up-to-date reference for normal pubertal development in urban Chinese girls needs to be established for the purpose of determining precocious puberty or pubertal delay.

69149086064	Gene polymorphism of vascular endothelial growth factor in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis	Objective: To study the relationship of -634G/C gene polymorphism of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) in children. Methods: One hundred ethnic Han children with HSP, including 50 children with concurrent nephritis (HSPN group) and 50 children without nephritis (HSP without nephritis group), were enrolled. Fifty age-, sex- and ethnics-matched healthy children were used as the control group. VEGF-634G/C genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP. Plasma VEGF levels were measured using ELISA. Results: CC genotype distribution (32%) and C allele frequency (56%) in the HSPN group were significantly higher than those in the control group (10% and 35% respectively) and the HSP without nephritis group (10% and 33% respectively) (P < 0.01). The incidence of nephritis in HSP patients with CC genotype increased significantly when compared with those with GG genotype (76% vs 31%; P < 0.01). Plasma VEGF levels in patients with CC genotype (180.5 ± 40.7 pg/mL) were significantly higher than those in patients with CG (145.2 ± 48.3 pg/mL) and GG (101.5 ± 26.5 pg/mL) genotypes (P < 0.05). Conclusions: VEGF-634G/C gene polymorphism may be associated with the development of HSPN.

70349501465	Identification of a novel splicing mutation in the growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone receptor gene in a Chinese family with pituitary dwarfism	A Chinese family with autosomal recessive pituitary dwarfism was identified and the proband was evaluated by MRI and hormonal analysis, which revealed pituitary dwarfism with a complete growth hormone deficiency. MRI showed a pituitary gland with a small anterior pituitary of 2.2 mm and evidence of hypoplastic pituitary. Linkage analysis with markers spanning 17 known genes for dwarfism revealed linkage of the family to the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) gene. Mutational analysis of all exons and exon-intron boundaries of GHRHR was carried out using direct DNA sequence analysis. A novel homozygosis mutation, a G to A transition located in the splice donor site at the beginning of intron 8 (IVS8+1G>A), was identified in the proband. The two other patients in the family are homozygous, whereas the living mother of the proband is heterozygous for the IVS8+1G>A mutation. The mutation was not found in 100 normal chromosomes from healthy Chinese individuals of Han nationality. An in vitro splicing assay using HeLa cells transfected with expression vectors containing the normal or the mutant GHRHR minigenes consisting of genomic fragments spanning exons 7-9 showed that the IVS8+1G>A mutation caused abnormal splicing, which is predicted to give rise to truncation or frameshift, leading to severely truncated GHRHR proteins. These results provide strong evidence that the splicing mutation IVS8+1G>A of GHRHR is a cause of pituitary dwarfism in the Chinese family. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to construct Sars-CoV membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike 2 (S2) gene eukaryotic expression plasmids, and identify their expression in vitro. Gene fragments encoding N protein, M protein and S2 protein of SARS-CoV were amplified by PCR using cDNA obtained from lung samples of SARS patients as template, and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector to form eukaryotic expression plasmids. SARS-CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were transfected respectively into CHO cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV in transfected cells. SARS-CoV protein eukaryotic expression plasmids were successfully constructed by identification with digestion of restriction enzymes and sequencing. M, N and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV were detected in the cytoplasm of transfected CHO cells. It was concluded that these recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids were constructed successfully, and SARS-CoV encoding proteins could activate transcription and expression of hfgl2 gene. © 2009 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

72349087611	Involvement of CXCR3-associated chemokines in MHV-3 induced fulminant hepatic failure	The role of chemokines in murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is not well defined. In this study, we investigated the role of the CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3)-associated chemokine [monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig/CXCL9) and interferon-gamma- inducible protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10)] in the recruitment of intrahepatic lymphocytes and subsequent fulminant hepatic failure induced by MHV-3. Balb/cJ mice (6-8 weeks, female) were intraperitioneally injected with 100 PFU MHV-3.The proportions and numbers of T cells and NK cells as well as the expression of CXCR3 on T cells and NK cells in the liver, spleen and blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The hepatic mRNA level of the CXCR3-associated chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10) was detected by realtime PCR. A transwell migration assay was used to assess the chemotactic effect of MHV-3-infected hepatocytes on the splenic lymphocytes. Following MHV-3 infection, the number of hepatic NK cells and T cells and the frequencies of hepatic NK cells and T cells expressing CXCR3 increased markedly; however, in the spleen and peripheral blood, they both decreased significantly. Moreover, the hepatic mRNAs levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were significantly elevated post infection. The transwell migration assay demonstrated that MHV-3-infected hepatocytes have the capacity to attract and recruit the splenic NK cells and T cells, and CXCL10 plays a key role in lymphocyte mobilization from the spleen. These results suggest that the CXCR3-associated chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10) may play an important role in the recruitment of intrahepatic lymphocytes and subsequent necroinflammation and hepatic failure in MHV-3 infection. © 2009 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

73949112938	Increased killing of liver NK cells by Fas/Fas ligand and NKG2D/NKG2D ligand contributes to hepatocyte necrosis in virus-induced liver failure	The role of liver NK cells in virus-induced severe viral hepatitis and, subsequently, hepatic failure is not well defined. In this study, we investigated the role of liver NK cells in the development of hepatocyte necrosis in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) because of viral infection. A mouse model of FHF induced by murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) was used to study the role of liver NK cells. Samples from patients with hepatitis B virus-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF) were examined. After MHV-3 infection, the number of NK cells in livers of BALB/cJ mice increased markedly, peaked at 48 h postinfection, and remained at a high level until sacrifice. In peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow, this number decreased significantly. Expression of CD69, cytotoxic activity, and intracellular IFN-γ and TNF-α production by liver NK cells at 48 h postinfection were all significantly upregulated. Depletion of NK cells 24 h post-MHV-3 infection increased the mice survival from 0 of 18 (0%) to 4 of 18 (22.2%). Highly activated liver NK cells were cytotoxic to MHV-3-infected hepatocytes and this effect was markedly inhibited by anti-Fas ligand (FasL) plus anti-NKG2D mAbs. Furthermore, the accumulation of hepatic NK cells and increased expression of FasL and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30 and NKp46) on the peripheral NK cells from patients with HBV-ACLF were correlated with disease progression. These results indicate NK cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of FHF and HBV-ACLF, in which process Fas/FasL and NKG2D/NKG2D ligand pathway contribute to the liver NK cell-mediated hepatocyte injury.

77249171921	Construction of mTNFR1shRNA plasmid and its biological effects on MHV-3 induced fulminant hepatitis in BALB/cJ mice	Previous study on TNFR1-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis has been implicated in the development of fulminant viral hepatitis. To interfere with the potentially effective target, plasmid named p-mTNFR1shRNA complimentary to the sequence responsible for mTNFR1 was also constructed and further confirmed by sequence analysis. To investigate the effect of mTNFR1shRNA plasmid on mTNFR1 expression in vivo and the disease progress in MHV-3 induced fulminant hepatitis mice model. By hydrodynamic injection of mTNFR1shRNA plasmid, the survival rate of mice, hepatic pathological change were examined and compared between mice with/without mTNFR1shRNA plasmid intervention. The expression of mTNFR1 was detected by Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry staining. The mTNFR1shRNA plasmid significantly reduced mTNFR1 expression in vivo, markedly ameliorates inflammatory infiltration, prolonged the survival time period and elevated the survival rate from 0 up to 13.3% in Balb/cJ mice with MHV-3 induced fulminant hepatitis. This study was designed to explore the opportunity of RNA interference technique in inhibiting TNFR1 expression, which has been reported to be involved in the development of a variety of diseases including fulminant viral hepatitis and severe chronic hepatitis B. © 2010 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

77749315681	Telbivudine preserves T-helper 1 cytokine production and downregulates programmed death ligand 1 in a mouse model of viral hepatitis	Telbivudine is an orally bioavailable L-nucleoside with potent and specific anti-hepatitis B virus activity. The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during telbivudine treatment than other potent anti-HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. We sought to determine the effects of telbivudine on the immune system, particularly on cytokine production and T-cell response, using an animal model with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced hepatitis. The effects of telbivudine on virus replication and cytokine production were investigated in vitro using MHV-3-infected macrophages, and the effects on T-cell response were investigated in vivo in an MHV-3-induced viral hepatitis model. Telbivudine had no effect on MHV-3 replication in macrophages. However, the production of tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-12 was increased significantly in MHV-3-induced macrophages treated with telbivudine. In vivo survival was enhanced in telbivudine-treated mice, with marked normalization in clinical conditions and histological lesions. Serum levels of interferon-γ were elevated significantly after telbivudine treatment in MHV-3-infected C3H mice. In contrast, serum interleukin-4 levels were decreased significantly. Furthermore, telbivudine treatment enhanced the ability of T cells to undergo proliferation and secrete cytokines but did not affect cytotoxicity of infected hepatocytes. Of note, we found that telbivudine treatment suppressed programmed death ligand 1 expression on T cells. The results demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of telbivudine, independent of its antiviral activity, in a mouse model of MHV-3-induced hepatitis. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

77953631535	Effects of retinoic acid on the expressions of Vangl1 and Vangl2 in mouse fetuses	This study reports the effects of retinoic acid on the spatiotemporal expressions of Vangl1 and Vangl2 in mouse fetuses. A single dose of 120 mg/kg body weight of all-trans-retinoic acid suspended in olive oil was administered intragastrically to each pregnant BALB/C mice on embryonic day (E) 9.5 (group 1, G1) or E10.5 (group 2, G2); mice treated with pure olive oil on E9.5 or E10.5 served as control groups. The expression of Vangl1 and Vangl2 in fetuses was investigated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and their spatial and temporal expression was detected by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) on E10.5, E11.5, E13.5, E15.5, E17.5, and E19.5, respectively. The study indicated that the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in live birth and craniofacial NTD rate were significantly higher in G1 (100% and 25.6%) than that in G2 (78.2% and 5.7%), both P <0.01. Vangl1 and Vangl2 were strongly expressed throughout neurulation in embryos of control groups. G1 embryos exhibited a dramatic downregulation of Vangl1 and Vangl2 expression from cranial regions to posterior neuropore compared with the control group of G1 (all P <0.01). In contrast, both transcripts in G2 embryos were significantly downregulated and weakly expressed in whole embryos on E11.5 and in the spinal region of the neural tube from E15.5 to E19.5, but moderately downregulated in the cranial region of the neural tube from E15.5 to E19.5 (all P <0.01). In conclusion, Vangl1 and Vangl2 transcript downregulation might be implicated in the occurrence of mouse NTDs induced by retinoic acid. Copyright © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

77955489072	Dual interference with novel genes mfgl2 and mTNFR1 ameliorates murine hepatitis virus type 3-induced fulminant hepatitis in BALB/cJ mice	Our studies and those of many others have implicated hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis mediated by fibrinogen-like protein-2 (fgl2) prothrombinase and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) in the development of fulminant viral hepatitis, a disease with a mortality rate greater than 80% in cases lacking immediate organ transplantation. This study was designed to explore the efficacy of dual short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference with fgl2 and TNFR1 in the treatment of murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced fulminant hepatitis in mice. Plasmids p-mfgl2shRNA and p-mTNFR1shRNA, complementary to the sequences for mfgl2 and mTNFR1, were constructed. Plasmids pEGFP-mfgl2 and pEGFP-mTNFR1 expressing mfgl2-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and mTNFR1-EGFP fusion proteins were also constructed to screen the inhibitory effect of p-mfgl2shRNA and p-mTNFR1shRNA on mfgl2 and mTNFR1 expression. Cotransfection of individual shRNA plasmids and pcDNA3.0-mfgl2 and pcDNA3.0-mTNFR1 expression constructs into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells significantly inhibited mfgl2 and mTNFR1 gene expression, as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. In vivo hydrodynamic delivery of dual-interference shRNA plasmids for mfgl2 and mTNFR1 significantly decreased mfgl2 and mTNFR1 expression; markedly ameliorated fibrin deposition, hepatocyte necrosis, and apoptosis; and prolonged survival against fulminant viral hepatitis induced by MHV-3 in BALB/cJ mice compared with mfgl2 or TNFR1 single-gene interference. These results indicate that in vivo interference with genes for more than one key target provides superior treatment efficacy compared with single-gene interference. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

79955828802	The influence of down-regulation of suppressor of cellular signaling proteins by rnai on glucose transport of intrauterine growth retardation rats	Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been linked to metabolic syndrome including insulin resistance, and overexpression of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCSs) proteins is thought to be associated with increased whole-body insulin sensitivity. The insulin-resistant IUGR rat model was established by maternal food restriction (about 30% of the normal rats). The weight, length, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) of IUGR-born rats was higher than the control group. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 expression decreased, whereas SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 increased in the skeletal muscle of IUGR rats compared with the control group. The recombination plasmids PGPU6/GFP/Neo-SOCS-1small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and PGPU6/GFP/Neo-SOCS- 3shRNA were transfected into skeletal muscle cells, and the shRNAs efficiently inhibited the expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. Insulin-stimulated glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) translocation was also dramatically increased. In conclusion, these data provide additional information on the mechanism of insulin resistance associated with IUGR. Down-regulation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 ameliorates the capacity of glucose transport and provides a potential gene therapy approach to managing metabolic syndrome.

0036229986	Hepoxilin analogs inhibit bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the mouse	Bleomycin has been suggested to incite plasma extravasation and influx of inflammatory cells leading to pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesized that stable analogs of the 12-lipoxygenase product, hepoxilin, may attenuate these effects. We initially investigated the effects of the four hepoxilin analogs (PBT-1 to -4) coadministered intradermally with bleomycin and found that PBT-1 and -2 significantly opposed the vascular permeability effects of bleomycin in rat skin. We subsequently tested the hepoxilin analogs for their actions in opposing the intratracheal bleomycin-evoked acute inflammatory phase of lung fibrosis in the mouse, characterized by a marked accumulation of macrophages and an increase in the rate of collagen synthesis and deposition. We found that the bleomycin-evoked effects on macrophage influx were inhibited by all the hepoxilin analogs (PBT-1, -3, and -4 > PBT-2) administered i.p. for 8 days. Increased total lung collagen was completely abrogated by PBT-1 and -2, whereas PBT-3 and -4 had little effect. A dose-response study with PBT-1 indicated that the effective dose for inhibition of bleomycin-induced inflammatory and histological changes was below 10 μg/day. These studies demonstrate an in vivo action of stable analogs of hepoxilin and support an effect on inflammation and vascular permeability from these novel compounds, especially for PBT-1.

80053384209	Pubertal development timing in urban Chinese boys	We describe current pubertal development in healthy urban Chinese boys. A cross-sectional study of the pubertal development of 18807 urban Chinese boys aged from 3.50 to 18.49years was conducted between 2003 and 2005. Testicular volume was evaluated with a Prader orchidometer. Pubic hair development was assessed according to the Tanner method. Data on spermarche were collected using the status quo method. Probit analysis was used to calculate the median age and 95% CI at different stages of testicular development, pubic hair development and spermarche. By age 9, 12.99% of the boys had a testicular volume of 4mL or greater. The median age of onset of puberty defined as the age at attainment of testicular volume of 4mL or greater was 10.55 (95% CI 10.27-10.79) years.

80054730395	Antiviral resistance mutations potentiate HBV surface antigen-induced transcription of hfgl2 prothrombinase gene	Antiviral resistance mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase (pol) gene have been demonstrated to play an important role in the progression of liver disease and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The HBV pol gene overlaps the S gene encoding surface antigen (HBsAg). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that HBV core protein (HBc) and X protein (HBx), but not HBV S protein (HBs), promote hfgl2 prothrombinase transcription. To investigate whether the nucleotide (nucleoside)-induced resistant mutations of HBs potentiate transcription of hfgl2 prothrombinase gene, we generated two mutant HB expression constructs harboring rtM204V/sI195M or rtM204I/sW196L mutations. Two mutant expression plasmids were co-transfected with hfgl2 promoter luciferase-reporter plasmids and β-galactosidase plasmid in CHO cells and HepG2 cells, respectively. Luciferase assay showed that the rtM204I/V mutant HBs could activate the transcription of hfgl2 promoter compared with the wild type HBs. Site-directed mutagenesis and further experiment (co-transfection) demonstrated that transcription factor Ets translocated to its cognate cis-element in the hfgl2 promoter. The results show that mutated HBs caused by antiviral drug resistance induce transcription of the hfgl2 gene dependent on the transcription factor Ets. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

80455177303	Clinical characteristics and gene mutation analysis of methylmalonic aciduria	Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is a common inherited autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defects in the enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MCM, mut complementation group) or in the synthesis of the MCM cofactor adenosylcobalamin (cbl complementation groups). The defects in the mut complementation group accounts for the largest number of patients with isolated MMA. At least 200 mutations in the MUT gene on chromosome 6p12 have been identified in MMA patients until now. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of MMA and genomic variations in the MUT gene of Chinese patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from 18 patients who were diagnosed as having isolated MMA by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and from some of their parents as well. Amplification and direct sequencing of the MUT coding regions (exon 2-13) and their adjacent intronic consensus splice sites were performed in order to identify the disease causing mutations. In this group, six novel mutations in the MUT gene, c.424A>G (p.T142A), c.786T>G (p.S262R), c.808G>C (p.G270R), c.1323-1324insA, c.1445-1G>A and c.1676+77A>C were identified. p.T142A and p.G270R were respectively detected at a heterozygous level in one patient. Two previously reported mutations, c.682C>T (p.R228X) and c.323G>A (p.R108H) were also found in this study. In addition, six previously described single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), c.636A>G (p.K212K), c.1495G>A (p.A499T), c.1595A>G (p.H532R), c.1992G>A (p.A664A), c.2011G>A (p.V671I) and c.1677-53A>G were identified. In this study, we updated the spectrum of MUT mutations and identified the main MMA-causing mutations in Chinese MMA patients. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

84858826138	Growth hormone and treatment outcomes: Expert review of current clinical practice	Although there are guidelines for treatment of short stature, open questions regarding optimal management of growth hormone therapy still exist. Experts attending six international meetings agree that successful therapy results in the patient attaining mid-parental height, and relies on correct diagnosis and early intervention. Experts advocate patient follow-up every 3-6 months, and that growth and adherence should be monitored at each visit. Growth response is variable, and an accepted definition of good/poor response is lacking. Combined with patient education and regular patient follow-up, a definition of treatment response could lead to improved treatment outcomes. Few experts use prediction models in clinical practice, but all agree that pharmacogenetics might improve prediction, enable early therapy modulation, and promote growth. Poor growth is often due to low adherence. Guidance on optimal management of growth hormone therapy is required, with focus on early diagnosis, dosing, treatment monitoring, adherence, and motivation.

84860894789	Diagnosis of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C and identification of 2 noval mutations in NPC1 gene	Objective: To established a diagnostic methods to identity Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) in China. Methods: Two patients aged 5 and 20 years respectively who presented progressive neurologic regression and splenomegaly were subjected to filipin staining of cultured skin fibroblasts and genetic analyses of NPC1 gene. Results: Although there were differences in onset ages and clinical presentations, filipin staining of the cultured skin fibroblasts confirmed the clinical diagnosis of NPC, showing an intense punctate pattern of fluorescence concentrating around the nuclei, consistent with the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in NPC cells. Genetic sequence analysis further verified the results of filipin staining. The case 1 was compound heterozygous for M1142T (3425T > C), R1186H (3557T > C) and case 2 for Q88H (264G > T), 469_470insGT. The latter 2 mutations were novel, and the possibility of polymorphisms was not supported by analyzing 134 DNA samples obtained form normal controls. Conclusions: Filipin stainning of the cultured skin fibroblasts is a reliable method to clinically diagnose NPC with a sensitivity. Genetic diagnose should be performed where genetic analysis is allowed.

In order to investigate the neurotoxic effects of GA on neonatal rat corpus striatum and the possible mechanism, 34 male pups were randomly assigned to NS group, low dose GA (LGA, 5 νmol GA/g body weight) group and high dose GA (HGA, 10 νmol GA/g body weight) group. These pups were subcutaneously administered with three injections from postnatal day 3 to 22 at 7:30 am, 15:00 pm and 22:30 pm and killed 12 h after the last injection. Microscopic pathology in corpus striatum was evaluated by HE staining. The apoptotic cells were identified by TUNEL staining. The transcript levels of caspase-3, 8, 9, Bax, Bcl-2 were detected by using real-time PCR and the protein levels of procaspase-3 and the active fraction were evaluated by Western blotting. In LGA and HGA groups, ventricle collapse, cortical atrophy by a macroscope and interstitial edema, vacuolations, widened perivascular space of bilateral striatum by a microscope were observed. TUNEL assay revealed that the apoptotic cells were increased in LGA and HGA groups. The transcript of caspase-3 was up-regulated to 2.5 fold, accompanied by the up-regulation of caspase-9, Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2. The protein levels of procaspase-3 and the active fraction were up-regulated in LGA and HGA groups. The rat model for GA I showed mitochondrial apoptotic pathway may be involved in the GA-induced striatal lesion. Further studies should be taken to investigate the underlying mechanisms. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

The U87 cells were divided into miR-34a mimics, negative control, mock transfection and blank control groups in terms of different treatments. In miR-34a mimics group, human U87 glioma cells were transfected with miR-34a mimics by using lipofectamine 2000. The cells transfected with nonsense microRNA were set up as negative control group. Those treated with lipofectamine 2000 only were designated to the mock tranfection group. In the blank control group, the cells were cultured routinely and no treatment was given. The expression of miR-34a and Notch1 was detected by using real-time RT-PCR. Western blotting was employed to monitor the change in Notch1 protein. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The results showed that the proliferative ability of U87 cells was significantly reduced and the apoptotic cells increased in miR-34a mimics group relative to control groups. The expression of miR-34a was significantly up-regulated in mimics group as compared with control groups (P<0.05). Furthermore, Notch1 protein levels were significantly decreased in miR-34a mimics group when compared with control groups (P<0.05), but the mRNA expression of Notch1 showed no significant difference among these groups. It was concluded that miR-34a may suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis of U87 cells by decreasing the expression of target gene Notch1, suggesting that miR-34a may become a promising gene therapeutic target for brain glioma. © Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

0037202957	STAT1α/β and STAT3α/β splice-form activation in mice with MHV-3 induced hepatitis	Objective: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1α(STAT1α) is essential to IFN-γ and IFN-α regulated gene expression, while STAT1β, an alternate splice-form mediates only IFN-α dependent gene expression. STAT3α and STAT3β splice forms are also differentially activated in response to cytokines including IL6, IL-10 and GM-CSF. In this report, we studied the host immune response to viral infection with a murine hepatitis model for rates of STAT1α, β and STAT3α, β activation following infection with hepatitis virus in resistant and sensitive mouse strains. Methods: Mice were i. p infected with 100 PFU of MHV-3. The mice were killed at required intervals and livers/spleens were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear extracts were separated in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and proteins were detected by immunoblotting. DNA mobility shift assay was also performed to examine the protein-DNA interreaction. Results: STAT1 and STAT3 activation in spleen enhanced in 24 hs to 72 hs following MHV-3 infections in both sensitive and resistant mouse strains. However, beyond this time period, ratio of activated α to β splice-form for STAT1 and STAT3 enhanced to above 1.0 in resistant A/J mice, while decreased to less than 0.3 in MHV-3 sensitive BALB/c and C3H/HeJ strains. Activated STAT1α/β and STAT3α/β ratio in liver was similar in both resistant and sensitive mouse strains. Conclusion: The ratios of activated STAT1α/β and STAT3α/β in mixed leukocytes from spleen predict outcome of MHV-3 infection and may function as an important markers of therapeutic effect for modification of host immune response.

0037361274	STAT1 and STAT3 α/β splice form activation predicts host responses in mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection	Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1α (STAT1 α) is reported to be essential for IFN-γ and IFN-α regulated gene expression, while STAT1 β, an alternate splice-form, mediates only IFN-α-dependent gene expression. STAT3 α and STAT3 β splice forms are also differentially activated in response to cytokines including IL-6 and IL-10. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the STAT activation will predict the host immune response to viral infection and possibly a therapeutic target for the treatment of viral infection. Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV-3) resistant strain (A/J) and sensitive mouse strains (BalB/cJ) were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 plaque form units (pfu) of MHV-3. The mice were sacrificed at the indicated times, and livers and spleens were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear extracts proteins were detected by immunoblotting. STAT1 and STAT3 activation in spleen increased 24 to 72 hr following MHV-3 infections in both sensitive and resistant mouse strains. However, over this time period, the ratio of activated α to β splice-form for STAT1 and STAT3 increased above 1.0 in resistant A/J mice, while the ratio fell to <0.3 in MHV-3 sensitive Balb/cJ and C3H/HeJ strains. Activated STAT1 α/β and STAT3 α/β ratio in liver were similar in resistant and sensitive mouse strains. Treatment of sensitive Balb/cJ mice with neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody could increase the STAT1 α/β ratio to <1.0 in spleens, predicting enhanced rates of survival. These results suggested that ratio of activated STAT1 α/β and STAT3 α/β in mixed leukocytes from spleen predict the outcome to MHV-3 infection, and may be an important marker and therapeutic target for modification of host immune response to virus infection. 306-312 © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

84867876776	Effects of intrauterine growth retardation with catch-up growth on sugar-lipid metabolism and adipocyte function in young rats	Objective: To study changes of glycolipid metabolism and adipocyte function in an catch-up growth intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) rat model. Methods: IUGR rat model was established by maternal nutrition restriction during pregnancy. Newborn IUGR pups were used as IUGR group, and normal newborn pups were used as control group (appropriate for gestational age, AGA group). At age of 12 weeks, plasma samples were collected for the test of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), adiponectin and acylation stimulating protein (ASP). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed for the test of glucose and insulin levels, and insulin resistance index (IRI) was calculated. Expression of glucose transfer 4 (GLUT-4) in adipocytes was examined by confocal microscopy. Results: Body weight and BMI in the IUGR group were significantly higher than in the AGA group by 12 weeks (P < 0.01), and plasma TC, TG and LDL-C levels in the IUGR group were higher than in the AGA group, but HDL-C was lower (P < 0.05). In the OGTT test, blood glucose level and IRI score in the IUGR group were higher than in the AGA group (P < 0.05). Compared with the AGA group, the IUGR group had a higher ASP level (P < 0.05) and a lower adiponection level (P < 0.05). GLUT4 expression in the adipocytes was significantly lower in the IUGR group than in the AGA group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Catch-up growth may be obviously noted in IUGR rats after birth. Both hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance occur at age of 12 weeks. Dysfunction of adipocytes decreased expression of GLUT-4 may be risk factors for insulin resistance in IUGR rats.

84867775667	Molecular defects of the GnRH-receptor gene in Chinese patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and the severity of hypogonadism	Background: Human mutations in the gonadotropinreleasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) gene cause normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). At least 19 different mutations have been identified in this G-protein-coupled receptor, which consist mostly of missense mutations. Objectives: To identify and determine the frequency of mutations in the coding region of the gonadotropinreleasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) gene in forty Chinese patients with normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and establish genotype/phenotype correlations where possible. Methods: The diagnosis of HH was based on absent or incomplete sexual development after 17 years of age in girls and 18 years in boys associated with low or normal levels of LH in both sexes and low levels of testosterone in males and of estradiol in females. All patients presented with a normal sense of smell in an olfactory specific test. Forty IHH patients and 40 controls were screened for mutations in the coding sequence of the GnRHR gene. The coding region of the GnRHR gene was amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Results: A missense mutation, serine 168 arginine (S168R), located in the fourth transmembrane domain of the GnRHR gene, was identified as being in a homozygous state in one male with complete HH. The S168R mutation has been previously shown to be a cause in the complete loss of receptor function because hormone binding to the receptor is completely impaired. In another patient, a compound heterozygous mutation (Gln106Arg and Arg262Gln) was identified in a male with partial HH. The Gln106Arg mutation is located in the first extracellular loop of GnRH-R, this mutation decreases but not does eliminate GnRH binding; while Arg262Gln mutation is located in the third extracellular loop of GnRH-R and only decreases signal transduction. A good correlation between genotype and phenotype was found in our patients. The patient, who was homozygous for the completely inactivating S168R mutation, had complete HH. In addition, the affected patient who was compound heterozygous for the Gln106Arg - Arg262Gln mutations - has partial HH. Conclusions: GnRHR mutations can be classified into partial or complete loss of function mutations. Partially inactivating substitutions of the GnRHR frequently found in familial hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism are Q106R and R262Q. Comparison of compound heterozygous with homozygous patients suggests that their phenotype and the response to GnRH is determined by the GnRHR variant with the less severe loss of function.

84871342833	Downregulating SOCS3 with siRNA ameliorates insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in hepatocytes of IUGR rats with catch-up growth	Background: Individuals with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) who demonstrate a catch-up in body weight are prone to insulin resistance. High expressions of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) are thought to aggravate insulin resistance. We hypothesized that downregulating SOCS3 expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) might have beneficial effects on insulin-resistant hepatocytes of catch-up growth IUGR rats (CG-IUGRs). Methods: An IUGR rat model was employed via maternal nutritional restriction. After evaluating metabolic states of CG-IUGR offspring, effective SOCS3-specific siRNA (siSOCS3) was transfected into cultured hepatocytes using liposomes. mRNA levels of SOCS3, insulin receptor substrates (IRSs), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt2, key gluconeogenesis genes, were assessed via real-time PCR. Protein expression and phosphorylation changes were evaluated via western blot.Results:CG-IUGR hepatocytes showed increases in SOCS3 and gluconeogenic gene expressions, and decreases in IRS1 and PI3K expressions as compared with controls. After transfecting CG-IUGR hepatocytes with siSOCS3, protein levels of IRS1, PI3K, and phosphorylated Akt2 were higher as compared with those of untransfected CG-IUGR cells. Transcriptional suppression effects of gluconeogenesis genes were more obvious in siSOCS3-treated cells after insulin stimulation.Conclusion:Additional insights were provided to understand mechanisms of insulin resistance in CG-IUGR rats. Downregulating SOCS3 might improve insulin signaling transduction and ameliorate hepatic glucose metabolism in insulin-resistant CG-IUGR rats in vitro. © 2012 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

84871409561	CD4-CD8-T cells contribute to the persistence of viral hepatitis by striking a delicate balance in immune modulation	Viral hepatitis remains the most common cause of liver disease and a major public health problem. Here, we focus on the role of CD4 CD8 double negative T (DN T) cells involved in the mechanisms of viral persistence in hepatitis. C3H/HeJ mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) were used to display chronic viral hepatitis. DN T cells dramatically increased in MHV-3 infected mice. Adoptive transfer of DN T cells from MHV-3 infected mice led to a significant increase in mice survival. The DN T cells with production of IFN-γ and IL-2 are able to kill virus-specific CD8

84872496070	Differential chemoattractant response in adipocytes and macrophages to the action of acylation stimulating protein	Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation with increased adipose tissue pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) stimulates triglyceride synthesis and glucose transport via its receptor C5L2. Circulating ASP is increased in obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The present study examines the effects of normal (50nM), high physiological (200nM) and pathological (600nM) levels of ASP on inflammatory changes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and J774 macrophages and the underlying mechanisms involved. Treatment with ASP for 24h increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1, 800%, P<0.001) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC, >150%, P<0.01) secretion in adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, with no effect on IL-6 or adiponectin. In macrophages, ASP had no effect on these cytokines. C5a, a ligand for C5L2 and C5aR receptors, differed from ASP. Macrophage-adipocyte coculture increased MCP-1 and adiponectin secretion, and ASP further enhanced secretion (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively) at doses of 50nM and 200nM. ASP increased Ser

84873180258	KCTD9 contributes to liver injury through NK cell activation during hepatitis B virus-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure	We explored the expression of a newly identified potassium channel tetramerisation domain containing 9 (KCTD9) protein in 113 blood and 81 liver samples, from patients with mild chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or HBV-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF). KCTD9 was highly expressed in peripheral and hepatic NK cells from HBV-ACLF patients compared with mild CHB patients, and this correlated positively with the severity of liver injury. The role of KCTD9 was further investigated in NK92 cells in vitro. KCTD9 overexpressed NK92 cells exhibited a marked increase in CD69 expression, cytotoxicity, IFN-γ secretion and a significant decrease in NKG2A receptor expression. Inhibition of KCTD9 by shRNA resulted in reduced cytotoxic function. These results suggest the involvement of KCTD9 in NK cell activation and provide additional insight into a potential therapeutic target for molecular manipulation for HBV-ACLF patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84874081861	Effects of SOCS 1/3 gene silencing on the expression of C/EBP and PPARγ during differentiation and maturation of rat preadipocytes	Background: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 and -3 (SOCS-1 and SOCS-3) are two important negative regulators in the insulin-signaling pathway, and their overexpression may aggravate insulin resistance. Subjects with insulin resistance are often obese and have increased expressions of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. We speculated that SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 may be involved in abnormal deposition of adipose tissues during insulin resistance.Methods:A catch-up growth intrauterine growth retardation (CG-IUGR) rat model with insulin resistance was established; mRNA and protein expression of SOCS-1, SOCS-3, the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) in adipose tissue were measured by real-time PCR and western blot; plasmids carrying small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 genes were constructed and transfected into preadipocytes, which were then induced to mature. At 72 h after differentiation was induced, the expressions of C/EBP and PPARγ, two important molecules promoting the differentiation of preadipocytes, were detected.Results:Expressions of SOCS-1, SOCS-3, C/EBP, and PPARγ were markedly increased in adipose tissues of CG-IUGR rats, whereas the expressions of C/EBP and PPARγ were significantly reduced after gene silencing of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 in adipocytes.Conclusion:Overexpression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 may enhance the expression of C/EBP and PPARγ, resulting in abnormal deposition of adipose tissues during insulin resistance.

84876414141	Inflammatory markers and adipokines alter adipocyte-derived ASP production through direct and indirect immune interaction	Obesity and related metabolic diseases are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory proteins. Several studies have demonstrated increases in acylation stimulating protein (ASP) and its precursor protein C3 in obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia. To evaluate the effects of acute inflammatory factors and adipokines on ASP production and potential mechanisms of action, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 24 h with adipokines, cytokines, macrophage-conditioned media and direct co-culture with J774 macrophages. ASP and C3 in the media were evaluated in relation to changes in adipocyte lipid metabolism (cellular triglyceride stores). Leptin, adiponectin, IL-10, LPS and TNF-α increased ASP production (151%, 153%, 190%, 318%, 134%, P<0.05, respectively,). C5a and RANTES (Regulated and normal T cell expressed and secreted) decreased ASP production (- 34%, - 47%, P<0.05), which was also associated with a decrease in the precursor protein C3 (- 39% to - 51%, P<0.01), while keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC; murine IL-8 ortholog) had no effect on ASP and C3 secretion. By contrast, apelin, omentin and visfatin also decreased ASP (- 27%, - 49%, - 22%, P<0.05), but without changes in precursor protein C3 secretion. Macrophage-conditioned media alone had little effect on C3 or ASP, while co-culture of adipocytes with macrophages markedly increased ASP and C3 production (272%, 167%, P<0.05). These in vitro results suggest various metabolic hormones and inflammatory factors can affect ASP production through increased precursor C3 production and/or by changing the rate of C3 conversion to ASP. As an adipokine, ASP could constitute a new link between adipocytes and macrophages. © 2013 J. A. Barth Verlag in Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

84876424918	Comparative evaluation of short-term biomarker response to treatment for growth hormone deficiency in Chinese children with growth hormone deficiency born small for or appropriate for gestational age: A randomized phase IV open-label study	Objectives: To compare the response between Chinese children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) born either small for gestational age (SGA) or appropriate for gestational age (AGA) after 4 weeks of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) therapy. Methods: This was a phase IV, open-label, multicenter, interventional study (NCT01187550). Prepubertal children with GHD received open-label treatment with daily r-hGH (0.033 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factorbinding protein 3 (IGFBP3), and metabolic markers (including fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment, and were analyzed according to patient subgroup (SGA or AGA). Results: A total of 205 children with GHD (mean age 10.4 years; 175 AGA, 30 SGA) were included in the analysis. Mean baseline serum IGF-I and IGFBP3 standard deviation scores (SDS) across the whole patient population were lower than the population norms (mean values: -2.1 SDS for IGF-I and -1.2 SDS for IGFBP3), with no significant differences between the two patient subgroups. After 4 weeks, IGF-I and IGFBP3 levels increased by 1.0 SDS (p < 0.001) and 0.34 SDS (p < 0.001), respectively, but no significant differences were found between the two patient subgroups for growth-related or metabolic markers. Conclusions: For children with GHD born SGA, IGF-I and IGFBP3 are short-term biomarkers of responsiveness to treatment with growth hormone, as for children with GHD born AGA. © The Author(s), 2013.

Radiologically, tubular bones were short with widened metaphyses, irregular and small epiphyses; anterior tonguing or beaking of vertebral bodies were characteristic. DNA sequencing analysis of the COMP gene revealed a heterozygous mutation (c.1511G>A, p.Cys504Tyr) in the patient but his parents were unaffected without this genetic change. The missense mutation (c.1511G>A) was not found in 100 healthy controls and has not been reported previously.

84877658324	Successful interventional treatment of post-biopsy renal artery pseudoaneurysm in pediatric patients	Background: With an incidence ranging from 0.01% to 1.0%, renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is a rare complication after renal biopsy, percutaneous renal surgery, penetrating trauma, and rarely blunt renal trauma. Methods: Percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) of native kidneys was performed in 1,500 pediatric patients under real-time ultrasonographic guidance at our institution from July 1999 to January 2011. A retrospective review of these cases revealed that 2 patients developed a post-biopsy RAP. The diagnosis of RAP was established using color duplex ultrasonography (US), contrastenhanced computed tomography (CT) and digital substraction angiography (DSA). Results: Two patients developed RAP after 1,500 PRBs were performed (0.13% incidence). In the presented cases, immediate post-bioptic ultrasound showed no abnormalities. A high index of suspicion for RAP was prompted when complications such as unexplained gross hematuria and anemia occurred and the arterial phase of CT showed a well-circumscribed hyperdense area with a contrast enhancement similar to the adjacent arterial vessels. The diagnosis was confirmed by DSA and then the feeding artery of RAP was successfully occluded. After the procedure, the patients recovered and were discharged shortly. Conclusion: RAP is a rare, but potentially life-threatening complication after PRB and can be treated successfully with superselective arterial embolization. © 2013 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

84877050011	Effects of Targeted Suppression of Glutaryl-CoA Dehydrogenase by Lentivirus-Mediated shRNA and Excessive Intake of Lysine on Apoptosis in Rat Striatal Neurons	In glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1), glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency has been shown to be responsible for the accumulation of glutaric acid and striatal degeneration. However, the mechanisms by which GA1 induces striatal degeneration remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to establish a novel neuronal model of GA1 and to investigate the effects of GCDH deficiency and lysine-related metabolites on the viability of rat striatal neurons. Thus we constructed a lentiviral vector containing short hairpin RNA targeted against the GCDH gene expression (lentivirus-shRNA) in neurons. A virus containing a scrambled short hairpin RNA construct served as a control. Addition of lysine (5 mmol/L) was used to mimic hypermetabolism. Cell viability was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Apoptosis was assessed using Hoechst33342 staining and Annexin V-PE/7-AAD staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MPP) was monitored using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester. The expression levels of caspases 3, 8, and 9 were determined by Western blotting. We found that lentivirus-shRNA induced apoptosis and decreased MMP levels in neurons, and addition of 5 mmol/L lysine enhanced this effect markedly. Lentivirus-shRNA upregulated the protein levels of caspases 3 and 9 regardless of the presence of 5 mmol/L lysine. The expression level of caspase 8 was higher in neurons co-treated with lentivirus-shRNA and 5 mmol/L lysine than in control. Benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone, a pan-caspase inhibitor, blocked the apoptosis induced by lentivirus-shRNA and 5 mmol/L lysine to a great extent. These results indicate that the targeted suppression of GCDH by lentivirus-mediated shRNA and excessive intake of lysine may be a useful cell model of GA1. These also suggest that GA1-induced striatal degeneration is partially caspase-dependent. © 2013 Gao et al.

84879047972	Normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: Update on the genetic background and future challenges	Purpose of review: What controls puberty remains largely unknown, and current gene mutations account for only about one-third of the apparently genetic cases of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Lately, important developments have occurred in this field. Recent findings: The neuroendocrine control of reproduction in all mammals is governed by a hypothalamic neural network of approximately 1500 gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secreting neurons that control the activity of the reproductive axis across life. Recently, the syndrome of human GnRH deficiency, either with anosmia, termed Kallmann syndrome, or with a normal sense of smell, termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, has proven to be important disease models that have revealed much about the abnormalities that can befall the GnRH neurons as they differentiate, migrate, form networks, mature and senesce. Mutations in several genes responsible for these highly coordinated developmental processes have thus been unearthed by the study of this prismatic disease model. These genetic studies have opened up a new chapter in the physiology and the pharmacology of the gonadotropic axis.

84881267258	Salidroside attenuates LPS-stimulated activation of THP-1 cell-derived macrophages through down-regulation of MAPK/NF-kB signaling pathways	Excessive activation of macrophages is implicated in various inflammatory injuries. Salidroside (Sal), one of the main bioactive components of Rhodiola Sachalinensis, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory activities. This study aimed to examine the effect of Sal on the activation of macrophages and the possible mechanism. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated phrobol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 macrophage models were established. The changes in the inflammatory profiles of THP-1-derived macrophages were determined. The results showed that Sal significantly decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at both mRNA and protein levels in THP-1-derived macrophages, and the effect was dose-depedent. Moreover, NF-κB activation was significantly suppressed and the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and JNK was substantially down-regulated after Sal treatment. The findings suggested that Sal can suppress the activation of LPS-stimulated PMA-differetiated THP-1 cells, as evidenced by the decreased expression of iNOS, COX2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, and the mechanism involves the inhibition of NF-κB activation and the phosphorylation of the MAPK signal pathway. © 2013 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84894032596	Investigations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in folate pathway genes in Chinese families with neural tube defects	Aims We investigated the hypothesis that there are interactions between SNPs in folate metabolism pathway genes and environmental risk factors to the etiology of neural tube defects (NTDs). Method In 602 Chinese families, 609 aborted fetus tissues or blood samples were collected from NTD individuals, and 1106 parental blood samples were detected as controls. We analyzed 28 SNPs in 12 folate pathway genes. Folate supplementation, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and medicine administration before and during pregnancy were investigated. Case-parental control study and transmission/disequilibrium tests were performed according to environmental cofactor stratification. Results Association between 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T and NTDs was significant in all stratifications (all P <.05), and synergistic effects of no folate supplementation and GDM were shown on NTD occurrence. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTHM) 501A>G in case of GDM, and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) 716G>A in case of no folate supplementation significantly associated with NTDs (both P <.05), whereas the two genotypes alone did not significantly associate with NTDs (both P >.05). Conclusions MTHFR 677C > T genotype, especially in case of no folate supplementation and GDM, promotes NTD occurrence. MTHM 501A > G only in case of GDM, and BHMT 716G > A only in case of no folate supplementation contribute to the etiology of NTDs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84896700072	Combined adenovirus-mediated artificial microRNAs targeting mfgl2, mFas, and mTNFR1 protect against fulminant hepatic failure in mice	Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has a poor prognosis with high in-hospital mortality. Hepatic and circulating inflammatory cytokines, such as fibrinogen like protein 2 (fgl2), FasL/Fas, and TNFα/TNFR1, play a significant role in the pathophysiology of ACLF. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying constructed DNA code for non-native microRNA (miRNA) targeting mouse fgl2 (mfgl2) or both mFas and mTNFR1 on murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-3-induced fulminant hepatitis in BALB/cJ mice. Artificial miRNA eukaryotic expression plasmids against mfgl2, mFas, and mTNFR1 were constructed, and their inhibitory effects on the target genes were confirmed in vitro. pcDNA6.2-mFas-mTNFR1-miRNA□which expresses miRNA against both mFas and mTNFR1 simultaneously£≠was constructed. To construct a miRNA adenovirus expression vector against mfgl2, pcDNA6.2-mfgl2-miRNA was cloned using Gateway technology. Ad-mFas-mTNFR1-miRNA was also constructed by the same procedure. Adenovirus vectors were delivered by tailvein injection into MHV-3-infected BALB/cJ mice to evaluate the therapeutic effect. 8 of 18 (44.4%) mice recovered from fulminant viral hepatitis in the combined interference group treated with Ad-mfgl2-miRNA and Ad-mFas-mTNFR1- miRNA. But only 4 of 18 (22.2%) mice receiving Ad-mfgl2-miRNA and 3 of 18 (16.7%) mice receiving Ad-mFas- mTNFR1-miRNA survived. These adenovirus vectors significantly ameliorated inflammatory infiltration, fibrin deposition, hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, and prolonged survival time. Our data illustrated that combined interference using adenovirus-mediated artificial miRNAs targeting mfgl2, mFas, and mTNFR1 might have significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of fulminant hepatitis. © 2013 Xi et al.

84897475388	MicroRNAs function primarily in the pathogenesis of human anencephaly via the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway	Anencephaly is one of the most serious forms of neural tube defects (NTDs), a group of congenital central nervous system (CNS) malformations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in diverse biological processes via the post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. Although miRNAs play important roles in the development of mammalian CNS, their function in human NTDs remains unknown. Using a miRNA microarray, we identified a unique expression profile in fetal anencephalic brain tissues, characterized by 70 upregulated miRNAs (ratio ≥2) and 7 downregulated miRNAs (ratio ≤0.5) compared with healthy human samples. Ten miRNAs with altered expression were selected from the microarray findings for validation with real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found that in anencephalic tissues, miR-22, miR-23a, miR-34a, miR-103, miR-125a, miR-132, miR-134, miR-138, and miR-185 were significantly upregulated, while miR-149 was significantly downregulated. Furthermore, 459 potential target genes within the validated miRNAs were revealed using combined four target prediction algorithms in the human genome, and subsequently analyzed with the Molecule Annotation System 3.0. A total of 119 target genes were ultimately identified, including those involved in 22 singular annotations (i.e., transcription, signal transduction, and cell cycle) and 55 functional pathways [i.e., mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and actin cytoskeleton regulation]. Six target genes (HNRPU, JAG1, FMR1, EGR3, RUNX1T1, and NDEL1) were chosen as candidate genes and associated with congenital birth abnormalities of the brain structure. Our results, therefore, suggest that miRNA maladjustment mainly contributes to the etiopathogenesis of anencephaly via the MAPK signaling pathway. © FUNPEC-RP.

84901759197	Glutaric acid-mediated apoptosis in primary striatal neurons	Glutaric acid (GA) has been implicated in the mechanism of neurodegeneration in glutaric aciduria type I. In the present study, the potential cytotoxic effects of GA (0.150 mM for 2496 h) were examined in cultured primary rat striatal neurons. Results showed increase in the number of cells labeled by annexin-V or with apoptotic features shown by Hoechst/PI staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and upregulation of the expression of mRNA as well as the active protein fragments caspase 3, suggesting involvement of the caspase 3-dependent apoptotic pathway in GA-induced striatal neuronal death. This effect was in part suppressed by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 but not the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5- methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalone-2, 3-dione (CNQX). Thus, GA may trigger neuronal damage partially through apoptotic pathway and via activation of NMDA receptors in cultured primary striatal neurons. © 2014 Fengyan Tian et al.

Methods: Tis cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China from March to June 2010. Tree successful measurements at diferent sites in 123 patients were obtained, and the LS discrepancy was calculated. Te infuence of clinical data on the discrepancy was also assessed. Results: Te LS discrepancy was 1.3 (0.2-16.5) kPa and independently increased with a fbrosis stage: 0.9 (0.2-4.4) kPa in F0/F1, 1.5 (0.4-3.7) kPa in F2, 3.0 (0.3-9.4) kPa in F3, and 7.4 (3.1-16.5) kPa in F4. A discrepancy ≥2 kPa was observed in 45 (36.6%) patients: 8 (11.9%) with F0/F1, 7 (31.8%) with F2, 15 (73.7%) with F3, and 15 (100%) with F4. Te incidence of discrepancy ≥2 kPa was only associated with fbrosis stage in multiple regression analysis. Discordance in fbrosis stages was observed in 33 (26.8%) patients, and was most frequent in stage F2 (F0/F1, 10.45%; F2, 68.2%; F3, 36.8%; and F4, 26.7%). Conclusion: Te LS discrepancy is common and associated with fbrosis stage independently. While determining the fbrosis stage and disease progression, LS discrepancy should be considered.

84904018959	SOCS3 expression correlates with severity of inflammation in mouse hepatitis virus strain 3-induced acute liver failure and HBV-ACLF	Recently, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) has been shown to be an inducible endogenous negative regulator of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway which is relevant in inflammatory response, while its functions in acute liver failure and HBV-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the role of SOCS3 in the development of mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced acute liver failure and its expression in liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with HBV-ACLF. Inflammation-related gene expression was detected by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The correlation between SOCS3 level and liver injury was studied. Our results showed that the SOCS3 expression was significantly elevated in both the liver tissue and PBMCs from patients with HBV-ACLF compared to mild chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Moreover, a time course study showed that SOCS3 level was increased remarkably in the liver of BALB/cJ mice at 72 h post-infection. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were also increased significantly at 72 h post-infection. There was a close correlation between hepatic SOCS3 level and IL-6, and the severity of liver injury defined by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, respectively. These data suggested that SOCS3 may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of MHV-3-induced acute liver failure and HBV-ACLF. © 2014 Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84904156387	Valproate pretreatment protects pancreatic β-cells from palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β	Background: Reduction of pancreatic β-cells mass, major secondary to increased β-cells apoptosis, is increasingly recognized as one of the main contributing factors to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and saturated free fatty acid palmitate has been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that may contribute to promoting β-cells apoptosis. Recent literature suggests that valproate, a diffusely prescribed drug in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder, can inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity and has cytoprotective effects in neuronal cells and HepG2 cells. Thus, we hypothesized that valproate may protect INS-1 β-cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis via inhibiting GSK-3β. Results: Valproate pretreatment remarkable prevented palmitate-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis (lipotoxicity) as well as ER distension. Furthermore, palmitate triggered ER stress as evidenced by increased mRNA levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in a time-dependent fashion. However, valproate not only reduced the mRNA and protein expression of CHOP but also inhibited GSK-3β and caspase-3 activity induced by palmitate, whereas, the mRNA expression of ATF4 was not affected. Interestingly, TDZD-8, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, also showed the similar effect on lipotoxicity and ER stress as valproate in INS-1 cells. Finally, compared with CHOP knockdown, valproate displayed better cytoprotection against palmitate. Conclusions: Valproate may protect β-cells from palmitate-induced apoptosis and ER stress via GSK-3β inhibition, independent of ATF4/CHOP pathway. Besides, GSK-3β, rather than CHOP, may be a more promising therapeutic target for T2D. © 2014Huang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84908093500	Mechanistic effects of amino acids and glucose in a novel glutaric aciduria type 1 cell model	Acute neurological crises involving striatal degeneration induced by a deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) and the accumulation of glutaric (GA) and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3-OHGA) are considered to be the most striking features of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1). In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of apoptosis and energy metabolism impairment in our novel GA1 neuronal model. We also explored the effects of appropriate amounts of amino acids (2 mM arginine, 2 mM homoarginine, 0.45 g/L tyrosine and 10 mM leucine) and 2 g/L glucose on these cells. Our results revealed that the novel GA1 neuronal model effectively simulates the hypermetabolic state of GA1. We found that leucine, tyrosine, arginine, homoarginine or glucose treatment of the GA1 model cells reduced the gene expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, bax, fos, and jun and restored the intracellular NADH and ATP levels. Tyrosine, arginine or homoarginine treatment in particular showed anti-apoptotic effects; increased a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC), fumarase (FH), and citrate synthase (CS) expression; and relieved the observed impairment in energy metabolism. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the protective mechanisms of amino acids and glucose in GA1 at the cellular level from the point of view of apoptosis and energy metabolism. Our data support the results of previous studies, indicating that supplementation of arginine and homoarginine as a dietary control strategy can have a therapeutic effect on GA1. All of these findings facilitate the understanding of cell apoptosis and energy metabolism impairment in GA1 and reveal new therapeutic perspectives for this disease.

Methods Hyperoxic lung injury was induced by exposing to 60% O2 in Spraque-Dawley rats within 6 hours after birth. Rats exposed to air were used as the control group. The lungs from groups aged postnatal days 3, 7 and 14 were removed and dissected from the main bronchi for analysis. Eight rats of each group were used to assess expression of FABP4 in lungs by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Lung FABP4 mRNA levels were measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The levels of FABP4 in BALF were measured using ELISA. Results FABP4 immunoreactivity was detected in the majority of alveolar macrophages, bronchial epithelial cells and endothelial cells. FABP4 protein levels in lung tissues in the hyperoxic exposure group increased significantly compared with the control group on days 3, 7 and 14 after birth (P<0.05), and FABP4 mRNA levels in lung tissues also increased significantly in the hyperoxic exposure group compared with the control group on days 7 and 14 after birth (P<0.05). The hyperoxic exposure group demonstrated increased FABP4 levels in BALF compared with the control group on days 7 and 14 after birth (P<0.05). Conclusions FABP4 levels increase in preterm rat lungs after hyperoxic lung injury, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.
