The crosswise relaxation time T2 distribution, rock porosity and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) are obtained by the nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) technique. The results show that: (1) As the unloading confining pressure ratio increases, the T2 spectrum curves move towards right with the spectrum areas keeping increasing, and the porosity of the specimens increases, which indicates that the damage of specimens increases. (2) As the unloading confining pressure ratio increases, the spectral peaks of small microcracks move towards right, but the spectrum areas of small microcracks are relatively small, which indicates that the size of small microcracks increases and the number of small microcracks changes randomly. The influence of small microcracks is weak to the porosity of the specimens. There is a critical value near the unloading confining pressure ratio of 75%. When the unloading confining pressure ratio is below the critical value, new microcracks appear constantly in the specimens. When the unloading confining pressure ratio is above the critical value, the generation of new microcracks is limited. (3) As the unloading confining pressure ratio increases, the spectral peaks of big microcracks move towards right. The spectrum areas of big microcracks keep increasing and account for over 96% of all microcracks in the rock specimens, which indicates that the size and number of big microcracks increase and the change of big microcracks determines the porosity and damage of rock.

It was shown that the effect of induced caving was prominent. Pre-cracks of 20 to 40 mm width in pre-splitting holes after blasting extended to the bottom of holes. The average failure thickness of roofs reached 30 to 40 m. Steep obliquity, narrow width and short trace length were the main characteristics of fractures in rock mass. Developing fractures formed the fracture net and led to the spalling of rock from the bottom to the top of roofs because of their propagation and coalescence. The developing conditions of fractures in rock mass operated by the coupling jamming and the single mining excavation were different. The characteristics of fracture development at the same location in different boreholes were studied by using the fractal theory. According to the research results, fracture values under different disturbances were calculated and their relationship curves were drawn. It was found that the evolvement under disturbance was self-similar and its value became larger and larger along with the process of induced caving.

Using the universal distinct element code (UDEC), three working condition goafs with different sizes were carried out the numerical simulation tests. For three structure sizes, the goafs surrounding rock all displayed the above deformation characteristics. According to the difference of goafs structure sizes, the roof displacements reached a 19.11mm, 26.78mm, and 47.35mm respectively. The analyses for plastic zone in the three conditions showed that the holistic span of plastic zones changed with the goafs size; the plastic zones transfixed gradually in roof, and formed the caving zones at last. Regarding to deformation characteristics of different sizes, these measures were provided, such as a network anchor injection, the lateral filling, cement grouting, and so on. The research results showed that in the cataclastic medium, the sizes of goafs' structure has an obvious impact on the deformation of surrounding rock; the deformation increases with the sizes gradually; the goafs treatment measures provided could effectively guarantee the safety of mine production. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77953262393	Panoramic inspection and evaluation of blasting effect of induction caving roof	Technology of blast-induced caving roof based on the successive mining, it is said that the caving zone of fracturing are controlled through the pre-splitting blasting and inducing fracture are developed by the forced blasting. With the development and expanding of the cracks, the rock mass would have been instability and caving in the roof. But, to the process of the induction caving roof by blasting in the underground mine, the effects were invisible to the pre-splitting blasting and the forced blasting. It is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the effect of blasting. Using the borehole camera system, the technique of front view and digital panorama were used to inspect the effect of blasting. The shape of the hole-wall was detected before blasting, and the effect of the inducing fracture was inspected after blasting in the hole-wall. Especially, the cracks character was described by the digital panoramic borehole camera. The photographs were analyzed by the view and digital method. The results of the digital panoramic borehole camera show: (1) The pre-splitting cracks had been formed after pre-splitting blasting. Its width is up to 20-40 mm; and the half wall of hole could be seen in the bottom. (2) Large of secondary cracks were formed in the rock mass of roof, the crack form is "X". And the original cracks were expanded. (3) The mass shapes of blasting was right, the rock stacked by the natural angle of slope. It is advantage to induction caving roof to the large cracks and ruptured structural rock mass.

Three kinds of filling schemes were designed and calculated, in which the filling heights were 2, 4, and 7 m, separately. The results show that there are some rules in the stress field with the increase of the filling height as follows: (1) the maximum value of tension stress of the roof decreases gradually, and stress conditions are improved gradually; (2) the tension stress status in the vertical pillar is transformed into the compressive stress status, and the carrying capacity is improved gradually; however, when the filling height is beyond 2.8 m, the carrying capacity of the vertical pillar grows very slowly, so, there is little significance to continue to fill the low-grade backfill; (3) the bottom pillar suffers the squeezing action from the vertical pillars at first and then the gravity action of the low-grade backfill, and the maximum value of tension stress of the bottom pillar firstly increases and then decreases. Considering the economic factor, security and other factors, the low-grade backfill has the most reasonable height (2.8 m) in the scope of all filling height. © 2010 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77958025161	RETRACTED ARTICLE: Numerical simulation of time-varying effect to induction caving roof based on RFPA2D	Based on underground continuous mining technologies, it is one of the developing directions of modern underground metal mines to implement induction roof instability caving, which is used to handle mined-out area. And this mechanical instability process is a typical slow-speed time-varying boundary mechanical problem, of which the main characteristic is dynamic time-varying effect when inducing roof caving. To RFPA software, it's an effective way to deal with the problem of unit destruction by using the method of weakening unit nature and to simulate the time-varying boundary problem during caving properly and dynamically, obtaining time-varying effect when roof caving is induced. Using the RFPA software taking the T112-T115 mine of 92# orebody in Tongkeng Mine as the research object, the time-varying effect was simulated and analyzed during the induction roof caving. The results are showed as following: (1) The stable exposed area of mined-out area can be up to 4500m2. (2)The roof surrounding rock mass has been avianized seriously after the fourth ore section is stoped, and the caving line height is 48m. Thus the roof caving must be artificially induced after stoping the fourth ore section to make sure safe mining. The safe height of induction caving engineering must be up 50m. The results of time-varying effect show that the surrounding rock mass are avianized by the change of continuous stoping space. It is an effective method to tackle mined-out area by inducing roof instability caving through artificial disturbance in the partial roof. © 2010 IEEE.

The results showed that the stability of stope structure with the size increasing of ore pillar of reconstructed mining environment had some rules as follow: 1) The maximum value of tensile stress and vertical displacement of roof structure decreased gradually, and stress conditions had been improved. 2) Most part of the four size ore pillars's von mises equivalent stress value was less than the ore-rock uniaxial compressive strength. 3) When the size changed within a certain range, it was not too much significance to reduce the tensile stress area and vertical displacement of roof by increasing its size. Thus, as for ore pillar, from the perspective of mechanics, there is a reasonable size range in which stability of the re-constructed mining environment is in an ideal state. © 2010 IEEE.

78149418833	Particle simulation of the failure process of brittle rock under triaxial compression	In order to investigate the failure process of brittle rock under triaxial compression through both experimental and numerical approaches, the particle simulation method was used in numerical simulations and the simulated results were compared with those of the experiment. The numerical simulation results, such as fracture propagation, microcrack distribution, stress-strain response, and damage patterns, were discussed in detail. The simulated results under various confining pressures (0-60 MPa) are in good agreement with the experimental results. The simulated results reveal that rock failure is caused by axial splitting under uniaxial compression. As the confining pressure increases, rock failure occurs in a few localized shear planes and the rock mechanical behavior is changed from brittle to ductile. Consequently, the peak failure strength, microcrack numbers, and the shear plane angle increase, but the ratio of tensile to shear microcracks decreases. The damage formation during the compression simulations indicates that the particle simulation method can produce similar behaviors as those observed through laboratory compression tests. © 2010 Journal Publishing Center of University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

80052130144	Time-varying optimization study of mining sequence based on reconstructed mining environment	Aiming at the practical situation about engineering geological conditions and productivity requirements of Xinshan ore block of Kafang mine, the optimization schemes of 3 feasible mining sequences are proposed based on the reconstructed mining environment idea. By using finite element analysis software MIDAS/GTS, a three dimensional finite element model of complex ore body is built. The mechanical time-varying effects of the 3 schemes are simulated and analyzed by numerical simulation. The results show that the stress and displacement of stope gradually increase and significant stress concentration appears as the advance of mining steps. In the 3 schemes, the maximum compressive stress is up to 27 MPa in the stope surrounding rock; to the roof, the maximum compressive stress is no more than 15 MPa and the maximum tensile stress of the roof reaches 1.2 MPa; for the subsidence displacements of roof, the maximum values of the 3 schemes are 82.9 mm, 84.4 mm and 84.5 mm separately. A wide range tensile stress area appears with mining in roof; the maximum proportions of the tensile stress area occupying the roof area are 22%, 22.3% and 23.5% separately. However, the time-varying laws of the tensile stress area show remarkable feature of imbalance and mutability. According to the process response laws of the stope structure under mining, the evaluating indices of the tensile stress damage area and the subsidence displacements of the roof are chosen. The optimal scheme is proposed and it is the scheme 1.

Three stress paths were chosen as test schemes corresponding to the triaxial compressive test, pre-peak and post-peak unloading the confining pressure tests. The results show that compression deformation is the main cause of rock failure under loading condition. However, the strong dilatation leads to the rock failure along unloading direction. Rock failure happens even under little axial stress with confining pressure unloading. Poisson ratio increases with the decrease of confining pressure during the process of unloading. Elastic modulus increases slowly along with the decline of confining pressure, but decreases rapidly when unloaded to yielding strength. It shows that the weakening rate of rock intensity tends to be faster with easily failure under the unloading condition. © 2012 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The main problem is how to make sure the deterioration laws of the mechanical properties. Taking the object of test stopes on induced caving roof which is based on the continuous mining method in the No. 92 ore of the Tongkeng mine, based on the unloading rock mass mechanics theory, the calculation procedure is established to simulate and analyse the rock mass mechanical parameters under excavation unloading. Combined with FEM, the equivalent model of rock mass unloading is built; and the 6 steps of continuous unloading calculations are carried out. The deterioration laws of the mechanical properties of the roof rock mass unloading are obtained in underground continuous mining. The relation functions between unloading rock mass mechanical parameters and the unloading percentage are fitted by polynomial fitting method. The results show that, after the 6th step unloading, the calculation is non-convergence. It indicates that the roof has totally been destroyed and fallen. As to the rock mechanical parameters, it shows a gradual weakening trend, including the internal friction angle, cohesion and the modulus of elasticity. These values gradually decrease to 55%, 50% and 50% of the initial value. For Poisson's ratio, it gradually increase to 1.15 times of the initial value. It is demonstrated that the rock mass mechanical parameters are deteriorated under mining unloading. The dynamic analysis theoretical basis of mining mechanical response is provided by the relation functions of unloading rock mass mechanical parameters and the unloading percentage.

Firstly, based on the analysis of main causes of blastbility, three indexes were chosen as the evaluation indicators and the classification standards were confirmed. Meanwhile, in order to remedy the defect of the correlation function cannot be calculated when the eigenvalue exceeds the controlled field, the blastability classification standards were normalized. Secondly, based on the game theory, the synthetic weight values of eigenvalue were determined by integrating the objective-dynamic weight and subjective-static weight, which can solve the problems occurred in traditional matter-element extension assessment method, that is, the indicator weight only depends on the eigenvalue, and ignores the significance of feature. Finally, the classification of blastability was predicted by using the maximum incidence degree criterion, and the prediction model of game theory-matter-element extension for blastability classification was proposed. The application results show that the blastability of surrounding rock and ore body in the roof is of medium-grade, and the surrounding rock in footwall is of relatively low-grade. The predication results agree well with the project reality geological situation, thus, the corresponding control measures about the blasting in mine engineering were put forward.

Finally, the instance analysis was carried out taking a mine in Yunnan as an example, with the sensitivity of four factors being 0.050, 0.132, 0.315 and 0.074, respectively. The results show that the artificial pillar width is the most sensitive and important parameter to the stope stability. As the artificial pillar width increases, the stope tends to be unstable. The elastic modulus of structural body reengineering and the stope length have significant impact on the stability of the stope, but the stope width has less effect on it.

84885438374	Monitoring of single-hole blasting vibration and detection of its attenuation law by using multiple linear regression	There exist complicated non-linear relations between explosive vibration effect and its affecting factors, and accurate prediction of the attenuation law of blasting vibration is the basis of blasting design and disaster control. Based on the analysis of defects of traditional Sadaovsk formula, a modified Sadaovsk formula (MSF) considering the height deviation between mass point and blast center was introduced. A multiple linear mathematical model for predicting the attenuation law of blasting vibration was established. The unknown parameter vectors(K, α, β) in the model were calculated by using least square method, thus the concrete MSF for accurately predicting the attenuation law of blasting vibration was achieved. The single-hole blasting vibration of the zinc-copper deposit in Tongkeng Mine was monitored and the data were analysed by using the proposed method. The results show that the proposed MSF is reliable, and can provide scientific guide for blasting design in zinc-copper deposit.

84888083708	Degradation mechanism and evolutionary pattern of granites with coarse and fine grains in freezing-thawing condition	The influence of freezing and thawing cycles on the physical and mechanical properties of granites with coarse and fine grains was studied by freezing and thawing cycle experiment and rock mechanic test. Rock samples were detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), their transverse relaxation time spectra and NMR images were got before and after freezing and thawing cycle experiment, and the porosity variation, pore structure and evolution laws were discussed. The macro phenomenological theory and the self-consistency theory were used to analyze the degradation principle of rock samples in macro and micro scales, respectively. It is found that the number of pores increases in the action of freezing and thawing cycles, which weakens the strength of rock samples. The theoretical values of damage models are in consistence with experimental data, but different damage theories show different results about the development of damage tendency. Granite with fine grains shows a better durability in the action of freezing and thawing cycles.

84900847454	Mechanism on simulation and experiment of pre-crack seam formation in stope roof	The pre-crack blast technology has been used to control the induction caving area in the roof. The key is to form the pre-crack seam and predict the effect of the seam. The H-J-C blast model was built in the roof. Based on the theories of dynamic strength and failure criterion of dynamic rock, the rock dynamic damage and the evolution of pre-crack seam were simulated by the tensile damage and shear failure of the model. According to the actual situation of No. 92 ore body test stope at Tongkeng Mine, the formation process of the pre-crack blast seam was simulated by Ansys/Ls-dyna software, the pre-crack seam was inspected by a system of digital panoramic borehole camera. The pre-crack seam was inspected by the system of digital panoramic borehole in the roof. The results of the numerical simulation and inspection show that in the line of centers of pre-hole, the minimum of the tensile stress reaches 20 MPa, which is much larger than 13.7 MPa of the dynamic tensile strength of rock. The minimum particle vibration velocity reaches 50 cm/s, which is greater than 30-40 cm/s of the allowable vibration velocity. It is demonstrated that the rock is destroyed near the center line and the pre-crack is successfully formed by the large diameters and large distances pre-crack holes in the roof. © 2014 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84903472297	An experimental study on the mechanical properties of cemented rock-tailings fill	This paper outlines an effective approach to making composite backfill using mine waste material. Composite materials are widely used in many areas of engineering because of their unique structural properties. Cemented rock-tailings are one of the most prevalent materials used for composite backfill because they can effectively make use of mine waste rock and mill tailings that would otherwise be simply considered waste. This backfill method has the capability of maintaining the mine environment while still allowing for continued mine development. An experimental study is being conducted in a cooperative mine research project to investigate the properties of backfill material and specifically the mechanical characteristics of cemented waste rock-tailings fill. This study details the characteristics of the composite backfill aggregate with respect to the compressive strength of the cemented rock-tailings fill and the backfill mix-proportion, as well as outlines a new method of study for cemented rock-tailings fill mechanics. The study results show the compressive strength of cemented rock-tailings fill is dependent mainly on the cement and waste rock content. Ensuring a precise backfill mix proportion can effectively reduce the cement dosage, thereby decreasing the backfill cost realized for the mine. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84920437965	Failure mechanism of discontinuous joint rock mass under different confining pressures based on particle flow code	According to uniaxial compressive test of rock-like materials, particle flow code (PFC) numerical model was created, and failure mechanism of discontinuous joint rock mass under different confining pressures was studied. Numerical compressive tests of specimens with joint inclination (i.e., 25°, 60° and 90°) under different confining pressures (i.e., 0, 1, 4, 7 as well as 10 MPa) were performed and the effect of the confining pressure on mechanics response, failure shape, cracks development and energy transform to the discontinuous joint rock mass were studied. The results show that confining pressure has a marked influence on deformation and strength of discontinuous joint rock mass, but the average modulus is not significantly affected. Both joint inclination and confining pressure can influence rock specimen's failure shapes. With lower confining pressure, joint inclination highly affects specimen's failure shapes, or shear band is formed and joint has little implication. As the confining pressure goes up, the development of cracks is constrained and cracks advanced process is extended, and finally, more cracks are created. When the confining pressure is changed, the total and proportion of diverse types of energy will vary. With the increase of the confining pressure increasing, the crack initiation stress rises nonlinearly.
